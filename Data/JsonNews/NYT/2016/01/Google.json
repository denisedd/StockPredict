{"Headline": "Amit Singh of Google for Work: A Respectful Clash of Ideas", "Date": "2016-01-22", "News": "Supported byCorner OfficeQ. What were your early influences?It\u2019s quite an interesting experience at 12 years old. You learn sharing, and with boarding school food you were always starving. So you learn negotiation \u2014 one jam roll is worth 10 butters, for example. You really stayed together as a team because there\u2019s a lot of rivalry with the other houses. It\u2019s like Harry Potter.I also remember wanting to be on the basketball team, but I\u2019d never played basketball before. And I wanted it desperately enough that I used to wake up a few hours before everybody else and just practice by myself. I did that for six months. Then I made the team and eventually became the captain. As a senior, I was the prefect, in charge of our house.When did you move to the United States?I did my undergrad at the Delhi College of Engineering, and then I did my master\u2019s in industrial and management at Rensselaer Polytechnic in upstate New York. I didn\u2019t know much about technology at that stage, but I got a job right after that with Oracle.And what were some early leadership lessons for you?I learned the hard way about the importance of coaching people rather than jumping in and doing the work for them. A lot of folks have a tough time with that balance, and I did, too. Instead of giving people advice or coaching them on how to present something, I would go and do it for them or write their presentation.Over the years, I have tried to find the balance of when to jump in and when to coach. I\u2019ve also learned how to coach. A lot of folks wait until a formal review, and I\u2019ve always felt that the best coaching is in the moment and actionable.It\u2019s about trying to make somebody better versus criticizing someone for doing something. Done right, people love it, because you\u2019re really invested in their success. The flip side is that if you just say what\u2019s wrong, then people feel terrible.Other lessons?Whatever amount of time you\u2019re spending communicating, it\u2019s never enough. I realized that so much gets lost in translation in emails. You have to spend time communicating your point of view and establishing a vision for the team and how you\u2019re going to get there. It\u2019s superimportant.I think people are looking for inspiration. Work needs to have meaning, and they want to feel like they\u2019re part of something bigger. To do that well, you have to be thoughtful, and you have to communicate effectively.Another lesson is that as big as the organization might be, it doesn\u2019t always take that much to reach out and connect with people. We have a very flat structure at Google, and it\u2019s pretty open. Anybody can come into my office and say, \u201cHey, I want to have a cup of coffee with you.\u201d I remember being so motivated by a leader who always felt so accessible even though he spent all of five minutes with me.I\u2019ve also learned over time that you can\u2019t do too many things well. And so you narrow the focus down to the things that truly matter, which forces you to prioritize ruthlessly. Sometimes you just have to say that you\u2019re not going to that meeting. That takes some self-confidence and discipline.How do you hire? What qualities are you looking for?Are they open, do you like them, does their style mesh with yours and the rest of the team? Do they care about things beyond just their own success? Those are things that are hard to test for. You have to spend time with people to get to know them.I typically do a lot of reference checks. It\u2019s amazing what you\u2019ll find if you just are persistent and ask the right questions. And hiring for a specific role because they just did that role elsewhere is a good starting point, but I look at candidates much more broadly.Can this person stretch? Can we make a judgment that this person can learn new things, and it doesn\u2019t have to be business-related. They could be passionate about something completely different. You have to put them at ease to get them to talk about those interests.We also have a broad set of interviewers \u2014 we have a minimum of four at Google \u2014 that gives you diverse points of view and then you connect to see if this is the right person. Diversity of thought is actually the most invaluable thing in a business community. If we\u2019re always agreeing with each other, then we haven\u2019t gone down paths of debate that allow new ideas to emerge.Some of the best discussions are passionate but respectful, so that you leave a meeting without feeling like you\u2019ve lost something, even though your point of view may not have been the one that was adopted. That is what fosters innovation in a company \u2014 a clash of ideas, but a respectful clash.The balance is how to get it right, and the people you introduce into that mix and the culture you create around debate are the two variables.What advice do you give new college grads?They grow up learning a few things about how to approach problems. The piece that they possibly miss is that, once you\u2019re in the real world, it\u2019s all about other people. Giving is more important than your point of view.And learning how to get along and work together, work in a team, is the difference between frontline managers and leaders. Leaders find a way to work together. They find a solution. There\u2019s always a way, and you\u2019ve got to find what that way is.Advertisement"}

On Wednesday, DeepMind, a research organization that operates under the umbrella of Alphabet, reported that a program combining two separate algorithms had soundly defeated a high-ranking professional Go player in a series of five matches.Go is seen as a good test for artificial intelligence researchers because it is more complex than chess, with a far larger range of possible positions. This makes strategy and reasoning in the game more challenging.The Alphabet approach relies on the newest so-called deep learning approach combined with a more traditional type of algorithm known as a Monte Carlo, which is designed to exhaustively explore large numbers of possible combinations of moves. The researchers said they had also trained their program using input from expert human Go players.The research and the game have created a rivalry among the public relations departments of companies like Alphabet, Microsoft and Facebook.There will be a $1 million prize for the winner, and Mr. Hassabis said that Alphabet would donate the prize to charity if AlphaGo won. The match will be streamed live on YouTube.Mr. Hassabis, who is a skilled chess player and has been a professional gamer as well, said that Go was a beautiful game, but that \u00e2\u0080\u009cbuilding an A.I. is also a human endeavor and a kind of ingenious one, too.

{"Headline": "Brazil\u2019s Digital Backlash", "Date": "2016-01-12", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsBrazilians take their social media very seriously. The country has one of the fastest growing populations of Internet users in the world. Online tools like Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp are used not only to express opinions; they are an affordable alternative to exorbitantly priced Brazilian telecom providers. One recent study in Brazil found that WhatsApp was used by 93 percent of those surveyed who had Internet access.The official reason for the judge\u2019s decision to suspend WhatsApp was because its parent company, Facebook, refused to comply with requests to provide personal information and communications records to prosecutors in an investigation into organized crime and drug trafficking. This is not the first time that the Brazilian authorities have jousted with tech companies. Notwithstanding the seriousness of the crimes being investigated, the judge\u2019s action was reckless and represents a potentially longer-term threat to the freedoms of Brazilians.The ruling was not entirely out of the blue. Brazil\u2019s Congress has been considering legislation that would roll back key provisions of the country\u2019s freshly minted digital bill of rights, known as the Marco Civil da Internet, which was passed in 2014. The new proposal is expected to make it easier for prosecutors to access citizens\u2019 personal information without the nuisance of having to obtain a court order.Described by critics as \u201cthe big spy bill,\u201d it would require Brazilians to register personal details like their home address, telephone number and other private information when accessing websites. It would also expose citizens to possible charges of libel for comments made on social media. At a time when political dissent is vigorous, this bill would surely chill debate.When Brazilian legislators passed the Marco Civil, the government signaled to its citizens and the international community that it took \u201cnet neutrality\u201d and digital sovereignty seriously. It was, in effect, declaring that the democratic principles of freedom, privacy and human rights were equally applicable in cyberspace as in the physical world.Last month\u2019s judicial injunction, together with retrograde proposals like the spy bill, set a dangerous precedent. For a while, the country looked to be a progressive voice for digital freedom. No one expected Brazil to become a leader in cyber surveillance and censorship.

Mr. Dorsey confirmed some of the changes late Sunday night in a tweet.The shake-up is taking place as Mr. Dorsey, 39, attempts to reshape Twitter. The social networking service, used by presidential candidates such as Donald J. Trump and sports stars like the basketball player Stephen Curry, has failed to attract droves of new users. That has investors questioning how useful the service is for people and whether it will become a mainstream hit on the scale of Facebook or Instagram. Shares of Twitter have plunged nearly 55 percent in the last year.Mr. Dorsey has been pointed in his critique of Twitter\u2019s problems and what needs to be done to solve the issues. \u201cA greater clarity of our purpose, our objectives and putting the people that use Twitter first drives the urgency we now feel,\u201d he said last year. \u201cYou should expect Twitter to be as easy as looking out your window to see what\u2019s happening.\u201dTo grapple with Twitter\u2019s problems, Mr. Dorsey is turning to a bigger slate of directors. The San Francisco-based company plans to announce the appointment of two new board members soon, said the people familiar with the plans. While the names of the new directors could not be learned, one of them was a high-profile media personality, the people said. Twitter also plans to appoint a new chief marketing officer, they said.The additions are to be accompanied by several departures of Twitter executives.

{"Headline": "Facebook Reports Soaring Revenue, Buoyed by Mobile Ads", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "Supported byThe numbers far surpassed Wall Street\u2019s fourth-quarter expectations of $1.2 billion in profit on $5.37 billion in revenue. Investors welcomed the performance by pushing up Facebook\u2019s stock more than 12 percent in after-hours trading.The results were largely a result of Facebook\u2019s enormous success in selling advertising on mobile devices, a business that the company was not even in just a few years ago. Mobile ads made up 80 percent of the company\u2019s total ad business in the fourth quarter, compared with 23 percent in the same quarter of 2012.\u201cWe have a Super Bowl on mobile in the U.S. every single day,\u201d Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook, said in an interview.The results offer a bright spot in a tumultuous climate for many American technology stocks. Shares of Twitter, Facebook\u2019s most visible social networking competitor in the United States, have tumbled more than 55 percent during the last year. Yelp, the local-review service, is down about 60 percent. LinkedIn, the professional social networking service, is off more than 15 percent.Facebook is a much larger company than many of its peers, yet it is able to keep its growth rate high. The company has notched double-digit jumps in ad revenue and in the expansion of its user base. Facebook now has 1.59 billion monthly visitors, up 14 percent from a year ago. About 1.44 billion of those people visit the site on a mobile device; 1.04 billion visit Facebook every day.That growth engine has given Facebook lots of room to play in different areas \u2014 like virtual reality, messaging and even building drones capable of delivering Internet service to far-flung places around the world \u2014 that seem to have little to do with Facebook\u2019s core business of advertising.Facebook is spending billions of dollars developing those projects, and Mr. Zuckerberg has repeatedly said the company has no plans to make money on them in the near term. In an earnings call with investors, David Wehner, Facebook\u2019s chief financial officer, said the company projected that expenses would increase roughly 30 to 40 percent over the course of 2016 compared with last year.\u201cThese are long-term bets, but we don\u2019t think they\u2019re particularly large bets relative to the size of Facebook,\u201d said Ben Schachter, an Internet analyst at Macquarie Securities. \u201cThey\u2019ve gone out of their way to say they\u2019re not Google and going after health care, for instance.\u201dOther analysts said they also saw potential for profit in the hundreds of millions of people who regularly use Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, a messaging service also owned by Facebook.They are also bullish on the potential for Instagram, the photo-sharing service that has more than 400 million regular monthly users, to become a significant source of revenue in the future. The company does not disclose what portion of revenue Instagram accounts for in Facebook\u2019s overall sales. Ms. Sandberg said 98 of the top 100 advertisers on Facebook also advertised on Instagram in the last quarter.As for Mr. Zuckerberg, he spent a portion of the investor call on Wednesday talking about his new role as a father to his daughter, Max.\u201cWith a new addition to my family, I\u2019ve been reflecting a lot on the legacy we want to pass on to the next generation,\u201d he said, adding that he wanted Facebook to \u201ccontinue to focus on solving the fundamental challenges facing the world, and bringing the world closer together.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Marketing in the Moments, to Reach Customers Online", "Date": "2016-01-17", "News": "Supported byAdvertisingMOMENTS are having a moment in advertising. Or at least a micromoment.Companies that buy and sell online advertising are increasingly taking aim at these fleeting instances. They are hoping that targeting people based on what they are doing on their mobile devices at a particular time might make them more receptive to the message.Last fall, for instance, the spirits company Campari America targeted liquor consumers aged 21 to 34 while they were in neighborhoods with lots of bars and restaurants. Using Kiip, a San Francisco firm that places ads in mobile apps, Campari offered consumers $5 off from the ride-sharing service Lyft when, say, they checked a score on an app while at a sports bar. More than 20 percent redeemed the offer, a high rate for digital ads.\u201cThe attention span of consumers today is, what, eight seconds?\u201d said Umberto Luchini, Campari America\u2019s vice president for marketing. \u201cYou get one shot.\u201d\u201cThe advertising game is no longer about reach and frequency,\u201d said Lisa Gevelber, a Google vice president for marketing, who pioneered the micromoments concept. \u201cNow more than ever, intent is more important than identity and demographics, and immediacy is more important than brand loyalty.\u201dThat means marketers must be omnipresent with apps, a social media presence, short how-to videos and the entire range of digital ads. They can be search ads, or those like Kiip\u2019s that offer a reward, or Google\u2019s local inventory ads that reveal what is in stock in a nearby store, or click-to-call ads that dial up a business with a tap. More important than the format, the ads must appear at the instant people need the information.Reaching people at key junctures has always been a staple of advertising: billboards ahead of a highway exit, beer ads during halftime of the Super Bowl, digital search ads. The terminology is not all that new, either. A.G. Lafley, executive chairman at Procter & Gamble, where Ms. Gevelber once worked as a brand manager, coined the term \u201cfirst moment of truth\u201d in the 2005 book \u201cThe Game-Changer,\u201d written with Ram Charan. It describes the point at which a consumer forms an impression of a brand.The difference today is the rise of mobile phones as the consumers\u2019 tool to find or do almost anything. That has introduced several wrinkles to the way marketers can influence and track how consumers decide to buy something. Global Positioning System navigation provides precise location data, apps track people\u2019s every tap and swipe, and sensors such as accelerometers can even tell if people are sitting, walking or driving.The herky-jerky nature of app use, much lamented by marketers, has an upside, too: There are now many more times during the day when consumers are engaging in discrete activities, between which they may be primed to see a related message.It is not just a matter of reaching people at a particular time of day, a capability advertisers have employed for decades. Randy Wootton, chief executive of the ad technology firm Rocket Fuel, which recently announced a \u201cmarketing in the moment\u201d approach, refers to ancient Greek concepts of time: chronos, or sequential time, and kairos, a moment of opportunity independent of linear time. The latter, of course, is the one his company claims to employ for marketers.Another key, said Brian Solis, a principal analyst at Altimeter Group, a market research firm, is that the ads need to be more useful than they are attention-getting. According to a Google survey, 51 percent of smartphone owners have bought from a different company than they intended on the basis of information found online.\u201cThere are more jump balls, and now we can capitalize on those moments,\u201d said Jared Belsky, president of the New York digital agency 360i. One client, Red Roof Inn, linked flight data from the aviation software company FlightAware with Google\u2019s search ad system to target travelers stranded at airports \u2014 but at very precise moments, such as when O\u2019Hare Airport in Chicago experienced a major flight cancellation. Then, the system automatically raised the hotel chain\u2019s bids for ad space enough to win the top spot in three-quarters of search results for queries such as \u201chotels near O\u2019Hare.\u201d The company experienced a 60 percent jump in room bookings from those searches.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Catch a Rapist", "Date": "2016-01-05", "News": "FeatureA special-victims unit fights the hidden epidemic of sexual assault that is disturbingly difficult to investigate.Supported byThat morning, in a voice edged with distress, the mother had described a girl who seemed broken by the assault. The mother, too, was overwhelmed. When she broke down sobbing, covering her face, Cuddy placed her hand on the woman\u2019s forearm, saying quietly, \u2018\u2018We\u2019re almost done. We\u2019re almost done,\u2019\u2019 as if she were coaxing her to swim a little longer (they were almost at the shore!), coaxing her even though in all likelihood that shore no longer existed for her.Cuddy shared an office with her partner, Detective Joe Landisio, their two desks facing each other and pushed together, edge to edge. The room was crowded with two printers, a table, another small desk and a huge file cabinet filled with old homicide cases that no one had bothered to move when the units switched offices. The bathroom was next door, so you could hear toilets flushing all day. When she walked into the office, she felt like going straight to sleep. The mother had been so distraught, and Cuddy couldn\u2019t make a dent in that. \u2018\u2018You know what this office needs?\u2019\u2019 she asked as she sat down at her desk, letting out a huge sigh. \u2018\u2018A bar.\u2019\u2019Landisio swiveled in his chair, scanning the room. \u2018\u2018It could go right against that wall there,\u2019\u2019 he said, pointing to a spot beneath a cartoon drawing of a man joyfully kicking a pregnant woman \u2014 a \u2018\u2018gift\u2019\u2019 from Officer Steve Formica, from Firearms, in recognition of the no-taboos humor char\u00adac\u00adteristic of the S.V.U. squad. Its four detectives \u2014 Cuddy and Landisio, along with Nikki Natale and Jesse Agosto \u2014 worked roughly 400 cases a year, investigating mainly sexual assaults but also the abuse and neglect of children and seniors, domestic violence and child deaths, including homicides.That afternoon, as Cuddy and Landisio ate lunch in front of their computers, Landisio read the files for two new cases that had landed on the already-toppling pile on his desk, muttering in singsong, \u2018\u2018Punch me in the face, punch me in the face,\u2019\u2019 while Cuddy made out an arrest-warrant application for the suspect in the child\u2019s rape. The girl had already been interviewed at the Yale Child Abuse Clinic, a five-minute drive from headquarters. The S.V.U. detectives never questioned children or young teenagers, leaving that job to the trained social workers with the clinic. But they observed these forensic interviews on a television screen in an adjoining room, along with a social worker and medical personnel from the clinic and a case worker from the state\u2019s Department of Children and Families. The room was always crowded and often overheated. It was hard for Cuddy to be just an observer \u2014 she would have liked to interview the children herself. Sometimes she talked to them afterward, not to question them but to offer her support, to compliment them on their courage, to try to cheer them up. Landisio never wanted to talk to the victims. He wouldn\u2019t know what to say. The whole thing just made him too sad.Late that afternoon, Cuddy handed her application for an arrest warrant to the supervisor of their unit, Sgt. Betsy Segui, for review. From there it would be submitted to the court, where an inspector for the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office would review it again before the court decided whether to issue a warrant. \u2018\u2018Then we can get this [expletive],\u2019\u2019 Cuddy said. It was her way, the only one she had, of fixing things. But winter turned to spring, spring to summer and then summer to fall, and still Cuddy waited for her arrest warrant.There is another unacknowledged side to the investigation of sexual assault: the huge numbers of victims who are children or teenagers. In New Haven, the detectives estimate that more than 80 percent of their cases involve minors \u2014 a number above but not that far afield from national statistics. In a 2014 study published by the National Center for Juvenile Justice, which analyzed data from the F.B.I.\u2019s National Incident-Based Reporting System for the years 2009 and 2010, 61 percent of the female victims and 84 percent of the male victims of sexual assaults reported to law enforcement were younger than 18. For females, the age with the most sexual-assault victimizations was 14, and for males it was 4.These cases are rarely reported immediately because children often feel confused, afraid or to blame, and because the perpetrators are often family members or family friends. Even many adult victims don\u2019t report a sexual assault before the 72-to-120-hour cutoff after which hospitals will no longer conduct a forensic medical exam. Delayed reporting is the norm in sexual-assault cases, not the exception. In New Haven, the vast majority of the detectives\u2019 cases are reported days, weeks, months, even years after the fact. Not only is there bias against a victim who waits to report an assault, but the delay also means that there is rarely any physical evidence \u2014 neither forensic evidence taken from the bodies of the victims or suspects nor crime scenes to investigate.These prejudices about \u2018\u2018real rape\u2019\u2019 happen to dovetail with those rapes that are easier to investigate and prosecute. In a 2002 review of charging decisions made by prosecutors in three major cities, Cassia Spohn, now director of the School of Criminol\u00adogy and Criminal Justice at Arizona State University, found that prosecutors were substantially more likely to file charges \u2018\u2018if the victim was injured, if the suspect used a gun or knife and if there was physical evidence,\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018if the victim reported the crime promptly\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018if there were no questions about the victim\u2019s moral character or behavior at the time of the incident.\u2019\u2019In spite of the difficulties of these investigations, it\u2019s far too common for special-victims units to be understaffed and low on resources, according to Joanne Archambault, a retired sergeant with the San Diego Police Department and executive director of End Violence Against Women International. Police chiefs and sheriffs are often pressured by the community and the media to focus on more visible problems. \u2018\u2018They are focusing their energy on gangs and narcotics because that\u2019s what the community is talking about,\u2019\u2019 Archambault says. Rarely is there an outcry over police response to sexual assaults. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s the hidden epidemic, right? Nobody really wants to know about it.\u2019\u2019These are also the first units to be plundered if more officers are needed elsewhere. At one time New Haven\u2019s S.V.U. had 15 detectives, two supervising sergeants and a lieutenant, but in August 2011, a year that saw the city plagued by 130 shootings and 34 homicides (more than four times the per-capita murder rate in New York City that year), it was disbanded, and all the detectives were assigned to Major Crimes. A year and a half later, under the new chief of police, Dean Esserman, the unit was resurrected \u2014 this time with four detectives and one sergeant, though for one memorable month that year, Cuddy was the only detective working on the squad. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t know how you did this all by yourself,\u2019\u2019 Landisio commented one day. Cuddy replied, \u2018\u2018A lot of booze, a lot of booze.\u2019\u2019Most detectives in New Haven dreaded being assigned to the Special Victims Unit. But Cuddy and Landisio wanted to be there. For Cuddy, it was simple: \u2018\u2018It feels like the only unit where what you do really matters.\u2019\u2019 For Landisio, whom colleagues called Lando, it was also simple: He wanted to work with Cuddy. With 13 years on the job, four of them in the S.V.U., she was the detective with the most experience in the unit, but she also had a sense of humor that ran from ridiculously whimsical to jaw-droppingly filthy. In their office, it was not an unusual to see a strapping, dark-suited homicide detective walking away from some raunchy comment she made, shaking his head and murmuring, \u2018\u2018Cuddy, Cuddy, Cuddy.\u2019\u2019 She could be a charismatic flirt (waitresses; female bartenders; their supervisor, Sergeant Segui) and was deeply in love with her wife, whose name was tattooed on the inside of her left wrist. Landisio had eight years on the job and just under a year in the S.V.U. He was short and dark-eyed with a silver barbell piercing his tongue. He had passions for electronic music, firearms, pit bulls and T. rexes. His appearance and personality might have been put together by an eclectic collector. The two detectives kept up a running commentary throughout the day that consisted of lines from \u2018\u2018S.N.L.\u2019\u2019 sketches and YouTube videos, as well as bizarre quotations they\u2019d heard working the job. \u2018\u2018You two are like an old married couple,\u2019\u2019 one detective observed when she happened into the office one day as Landisio was running a lint roller down Cuddy\u2019s back.When a patrol cop ducked in to get Landisio\u2019s and Cuddy\u2019s advice on whether she should take the sergeant\u2019s exam, she asked them, \u2018\u2018Why does everyone hate this unit?\u2019\u2019 Neither Cuddy nor Landisio seemed insulted by the question. Because you work your butt off, they told her. You will do more interviewing here \u2014 of victims, suspects, witnesses \u2014 than you will ever come close to in any other unit. \u2018\u2018It will make you a better cop,\u2019\u2019 Cuddy said.But it wasn\u2019t just the workload; it was the nature of the crimes themselves. Too disturbing for your average cop. Then there was the amorphous character of the investigations: the lack of physical evidence, the time factor when so many of the reports came in long after the incident. A week into her assignment, Detective Natale said: \u2018\u2018It seems like 95 percent of these cases are [expletive],\u2019\u2019 sounding completely frustrated and baffled by the work of investigating a crime without a scene to examine, weapons to trace, eyewitnesses to interview.When the rookies were finally ushered into their office, after a lieutenant laughingly warned Cuddy to go easy on them, they stood just inside the doorway, shoulder to shoulder, looking blank-faced and ill at ease. Landisio swirled around in his chair, kicked off with a description of their caseloads, then looked to Cuddy to chime in. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m just going to sit here and eat my cold sore,\u2019\u2019 she said pleasantly. The rookies stared at her.Landisio tried again, going into a history of his law-enforcement career. \u2018\u2018I started walking in \u201909. \u2026\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018On Milford beach,\u2019\u2019 Cuddy interjected brightly. \u2018\u2018Collecting seashells.\u2019\u2019 The rookies shifted uneasily side to side. One guy finally asked Cuddy whether she had chosen to be in this unit. No, she said, she was assigned, but she had worked in almost every other unit, and none was as satisfying as this one. Not a lot of people want to be here, she said, because \u2018\u201890 percent of our cases are kids being drilled in the ass by their grandfathers. But when you lock up their grandfather, that kid will never forget you for being their voice.\u2019\u2019 When the rookies left, five uncomfortable minutes later, I got the feeling that they were all fervently hoping they would never be assigned there, but Cuddy merely rolled her eyes.In New Haven, unless a victim chooses not to file charges, every case that is assigned to an S.V.U. detective is investigated. According to Segui, the detectives refer about 90 percent of their cases to the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office for an arrest warrant \u2014 though that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll get one. Every recommendation by a detective either to proceed with an application for an arrest warrant or to close a case is first reviewed by Segui, then by the court. The detectives have considerable influence on Segui. \u2018\u2018I trust them,\u2019\u2019 she told me. If the detectives feel they should close a case, she looks it over herself and then occasionally has the prosecutor \u2018\u2018in essence, quote-unquote, check our work.\u2019\u2019During my months with the unit, the detectives closed six cases out of dozens without applying for an arrest warrant. There was a young woman who told an emergency-room nurse that a friend raped her. Her lip was swollen as if she\u2019d been punched in the mouth. She didn\u2019t want to file a complaint, but Cuddy persuaded her to take the sexual-assault exam, so that they would have the evidence if she changed her mind. A mother reported that her 3-year-old son said her ex-partner bit and pulled his penis, but the boy never disclosed this or any other abuse during his forensic interview. If there\u2019s no medical evidence (there wasn\u2019t), and if a child doesn\u2019t mention abuse during the forensic interview, the case doesn\u2019t move forward. Cuddy also noticed that when the mother was asked to repeat exactly what her son said, she used the word \u2018\u2018penis\u2019\u2019; in his interview, the boy always used the word \u2018\u2018pee-pee.\u2019\u2019Some cases were so tangled and muddy that the truth remained unknowable, and they eventually withered because of a lack of probable cause. One of these was a case that came back to the unit: an injured woman whom the detectives interviewed in the hospital two months earlier, after hospital personnel called in a case of possible domestic abuse. The victim told the detectives she didn\u2019t know how her face became bruised and bloodied. She had been sleeping at her ex-boyfriend\u2019s house the night before, so she could drive him to work the next morning, and she woke to the taste of blood in her mouth. She said her ex-boyfriend told her she had fallen. She thought maybe he had elbowed her in her sleep. With no claim of domestic abuse, Landisio referred the case back to patrol, and an officer interviewed the ex. That report concluded: \u2018\u2018Due to [complainant\u2019s] conflicting report and no evidence of domestic violence, there was no arrest made. No further actions were taken.\u2019\u2019But shortly afterward, the victim claimed her ex-boyfriend had beaten and sexually assaulted her, and the case was reassigned to Landisio. \u2018\u2018She definitely got [expletive] up,\u2019\u2019 Landisio said. He was sitting at his desk across from Cuddy, examining a photograph of the woman\u2019s face \u2014 the right side was puffy and purpled, the eye sealed shut, as if she\u2019d been lying half-submerged in water. \u2018\u2018Yeah, but how?\u2019\u2019 Cuddy asked. \u2018\u2018That\u2019s the question.\u2019\u2019Landisio and Cuddy interviewed the victim again, and this time she described her ex asking for sex that night and hitting her after she refused. The last thing she heard before passing out was her clothes being ripped, she said. When Landisio asked her why she didn\u2019t mention the assault before, the woman said it took a few days for the memories to come back to her.Landisio filled out a request for the victim\u2019s medical records, while Cuddy found the suspect\u2019s profile on Facebook. He had posted a handful of photos from fishing trips of himself proudly displaying his catch, the fish gripped in his right hand. All of the woman\u2019s injuries were to the right side of her face, which meant that if she was punched, it was likely to have been by a left-handed person. Landisio and Cuddy started searching on Google for images of facial injuries from falls to see if there was any resemblance between those and the particular bruising and swelling on the woman\u2019s face. The assault story was looking weaker to them, but they both thought the woman\u2019s injuries seemed too severe for just tumbling out of bed.Three weeks later, Landisio interviewed the ex-boyfriend. He didn\u2019t like interviewing suspects. When you asked a victim a hard question, you were doing it for her benefit. But suspects? He worried about the innocent ones tripping themselves up. \u2018\u2018I think of how the implications of what they\u2019re saying could lead to a lifetime in prison,\u2019\u2019 Landisio said. The suspect was voluble and animated to the point of cartoonishness. In his version of events, his ex-girlfriend was drinking and taking prescription medicine that night and didn\u2019t fall off the bed \u2014 he heard a crash while he was in another room and found her lying in the middle of the bedroom. To him, it seemed she had keeled over from a standing position, like a felled tree. When he tried to move her, she told him to leave her alone.Afterward, Landisio felt his account was credible. He never deflected a question or repeated it to buy himself time. He leapt at every query, often interrupting Landisio, eager to explain. And the suspect was all of one piece: amiable, entertaining, self-absorbed and contemptible \u2014 but consistently so. When he heard her fall? He was aggravated by the noise because a family member was sleeping upstairs. When the victim refused to be moved? He went about his night, fixing his dinner, checking in occasionally to see if she was still breathing. When he woke in the morning to find her gone? He called her son, even driving to their house on his suspended license hoping she was there. He still wanted her to drive him around. And the suspect signed his statement with his right hand.The victim\u2019s son later confirmed to Landisio that the suspect had called several times and come to their house looking for his mother. Landisio submitted copies of the interviews, the medical records, the original police report and his own report to Segui. He told her he didn\u2019t think they had probable cause for an arrest warrant. Segui and then the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office agreed. No arrest warrant was issued, and the case was closed.According to the Department of Children and Families report Cuddy was reading, the girl claimed she was raped while in the care of her mother\u2019s friend when her mother was incarcerated. The male relative showed up at the house and told the friend she could leave \u2014 he would watch the child. Then he raped her.The girl had a forensic interview scheduled at the Yale clinic later in the month, but the mother was coming to the station that day. Before she arrived, Cuddy ran her name through various law-enforcement databases. She was looking for dates when the mother was locked up. Yellow highlighter suspended, Cuddy frowned at the printout in front of her. She saw several jail sentences, all suspended. Six months, suspended; one year, suspended. There was no jail time that matched the year the girl would have been raped.In the interview room, Cuddy sat no more than an arm\u2019s length from the mother, taking notes on a legal pad. The mother kept her elbows on the table and her hands clasped. Her face was tense and grave, and at first there was a slight tremor in her voice. Cuddy opened the interview with: \u2018\u2018And this is in regard to your daughter?\u2019\u2019Yes, the mother nodded.\u2018\u2018O.K., why don\u2019t you tell me everything that happened from the beginning?\u2019\u2019The mother described the argument that led to her daughter\u2019s divulging the rape. When her daughter named her rapist, the mother\u2019s voice went hard and flat. \u2018\u2018Walk me through it,\u2019\u2019 she said to her daughter tersely. The girl told her what the man did, and when she repeated the words he said while he raped her, the mother knew her daughter wasn\u2019t lying: He said the same thing before raping her when she was a girl.The interview solved one mystery: The mother told Cuddy that she believed the rape took place while she was detained after being picked up on a misdemeanor charge. She was locked up for only six or seven hours while she waited to be arraigned. Still, the situation felt slightly improbable. How did the relative happen to walk through that narrow window of opportunity?Cuddy went back to the records, no longer looking for a jail sentence during the time period the girl was assaulted but an arrest \u2014 an arrest at a location the mother named that led to approximately six hours of lockup. She would find that first and figure out the suspect\u2019s omniscience later.And then there it was: the right year, the right misdemeanor charge. An arrest and then hours later, the booking. Scanning the police report, Cuddy suddenly said very quietly: \u2018\u2018He was with her. That\u2019s how he knew. He was with her.\u2019\u2019The police arrested the mother in front of him and took her away, and there he was \u2014 with the certain knowledge that she would be gone for hours. \u2018\u2018I got it,\u2019\u2019 Cuddy said. \u2018\u2018Phew!\u2019\u2019 Then she let out a relieved laugh.During the teenager\u2019s forensic interview, which Cuddy watched craned close to the monitor so she could catch every word, her voice was barely audible. She never once made eye contact with the social worker. If she could gesture \u2018\u2018yes\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018no\u2019\u2019 rather than speak, she did. After it was over, Cuddy asked the mother if she could speak to her daughter. In a room set aside for children, they sat over a game of Jenga, and Cuddy told the girl she was proud of her. \u2018\u2018You\u2019re a survivor now, not a victim,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018You\u2019re free from this point on. You\u2019ve talked about it, and you don\u2019t need to talk about it again.\u2019\u2019As she headed back to headquarters, Cuddy said, \u2018\u2018I finally got her to smile.\u2019\u2019 When she told the girl she was going to arrest the relative, Cuddy asked for a high-five. The girl slapped her hand, a smile slipping shyly into view. \u2018\u2018Which makes me feel great, you know?\u2019\u2019 Cuddy said. \u2018\u2018Win-win.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018I came out for [expletive],\u2019\u2019 Cuddy chimed in. Formica\u2019s eyes gleamed briefly, like the pulse from a lighthouse, but his face remained immobile. It was snowing outside. A toilet flushed next door. Landisio continued to read. He had just been assigned a case of a 15-year-old who said a classmate assaulted her in the school auditorium. He had gone to the school to look at the layout and collect any footage from the school\u2019s surveillance cameras. An hour before the girl\u2019s forensic interview, he scanned the police report, reading sections out loud. The teenager told the patrol officer that she and the boy were backstage in the auditorium, making out, and \u2018\u2018the next thing she knows, he was inside of her,\u2019\u2019 Landisio read.\u2018\u2018There you go, those are the key words,\u2019\u2019 Cuddy said. \u2018\u2018\u2009\u2018The next thing I knew.\u2019 She\u2019s leaving something out.\u2019\u2019 That was one of the verbal cues they paid attention to, those time gaps in a subject\u2019s story. \u2018\u2018And before I knew it. ... \u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The next thing I remember. ... \u2019\u2019 During interviews, they would first let the subject proceed with her unprompted narration, and then they would return to those gaps \u2014 slowing the narration down, backfilling the account with details. Those specific questions could make the case stronger. Or they could reveal that the subject was evasive on purpose. Understanding why was essential. Many victims will try to present themselves as \u2018\u2018better victims,\u2019\u2019 embarrassed or afraid to admit they were drunk at the time, for instance, or that they were close to their attacker. The detectives almost never interviewed a victim more than once, because even the smallest contradiction between their statements was a gift for a defense attorney. So they had to get it right the first time. If they didn\u2019t, they might not be able to pursue a case. The heart of every investigation was that victim interview \u2014 if done right, it provided exploratory avenues for the detectives. It became the road map for the investigation.As Landisio continued to prepare for his interview with the 15-year-old, Cuddy took a call from the Connecticut state laboratory: There was a DNA match linking a suspect to two stranger rapes that occurred in 2012 and 2013. The first victim, who worked as a prostitute, was attacked late at night; the second, a mother in her 40s who was assaulted as she was walking to work before dawn. Each woman was yanked off the street at knife point, pulled into an empty lot, forced to her knees and then onto her back and then upright again as she was orally, vaginally and anally raped.Rapes by strangers are more likely to be reported, and reported immediately, but they have their own investigative challenge: identifying the perpetrator. Images from a surveillance camera at one of the crime scenes were too fuzzy to be of use, even after Cuddy sent them to the F.B.I. lab for enhancement. The victims\u2019 descriptions of the rapist narrowed it down to a light-skinned man with a Spanish accent, no facial hair, possibly in his 30s \u2014 it was hardly much to work on. Victims\u2019 identifications are usually too fragmentary to be helpful, Cuddy told me. \u2018\u2018Sometimes they can\u2019t tell you anything, but they can tell you he had a black thumbnail because they just focused on that to get out of the moment. When you think of what\u2019s happening, they have to focus on something, and it\u2019s not gonna be his face.\u2019\u2019DNA evidence from a sexual-assault exam can be the key to solving stranger rapes \u2014 but only if the rapist\u2019s DNA is in the F.B.I.\u2019s national database, known as the Combined DNA Index System (Codis). In 2011, the Connecticut state lab lost its accreditation after federal audits found a backlog of thousands of DNA cases. A year later, the lab regained its accreditation and underwent a major expansion with a new director. This fall, Connecticut passed new legislation mandating that the police submit rape-kit evidence to the lab within 10 days of a crime and that the lab test the evidence within 60 days. But in some parts of the country, many kits are still never tested at all. Tens of thousands sit untested in police storage units and public lab facilities. And those are the ones that have been counted. Many police agencies do not even inventory the rape kits in their evidence lockers. Underfunded and poorly staffed forensic labs have been partly responsible for the backlog, because processing a single rape kit typically costs between $1,000 and $1,500. Last year, the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office, along with the Department of Justice, awarded a total of nearly $80 million in grants to local jurisdictions across the country to eliminate rape-kit backlogs. (To provide the grants, the Manhattan district attorney used asset-forfeiture funds from settlements with international banks that had violated United States sanctions.)Another cause is police discretion: In most jurisdictions, investigators decide whether to forward a rape kit to the lab for processing. Officers may shelve the evidence because they think the case is unlikely to be taken up by the prosecutor. Many also mistakenly believe that DNA testing is useful only in identifying an unknown rapist. And yet acquaintance-rape cases with DNA evidence do better in court \u2014 not only are these cases more likely to be pursued by prosecutors, but they\u2019re also more likely to end in a successful conviction. Having that DNA in the database also often helps solve other cases, because many rapists are repeat offenders. (In a 2006 study, interviews with 41 serial rapists found that their first victims were younger siblings, neighborhood children, girlfriends, spouses; in other words, they started as acquaintance rapists.)A lack of leads led Cuddy to close both stranger-rape cases almost a year earlier, though they were subject to being reopened if any new evidence came in. And so it did \u2014 nearly three years after the first assault. The DNA had been matched to a man who was in prison for another, nonsexual offense.\u2018\u2018Yes!\u2019\u2019 Cuddy declared when she got off the phone with the state lab, after hearing about the Codis match.\u2018\u2018That\u2019s awesome!\u2019\u2019 Landisio said.\u2018\u2018That\u2019s some \u2018Law & Order\u2019 [expletive] right there,\u201d Formica added. When Segui came into the office, Cuddy told her the news. \u2018\u2018That deserves a drink,\u2019\u2019 the sergeant said.\u2018\u2018I think that deserves breast milk from the supervisor,\u2019\u2019 Cuddy replied. Segui tilted her head, smiling and looking at Cuddy the way you might at a particularly precocious and captivating child, then headed off to a meeting.\u2018\u2018So good, so good,\u2019\u2019 Cuddy said emphatically, talking to herself, as she looked up the suspect\u2019s criminal record. \u2018\u2018Stranger rapes never get solved.\u2019\u2019 She stared at his mug shot for a minute: a slight, rabbity-looking man in his early 20s with an almost concave face. \u2018\u2018That\u2019s the little [expletive].\u2019\u2019 Immediately, she made out the arrest warrant for each attack, handing them to Segui for review. Segui submitted them to court a week later. The suspect was due to be released from prison in November, so it seemed as if nothing could possibly go wrong. The man would be served with the warrant while he was still locked up; no other woman would be forced through that terrible ordeal.Victim No. 1 had dropped out of sight, but Cuddy phoned victim No. 2, the mother in her 40s. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m calling to let you know I received a Codis match, and I will be doing an arrest warrant for your attacker. As soon as I serve it, I will let you know.\u2019\u2019 There was a pause. \u2018\u2018You\u2019re welcome. Goodbye.\u2019\u2019 Cuddy said the victim started crying at the news. She turned to me, her face lit from the inside, and said, \u2018\u2018And that, my dear, is why I do this job.\u2019\u2019In most of these model cities, victims aren\u2019t interviewed in the bare-bones rooms used for suspects but in more comfortable ones, with couches, artwork and lamps. They\u2019re given handouts describing how the criminal-justice process works, how to apply for victims\u2019 compensation and information on victims\u2019 support groups. Austin and Grand Rapids have a blind reporting option that allows the victim to be anonymous but still give useful information to the detectives.All these police agencies have extensive reviews in place, so detectives aren\u2019t allowed to shelve a case without oversight. Philadelphia significantly revamped its sex-crimes unit after a 1999 Philadelphia Inquirer investigation revealed that the unit was misclassifying \u2014 basically burying \u2014 about a third of all complaints it received. Since then, an external oversight committee made up of experts in women\u2019s legal rights, children\u2019s advocates and staff members from rape-crisis centers has examined 300 to 400 cases annually, including all \u2018\u2018unfounded\u2019\u2019 rape reports.In these units, detectives and victims stay in contact. The No. 1 complaint of sexual-assault survivors, according to Archambault, is that law enforcement doesn\u2019t keep them up to date on the status of their investigations; often detectives don\u2019t even return victims\u2019 phone calls. Yet keeping in touch with the victims is espe\u00adcially important in the case of sexual assault, she says, \u2018\u2018because there are so few good outcomes.\u2019\u2019 Denied justice, victims especially need to feel respected by law enforcement. But the reason that it\u2019s crucial to stay in contact with the victims is the same reason that detectives often don\u2019t \u2014 they hate being the bearers of bad news. As noted in the policy and training guidelines published in 2015 by the International Association of Chiefs of Police: \u2018\u2018Virtually all sexual-assault victims want validation from the authorities that the crime occurred, and this may be a more critical element of a successful response and investigation than a criminal prosecution or conviction. Regardless of the investigative results, responding officers and investigators have the power to help a person heal from sexual assault.\u2019\u2019Many educators and leaders in this field say that arrest rates are not the best indicators of success. Instead, the thoroughness of the investigation and whether the victim stays in the process are more useful. Crime numbers are also not a good indicator of successful policing, unless you\u2019re willing to use what feels like reverse logic: Better, more responsive policing means more victims come forward. And more honest record-keeping means more of those assaults are counted.The assistant state\u2019s attorney had decided that the office was going to, in his words, \u2018\u2018wait\u2019\u2019 on the warrant regarding the prostitute\u2019s rape, because there was semen from multiple men on the vaginal swab. Cuddy was furious. \u2018\u2018The guy is a serial rapist,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018And obviously, there\u2019s a mix \u2014 she\u2019s a prostitute.\u2019\u2019 And although there was a mix of DNA on the vaginal swab, only the suspect\u2019s DNA was found on the swab taken from the woman\u2019s mouth.The state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office had also requested an additional piece of information for the other warrant. Now that it had a suspect, the court wanted Cuddy to ask the second victim whether she knew the man or ever had a sexual relationship with him. Cuddy had no choice but to make that call, and later that day she typed two additional sentences into the warrant application saying the victim did not know the suspect and never had sex with him before the rape. She looked angry and tired, and Landisio kept casting worried glances her way.There were dark moments at the S.V.U., and this was one of them; they moved in fast and sucked the light out of the room. And then you saw how much sense it would make to chuck everything \u2014 the sobbing mothers, the kids and the women muscling their way through their statements, every word like a nail in their mouths.That afternoon, a fresh-faced intern, a criminal-justice major from the University of New Haven, popped into the office. \u2018\u2018The copy machine\u2019s not working again,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018It says it needs resources. It has paper, it has toner, what resources does it want?\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018It wants your soul,\u2019\u2019 Cuddy told her. \u2018\u2018Just slip it in the slot. We all have.\u2019\u2019 There was a beat of silence, then Landisio, the intern, Natale and Formica (who had ducked into the office to see why it was so weirdly quiet) broke into laughter. Cuddy lowered her sharp little chin and, glancing coyly at them all, flashed a grin.This is what they lived on, what drove them forward \u2014 a sense of justice, of course, but that justice was so infrequent, so arbitrary, that their fuel had to be camaraderie and humor. They carried one another, quite literally in one case \u2014 Landisio hauling Cuddy into her apartment on his back after a night of drinking on the anniversary of her father\u2019s death. Once, when I asked them what the toughest part of their job was, they didn\u2019t say mucking through the ugliness of these cases every day; they didn\u2019t mention their huge workload. They said it was waiting for the court to approve their arrest warrants. The average delay, Cuddy said, was three months. One case that I watched them pursue took 10. Victims gave up. \u2018\u2018I just had a victim drop out of a case last week,\u2019\u2019 Landisio told me at one point. \u2018\u2018She said to me, \u2018I didn\u2019t think it would take so long.\u2019 She said she was over it now and just wanted to move on.\u2019\u2019 Months crawled by, and suspects disappeared.By spring, Natale got her wish and was transferred to Major Crimes. Detective Shayna Kendall, from their old crew, got her wish and returned. She moved her desk into Cuddy and Landisio\u2019s office, and you could feel the unit picking up cohesion, efficiency, speed. (By the fall, Detective Lenny Soto would also be returned to the unit, and he, too, would move his desk inside that tiny office, so the four detectives were almost joined at the hip.) A week after Kendall\u2019s return, she had 17 cases, some carried over from when she was still in the squad, cases waiting at court for arrest warrants, as well as new ones assigned by Segui. Cuddy had 22. Landisio, working 21 cases, including a sex-trafficking case he was investigating with the F.B.I., said he felt as if he were \u2018\u2018juggling cannon balls.\u2019\u2019 Segui apologized, saying she tried to hold back those that weren\u2019t as urgent, but Cuddy said, \u2018\u2018Just [expletive] assign them. We\u2019ll prioritize and do what we have to do.\u2019\u2019When Cuddy finally received her arrest warrant for the Codis case, it was six months after her first request, and three months after she was asked to add the follow-up sentences. The inspector at the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office called her with the news, and she reminded him that the suspect was in prison, so the court would serve the warrant. Shortly afterward, the inspector emailed her. When she read the email, she was livid. The suspect was released early \u2014 a month prior, in fact. \u2018\u2018They sat on a Codis case for what? Six months?\u2019\u2019 she said, spitting out the words. \u2018\u2018He\u2019s gonna be in a homeless shelter. I\u2019m never gonna find this guy \u2014 if he\u2019s not already in Mexico.\u2019\u2019 He had been released without parole, so there was no parole officer to contact and no forwarding address.She, Kendall and Landisio began searching databases, trying to find some whiff of him, while Cuddy muttered to herself: \u2018\u2018Don\u2019t get frustrated. Just do all this [expletive]. Do it for nothing.\u2019\u2019 Then Kendall hit on something \u2014 their suspect was stopped by the police three days earlier, and when they asked where he lived, he gave them his sister\u2019s address. Within minutes, the three detectives, Sergeant Segui and Officer Formica were piled into two cars, heading to the address. The suspect\u2019s two sisters were in the second-floor apartment of a multifamily house. Once the detectives were let in to search the premises, Cuddy found a bedroom that was locked. After shouting \u2018\u2018Police!\u2019\u2019 to no response, she kicked the door in while the sisters screamed at her in Spanish. But no one was inside. The sisters said they hadn\u2019t seen their brother since he was locked up over a year ago.On the ride back to the stationhouse, as the detectives recounted the raid, the adrenaline seeped from the car like boiling water from a pot going dry. Cuddy didn\u2019t believe the sisters; in a way, she didn\u2019t want to. But the next day, she found out that her suspect was, indeed, gone for good. He had been deported back to Mexico. \u2018\u2018And these guys never stop,\u2019\u2019 Cuddy said.Over the next 24 hours, her anger died away, morphing into a kind of grim fatalism. She had done everything right, the victims had soldiered through the investigation, submitting to the forensic exam, recounting the attack for the record. They had actually nailed the guy, and now he was gone. Cuddy stared bleakly at the pile of case files on her desk, making no move to open them. Finally she let out a sigh. She had to inform her victim now. The woman had cried with relief when she learned they had identified her rapist. Cuddy decided she had to do it in person. \u2018\u2018I\u2019ll come with you when you do it,\u2019\u2019 Landisio said. Cuddy looked at him and nodded. Then she turned to her newest case file.Kathy Dobie is the author of the memoir \u2018\u2018The Only Girl in the Car.\u2019\u2019 She has written for GQ and Harper\u2019s Magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Group Show, Curated by an Artist Who Hates Group Shows", "Date": "2016-01-08", "News": "Supported byThe artist Mark Flood plays curator this winter with \u201cThe Future Is Ow\u201d at Marlborough Chelsea. The prophetically titled exhibition gathers together the most futuristic work of the Houstonian\u2019s artist circle, which includes Chris Bexar, Paul Kremer, El Franco Lee II and Susie Rosmarin. Billed as a group show governed by a common interest in digital printing, it celebrates years of fruitful friendship both in and out of the studio \u2014 and the informal layout, which includes a mattress floor and plywood fortresses, is more reminiscent of a clubhouse than an exhibition. \u201cI get the idea and the title for a show at the same time,\u201d explains Flood, who has been collecting his peers\u2019 work for decades. \u201cI don\u2019t think the future is going to look like a James Bond movie; I think it will be some shelter where everyone sits on the floor surrounded by art.\u201d Here, a look at Flood\u2019s brave new world.Houston\u2019s iconic skyline comes to mind when looking at the artist Chris Bexar\u2019s works \u2014 but appearances can be deceiving. \u201cThat\u2019s a heat sink; it\u2019s the computer\u2019s radiator,\u201d says Bexar, pointing at one of his blurred images. \u201cIt has a nice form; it reminds me of Modernist German architecture.\u201d A former member of I Love You Baby, a painting collective, Bexar worked alongside Flood on a series of projects. \u201cChris\u2019s work is really the most futuristic of the bunch, but he\u2019s been doing this for years,\u201d Flood says.The painter El Franco Lee II\u2019s digital prints hang across one wall of the gallery with stacked, plastic-wrapped multiples on the floor beneath. \u201cI woke up one morning and realized I could put El Franco Lee II in the show because he printed all those multiples,\u201d Flood says with a smile. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d let me hang them the way I wanted to, but I think the digitized prints play even in plastic wrap. They fit in with the others.\u201d A painter whose work balances the jazz of Archibald Motley\u2019s frenetic scenes and the childlike hand of Henry Taylor, the reserved El Franco Lee II\u2019s work stands out for its more traditional artistic language. \u201cI was worried they wouldn\u2019t convey his art, but they absolutely do,\u201d Flood says.\u201cI\u2019ve been a Susie fanatic for decades. I probably own more Susie than Susie does,\u201d Flood says. He beams when speaking about his longtime friend Rosmarin, whose digitally inspired and printed paintings feature prominently in the exhibition. Working backward from painted images, Rosmarin zooms in and blows up her individual pigments into a colorful oblivion. \u201cI love that computers have led me back to painting,\u201d says Rosmarin in front of one her gridded pieces. \u201cIt\u2019s like evolution in reverse.\u201dPaul Kremer\u2019s paintings, some of which are based on Google searches, echo the digitized vocabulary of his fellow Houstonians. \u201cHe is so computer-savvy, he did Lou Reed\u2019s website,\u201d says Flood of Kremer. \u201cI hooked him up with Susie, and they just went crazy. The clicked immediately.\u201d Kremer\u2019s Google search prints are contrasted in the show with his abstract paintings, which demonstrate a more hands-on form of artistry. These simple geometric compositions add a breath of minimalism to the otherwise maximalist display. Rosmarin echoes her collaborator\u2019s claims: \u201cPaul can do anything, but I really love the work he is making now.\u201dThe exhibition also features several pieces of Flood\u2019s own work. Notably, a painting that spells out \u201cYOLO,\u201d a piece from Flood\u2019s recent \u201cLOL\u201d series, adds a tongue-in-cheek lightness to the show. When questioned about their gregarious leader, the participating artists recall funny encounters and long-held friendships. \u201cMark is always putting people together,\u201d Rosmarin says. The dark-humored Flood seems equally surprised by the natural chemistry of the show: \u201cIt all happened in the nick of time. I didn\u2019t want things to be contrived or forced, but in the end it all came together very organically. I usually hate themed group shows, but here I am.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Activision Buys Major League Gaming to Broaden Role in E-Sports", "Date": "2016-01-04", "News": "Supported byThe deal, worth $46 million, is relatively small for a company the size of Activision, which has a market value of over $27 billion. But it could play a significant role in Activision\u2019s broader ambitions to become a bigger player in the media business.Robert A. Kotick, chief executive of Activision Blizzard, said he saw an opportunity to build a bigger mainstream audience for e-sports through more professionally produced events modeled on traditional athletic competitions and the broadcasts that bring them into homes.While most of its e-sports events are more likely to be watched over the Internet, as most professional e-sports competitions are today, Activision intends to bring them to viewers through a traditional television channel distributed by cable and satellite providers, Mr. Kotick said.\u201cI have a simple vision for this,\u201d Mr. Kotick said in a phone interview. \u201cI want to build the ESPN of video games.\u201dActivision has already begun bringing in people with extensive backgrounds in broadcasting and e-sports. In October, Activision hired Steve Bornstein, the former chief executive of ESPN and NFL Network, to run its new media division. It also hired Mike Sepso, a co-founder of Major League Gaming, to serve as a senior vice president of the division.As part of the acquisition, Sundance DiGiovanni, the other co-founder of Major League Gaming and its chief executive, will join Activision.Major League Gaming, founded 12 years ago, will continue to organize professional video game competitions featuring games made by Activision and other publishers.Other big publishers have begun increasing their investments in e-sports in recent months. In December, Electronic Arts, the publisher of the Madden and Battlefield franchises, formed an e-sports division and appointed Peter Moore, its former chief operating officer, to run it. Last year, Microsoft increased its investments in a professional tournament for players of Halo, its science-fiction shooter game.But no publisher has been more successful at fostering a large e-sports audience than Riot Games, whose October championship match for its arena battle game, League of Legends, was viewed by as many as 14 million people at one time, up from 11 million the prior year.For the most part, publishers like Riot have viewed e-sports as a way to energize their fan bases by showcasing the talents of the most highly skilled players. The competitions are not generally big sources of profits on their own but benefit publishers indirectly by improving sales and increasing the online purchases that occur within games.Mr. Kotick, of Activision, said that he saw similar benefits for his company\u2019s games, but that he believed organized competitions would become a big business in their own right, as corporate sponsors and advertisers become more familiar with the category.Activision is hardly the first company to consider the broadcasting of e-sports competitions as a crucial piece of the e-sports business. Twitch became a streaming powerhouse by allowing professionals and amateurs to broadcast matches, and it was eventually acquired by Amazon for nearly $1 billion. YouTube, which is owned by Google, has also turned itself into a popular destination to view gaming videos of all kinds.Much of the gaming content on Twitch and YouTube is contributed by users, though these platforms also broadcast professional competitions. Mr. Kotick thinks an e-sports network singularly focused on premium content \u2014 including slickly produced competitions and news shows akin to \u201cSportsCenter,\u201d on ESPN \u2014 will be able to attract more interest from advertisers.\u201cWe think user-generated-content networks are great and widely available,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is really focused on premium content.\u201dThe studios within Activision that make its games will be able to decide whether to team with Activision\u2019s own broadcasting arm to air their competitions or an outside company, Mr. Kotick said.In addition to Call of Duty, the digital card game Hearthstone, developed by the Blizzard side of the company, has developed a sizable e-sports following. Blizzard\u2019s StarCraft helped create the modern e-sports scene, which first emerged in South Korea over a decade ago.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Try to Interview Google\u2019s Co-Founder. It\u2019s Emasculating.", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "Supported byI started as The New York Times\u2019s Google beat reporter in August 2014. Shortly thereafter, I told the company\u2019s public relations people that at some point I would love to interview Larry Page, the company\u2019s co-founder. I\u2019ve been waiting ever since.Mr. Page is a fascinating character who has changed the world a few times over and is worth tens of billions of dollars. But he makes little time for the press. He rarely grants interviews, and, when he does, they are usually limited to staged events like TED.Before we go any further, I want to say loud and clear that I don\u2019t think Mr. Page or any other business leader has a responsibility to talk to the press. He is a busy man and his media shyness probably should not be confused with reclusion. Mr. Page is visible at Google\u2019s Mountain View, Calif., campus and regularly talks to the company\u2019s 60,000 employees there and around the world (via videoconference), during the company\u2019s weekly T.G.I.F. gatherings.But companies are run by people, so it is extremely difficult to understand Google without understanding Mr. Page. If you can\u2019t talk to the man himself, the next best thing is to talk to people who have worked with him.As I reported the story, two things kept surfacing. The first was that a number of recently departed Googlers told me that after they gave notice, Mr. Page personally asked them to stay. They said that, during these conversations, he honestly laid out his concerns and aspirations for the company and its future.The second thing was that as I reported the profile \u2014 as well as other technology stories \u2014 I kept meeting scientists and other researchers who had bumped into Mr. Page at Google\u2019s various academic and scientific gatherings.Whenever someone asks me what I do at The Times, and I tell them I cover Google, the result is often a confused stare. \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201dNot really. Our technology group tends to work thematically, meaning that we try to focus on how tech is changing our readers\u2019 work and personal lives. Google is the main focus of my reporting, and it is a brutally competitive beat. It takes me an hour to go through the day\u2019s headlines each morning, and there are dozens of competitors and talented journalists on the tech beat. That means I\u2019m often scooped, and the scrum of daily news can make it hard to see the bigger picture.It\u2019s worth it, though. There\u2019s a strong argument that Google is now the most important company in the world. It is worth $500 billion and is neck and neck with Apple as the most valuable company by market capitalization. Six Google products have more than one billion users. I use Google to research stories, I email my editors through Gmail, and I use Google Maps to go to meetings.Google\u2019s power is unparalleled and partly explains why it and other giant technology companies have faced a bit of cultural backlash in the wake of Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who leaked documents about government spying.Google\u2019s omnipresence is such that it is often hard for me to get away from work. For example, a few weeks after Mr. Page announced the formation of Alphabet, the author Jonathan Franzen published \u201cPurity,\u201d his fifth novel. I read the book for fun, but, as often happens on the Google beat, it quickly turned into work.One of the main characters in Mr. Franzen\u2019s novel is Andreas Wolf, a hacker who has exposed secrets about the East German Stasi and the United States nuclear arsenal, but, during one fictional exchange, refused to publish leaks from two Google employees for fear that the company might use its search engine to tar Mr. Wolf\u2019s reputation.I emailed Mr. Franzen, via a publicist, to see if he might be willing to tell me what kinds of real-world concerns led to that imaginary exchange.\u201cThat paragraph came out of the distance between what the N.S.A. was collecting in terms of metadata, basically the Snowden leak, a relatively paltry amount of data compared to the rather large amounts of data we are willingly giving up \u2014 or unwillingly giving up by clicking the \u2018I accept the terms box\u2019 \u2014 to these very powerful corporations,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cAnd my feeling is, you look around at who is powerful in the world now, and, yes the U.S. government still has drones and a nuclear arsenal \u2014 it has some might \u2014 but in terms of power over people\u2019s daily lives, I think it\u2019s shifted to the private sector.\u201dLater, he added: \u201cI think it\u2019s appropriate always to resist concentration of power in the hands of too few. There is bound to come a point where that becomes dangerous.\u201dBut Mr. Page has also used his own power \u2014 through an unusual share structure, he and co-founder Sergey Brin control the company outright \u2014 to isolate himself from Wall Street\u2019s demands. In the 16 years I\u2019ve been covering business I have met countless C.E.O.s who describe their jobs in almost academic terms, using phrases like \u201cfiduciary duty\u201d to dodge questions about what kind of role their company has to society.In public comments, Mr. Page goes out of his way to say the opposite, describing Google more in terms of a nonprofit than a gigantic corporation. During a 2014 interview with Charlie Rose, he said he wished there were a vehicle for people to donate money to their company so that it could be used for projects that had some kind of social purpose.These are some of the ideas I tried to get at in the article, but of course I would love to have included an interview with the man himself. There is a popular image of reporters as a pack of pushy cold callers who will stalk anyone to get their story, and while that is true at times, I can tell you from experience that it is really awkward and emasculating to try to interview someone who doesn\u2019t want to talk. You feel like a big dork.In total, I have encountered Mr. Page three times for a total of five minutes or so. Once was at an off-the-record gathering where nothing interesting happened, and another was at a press event where he politely shook my hand before heading in another direction.The other time, I was at Google\u2019s Mountain View campus, talking to an executive, when Mr. Page rode up on his bike to say hello to his employee. I introduced myself as a New York Times reporter and he immediately pedaled away.\u201cThat went well,\u201d the executive said.It\u2019s not always the most flattering work, but I do believe it\u2019s important.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Composers\u2019 Collectives Offer Creativity and Challenges", "Date": "2016-01-17", "News": "Supported byCritic\u2019s NotebookThe men met as students at Yale University and dispersed to different corners of the country, each making an individual mark on the new-music scene. But for works like \u201cAsh,\u201d which Ms. Bathgate commissioned under the working title \u201cBach Unwound,\u201d the composers come together, in gargantuan email chains and in Google Hangout sessions lasting hours, to collaborate on multi-movement pieces that seek to preserve their own voices within a common dramatic arc.\u201cIt does mean that it takes longer,\u201d Mr. Cooper said of the creative process, in a phone interview. \u201cBecause we\u2019ll email each other back and forth a hundred times a day. But it really is wonderful to not be in a vacuum when you are composing.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s tumultuous,\u201d Mr. Hearne agreed in a separate interview. \u201cNot only do we argue with each other, but we also consider different opinions far more than we should.\u201dComposers\u2019 collectives have always had a certain combative spirit. But it is perhaps a sign of the fuzzy warmth of the current all-embracing new-music scene, where no one style is dominant, that composers seem to band together in order to argue with one another, rather than take up the fight against a perceived status quo.\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to promote any one aesthetic,\u201d Mr. Hearne said. In choosing the group\u2019s name, taken from a mountain near New Haven, he said he felt strongly that there should be no \u201cthe\u201d preceding it: \u201cHaving the definite article in there would not be of our time.\u201dAlong the way its members learned hard entrepreneurial lessons. Once, Mr. Salonen organized a concert at his old school but forgot to advertise the event. The audience consisted of \u201ctwo little old ladies,\u201d who, it appeared, \u201cthought they were going to church.\u201d They politely stayed to listen to one and a half hours of hard-driving music by Mauricio Kagel. \u201cThey looked a bit pale afterwards,\u201d Mr. Salonen said.\u201cWe thought that hearing postserial music is good for people,\u201d he continued. In media appearances and publications, the members of Ears Open! relished the chance to take a stand \u2014 even if it was a ridiculous one, like Mr. Salonen\u2019s declaration, made from atop a mound of coal, that rock music was dead.The Bang on a Can collective, formed in the 1980s by the composers Julia Wolfe, Michael Gordon and David Lang, locked horns with an American new-music scene that was still largely dominated by European Modernism. \u201cThere was more to fight against,\u201d Ms. Wolfe said of those early years, in a phone interview. \u201cWe bumped into a lot of walls. That\u2019s very different to today. There isn\u2019t a similar kind of conflict.\u201d She said that her group tried to open doors to a greater plurality of styles in its concerts and music marathons, and was surprised when Bang on a Can came to be identified with a particular aesthetic (open to pop influences, fond of amplification).Sleeping Giant, too, may be heading for that sort of cohesion. On Tuesday, the individual movements of \u201cAsh\u201d rang clear with the distinct voices of its composers. These included Mr. Norman\u2019s dry wit in \u201cFor Ashley,\u201d the dreamy tranquillity of Mr. Honstein\u2019s \u201cOrison\u201d and the hyperactive virtuosity of Mr. Andres\u2019s \u201cSmall Wonder.\u201dBut there was interconnectivity in the way individual composers approached the solo cello. The musical elements each chose to focus on \u2014 resonance, for instance; or progression; or the particular camber of an arpeggio \u2014 seemed drawn from a common pool. In fact, Mr. Cooper said, the members\u2019 styles \u201chave become a bit more similar, the way married people grow more like each other over time.\u201dFor \u201cHand Eye,\u201d the work that Eighth Blackbird will present at Carnegie Hall, the composers worked references to one other\u2019s music into their respective movements. Mr. Cooper\u2019s and Mr. Hearne\u2019s will interlock, subtly.\u201cPeople like commissioning us,\u201d Mr. Cooper said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good way of ensuring that you\u2019ll have a cohesive piece.\u201dAdvertisement"}

On Tuesday, he appeared on \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert,\u201d where he spoke in support of his candidate.In an interview, Mr. Render repeated the message he delivered to the \u201cLate Show\u201d audience, saying that Mr. Sanders\u2019s politics were directly in line with the ideology of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u201cBernie Sanders has been the only politician in my lifetime that I have heard talk about reform that was directly out of King-ian organizing philosophy,\u201d he said.On a call with reporters on Thursday, Ron Lester, a pollster for the Clinton campaign, said that in South Carolina, Mrs. Clinton was supported by 76 percent of black voters, while Mr. Sanders was polling at 10 percent.But others say Mr. Sanders still has a chance to make up ground. While acknowledging Mrs. Clinton\u2019s firm base of support among African-American voters, the Democratic strategist Donna Brazile said that \u201cthere\u2019s enough votes on the table for Bernie.\u201d\u201cThere are voters on the margin in the African-American community who don\u2019t have history with the Clintons,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen it comes to scripture, Hillary Clinton knows the message and the melody for black voters. But Hillary has to earn the votes.\u201dShe also recalled that in 2007, Mrs. Clinton had been beating Barack Obama in the polls among African-Americans. But in the course of the campaign, black voters began to make a shift to the eventual president, and ended up representing a significant part of the coalition that elected him.Mr. Render supported Mr. Obama in that election, seeing him as a landmark candidate who would provide inspiration to a generation of African-American children. But he says that from a policy perspective, he is more enthusiastic about Mr. Sanders.Mr. Render grew up in a politically engaged family. Raised by his maternal grandparents, one a Democrat, the other a \u201cfierce libertarian,\u201d he became an activist in his community as a teenager. He worked with Black Teens for Advancement, an anti-violence organization in Atlanta, and later with the Atlanta/Fulton Commission on Children and Youth, and its program, Kids 4 a Change.\u201cThey were my passions, rapping and organizing,\u201d he said. \u201cOrganizing helped me feel better about being able to affect my community immediately. Organizing gave me an outlet and rap music gave me a voice.\u201dHe started rapping under the pseudonym Skunk, but a local D.J. nicknamed him Killer Mike after he outrapped a room of competitors in high school and the name stuck. He said that he is not concerned about people ignoring his message because of the name, comparing himself to other musicians who have gone by the name \u201ckiller.\u201d\u201cYou have to say to yourself, \u2018well Jerry Lee Lewis wasn\u2019t a killer and the band The Killers aren\u2019t killers, so let me Google him and see what he\u2019s about,\u2019\u201d he said. If the name holds outsize weight with people, he said, they \u201cwant to think badly of me already.\u201dMr. Render\u2019s strong advocacy for Mr. Sanders is part of a long marriage between rap and politics. According to the hip-hop historian Shea Serrano, author of \u201cThe Rap Year Book\u201d (to which I contributed a blurb), the two have been closely intertwined since the 1980s, when politicians started condemning gangster rappers like N.W.A., and rap groups like Public Enemy were writing explicitly political songs.Mr. Render says the rise of his artistic profile has given his political message a boost.\u201cI was as vocal and as adamant\u201d in past years, he said. \u201cJust more people are tuned in now.\u201dMr. Serrano agreed that any political credibility Mr. Render had with audiences was amplified by his artistic credibility.\u201cYou have this very charismatic and powerful presence in Killer Mike. I wasn\u2019t paying attention to Bernie Sanders until Killer Mike put his name next to him. Then I was like, \u2018I guess I better pay attention to Bernie Sanders now.\u2019\u200a\u201d\u201cI think he\u2019s done a phenomenal job, but he has a lot of ground to make up,\u201d Ms. Brazile said of Mr. Render\u2019s political advocacy. \u201cBernie Sanders doesn\u2019t have 25 years of what I call attending church.

{"Headline": "Why Are Corporations Hoarding Trillions?", "Date": "2016-01-20", "News": "Supported byOn MoneyThere is an economic mystery I\u2019ve been struggling to understand for quite some time, and I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s confused: Among financial experts, it is often referred to as a conundrum, a paradox, a puzzle. The mystery is as follows: Collectively, American businesses currently have $1.9 trillion in cash, just sitting around. Not only is this state of affairs unparalleled in economic history, but we don\u2019t even have much data to compare it with, because corporations have traditionally been borrowers, not savers. The notion that a corporation would hold on to so much of its profit seems economically absurd, especially now, when it is probably earning only about 2 percent interest by parking that money in United States Treasury bonds. These companies would be better off investing in anything \u2014 a product, a service, a corporate acquisition \u2014 that would make them more than 2 cents of profit on the dollar, a razor-thin margin by corporate standards. And yet they choose to keep the cash.Take, for example, Google. Its new parent company, Alphabet, is worth roughly $500 billion. But it has around $80 billion sitting in Google\u2019s bank accounts or other short-term investments. So if you buy a share in Alphabet, which has sold for roughly $700 lately, you are effectively buying ownership of more than $100 in cash. With $80 billion, Google could buy Uber and its Indian rival Ola and still have enough left over to buy Palantir, a data-mining start-up. Or it could buy Goldman Sachs outright or American Express or most of MasterCard; it could buy Costco or eBay or a quarter of Amazon. Surely it could use those acquisitions to earn more than 2 cents on the dollar.This strange vogue for corporate hoarding seems to have begun around the turn of the millennium. General Motors is perhaps the most extreme: It now holds nearly half its value in cash. Apple holds more than a third. These numbers are maddening on their face. If the companies spent their savings, rather than hoarding them, the economy would instantly grow, and we would most likely see more jobs with better pay. In the 1990s, when companies saved far less of their profits, they built new factories, bought new buildings. In part because of all that corporate spending, the 1990s were a period of low unemployment and high growth. Remarkably, the United States government was able to tax all that productive corporate behavior so much that it came close to paying off all its debts for the first time in 160 years.So what is going on now? There are countless economic journal articles laying out theories about why corporations have shifted from borrowing to saving. Some of the reasons are prosaic. Just like people, companies might want to have money for emergencies or for lousy economic times, and the past decade has been a period of increasing risk. Also, corporations have become far more focused on something they call \u2018\u2018tax efficiency,\u2019\u2019 which the rest of us call \u2018\u2018tax avoidance\u2019\u2019: For various reasons, holding on to cash and carefully shifting it among subsidiaries, especially foreign ones, is a great tool to shrink your tax bill.Another reason to hold on to cash is a byproduct of the increasingly intense competition for talent and acquisitions, especially in technology and pharmaceuticals. When Apple or Google enter negotiations to buy a smaller company, any other firm considering a competing offer may be scared off by their nearly infinite resources. Oddly enough, then, holding on to all that cash might be saving these companies even more money, by allowing them to pay less for the firms they acquire. (Google buys about one company a week, on average; Apple\u2019s acquisitions are more sporadic, but not far behind.)But even if you accept all these reasons, we are still left with an enormous puzzle. Companies like Google and GM are holding on to far more cash \u2014 many times more \u2014 than could possibly be explained by emergency funds and tax efficiencies and M.&A. intimidation put together. Lee Pinkowitz, a professor at Georgetown, told me that finance economists agree that there is a puzzle here but break into two distinct camps over the cause. One camp believes that a large cash hoard is a sign of an unhealthy company. Maybe its whole industry is doing so poorly that there is nothing worth investing in; maybe it\u2019s because executives are up to something shady, stockpiling cash as a personal war chest to mask poor decision-making and protect their jobs (cash in the bank, suddenly deployed, can make a firm seem more profitable than it actually is). The other camp doubts that the free market could be allowing executives to hold all that cash if it were purely for their own benefit.Along with his colleague Rohan Williamson, Pinkowitz built a valuation model that analyzed how investors react to different levels of cash holding. He ran 50 years of data (originally from 1965 to 2004, but then he kindly updated his findings for me, through 2014) for 12,888 different publicly traded companies. The model shows how investors value a dollar of savings when it\u2019s held by different sorts of companies, divided into 43 industry types.His findings show that both theories have some truth to them. For several industries, hoarding cash is clearly correlated with negative results. When publishing and entertainment companies or aircraft manufacturers hold on to extra cash, investors perceive that money to be worth less than it should, somewhere in the neighborhood of 40 cents on the dollar (the authors make a specific estimate for each industry but also provide a range to account for error). The defense and coal industries are considerably worse, with a dollar in savings valued negatively. This might suggest protective behavior by chief executives in those industries, because the market is clearly not valuing their decision to save.For other industries, though, a dollar of savings is worth a lot more than itself. For pharmaceutical companies, a dollar in savings is worth $1.50. For software firms, it\u2019s even higher: more than $2. This means that investors are behaving as if they trust the executives in these industries, like Larry Page of Alphabet, to be smarter about using that money than the investors themselves could be. And a cursory scan of the industries in this second group \u2014 which also includes automakers, medical-equipment makers and others \u2014 correlates well with the ones hoarding the most cash. Corporations, it seems, may have amassed at least a good chunk of that $1.9 trillion in mysterious savings because the stock market is rewarding them for it.Which leaves one last question: Why? The answer, perhaps, is that both the executives and the investors in these industries believe that something big is coming, but \u2014 this is crucial \u2014 they\u2019re not sure what it will be. Through the 20th century, as we shifted from a horse-and-sun-powered agrarian economy to an electricity-and-motor-powered industrial economy to a silicon-based information economy, it was clear that every company had to invest in the new thing that was coming. These were big, expensive investments in buildings and machinery and computer technology. Today, though, value is created far more through new ideas and new ways of interaction. Ideas appear and spread much more quickly, and their worth is much harder to estimate. (Indeed, the impossibility of valuing the Internet is essentially what created the 2000 stock bubble.)Surely the most important economic question of our time is a fairly simple one: Are the good times over? Will wages continue to fall for many, while rising high for a few? In the cash conundrum, we might find a modest reason for optimism. If corporate leaders and their investors truly believed that the future were bleak, that innovation and economic growth were irreparably slowing, there would be little reason to hold on to all that cash. Their hoarding of it hints that they think the next transformative innovation could be just around the corner. If in fact they do \u2014 and if they\u2019re right \u2014 it\u2019s good news for all of us.Adam Davidson is a founder of NPR\u2019s \u2018\u2018Planet Money\u2019\u2019 and a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}

Let\u2019s call it, Who\u2019s Losing?But don\u2019t expect it to shift much. Asking \u201cwho\u2019s losing?\u201d misses a larger truth about how thoroughly Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft now lord over all that happens in tech.Who\u2019s really losing? In the larger picture, none of them \u2014 not in comparison with the rest of the tech industry, the rest of the economy and certainly not in the influence each of them holds over our lives.But for much of the last half-decade, most of these five giants have enjoyed a remarkable reprieve from the bogeymen in the garage. And you can bet on them continuing to win. So I\u2019m coining the name the Frightful Five.Though competition between the five remains fierce \u2014 and each year, a few of them seem up and a few down \u2014 it\u2019s becoming harder to picture how any one of them, let alone two or three, may cede their growing clout in every aspect of American business and society.Indeed, the Frightful Five are so well protected against start-ups that in most situations, the rise of new companies only solidifies their lead.This gets to the core of the Frightful Five\u2019s indomitability. They have each built several enormous technologies that are central to just about everything we do with computers. In tech jargon, they own many of the world\u2019s most valuable \u201cplatforms\u201d \u2014 the basic building blocks on which every other business, even would-be competitors, depend.These platforms are inescapable; you may opt out of one or two of them, but together, they form a gilded mesh blanketing the entire economy.The Big Five\u2019s platforms span so-called old tech \u2014 Windows is still the king of desktops, Google rules web search \u2014 and new tech, with Google and Apple controlling mobile phone operating systems and the apps that run on them; Facebook and Google controlling the Internet advertising business; and Amazon, Microsoft and Google controlling the cloud infrastructure on which many start-ups run.Many of these platforms generate what economists call \u201cnetwork effects\u201d \u2014 as more people use them, they keep getting more indispensable. Why do you chat using Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp, also owned by Facebook? Because that\u2019s where everyone else is.Then there\u2019s the data buried in the platforms, also a rich source for new business. This can happen directly \u2014 for instance, Google can tap everything it learns about how we use our phones to create an artificial intelligence engine that improves our phones \u2014 and in more circuitous ways. By watching what\u2019s popular in its app store, Apple can get insight into what features to add to the iPhone.\u201cIn a way, a lot of the research and development costs are being borne by companies out of their four walls, which allows them to do better product development,\u201d Mr. Parker said.This explains why these companies\u2019 visions are so expansive. In various small and large ways, the Frightful Five are pushing into the news and entertainment industries; they\u2019re making waves in health care and finance; they\u2019re building cars, drones, robots and immersive virtual-reality worlds. Why do all this? Because their platforms \u2014 the users, the data and all the money they generate \u2014 make these far-flung realms seem within their grasp.Which isn\u2019t to say these companies can\u2019t die. Not long ago people thought IBM, Cisco Systems, Intel and Oracle were unbeatable in tech; they\u2019re all still large companies, but they\u2019re far less influential than they once were.Even with these difficulties, it\u2019s unclear if the larger dynamic may change much. Let\u2019s say that Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce company, eclipses Amazon\u2019s retail business in India \u2014 well, O.K., so then it satisfies itself with the rest of the world.So get used to these five. Based on their stock prices this month, the giants are among the top 10 most valuable American companies of any kind. Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft are the top three; Facebook is No. 7, and Amazon is No. 9. Wall Street gives each high marks for management; and three of them \u2014 Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook \u2014 are controlled by founders who don\u2019t have to bow to the whims of potential activist investors.So who\u2019s losing? Not one of them, not anytime soon.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "My Virtual Life at Tech\u2019s Big Consumer Electronics Show", "Date": "2016-01-08", "News": "LAS VEGAS \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Over the last few days, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve repaired a robot, driven a Rover across Mars and zapped objects with a laser gun.  I did all of that while mostly standing around in a far less interesting place: Las Vegas, where the International CES, the giant consumer electronics trade show, was being held. To escape from the artificial reality of Sin City during the show, I spent a few days trying out different virtual-reality headgear and applications to assess whether virtual reality was a gimmick or a lasting trend.My verdict: Virtual reality is here to stay for the long term, partly because the content looks and feels great (and also because so many tech companies will not stop talking about it). Whether it ends up widely appealing to consumers depends on how the companies market the technology and whether they bring prices down for virtual reality devices. But considering the high quality of the early content and applications already made for virtual reality, and given the amount of cash that companies are investing in the medium, this is probably not a fad that will fizzle out like 3D television. Virtual reality companies said 2016 is the year that many consumers will try out virtual reality for the first time and perhaps be wowed, though it will not be the year that it reaches mass adoption in terms of sales.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI haven\u2019t had anyone yet try the Rift and take it off and say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I didn\u2019t get it, that\u2019s not incredible,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Brendan Iribe, the chief executive of Oculus, in an interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMost people\u2019s reaction is, \u00e2\u0080\u0098That\u2019s probably the best thing I\u2019ve ever seen in technology in my life.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009dDuring my virtual reality jaunts at the trade show, I strapped on the Rift headgear, which connects to a computer, and looped the two controllers around my hands to test two applications. An app called Toybox places a user in a virtual playroom surrounded by objects that you can pick up and interact with, like ping pong paddles, a laser gun, a slingshot and fireworks. Another player can join you in the session, too, to hit the ping pong ball or shoot a paintball at you with the slingshot.Fox Entertainment also demonstrated a virtual reality app it developed for Oculus to promote the movie \u201cThe Martian.\u201d The app gives you the opportunity to be Mark Watney, the astronaut left stranded on Mars, who is played by Matt Damon in the film. The experience, which lasted about 20 minutes, consisted of seven scenarios, including a sequence where you use the hand controllers to operate a crane to load solar panels onto the Mars Rover. A less enthralling scene involved sorting potatoes by throwing them into different buckets. I was lousy at tossing the potatoes into the buckets, just as I am inadequate at throwing objects in real life.The hand controllers for both Rift and Vive took some time getting used to, but it felt natural to interact with objects on both devices. I figured out how to repair the Aperture robot and operate the crane in \u201cThe Martian\u201d app without any help. Chet Faliszek, a video game writer at Valve, said the intuitiveness of virtual reality should open the medium to broad applications, not just games. \u201cThe applications and the different ways that they can be used are so diverse,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.Rift and Vive had some major differences. Rift is designed for use while standing or sitting. Vive encourages you to walk around \u00e2\u0080\u0094 there is a front-facing camera on the headgear to let you peek into the real world with the press of a button, in case you want to grab a glass of water, for instance.Both devices had some flaws. Rift was difficult to wear on my face; I failed to orient the device to block out the outside world in a space under my nose (perhaps because I have a long nose) and a quick head movement made the headgear go out of focus and required a readjustment. Because Vive encourages moving around, I tripped over the cord a few times. With both devices, I felt exhausted and overstimulated after 20-minute sessions \u00e2\u0080\u0094 virtual reality feels like media designed to be consumed in small doses, not hours at a time.Oculus and Vive are initially targeting gamers with their products, and there are limits to the appeal of the systems. Consider the aesthetics of the headgear, which could be off-putting to everyday consumers. Both pieces of headgear still look freakishly sci-fi, like something out of a \u201cStar Trek\u201d episode.Jaunt, which hopes to one day to become the \u00e2\u0080\u009cNetflix of VR,\u00e2\u0080\u009d believes that, at least initially, the smartphone, not fancy headgear like Rift or Vive, will be the key to mass consumer adoption of virtual reality.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all about smartphone technology,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said David Anderman, the chief business officer of Jaunt. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEverybody who has a smartphone in their pocket \u00e2\u0080\u0094 quite soon that could be everybody \u00e2\u0080\u0094 can play VR content.\u00e2\u0080\u009dTed Schilowitz, the resident futurist at Fox who helped develop the virtual reality app for \u201cThe Martian,\u201d said the smartphone had trained consumers to embrace virtual reality. Smartphones, he said, act as robots that are our virtual assistants \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and now people should be comfortable with becoming even more intimate with virtual environments.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u2019s happened to our psychology, to our humanity, has set the stage for what\u2019s going on,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u2019re ready for this now.\u00e2\u0080\u009dFollowAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Improbable Rise of Mississippi Roast", "Date": "2016-01-25", "News": "Supported byFifteen or so years ago, by her recollection, a woman named Robin Chapman made a pot roast in her slow cooker. Now known as Mississippi Roast, it would eventually become one of the most popular recipes on the web, an unlikely star with unlikely ingredients, a favorite of the mom-blog set.Ms. Chapman lives in Ripley, Miss., but she did not call her pot roast Mississippi Roast, not then and not now. She just calls it \u201croast.\u201d She used beef chuck to make the dish that first time, she told me in an interview, and put a packet of dry ranch-dressing mix on top of the meat, along with a packet of dry \u201cau jus\u201d gravy, a stick of butter and a few pepperoncini. It was an on-the-spot variation of a recipe she had learned from her aunt, which called for packaged Italian dressing. Ms. Chapman wanted something \u201cmilder,\u201d she said, so she swapped out the Italian for the ranch.She set the slow cooker to low and walked away. Some hours later, her family dived into their meal with glee. She has made the roast ever since. And largely unnoticed by food writers and scholars, the recipe has slowly taken on a life of its own.The story of that twisting road to fame began a few months after the dish\u2019s creation, when Ms. Chapman prepared the roast for Karen Farese, a friend \u201csince we were diapers,\u201d Ms. Chapman said. Ms. Farese loved her dinner, and eventually contributed a recipe for it to a cookbook put together by her congregation, the Beech Hill Church of Christ, also in Ripley. Ms. Farese did not call the dish Mississippi Roast either. She called it \u201croast beef.\u201d\u201cOh, goodness,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to say that was over 10 years ago.\u201d\u201cThe best roast in the world,\u201d she called it in her post. While admitting that \u201cthe recipe sounded awful\u201d and that she hated ranch dressing, she stood strong on the deliciousness of the meal. \u201cYou have got to make this if you like a good roast,\u201d she wrote. \u201cTrust me on this.\u201dOutside the blogosphere, however, the success of Mississippi Roast has been a quiet one. It has gone widely unnoticed by the journalists and academics who document the food culture of the American South, perhaps because it sounds so unappetizing.To see what the fuss was about, I set out to make Mississippi Roast myself. An initial run at the recipe, strictly as written, yielded a tangle of soft and luscious beef, richly flavored with butter and salt, with a low vinegar zip from the pickled peppers. There was a faint chemical bite, yes, from the packaged dressing and gravy, but the dish was objectively good, even delicious.Still: packaged dry ranch-dressing mix? Packaged dry gravy mix? These are built on foundations of salt and monosodium glutamate, artificial flavors, artificial colors, polysyllabic ingredients that are difficult to pronounce much less identify. Surely they could be replaced without increasing by much the prep time for the roast.As for the full stick of butter Ms. Chapman used, I reckoned I could go with less. There is plenty of fat in a chuck roast. And Ms. Farese called for using \u201c2 or more pepperoncini\u201d in her recipe in the church cookbook. I thought many more \u2014 eight to 10 \u2014 would answer more clearly, providing some zing against the richness of the sauce.I seared the roast before placing it in the slow cooker, browning it aggressively beneath a shower of salt and pepper and a coating of all-purpose flour that I hoped would create a fond, or base of flavor, to replace the gravy mix, and give some structure to the sauce. I placed it in the slow cooker with a half-stick of unsalted butter and all my pepperoncini.While that started to heat, I made a small portion of ranch dressing: some mayonnaise and dried dill, cider vinegar and a splash of buttermilk, just a few tablespoons in all, seasoned with a dash of paprika. And I dumped that over the top of the meat.Eight hours later, my family dived into their meal with glee. It was exactly the same as the original effort, and took about the same amount of time to make.Ms. Farese has twins, Katherine and Michael, both seniors at the University of Mississippi. Recently, she said, a friend of theirs served them the roast for dinner. \u201cWhere did you get this recipe?\u201d Katherine asked. \u201cIt\u2019s a Mississippi Roast,\u201d the host replied. \u201cI found the recipe on Pinterest.\u201dMs. Farese laughed at the children\u2019s response. \u201cNo,\u201d Michael said, \u201cthis is my mama\u2019s roast.\u201dAnd to Drink ...cookingAdvertisement"}

Last week, my once-beloved \u201csmart\u201d thermostat suffered from a mysterious software bug that drained its battery and sent our home into a chill in the middle of the night.Although I had set the thermostat to 70 degrees overnight, my wife and I were woken by a crying baby at 4 a.m. The thermometer in his room read 64 degrees, and the Nest was off.\u201cWoke up to a dead nest and a very cold house,\u201d a commenter wrote on the company\u2019s forum. \u201cNot good when you have a baby sleeping!\u201dAdmittedly, this may strike some as a quintessential first-world problem: a thermostat that can\u2019t connect to the web. But for some users, it posed genuine issues.For those who are elderly or ill, or who have babies, a freezing house can have dire health consequences. Moreover, homeowners who installed a Nest in a weekend home, or who were on vacation, were also concerned that their pipes could freeze and burst, causing major damage.Matt Rogers, the co-founder and vice president for engineering at Nest, blamed a software update from December. \u201cWe had a bug that was introduced in the software update that didn\u2019t show up for about two weeks,\u201d Mr. Rogers said apologetically. In January, devices went offline, and \u201cthat\u2019s when things started to heat up.\u201dOr, in my case, not heat up.I know, you\u2019re not the only one confused. (Nest does offer to send an electrician to your home if you can\u2019t figure it out on your own.)But this isn\u2019t just about the Nest. This points to a larger problem with so-called smart devices that we are inviting into our lives: Small glitches can cause huge problems.I\u2019ve heard dozens of other stories from people with connected homes who were locked out by malfunctioning door touch pads, or about newfangled security alarms going off in the middle of the night because a bug (one with wings, not a digital one) flew by.Moreover, Ms. Gill noted, you have to agree to keep the terms of the arbitration confidential, meaning you can\u2019t warn other consumers about potential flaws.So, if a pipe bursts in your home because the thermostat stopped working, or if your grandmother falls ill because the heat shuts off in the middle of the night and she doesn\u2019t have a micro USB cable, you can\u2019t sue.After last week\u2019s freeze, I\u2019m thinking of ditching my Nest. I haven\u2019t decided on a replacement yet, but I may take a cue from Kent Goldman, a San Francisco resident I follow on Twitter who had a similar issue with his Nest in November.Sure, it doesn\u2019t let you change the temperature through your smartphone. And it won\u2019t email you monthly usage reports. But it isn\u2019t vulnerable to bad software, and it doesn\u2019t require a Wi-Fi connection.Advertisement"}

As a venture partner with Index, he will invest in new companies, as well as advise and mentor entrepreneurs and tech executives.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHaving the opportunity to work with the great team at Index while also embarking on my own new venture makes the beginning of 2016 a very special time for me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Costolo said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\u2019t wait to dive in.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Costolo is no stranger to start-ups. He co-founded a handful of them in the 1990s and 2000s, the most noteworthy being Feedburner, which Google acquired in 2007 for a reported $100 million. Mr. Costolo joined Twitter after Google, becoming chief operating officer before ascending to chief executive in 2010. He was largely credited with building up Twitter from roughly 300 employees to more than 3,000, and took the company public.

{"Headline": "Transcript of the Democratic Presidential Debate", "Date": "2016-01-17", "News": "Supported byFollowing is a transcript of the Democratic debate, as transcribed by the Federal News Service.HOLT: Good evening and welcome to the NBC News Youtube Democratic candidate\u2019s debate. After all the campaigning, soon, Americans will have their say with the first votes of the 2016 campaign just 15 days away in Iowa.HOLT: And New Hampshire not far behind.Tonight will be the final opportunity to see these candidates face to face before the voting begins. Our purpose here tonight is to highlight and examine the differences among the three Democratic candidates. So let\u2019s get started.Please welcome Secretary Hillary Clinton, Senator Bernie Sanders and Governor Martin O\u2019Malley.(APPLAUSE)Well, welcome to all of you. Hope you\u2019re excited, we\u2019re excited. We want to thank our hosts, the Congressional Black Caucus Institute. I\u2019m joined by my colleague Andrea Mitchell tonight. The rules are simple. Sixty seconds for answers, 30 seconds for follow-ups or rebuttals. I know you\u2019ll all keep exactly to time, so our job should be pretty easy here tonight. We\u2019ll have questions from the Youtube community throughout the debate.This is a critical point in the race. You\u2019ve been defining your differences with each other especially vigorously in the last week on the campaign trail. We\u2019re here to facilitate this conversation on behalf of the voters so that they know exactly where you stand as you face off tonight. Let\u2019s have a great debate.We\u2019ll begin with 45 second opening statements from each candidate, starting with Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Well, good evening. And I want to thank the Congressional Black Caucus Institute and the people of Charleston for hosting us here on the eve of Martin Luther King Day tomorrow.You know, I remember well when my youth minister took me to hear Dr. King. I was a teenager. And his moral clarity, the message that he conveyed that evening really stayed with me and helped to set me on a path to service. I also remember that he spent the last day of his life in Memphis, fighting for dignity and higher pay for working people.And that is our fight still. We have to get the economy working and incomes rising for everyone, including those who have been left out and left behind. We have to keep our communities and our country safe. We need a president who can do all aspects of the job.I understand that this is the hardest job in the world. I\u2019m prepared and ready to take it on and I hope to earn your support to be the nominee of the Democratic Party and the next president of the United States.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Thank you. Senator Sanders, your opening statement, sir.SANDERS: Thank you. As we honor the extraordinary life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., it\u2019s important not only that we remember what he stood for, but that we pledge to continue his vision to transform our country. As we look out at our country today, what the American people understand is we have an economy that\u2019s rigged, that ordinary Americans are working longer hours for lower wages, 47 million people living in poverty, and almost all of the new income and wealth going to the top one percent.SANDERS: And then, to make a bad situation worse, we have a corrupt campaign finance system where millionaires and billionaires are spending extraordinary amounts of money to buy elections.This campaign is about a political revolution to not only elect the president, but to transform this country.HOLT: Senator, thank you.(APPLAUSE)And Governor O\u2019Malley, your opening statement, sir.O\u2019MALLEY: Thank you. My name is Martin O\u2019Malley, I was born the year Dr. King delivered his \u201cI Have A Dream\u201d speech.And I want to thank the people of South Carolina, not only for hosting our debate here tonight, but also for what you taught all of us in the aftermath of the tragic shooting at Mother Emanuel Church.You taught us, in fact, in keeping with Dr. King\u2019s teaching, that love would have the final word when you took down the Confederate flag from your state house; let go of the past and move forward.Eight years ago, you brought forward a new leader in Barack Obama to save our country from the second Great Depression. And that\u2019s what he\u2019s done. Our country\u2019s doing better, we\u2019re creating jobs again.But in order to make good on the promise of equal opportunity and equal justice under the law, and we have urgent work to do, and the voices of anger and fear and division that we\u2019ve heard coming off of the Republican presidential podiums are pretty loud.We need new leadership. We need to come together as a people and build on the good things that President Obama has done.That\u2019s why I\u2019m running for president. I need your help, I ask for your vote, and I look forward to moving our country forward once again.Thank you.HOLT: All right. And Governor, thank you.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: All right, to our first question, now. The first question, I\u2019ll be addressing to all of the candidates.President Obama came to office determined to swing for the fences on health care reform. Voters want to know how you would define your presidency? How would you think big? So complete this sentence: in my first 100 days in office, my top three priorities will be \u2014 fill in the blank.Senator Sanders.SANDERS: Well, that\u2019s what our campaign is about. It is thinking big. It is understanding that in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, we should have health care for every man, woman, and child as a right that we should raise the minimum wage to at least $15 an hour; that we have got to create millions of decent- paying jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure.So, what my first days are about is bringing America together, to end the decline of the middle class, to tell the wealthiest people in this country that yes, they are going to start paying their fair share of taxes, and that we are going to have a government that works for all of us, and not just big campaign contributors.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Secretary Clinton, same question, my first 100 days in office, my top three priorities will be.CLINTON: I would work quickly to present to the Congress my plans for creating more good jobs in manufacturing, infrastructure, clean and renewable energy, raising the minimum wage, and guaranteeing, finally, equal pay for women\u2019s work.I would also...(APPLAUSE)I would also be presenting my plans to build on the Affordable Care Act and to improve it by decreasing the out-of-pocket costs by putting a cap on prescription drug costs; by looking for ways that we can put the prescription drug business and the health insurance company business on a more stable platform that doesn\u2019t take too much money out of the pockets of hard-working Americans.And third, I would be working, in every way that I knew, to bring our country together. We do have too much division, too much mean- spiritedness. There\u2019s a lot we have to do on immigration reform, on voting rights, on campaign finance reform, but we need to do it together. That\u2019s how we\u2019ll have the kind of country for the 21st century that we know will guarantee our children and grandchildren the kind of future they deserve.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Governor O\u2019Malley, same question.O\u2019MALLEY: Thank you. First of all, I would lay out an agenda to make wages go up again for all Americans, rather than down. Equal pay for equal work, making it easier rather than harder for people to join labor unions and bargain collectively for better wages; getting 11 million of our neighbors out of the underground shadow economy by passing comprehensive immigration reform, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, however we can, wherever we can.Secondly, I believe the greatest business opportunity to come to the United States of America in 100 years is climate change. And I put forward a plan to move us to a 100 percent clean electric energy grid by 2050 and create 5 million jobs along the way.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Thank you. You\u2019ve all...O\u2019MALLEY: Finally \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, that was second, Lester.O\u2019MALLEY: And third and finally, we need a new agenda for America\u2019s cities. We have not had a new agenda for America\u2019s cities since Jimmy Carter. We need a new agenda for America cities that will invest in the talents and skills in our people, that will invest in CBVG transportation, infrastructure and transit options, and make our cities the leading edge in this move to a redesigned built clean green energy future that will employ our people.HOLT: All right governor thank you.We\u2019ve all laid out large visions and we\u2019re going to cover a lot of the ground you talked about as we continue in the evening. The last couple of weeks of this campaign have featured some of the sharpest exchanges in the race. Let\u2019s start with one of them, the issue of guns.Senator Sanders, last week Secretary Clinton called you quote, \u201ca pretty reliable vote for the gun lobby.\u201d Right before the debate you changed your position on immunity from lawsuits for gun manufacturers, can you tell us why?SANDERS: Well, I think Secretary Clinton knows that what she says is very disingenuous. I have a D-minus voting record from the NRA. I was in 1988, there were three candidates running for congress in the state of Vermont, I stood up to the gun lobby and came out and maintained the position that in this country we should not be selling military style assault weapons.I have supported from day one and instant background check to make certain that people who should have guns do not have guns. And that includes people of criminal backgrounds, people who are mentally unstable. I support what President Obama is doing in terms of trying to close the gun show loop holes and I think it should be a federal crime if people act as dormant (ph).We have seen in this city a horrendous tragedy of a crazed person praying with people in the coming up and shooting nine people. This should not be a political issue. What we should be doing is working together.And by the way, as a senator from a rural state that has virtually no gun control, I believe that I am in an excellent position to bring people together to fight the sensible...HOLT: Senator, but you didn\u2019t answer the question that you did change your position on immunity from gun manufacturers. So can you...SANDERS: What I have said, is that gun manufacturer\u2019s liability bill has some good provisions among other things, we\u2019ve prohibited ammunition that would\u2019ve killed cops who had protection on. We have child safety protection work on guns in that legislation. And what we also said, \u201cis a small mom and pop gun shop who sells a gun legally to somebody should not be held liable if somebody does something terrible with that gun.\u201dSo what I said is, \u201c I would re-look at it.\u201d We are going to re- look at it and I will support stronger provisions.HOLT: Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond to Senator Sanders.CLINTON: Yes look, I have made it clear based on Senator Sanders\u2019 own record that he has voted with the NRA, with the gun lobby numerous times. He voted against the Brady Bill five times. He voted for what we call, the Charleston Loophole. He voted for immunity from gunmakers and sellers which the NRA said, \u201cwas the most important piece of gun legislation in 20 years. \u201cHe voted to let guns go onto the Amtrak, guns go into National Parks. He voted against doing research to figure out how we can save lives. Let\u2019s not forget what this is about, 90 people a day die from gun violence in our country. That\u2019s 33,000 people a year.One of the most horrific examples not a block from here where we had nine people murdered. Now, I am pleased to hear that Senator Sanders has reversed his position on immunity and I look forward to him joining with those members of congress who have already introduced legislation. There is no other industry in America that was given the total pass that the gun makers and dealers were and that needs to be reversed.HOLT: All right, Governor O\u2019Malley, you signed tough gun control measures as governor of Maryland and there are a lot Democrats in the audience here in South Carolina who own guns. This conversation might be worrying many of them. They may be hearing, \u201cyou want to take my guns. What would you say to them?O\u2019MALLEY: This is what I would say Lester, look see, I\u2019ve listened to Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders go back and forth on which of them has the most inconsistent record on gun safety legislation and I would have to agree with both of them. They\u2019ve both been inconsistent when it comes to this issue.O\u2019MALLEY: I\u2019m the one candidate on this stage that actually brought people together to pass comprehensive gun safety legislation. This is very personal to me being from Baltimore. I will never forget one occasion visiting a little boy in Johns\u2019 Hopkins Hospital, he was getting a birthday haircut, the age of three when drug dealers turned that barbershop into a shooting gallery and that boy\u2019s head was pierced with a bullet. And I remember visiting him, it did not kill him - I remember visiting him and his mother in Johns Hopkins Hospital. He was getting a birthday haircut, the age of three when drug dealers turned that barbershop into a shooting gallery, and that boys head was pierced with a bullet.And, I remember visiting him, it did not kill him. I remember visiting him and his mother in Johns Hopkins Hospital. In his diapers (ph) with tubes running in and out of his head, same age as my little boy.So, after the slaughter of the kids in Connecticut last year, we brought people together. We did pass in our state comprehensive gun safety legislation. It did have a ban on combat assault weapons, universal background checks, and you know what? We did not interrupt a single person\u2019s hunting season.I\u2019ve never met a self respecting deer hunter that needed an AR-15 to down a deer. And, so...(APPLAUSE)... we\u2019re able to actually do these things.HOLT: Alright, Governor, thank you.Secretary Clinton, this is a community that has suffered a lot of heartache in the last year. Of course, as you mentioned, the church shootings. We won\u2019t forget the video of Walter Scott being shot in the back while running from police.We understand that a jury will decide whether that police officer was justified, but it plays straight to the fears of many African American men that their lives are cheap. Is that perception, or in your view, is it reality?CLINTON: Well, sadly it\u2019s reality, and it has been heartbreaking, and incredibly outraging to see the constant stories of young men like Walter Scott, as you said, who have been killed by police officers. Their needs to be a concerted effort to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.And, that requires a very clear, agenda for retraining police officers, looking at ways to end racial profiling, finding more ways to really bring the disparities that stalk our country into high relief.One out of three African American men may well end up going to prison. That\u2019s the statistic. I want people hear to think what we would be doing if it was one out of three white men, and very often, the black men are arrested, convicted and incarcerated ...(APPLAUSE)...for offensive that do not lead to the same results for white men.So, we have a very serious problem that we can no longer ignore.HOLT: You time is up.Senator Sanders, my next question is...SANDERS: ...Well, I \u2014 look...HOLT: ... It\u2019s actually \u2014 actually my next question is to you...SANDERS: ... Let me respond to what the secretary said. We have a criminal justice system which is broken. Who in America is satisfied that we have more people in jail than any other country on Earth, including China? Disproportionately African American, and Latino. Who is satisfied that 51% of African American young people are either unemployed, or underemployed? Who is satisfied that millions of people have police records for possessing marijuana when the CEO\u2019s of Wall Street companies who destroyed our economy have no police records.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Senator Sanders...SANDERS: ... We need to take a very hard look at our...HOLT: Senator. Senator Sanders...SANDERS: ... criminal justice system, investing in jobs, and education not in jails and incarceration .HOLT: ... Just over a week ago the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus endorsed Secretary Clinton, not you. He said that choosing her over you was not a hard decision. In fact, our polling shows she\u2019s beating you more than two to one among minority voters. How can you be the nominee if you don\u2019t have that support?SANDERS: Well, let me talk about polling.(LAUGHTER) SANDERS: As Secretary Clinton well knows, when this campaign began she was 50 points ahead of me. We were all of three percentage points. Guess what?In Iowa, New Hampshire, the race is very, very close. Maybe we\u2019re ahead New Hampshire.(CHEERING)SANDERS: In terms of polling, guess what? We are running ahead of Secretary Clinton. In terms of taking on my taking on my good friend, Donald Trump, beating him by 19 points in New Hampshire, 13 points in the last national poll that we saw.To answer your question. When the African American community becomes familiar with my Congressional record and with our agenda, and with our views on the economy, and criminal justice \u2014 just as the general population has become more supportive, so will the African American community, so will the Latino community. We have the momentum, we\u2019re on a path to a victory.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)O\u2019MALLEY: Lester, I (inaudible)HOLT: Governor, I\u2019m going to come to you in a second.Google searches for the words, \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d surpassed, \u201ccivil rights movement\u201d. And, here in South Carolina, \u201cblack lives matter\u201d was the number one trending political issue.HOLT: Governor O\u2019Malley, you\u2019ve campaigned on your record as governor of Maryland, and before that, the mayor of Baltimore. Last year, of course, Baltimore was rocked by violent unrest in the wake of the death of Freddie Gray.And right from the start of your campaign, you\u2019ve been dogged by those who blame your tough-on-crime, so-called zero tolerance policies as mayor for contributing to that unrest. What responsibility do you bear?O\u2019MALLEY: Yes, let\u2019s talk about this. When I ran for mayor in 1999, Lester, it was not because our city was doing well. It was because we were burying over 300 young, poor black men every single year.And that\u2019s why I ran, because, yes, black lives matter. And we did a number of things. We weren\u2019t able to make our city immune from setbacks as the Freddie Gray unrest and tragic death showed.But we were able to save a lot of lives doing things that actually worked to improve police and community relations. The truth of the matter is, we created a civilian review board. And many of these things are in the new agenda for criminal justice reform that I\u2019ve put forward.We created a civilian review board, gave them their own detectives. We required the reporting of discourtesy, use of excessive force, lethal force. I repealed the possession of marijuana as a crime in our state.I drove our incarceration rate down to 20-year lows, and drove violent crime down to 30-year lows, and became the first governor south of the Mason-Dixon line to repeal the death penalty.I feel a responsibility every day to find things that work...(APPLAUSE)HOLT: All right. Let\u2019s talk...O\u2019MALLEY: ... and to do more of them to reform our criminal justice system.HOLT: Let\u2019s talk more about policing and the criminal justice system. Senator Sanders, a few times tonight we\u2019re going to hear from some of the most prominent voices on YouTube, starting with Franchesca Ramsey, who tackles racial stereotypes through her videos. Let\u2019s watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FRANCHESCA RAMSEY: Hey, I\u2019m Franchesca Ramsey. I believe there\u2019s a huge conflict of interest when local prosecutors investigate cases of police violence within their own communities.For example, last month, the officers involved in the case of 12- year-old Tamir Rice weren\u2019t indicted. How would your presidency ensure that incidents of police violence are investigated and prosecuted fairly?(END VIDEO CLIP)HOLT: Senator Sanders.SANDERS: I apologize for not hearing all of that question.HOLT: Would you like me to read it back to you?SANDERS: Yes.HOLT: Prosecutors \u2014 \u201cI believe there\u2019s a huge conflict of interest when local prosecutors investigate cases of police violence within their communities. Most recently, we saw this with a non- indictment of the officers involved in the case of 12-year-old Tamir Rice. How would you presidency ensure incidents of police violence are investigated and prosecuted fairly?\u201dSANDERS: Absolutely. This is a responsibility for the U.S. Justice Department to get involved. Whenever anybody in this country is killed while in police custody, it should automatically trigger a U.S. attorney general\u2019s investigation.(APPLAUSE)Second of all, and I speak as a mayor who worked very closely and well with police officers, the vast majority of whom are honest, hard- working people trying to do a difficult job, but let us be clear.If a police officer breaks the law, like any public official, that officer must be held accountable.(APPLAUSE)And thirdly, we have got to de-militarize our police departments so they don\u2019t look like occupying armies. We\u2019ve got to move toward community policing.And fourthly, we have got to make our police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Secretary Clinton, this question is for you. Tonight parts of America are in the grip of a deadly heroin epidemic, spanning race and class, hitting small towns and cities alike. It has become a major issue in this race.In a lot of places where you\u2019ve been campaigning, despite an estimated trillion dollars spent, many say the war on drugs has failed. So what would you do?CLINTON: Well, Lester, you\u2019re right. Everywhere I go to campaign, I\u2019m meeting families who are affected by the drug problem that mostly is opioids and heroin now, and lives are being lost and children are being orphaned. And I\u2019ve met a lot of grandparents who are now taking care of grandchildren.So I have tried to come out with a comprehensive approach that, number one, does tell the states that we will work with you from the federal government putting more money, about a billion dollars a year, to help states have a different approach to dealing with this epidemic.The policing needs to change. Police officers must be equipped with the antidote to a heroin overdose or an opioid overdose, known as Narcan. They should be able to administer it. So should firefighters and others.We have to move away from treating the use of drugs as a crime and instead, move it to where it belongs, as a health issue. And we need to divert more people from the criminal justice system into drug courts, into treatment, and recovery.HOLT: And that\u2019s time. CLINTON: So this is the kind of approach that we should take in dealing with what is now...HOLT: Senator...CLINTON: ... a growing epidemic.HOLT: Senator Sanders, would you like to respond?SANDERS: Sure. I agree...(APPLAUSE)I agree with everything the Secretary said, but let me just add this, there is a responsibility on the part of the pharmaceutical industry and the drug companies who are producing all of these drugs and not looking at the consequence of it.And second of all, when we talk about addiction being a disease, the Secretary is right, what that means is we need a revolution in this country in terms of mental health treatment. People should be able to get the treatment that they need when they need it, not two months from now, which is why I believe in universal...HOLT: That\u2019s...SANDERS: ... healthcare with mental health...HOLT: ... time.SANDERS: ... a part of that.HOLT: We\u2019re going to get into all that coming up.O\u2019MALLEY (?): Lester, just ten seconds.HOLT: But we\u2019re going to take a break and we need to take a break...O\u2019MALLEY (?): Just 10 seconds. All of the things...HOLT: ... and when we come back, the anger brewing in America.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HOLT: Welcome back to Charleston. Let\u2019s turn to another area where there has been fierce disagreement \u2014 that would be health care.Senator Sanders and Secretary Clinton, you both mentioned it in your 100-day priorities.Let\u2019s turn to my colleague, Andrea Mitchell now to lead that questioning.MITCHELL: Thank you, Lester.Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders favors what he calls \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d Now, you said that what he is proposing would tear up Obamacare and replace it.Secretary Clinton, is it fair to say to say that Bernie Sanders wants to kill Obamacare?CLINTON: Well, Andrea, I am absolutely committed to universal health care. I have worked on this for a long time, people may remember that I took on the health insurance industry back in the \u201990s, and I didn\u2019t quit until we got the children\u2019s health insurance program that ensures eight million kids.And I certainly respect Senator Sanders\u2019 intentions, but when you\u2019re talking about health care, the details really matter. And therefore, we have been raising questions about the nine bills that he introduced over 20 years, as to how they would work and what would be the impact on people\u2019s health care?He didn\u2019t like that, his campaign didn\u2019t like it either. And tonight, he\u2019s come out with a new health care plan. And again, we need to get into the details. But here\u2019s what I believe, the Democratic Party and the United States worked since Harry Truman to get the Affordable Care Act passed.We finally have a path to universal health care. We have accomplished so much already. I do not to want see the Republicans repeal it, and I don\u2019t to want see us start over again with a contentious debate. I want us to defend and build on the Affordable Care Act and improve it.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: OK.MITCHELL: Senator Sanders?SANDERS: Secretary \u2014 Secretary Clinton didn\u2019t answer your question.(LAUGHTER)Because what her campaign was saying \u2014 Bernie Sanders, who has fought for universal health care for my entire life, he wants to end Medicare, end Medicaid, end the children\u2019s health insurance program. That is nonsense.What a Medicare-for-all program does is finally provide in this country health care for every man, woman and child as a right. Now, the truth is, that Frank Delano Roosevelt, Harry Truman, do you know what they believed in? They believed that health care should be available to all of our people.I\u2019m on the committee that wrote the Affordable Care Act. I made the Affordable Care Act along with Jim Clyburn a better piece of legislation. I voted for it, but right now, what we have to deal with is the fact that 29 million people still have no health insurance. We are paying the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, getting ripped off.And here\u2019s the important point, we are spending far more per person on health care than the people of any other country. My proposal, provide health care to all people, get private insurance out of health insurance, lower the cost of health care for middle class families by 5,000 bucks.That\u2019s the vision we need to take.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: But \u2014 Senator Sanders, if I can...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: You know, I have to say I\u2019m not sure whether we\u2019re talking about the plan you just introduced tonight, or we\u2019re talking about the plan you introduced nine times in the Congress. But the fact is, we have the Affordable Care Act. That is one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party, and of our country.(APPLAUSE)And we have already seen 19 million Americans get insurance. We have seen the end of pre-existing conditions keeping people from getting insurance.(APPLAUSE)We have seen women no longer paying more for our insurance than men. And we have seen young people, up to the age of 26, being able to stay on their parent\u2019s policy.SANDERS: But \u2014 what if we have...CLINTON: Now, there are things we can do to improve it, but to tear it up and start over again, pushing our country back into that kind of a contentious debate, I think is the wrong direction.SANDERS: It is \u2014 it is absolutely inaccurate.O\u2019MALLEY: I have to talk about something that\u2019s actually working in our state.MITCHELL: Governor \u2014 Governor Sanders...SANDERS: No one is tearing this up, we\u2019re going to go forward. But with the secretary neglected to mention, not just the 29 million still have no health insurance, that even more are underinsured with huge copayments and deductibles.Tell me why we are spending almost three times more than the British, who guarantee health care to all of their people? Fifty percent more than the French, more than the Canadians. The vision from FDR and Harry Truman was health care for all people as a right in a cost-effective way.We\u2019re not going to tear up the Affordable Care Act. I helped write it. But we are going to move on top of that to a Medicaid-for- all system.O\u2019MALLEY: Andrea \u2014 Andrea \u2014 Andrea.(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)O\u2019MALLEY: Instead of \u2014 Andrea, I think, instead of attacking one another on health care, we should be talking about the things that are actually working.In our state, we have moved to an all-payer system. With the Affordable Care Act, we now have moved all of our acute care hospitals, that driver of cost at the center, away from fee-for- service.And actually to pay, we pay them based on how well they keep patients out of the hospital. How well they keep their patients. That\u2019s the future. We need to build on the Affordable Care Act, do the things that work, and reduce costs and increase access.(CROSSTALK)CLINTON: And that\u2019s exactly what we are able to do based on the foundation of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 what Governor O\u2019Malley just said is one of the models that we will be looking at to make sure we do get costs down, we do limit a lot of the unnecessary costs that we still have in the system.But, with all due respect, to start over again with a whole new debate is something that I think would set us back. The Republicans just voted last week to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and thank goodness, President Obama vetoed it and saved Obamacare for the American people.(APPLAUSE)MITCHELL: Senator Sanders, let me ask you this, though...SANDERS: Yeah.MITCHELL: ... you\u2019ve talked about Medicare for all...SANDERS: Yes.MITCHELL: .. and tonight you\u2019ve released a very detailed plan, just two... SANDERS: Not all that detailed.MITCHELL: ... well, two hours before the debate, you did.SANDERS: Well.MITCHELL: But let me ask you about Vermont. Because in Vermont \u2014 you tried in the state of Vermont, and Vermont walked away from this kind of idea, of \u2014 of Medicare for all, single-payer, because they concluded it would require major tax increases...SANDERS: Well, that\u2019s \u2014 you might want to ask...MITCHELL: ... and by some estimates, it would double the budget. If you couldn\u2019t sell it in Vermont, Senator...SANDERS: Andrea, let me just say this.MITCHELL: ... how can you sell it to the country?SANDERS: Let me just say that you might want to ask the governor of the state of Vermont why he could not do it. I\u2019m not the governor. I\u2019m the senator from the state of Vermont.(LAUGHTER)But second of all \u2014 second of all...(APPLAUSE)... here is what the real point is, in terms of all of the issues you\u2019ve raised \u2014 the good questions you\u2019ve raised. You know what it all comes down to?Do you know why we can\u2019t do what every other country \u2014 major country on Earth is doing? It\u2019s because we have a campaign finance system that is corrupt, we have super PACs, we have the pharmaceutical industry pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into campaign contributions and lobbying, and the private insurance companies as well.What this is really about is not the rational way to go forward \u2014 it\u2019s Medicare for all \u2014 it is whether we have the guts to stand up to the private insurance companies and all of their money, and the pharmaceutical industry. That\u2019s what this debate should be about.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Well, as someone who \u2014 as someone who has a little bit of experience standing up to the health insurance industry, that spent, you know...(APPLAUSE)... many, many millions of dollars attacking me, and probably will so again, because of what I believe we can do building on the Affordable Care Act, I think it\u2019s important to point out that there are a lot of reasons we have the health care system we have today.I know how much money influences the political decision-making. That\u2019s why I\u2019m for huge campaign finance reform. However, we started a system that had private health insurance.And even during the Affordable Care Act debate, there was an opportunity to vote for what was called the public option. In other words, people could buy in to Medicare, and even when the Democrats were in charge of the Congress, we couldn\u2019t get the votes for that.So, what I\u2019m saying is really simple. This has been the fight of the Democratic Party for decades. We have the Affordable Care Act. Let\u2019s make it work.Let\u2019s take the models that states are doing. We now have driven costs down to the lowest they\u2019ve been in 50 years. Now we\u2019ve got to get individual costs down. That\u2019s what I\u2019m planning to do.HOLT: And that\u2019s time (ph). We\u2019re gonna take a turn now.Secretary Clinton, in his final State of the Union address, President Obama said his biggest regret was his inability to bring the country together. If President Obama couldn\u2019t do it, how will you?O\u2019MALLEY: Great question.CLINTON: Well, I think it\u2019s an important point the president made in his State of the Union. And here\u2019s what I would say. I will go anywhere, to meet with anyone, at any time to find common ground.That\u2019s what I did as a first lady, when I worked with both Democrats and Republicans to get the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, when I worked with Tom DeLay, one of the most partisan of Republicans, to reform the adoption and foster care system.What I did, working in the Senate, where I crossed the aisle often, working even with the senator from South Carolina, Lindsey Graham, to get Tricare for national guardsmen and women.And it\u2019s what I did as Secretary of State, on numerous occasions, and most particularly, rounding up two-thirds votes in order to pass a treaty that lowered the nuclear weapons in both Russia and the United States. CLINTON: So I know it\u2019s hard, but I also know you\u2019ve got to work at it every single day. I look out here, I see a lot of my friends from the Congress. And I know that they work at it every single day.Because maybe you can\u2019t only find a little sliver of common ground to cooperate with somebody from the other party, but who knows. If you\u2019re successful there, maybe you can build even more. That\u2019s what I would do.HOLT: That\u2019s time. Senator Sanders, response.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: A couple of years ago, when we understood that veterans were not getting the quality care they needed in the timely manner, I worked with folks like John McCain and others to pass the most comprehensive veteran\u2019s health care legislation in modern history.But let me rephrase your question because I think, in all do respect, you\u2019re expression. In all do respect, you\u2019re missing the main point. And the main point in the Congress, it\u2019s not the Republicans and Democrats hate each other.That\u2019s a mythology from the media. The real issue is that Congress is owned by big money and refuses to do what the American people want them to do.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: The real issue is that in area after area, raising the minimum wage to $15 bucks an hour. The American people want it. Rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, creating 13 million jobs, the American people want it. The pay equity for women, the American people want it. Demanding that the wealthy start paying their fair share of taxes. The American people want it.HOLT: That\u2019s time. But let me continue with the...SANDERS: The point is, we have to make Congress respond to the needs of the people, not big money.HOLT: Senator Sanders, let me continue, you call yourself a Democratic socialist...SANDERS: I do. HOLT: And throughout your career in politics, you\u2019ve been critical of the Democratic party, you\u2019ve been saying in a book you wrote, quote, \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a hell of a big difference between the the two major parties.\u201d How would you will a general election...SANDERS: Did I say that?HOLT: How will you win a general election labeling yourself a democratic socialist?SANDERS: Because of what I believe in what I was just saying. The Democratic party needs major reform. To those of you in South Carolina, you know what, in Mississippi, we need a 50-state strategy so that people in South Carolina and Mississippi can get the resources that they need.Instead of being dependent on super PACs, what we need is to be dependent on small, individual campaign contributors. We need an agenda that speaks to the needs of working families and low-income people. Not wealthy campaign contributors.HOLT: Yes, but senator, you can...SANDERS: We need to expand what the input into the Democratic party. I am very proud that in this campaign, we have seen an enormous amount of excitement from young people, from working people. We have received more individual contributions than any candidate in the history of this country up to this point.(APPLAUSE)O\u2019MALLEY: Yes, but senator you never came to campaign for Vincent Sheheen when he was running for governor. In fact, neither of you came to campaign for Vincent Sheheen when he was running for governor.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: We can talk all we want about wanting to build a stronger Democratic party, but Lester, the question you answered, it\u2019s no laughing matter.The most recurring question I get when I stand on the chair all across Iowa and talk with my neighbors is, how are you going to heal the divisions and the wounds in our country? This is the biggest challenge we face as a people.All my life, I brought people together over deep divides and very old wounds, and that\u2019s what we need now in a new leader. We cannot keep talking past each other, declaring all Republicans are our enemies or the war is all about being against millionaires or billionaires, or it\u2019s all against American Muslims, all against immigrants.Look, as Frederick Douglas said, we are one, our cause is one, and we must help each other if we are going to succeed. HOLT: And that is right.SANDERS: And I respectfully disagree.HOLT: Secretary Clinton, our next question is for you. Here\u2019s another quantitative problem.The New York Times will be checking assertions made throughout the 2016 presidential campaign.SANDERS: And I respectfully disagree with my friend over here. And that is, you are right. All of us have denounced Trump\u2019s attempts to divide this country: the anti-Latino rhetoric, the racist rhetoric, he anti-Muslim rhetoric.But where I disagree with you, Governor O\u2019Malley, is I do believe we have to deal with the fundamental issues of a handful of billionaires...O\u2019MALLEY: I agree with that.SANDERS: ... who control economic and political life of this country.O\u2019MALLEY: I agree.SANDERS: Nothing real will get happened. Unless we have a political revolution. Where millions of people finally stand up.HOLT: And we\u2019re going to get into that coming up. But Secretary Clinton, here\u2019s a question from YouTube. It\u2019s from a young video blogger who has over 5 million subscribers. He has a question about the importance of younger voters.FRANTA: Hi, I\u2019m Connor Franta, I\u2019m 23 and my audience is around the same age. Getting my generation to vote should be a priority for any presidential candidate.Now I know Senator Sanders is pretty popular among my peers, but what I want to know is, how are all of you planning on engaging us further in this election?HOLT: Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Well thanks for the question and congratulations on five million viewers on YouTube, that\u2019s quite an accomplishment. Look, this election is mostly about the future and therefore it is of greatest urgency for young people.I\u2019ve laid out my ideas about what we can do to make college affordable; how we can help people pay off their student debts and save thousands of dollars, how we can create more good jobs because a lot of the young people that I talk with are pretty disappointed the economic prospects they feel their facing. So making community college free, making it possible to attend a public college or university with debt free tuition, looking for ways to protect our rights especially from the concerted Republican assault; on voting rights, on women\u2019s rights, on gay rights, on civil rights, on workers rights.And I know how much young people value their independence, their autonomy, and their rights. So I think this is an election where we have to pull young people and older people together to have a strategy about how we\u2019re going to encourage even more American\u2019s to vote because it absolutely clear to me...HOLT: That\u2019s time...CLINTON: That turning over our White House to the Republicans would be bad for everybody especially young people.HOLT: A quick follow up \u2014 a thirty second follow up.Why is Senator Sanders beating you to 2 to 1 among younger votes?CLINTON: Look, I have the greatest respect for Senator Sanders and for his supports and I\u2019m going to keep working as hard as I can to reach as many people of all ages about what I will do, what the experience and the ideas that I have that I will bring to the White House and I hope to have their support when I\u2019m the Democratic nominee.HOLT: We\u2019re going to take...SANDERS: Is that your strategy...HOLT: We\u2019re going to take a break. When we come back; big banks, big business and big differences among the three candidates on the American Economy. We\u2019ll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HOLT: Welcome back from Charleston. Let\u2019s turn now to the economy.Senator Sanders, you released a tough new ad last week in which without mentioning Secretary Clinton by name, you talk about two Democratic visions for regulating Wall Street. \u201cOne says it\u2019s OK to take millions from big banks and tell them what to do. My plan, break up the big banks, close the tax loopholes and make them pay their fair share.\u201dWhat do you see as the difference between what you would do about the banks and what Secretary Clinton would do?SANDERS: Well, the first difference is I don\u2019t take money from big banks. I don\u2019t get personal speaking fees from Goldman Sachs. What I would do...(APPLAUSE)What I would do is understand that when you have three out of the four largest banks today, bigger than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have the six largest financial institutions having assets of 60 percent of the GDP of America, it is very clear to me what you have to do.You\u2019ve got to bring back the 21st century Glass-Steagall legislation and you\u2019ve got to break up these huge financial institutions. They have too much economic power and they have too much financial power over our entire economy. If Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, the old Republican trust buster, what he would say is these guys are too powerful. Break them up. I believe that\u2019s what the American people to want see. That\u2019s my view.HOLT: Secretary Clinton, help the voter understand the daylight between the two of you here.CLINTON: Well, there\u2019s no daylight on the basic premise that there should be no bank too big to fail and no individual too powerful to jail. We agree on that. But where we disagree is the comments that Senator Sanders has made that don\u2019t just affect me, I can take that, but he\u2019s criticized President Obama for taking donations from Wall Street, and President Obama has led our country out of the great recession. Senator Sanders called him weak, disappointing. He even, in 2011, publicly sought someone to run in a primary against President Obama. Now, I personally believe that President Obama\u2019s work to push through the Dodd-Frank...(LAUGHTER)The Dodd-Frank bill and then to sign it was one of the most important regulatory schemes we\u2019ve had since the 1930s. So I\u2019m going to defend Dodd-Frank and I\u2019m going to defend President Obama for taking on Wall Street, taking on the financial industry and getting results.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: OK. First of all...HOLT: Senator Sanders, your response.SANDERS: Set the record right. In 2006 when I ran for the Senate, Senator Barack Obama was kind enough to campaign for me, 2008, I did my best to see that he was elected and in 2012, I worked as hard as I could to see that he was reelected. He and I are friends. We\u2019ve worked together on many issues. We have some differences of opinion.But here is the issue, Secretary touched on it, can you really reform Wall Street when they are spending millions and millions of dollars on campaign contributions and when they are providing speaker fees to individuals? So it\u2019s easy to say, well, I\u2019m going to do this and do that, but I have doubts when people receive huge amounts of money from Wall Street. SANDERS: I am very proud, I do not have a super PAC. I do not want Wall Street\u2019s money. I\u2019ll rely on the middle class and working families...HOLT: That\u2019s time.Governor O\u2019Malley...(CROSSTALK)SANDERS: ... campaign contributions.HOLT: I have a question for you...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: You know, I think since \u2014 since Senator Standers followed up on this...HOLT: Thirty-second response.CLINTON: Your profusion of comments about your feelings towards President Obama are a little strange given what you said about him in 2011.But look, I have a plan that most commentators have said is tougher, more effective, and more comprehensive.O\u2019MALLEY: That\u2019s not true.CLINTON: It builds on the Dodd-Frank \u2014 yes, it is. It builds on the Dodd-Frank, regulatory scheme...O\u2019MALLEY: It\u2019s just not true.CLINTON: ... but it goes much further, because...O\u2019MALLEY: Oh, come on.CLINTON: ... both the governor and the senator have focused only on the big banks. Lehman Brothers, AIG, the shadow banking sector were as big a problem in what caused the Great Recession, I go after them.And I can tell you that the hedge fund billionaires who are running ads against me right now, and Karl Rove, who started running an ad against me right now, funded by money from the financial services sector, sure thing, I\u2019m the one they don\u2019t want to be up against.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Governor O\u2019Malley.O\u2019MALLEY: Yes, thank you. Yes, Lester, what Secretary Clinton just said is actually not true. What \u2014 I have put forward a plan that would actually put cops back on the beat of Wall Street. I have put forward a plan that was heralded as very comprehensive and realistic.Look, if a bank robber robs a bank and all you do is slap him on the wrist, he\u2019s just going to keep robbing banks again. The same thing is true with people in suits.Secretary Clinton, I have a tremendous amount of respect for you, but for you to say there\u2019s no daylight on this between the three of us is also not true. I support reinstituting a modern version of Glass- Steagall that would include going after the shadow banks, requiring capital requirements that would force them to no longer put us on the hook for these sorts of things.In prior debates I\u2019ve heard you even bring up \u2014 I mean, now you bring up President Obama here in South Carolina in defense of the fact of your cozy relationship with Wall Street.In an earlier debate, I heard you bring up even the 9/11 victims to defend it. The truth of the matter is, Secretary Clinton, you do not go as far as reining in Wall Street as I would.And the fact of the matter is, the people of America deserve to have a president that\u2019s on their side, protecting the main street economy from excesses on Wall Street. And we\u2019re just as vulnerable today.HOLT: Secretary Clinton, 30-second response.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Yes, well, first of all \u2014 first of all, Paul Krugman, Barney Frank, others have all endorsed my plan. Secondly, we have Dodd-Frank. It gives us the authority already to break up big banks that pose...O\u2019MALLEY: And we have never used it.CLINTON: That pose a risk to the financial sector. I want to go further and add to that.And, you know, Governor, you have raised money on Wall Street. You raised a lot of money on Wall Street when you were the head of the Democratic Governor\u2019s Association...O\u2019MALLEY: Yes, but I haven\u2019t gotten a penny this year... CLINTON: And you were...O\u2019MALLEY: ... so somebody please, go on to martinomalley.com...(LAUGHTER)O\u2019MALLEY: Go on to martinomalley.com, send me your checks. They\u2019re not giving me \u2014 zero.CLINTON: Yes, well, the point is that if we\u2019re going to be serious about this and not just try to score political points, we should know what\u2019s in Dodd-Frank, and what\u2019s in Dodd-Frank already gives the president the authority...(CROSSTALK)CLINTON: ... with his regulators to make those decisions.SANDERS: Let me give you an example of how corrupt \u2014 how corrupt this system is. Goldman Sachs recently fined $5 billion. Goldman Sachs has given this country two secretaries of treasury, one on the Republicans, one under Democrats.O\u2019MALLEY: Say it.SANDERS: The leader of Goldman Sachs is a billionaire who comes to Congress and tells us we should cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.Secretary Clinton \u2014 and you\u2019re not the only one, so I don\u2019t mean to just point the finger at you, you\u2019ve received over $600,000 in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs in one year.I find it very strange that a major financial institution that pays $5 billion in fines for breaking the law, not one of their executives is prosecuted, while kids who smoke marijuana get a jail sentence.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: That\u2019s time.Andrea.CLINTON: Well, the last point on this is, Senator Sanders, you\u2019re the only one on this stage that voted to deregulate the financial market in 2000, to take the cops off the street, to use Governor O\u2019Malley\u2019s phrase, to make the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission no longer able to regulate swaps and derivatives, which were one of the main cause of the collapse in \u201908.So there\u2019s plenty...SANDERS: If you want to...CLINTON: There\u2019s plenty of problems that we all have to face together.And the final thing I would say, we\u2019re at least having a vigorous debate about reining in Wall Street...HOLT: ... Senator...CLINTON: ... The Republicans want to give them more power, and repeal Dodd-Frank. That\u2019s what we need to stop...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Anyone who wants to check my record in taking on Wall Street, in fighting against the deregulation of Wall Street when Wall Street put billions of dollars in lobbying, in campaign contributions to get the government off their backs. They got the government off their backs.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.Turns out that they were crooks, and they destroyed our economy. I think it\u2019s time to put the government back on their backs.(APPLAUSE)MITCHELL: Senator Sanders \u2014 Senator Sanders, you\u2019ve talked a lot about things you want to do. You want free education for everyone, you want the Federal Minimum Wage raised to $15 an hour. You want to expand Social Security...SANDERS: ... Yeah...MITCHELL: ... benefits. You\u2019ve been specific about what you want, but let\u2019s talk about how to pay for all this. You now said that you would raise taxes today, two hours or so ago, you said you would raise taxes to pay for your health care plan. You haven\u2019t been specific about how to pay for the other things...SANDERS: ... That\u2019s true.MITCHELL: ... Will you tell us tonight?SANDERS: Good. You\u2019re right. I want to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, create 13 million jobs. We do that by doing away with the absurd loophole that now allows major profitable corporations to stash their money in the Cayman (ph) Islands, and not in some years, pay a nickel in taxes. Yes, I do. I plead guilty. I want every kid in this country who has the ability to be able to go to a public college, or university, tuition free. And, by the way, I want to substantially lower student debt interest rates in this country as well.How do I pay for it?(APPLAUSE)I pay for it through a tax on Wall Street speculation. This country, and the middle class, bailed out Wall Street. Now, it is Wall Street\u2019s time to help the middle class. In fact...O\u2019MALLEY: (inaudible)SANDERS: ... we have documented, unlike Secretary Clinton, I have documented exactly how I would pay for our ambitious agenda.O\u2019MALLEY: Andrea...MITCHELL: ... OK...O\u2019MALLEY: ... The only person on this stage who has...MITCHELL: ... Secretary Clinton, you mentioned earlier \u2014 Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond?CLINTON: Well, I have actually documented every way that I\u2019m going to pay for what I\u2019m doing because I think the American public deserves to know. And, you can go to my website and actually see that.But, there are serious questions about how we\u2019re going to pay for what we want to see our country do. And, I\u2019m the only candidate standing here tonight who has said I will not raise taxes on the middle class. I want to raise incomes, not taxes, and I\u2019m going to do everything I can to make sure that the wealthy pay for debt free tuition, for child care, for paid family leave. To help us bring down student debt we\u2019re going to refinance that student debt, saving kids thousands of dollars.Yeah, and that will also come out of the \u2014 some of the pockets of people in the financial services industry...MITCHELL: OK, we\u2019re out of time. Senator Sanders,CLINTON: But I will tell you exactly how I pay for everything I\u2019ve proposed...(CROSSTALK)MITCHELL: Senator Sanders...SANDERS: ... Here is the main two points...MITCHELL: ... Senator Sanders, let me ask you a question about taxes. SANDERS: Yeah.MITCHELL: The most googled political issue...SANDERS: ... I got it.MITCHELL: In the last month was taxes. Now, in your healthcare plan, the plan you released tonight, you would not only raise taxes on the wealthy, but the details you released indicate you would raise taxes on the middle class also. Is that correct?SANDERS: What is correct, and I\u2019m disappointed that Secretary Clinton\u2019s campaign has made this criticism. It\u2019s a Republican criticism. Secretary Clinton does know a lot about healthcare, and she understands, I believe, that a medicare for all, single payer program will substantially lower the cost of healthcare for middle class families. So, what we have got to acknowledge, and I hope the Secretary does, is we are doing away with private health insurance premiums.So, instead of paying $10,000 dollars to Blue Cross, or Blue Shield, yes, some middle class families would be paying slightly more in taxes, but the result would be that that middle class family would be saving some $5,000 dollars in healthcare costs. A little bit more in taxes, do away with private health insurance premiums. It\u2019s a pretty good deal.(APPLAUSE)MITCHELL: Senator \u2014 Senator, let me just follow up on that.SANDERS: Yeah.MITCHELL: On Meet the Press on December 20th, you said that you would only raise taxes on the middle class to pay for family leave. And, having said that, now you say you\u2019re going to raise middle class taxes to pay for healthcare as well. Is that breaking your word?SANDERS: No, it is not breaking my word. When you are \u2014 it\u2019s one thing to say I\u2019m raising taxes, it\u2019s another thing to say that we are doing away with private health insurance premiums.SANDERS: So, if I save you $10,000 in private health insurance, and you pay a little bit more in taxes in total, there are huge savings in what your family is spending.O\u2019MALLEY: Senator, I\u2019m the only person on this stage that\u2019s actually balanced a budget every year for 15 years.SANDERS: I was mayor for eight years, I did that as well.(LAUGHTER)O\u2019MALLEY: OK. So, that was eight years. Yes. And Senator, but I actually did it during a budget down time \u2014 I mean, during a recession.And Andrea, the \u2014 I had to make more cuts than any governor in the history of Maryland, but we invested more in infrastructure, more in transportation. We made our public schools more in America more than five years in a row, and went four years in a row without a penny\u2019s increase to college tuition.The things that we need to do in our country, like debt-free college in the next five years, like making universal \u2014 like making national service a universal option in order to cut youth unemployment in half in the next three years, all these things can be done if we eliminate one entitlement we can no longer afford as a nation.And that is the wealthy among us, those making more than a million dollars, feel that they are entitled to paying a much lower marginal tax rate than was usual for the better part of these 80 years.And if we tax earnings from investments on money \u2014 namely capital gains \u2014 at the same rate as we tax sweat and hard work and toil, we can make the investments we need to make to make our country better.HOLT: We have got a lot to ground to cover here.Many Democratic voters are passionate about the need to do something to combat the threat of climate change, including the team of scientists from Youtube\u2019s MinuteEarth channel.Here\u2019s their take.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANNOUNCER: Hello from MinuteEarth. Fossil fuels have long kept our cars moving and our light bulbs lit.But we know that burning these fuels releases heat-trapping gases that are warming the planet, causing seas to rise and contributing to extreme weather events, like South Carolina\u2019s devastating flooding last year.Fighting human-caused climate change means giving up our global addiction to fossil fuels and shifting the bulk of the world\u2019s energy supply to alternative sources.Some countries have acted decisively to make this transition. But here at home, we still get a whooping 82 percent of our energy from coal, oil, and natural gas.In the U.S., political gridlock, pressure from industry lobbyists and insufficient R&D have made an already tough battle against climate change even tougher.(END VIDEO CLIP)HOLT: Senator Sanders, Americans love their SUVs, which spiked in sales last year as gas prices plummeted.How do you convince Americans that the problem of climate change is so urgent that they need to change their behavior?SANDERS: I think we already are. Younger generation understands it instinctively.I was home in Burlington, Vermont, on Christmas Eve, the temperature was 65 degrees. People in Vermont know what\u2019s going on. People who did ice fishing, where their ice is no longer there on the lake understand what\u2019s going on.I\u2019m on both the Environmental and Energy Committees. The debate is over. Climate change is real. It is already causing major problems. And if we do not act boldly and decisively, a bad situation will become worse.It is amazing to me, and I think we\u2019ll have agreement on this up here, that we have a major party, called the Republican Party that is so owned by the fossil fuel industry and their campaign contributions that they don\u2019t even have the courage, the decency to listen to the scientists.(APPLAUSE)It is beyond my comprehension how we can elect a president of the United States, somebody like Trump, who believes that climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese.(LAUGHTER)Bottom line is, we need to be bold and decisive, we can create millions of jobs. We must, for the sake of our kids and grandchildren, transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.I\u2019ve got the most comprehensive legislation in the Senate to do that. And as president, I will fight to make that happen.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Governor O\u2019Malley, 30 seconds.O\u2019MALLEY: Thank you.Lester, on this stage tonight, this Democratic stage, where we actually believe in science.(LAUGHTER)I would like to challenge and invite my colleagues here on this stage to join me in putting forward a plan to move us to a 100 percent clean, electric energy grid by 2050. It can be done.(APPLAUSE)With solar, with wind, with new technologies, with green buildings, this can happen, but in all \u2014 President Obama made us more energy independent, but in all of the above strategy didn\u2019t land us on the moon, we need American ingenuity and we need to reach by 2050 for the sake of our kids.HOLT: That\u2019s time. We\u2019re going to take a break.CLINTON: And let me...HOLT: When we return, the late-breaking developments regarding Iran. The threat of ISIS now more real than ever on U.S. soil. Americans in fear and hearing few good answers.We\u2019ll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)TODD: And we are back. I\u2019m Chuck Todd. We are just past the halfway mark in our NBC News YouTube Democratic Candidates Debate. Boy, this is one that has actually lived up to the billing.We\u2019ve seen some sharp exchanges on guns, health care and Wall Street \u2014 the debate, you could argue, that has been largely focused on all things Bernie Sanders.He was on the defensive early, Hillary Clinton getting, I think, some control on the gun issue. But on health care and on Wall Street reform, it was Hillary Clinton on the defensive, and was a very aggressive Bernie Sanders.One thing of note here: Bernie Sanders very much being the sort of revolutionary candidate, major change, and you\u2019ve heard a lot of Hillary Clinton saying things like she wants to build on the things that President Obama did, wrapping herself in President Obama.Let\u2019s go back downstairs and check in with our moderators, Lester and Andrea. So what\u2019s coming up next, guys?HOLT: Well, we\u2019ve covered a lot of ground already, but we\u2019re gonna be talking about ISIS. A threat to America, it\u2019s \u2014 always polls as one of the top concerns of Americans. And also some more late-breaking news.MITCHELL: We have all the news that has happened from Iran and the president\u2019s comments today, as well as what this means going forward for the War on Terror. What do we expect from Iran, and also what\u2019s happening in Syria? So a lot of foreign policy coming up.HOLT: A lot of debate to come. We\u2019ll be back in Charleston after this.TODD: You\u2019ve got it. Well, it\u2019s the commander-in-chief test \u2014 that\u2019s what\u2019s next. Stay with us \u2014 the debate resumes right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HOLT: Charleston, Andrea Mitchell has questions now starting with Iran.MITCHELL: Thank you Lester.Senator Sanders, the nuclear deal is now enforced. Iran is getting it\u2019s billions of dollars, several Americans who have been held are now going to be heading home. The president said today, \u201cit\u2019s a good day. It\u2019s a good day for diplomacy. It\u2019s a time now to restore diplomatic relations for the first time since 1979 and actually re- opened a U.S. Embassy in Tehran.\u201dSANDERS: I think what we\u2019ve got to do is move as aggressively as we can to normalize relations with Iran. Understanding that Iran\u2019s behavior in so many ways is something that we disagree with; their support terrorism, the anti-American rhetoric that we\u2019re hearing from of their leadership is something that is not acceptable.History suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.On the other hand, the fact that we\u2019ve managed to reach an agreement, something that I\u2019ve very strongly supported that prevents Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and we did that without going to war. And that I believe we\u2019re seeing a fall in our relationships with Iran is a very positive step. So if your question is, do I want to see that relationship become more positive in the future? Yes.Can I tell that we should open an embassy in Tehran tomorrow? No, I don\u2019t think we should. But I think the goal has go to be as we\u2019ve done with Cuba, to move in warm relations with a very powerful and important country in this world.MITCHELL: Your response Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, I\u2019m very proud of the Iran Nuclear Agreement. I was very pleased to be part of what the president put into action when he took office. I was responsible for getting those sanctions imposed which put the pressure on Iran. It brought them to the negotiating table which resulted in this agreement.And so, they have been so far, following their requirements under the agreement. But I think we still have to carefully watch them. We\u2019ve had one good day over 36 year and I think we need more good days before we move more rapidly toward any kind of normalization. And we have to be sure that they are truly going to implement the agreement. And then, we have to go after them on a lot of their other bad behavior in the region which is causing enormous problems in Syria, Yemen, Iraq and elsewhere.MITCHELL: You mentioned Syria. Let me ask you about Syria, all of you. Let\u2019s turn to Syria and the civil war that has been raging there. Are there any circumstances in which you could see deploying significant numbers of ground forces in Syria, not just specials forces but significant ground forces to combat ISIS in a direct combat role?Let me start with you Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Absolutely not.I have a three point plan that does not include American Ground forces. It includes the United States leading an air coalition which is what we\u2019re doing, supporting fighters on the ground; the Iraqi Army which is beginning to show more ability, the Sunni fighters that we are now helping to reconstitute and Kurdish on both sides of the border.I think we also have try to disrupt their supply chain of foreign fighters and foreign money and we do have to contest them in online space. So I\u2019m very committed to both going after ISIS but also supporting what Secretary Kerry is doing to try to move on a political diplomatic to try to begin to slow down and hopefully end the carnage in Syria which is the root of so many of the problems that we seen in the region and beyond.MITCHELL: Senator Sanders, ground forces yes or no? SANDERS: As everybody you know, this is incredibly complicated and difficult issue and I applaud. I know President Obama\u2019s been getting a lot of criticism on this. I think he is doing the right thing.What the nightmare is, which many of my Republican colleagues appear to want is to not have learned the lesson of Iraq. To get American young men and women involved in perpetual warfare in the quagmire of Syria and the Middle East would be an unmitigated disaster that as president, I will do everything in my power to avoid.O\u2019MALLEY: Andrea...MITCHELL: Governor O\u2019Malley?SANDERS: We should \u2014 we should learn \u2014 we should learn from King Abdullah of Jordan, one of the few heroes in a very unheroic place. And what Abdullah said is this is a war with a soul of Islam and that Muslim troops should be on the ground with our support and the support of other major countries. That is how we destroy ISIS, not with American troops in perpetual warfare.MITCHELL: Governor O\u2019Malley.O\u2019MALLEY: Thank you.(APPLAUSE)Andrea, governors have led us to victory in two world wars by doing what America does best, and that is by joining forces with others by acting in coalition. And I believe that President Obama is doing the right thing in this case.We need to learn the lessons from the past. We do need to provide the special \u2014 special ops advisers, we need \u2014 do need to provide the technical support, but over the long-term, we need to develop new alliances. We need a much more proactive national security strategy that reduces these threats before they rise to a level where it feels like we need to pull for a division of marines.And I also want to add one other thing here. I appreciate the fact that in our debate, we don\u2019t use the term you hear Republicans throwing around trying to look all vibrato (ph) and macho sending other kids \u2014 kids into combat, they keep using the term boots on the ground. A woman in Burlington, Iowa said to me, \u201cGovernor, when you\u2019re with your colleagues, please don\u2019t refer to my son who has served two tours of duty in Iraq as a pair of boots on the ground.\u201d Now, we need to be mindful of learning the lessons of the past.(APPLAUSE)MITCHELL: I have a question. I have a question for Senator Sanders. Did the policies of the Obama administration, in which Secretary Clinton of course was a part, create a vacuum in Iraq and Syria that helped ISIS grow?SANDERS: No. I think the vacuum was created by the disastrous war in Iraq, which I vigorously opposed. Not only did I vote against it, I helped lead the opposition. And what happened there is yes, it\u2019s easy to get rid of a two-bit dictator like Saddam Hussein, but there wasn\u2019t the kind of thought as to what happens the day after you get him and what kind of political vacuum occurs. And who rises up? Groups like ISIS.So I think that President Obama made a promise to the American people when he ran, and he said you know what, I\u2019m going to do my best to bring American troops home. And I supported what he did. Our job is to train and provide military support for Muslim countries in the area who are prepared to take on ISIS.And one point I want to make here that is not made very often, you have incredibly wealthy countries in that region, countries like Saudi Arabia, countries like Qatar. Qatar happens to be the largest \u2014 wealthiest country per capita in the world. They have got to start putting in some skin in the game and not just ask the United States to do it.(APPLAUSE)MITCHELL: Secretary Clinton, I want to talk to you about red lines, because former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said in a recent interview that President Obama\u2019s decision to stand down on planned missile strikes against Damascus after Assad had used chemical weapons hurt the president\u2019s credibility. Should the president have stuck to his red line once he drew it?CLINTON: Look, I think that the president\u2019s decision to go after the chemical weapons once there was a potential opportunity to build on when the Russians opened that door resulted in a very positive outcome. We were able to get the chemical weapons out.I know from my own experience as secretary of State that we were deeply worried about Assad\u2019s forces using chemical weapons because it would have had not only a horrific affect on people in Syria, but it could very well have affected the surrounding states, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, Turkey. So getting those chemical weapons out was a big deal, but...MITCHELL: But should he \u2014 should he have stuck to his...CLINTON: Well \u2014 but \u2014 but...MITCHELL: ... line? Did it hurt U.S. credibility? CLINTON: I think, as commander in chief, you\u2019ve got to constantly be evaluating the decisions you have to make. I know a little bit about this, having spent many hours in the situation room, advising President Obama.And I want to just add to something that Senator Sanders said, the United States had a very big interest in trying to help stabilize the region. If there is any blame to be spread around, it starts with the prime minister of Iraq, who sectarianized his military, setting Shia against Sunni.It is amplified by Assad, who has waged one of the bloodiest, most terrible attacks on his own people: 250,000-plus dead, millions fleeing. Causing this vacuum that has been filled unfortunately, by terrorist groups, including ISIS.So, I think we are in the midst of great turmoil in this region. We have a proxy conflict going on between Saudi Arabia and Iran. You know, one of the criticisms I\u2019ve had of Senator Sanders is his suggestion that, you know, Iranian troops be used to try to end the war in Syria...MITCHELL: Your time is up.CLINTON: ... and go after ISIS, which I don\u2019t think would be a good idea.SANDERS: Let me just...MITCHELL: Senator....CLINTON: But overall, a lot of the forces at work in the region are ones that we cannot directly influence, but we can...MITCHELL: You\u2019re out of time.SANDERS: OK. Let me suggest...(CROSSTALK)MITCHELL: Senator Sanders.SANDERS: Where Secretary Clinton and I think, I agree with most of what she said. But where I think we do have an honest disagreement, is that in the incredible quagmire of Syria, where it\u2019s hard to know who\u2019s fighting who and if you give arms to this guy, it may end up in ISIS\u2019 hand the next day. We all know that.And we all know, no argument, the secretary is absolutely right, Assad is a butcher of his own people, man using chemical weapons against his own people. This is beyond disgusting.But I think in terms of our priorities in the region, our first priority must be the destruction of ISIS. Our second priority must be getting rid of Assad, through some political settlement, working with Iran, working with Russia.But the immediate task is to bring all interests together who want to destroy ISIS, including Russia, including Iran, including our Muslim allies to make that the major priority.O\u2019MALLEY: But in all of that senator and secretary, I think we\u2019re leaving out something very important here. And that is that we still don\u2019t have the human intelligence: overt, in terms of diplomatic intelligence or covert, to understand even what the heck happens as the secondary and tertiary effects of some of these things.We are walking through this region, Andrea, without the human intelligence that we need. And we need to make a renewed investment as a country in bringing up a new generation of foreign service officers, and bringing up a new generation of business people and actually understanding and having relationships in these places.So we have a better sense of what the heck happens after a dictator topples and can take action to prevent another safe haven and another iteration of terror.MITCHELL: Your time is us. Lester.HOLT: Senator Sanders mentioned Russia a moment ago. Secretary Clinton, you famously handed Russia\u2019s foreign minister a reset button in 2009. Since then, Russia has annexed Crimea, fomented a war in Ukraine, provided weapons that downed an airliner and launched operations, as we just did discuss, to support Assad in Syria. As president, would you hand Vladimir Putin a reset button?CLINTON: Well, it would depend on what I got for it and I can tell you what we got in the first term, we got a new start treaty to reduce nuclear weapons between the United States and Russia. We got permission to resupply our troops in Afghanistan by traveling across Russia.We got Russia to sign on to our sanctions against Iran and other very important commitments. So look, in diplomacy, you are always trying to see how you can figure out the interest of the other to see if there isn\u2019t some way you can advance your security and your values.When Putin came back in the fall of 2011, it was very clear he came back with a mission. And I began speaking out as soon as that happened because there were some fraudulent elections held, and Russians poured out into the streets to demand their freedom, and he cracked down. And in fact, accused me of fomenting it. So we now know that he has a mixed record to say the least and we have to figure out how to deal with him.HOLT: What\u2019s your relationship with him?CLINTON: Well, my relationship with him, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s interesting.(LAUGHTER)It\u2019s one, I think, of respect. We\u2019ve had some very tough dealings with one another. And I know that he\u2019s someone that you have to continuingly stand up to because, like many bullies, he is somebody who will take as much as he possibly can unless you do.And we need to get the Europeans to be more willing to stand up, I was pleased they put sanctions on after Crimea and eastern Ukraine and the downing of the airliner, but we\u2019ve got to be more united in preventing Putin from taking a more aggressive stance in Europe and the Middle East.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: We to want turn right now to the issue of balancing national security concerns with the privacy rights of Americans. That brings us to YouTube and this question.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BROWNLEE: Hi, my name Marques Brownlee, and I\u2019ve been making YouTube videos about electronics and gadgets for the past seven years.I think America\u2019s future success is tied to getting all kinds of tech right. Tech companies are responsible for the encryption technology to protect personal data, but the government wants a back door into that information.So do you think it\u2019s possible to find common ground? And where do you stand on privacy versus security?(END VIDEO CLIP)HOLT: So, Governor O\u2019Malley.O\u2019MALLEY: Thank you.I believe whether it\u2019s a back door or a front door that the American principle of law should still hold that our federal government should have to get a warrant, whether they want to come through the back door or your front door.(APPLAUSE)And I also agree, Lester, with Benjamin Franklin, who said, no people should ever give up their privacy or their freedoms in a promise for security.So we\u2019re a collaborative people. We need collaborative leadership here with Silicon Valley and other bright people in my own state of Maryland and around the NSA that can actually figure this out.But there are certain immutable principles that will not become antique things in our country so long as we defend our country and its values and its freedoms. And one of those things is our right to be secure in our homes, and our right to expect that our federal government should have to get a warrant.I also want to the say that while we\u2019ve made some progress on the Patriot Act, I do believe that we need an adversarial court system there. We need a public advocate. We need to develop jurisprudence so that we can develop a body of law that protects the privacy of Americans in the information and digital age.HOLT: That\u2019s time.You have all talked about what you would do fighting ISIS over there, but we\u2019ve been hit in this country by home-grown terrorists, from Chattanooga to San Bernardino, the recent shooting of a police officer in Philadelphia. How are you going to fight the lone wolves here, Senator Sanders?O\u2019MALLEY: Yes, Lester, year in and year out I was the leader of the U.S. ...HOLT: That\u2019s a question to Senator Sanders. I wasn\u2019t clear, I apologize.SANDERS: OK. I just wanted to add, in the previous question, I voted against the USA Patriot Act for many of the reasons that Governor O\u2019Malley mentioned. But it is not only the government that we have to worry about, it is private corporations.You would all be amazed, or maybe not, about the amount of information private companies and the government has in terms of the Web sites that you access, the products that you buy, where you are this very moment.And it is very clear to me that public policy has not caught up with the explosion of technology. So yes, we have to work with Silicon Valley to make sure that we do not allow ISIS to transmit information...HOLT: But in terms of lone wolves, the threat, how would you do it?SANDERS: Right. What we have got to do there is, among other things, as I was just saying, have Silicon Valley help us to make sure that information being transmitted through the Internet or in other ways by ISIS is, in fact, discovered.But I do believe we can do that without violating the constitutional and privacy rights of the American people.(CROSSTALK)HOLT: We have to go to a \u2014 we have to go to a break, and when we come back, we\u2019re going to get to some of the burning questions these candidates have yet to answer and are totally eager to talk about.CLINTON: Oh, we\u2019re breaking? OK.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HOLT: And welcome back to Charleston.As we were going to a break, Secretary Clinton, I cut you off. I\u2019ll give you 30 seconds to respond on the issue of lone wolves.O\u2019MALLEY: Can I get 30 seconds, too?(LAUGHTER)SANDERS: Can I get 50 seconds?HOLT: Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Well, I wanted to say, and I\u2019ll do it quickly, I was very pleased that leaders of President Obama\u2019s administration went out to Silicon Valley last week and began exactly this conversation about what we can do, consistent with privacy and security.We need better intelligence cooperation, we need to be sure that we are getting the best intelligence that we can from friends and allies around the world. And then, we\u2019ve got to recognize our first line of defense against lone wolf attacks is among Muslim Americans.And it is not only shameful, it is dangerous for the kinds of comments you\u2019re hearing from the Republican side.We need to be reaching out and unifying our country against terrorist attacks and lone wolves, and working with Muslim Americans.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: And Andrea has a follow-up.O\u2019MALLEY: And Andrea \u2014 Andrea \u2014 Andrea...MITCHELL: Just a \u2014 just a quick follow-up, though, Secretary Clinton. Just a moment, Governor.O\u2019MALLEY: Andrea, when can I get my 30 seconds?MITCHELL: But \u2014 but \u2014 Secretary Clinton, you said that the leaders from the intelligence community went to Silicon Valley, they were flatly turned down. They got nowhere.CLINTON: That is not what I\u2019ve heard. Let me leave it at that.O\u2019MALLEY: Andrea, I need to talk about homeland security and preparedness.Ever since the attacks of September 11th \u2014 30 seconds.(LAUGHTER)Ever since the attacks of September 11th, my colleagues, Democratic and Republican mayors, Democratic and Republican governors, made me their leader on homeland security and preparedness.O\u2019MALLEY: Here in the homeland, unlike combating ISIL abroad, we\u2019re almost like it\u2019s \u2014 your body\u2019s immune system. It\u2019s able to protect your body against bad bugs, not necessarily because it outnumbers them, but it\u2019s better connected \u2014 the fusion centers, the biosurveillance systems, better prepared first responders.But there\u2019s another front in this battle, and it is this. That\u2019s the political front, and if Donald Trump wants to start a registry in our country of people by faith, he can start with me, and I will sign up as one who is totally opposed to his fascist appeals that wants to vilify American Muslims. That can do more damage to our democracy than any...(CROSSTALK)HOLT: All right, that\u2019s time, and \u2014 and we do...(APPLAUSE)... we do have to move on.Secretary Clinton, this is the first time...SANDERS: Can I get a \u2014 can I just get a very brief response? Very brief.HOLT: Thirty \u2014 30 \u2014 30 seconds, Senator.SANDERS: OK. One \u2014 and I agree with what the secretary said, and what Governor O\u2019Malley said. But here\u2019s an issue that we also should talk about. We have a $600 billion military budget. It is a budget larger than the next eight countries\u2019.Unfortunately, much of that budget continues to fight the old Cold War with the Soviet Union. Very little of that budget \u2014 less than 10 percent \u2014 actually goes into fighting ISIS and international terrorism. We need to be thinking hard about making fundamental changes in the priorities of the Defense Department.HOLT: All right. Secretary Clinton...(APPLAUSE)... this is the first time that a spouse of a former president could be elected president. You have said that President Clinton would advise you on economic issues, but be specific, if you can. Are you talking about a kitchen-table role on economics, or will he have a real policy role?CLINTON: Well, it\u2019ll start at the kitchen table, we\u2019ll see how it goes from there. And I...(APPLAUSE)... I\u2019m going to have the very best advisers that I can possibly have, and when it comes to the economy and what was accomplished under my husband\u2019s leadership and the \u201990s \u2014 especially when it came to raising incomes for everybody and lifting more people out of poverty than at any time in recent history \u2014 you bet.I\u2019m going to ask for his ideas, I\u2019m going ask for his advice, and I\u2019m going use him as a goodwill emissary to go around the country to find the best ideas we\u2019ve got, because I do believe, as he said, everything that\u2019s wrong with America has been solved somewhere in America.We just have to do more of it, and we have to reach out, especially into poor communities and communities of color, to give more people their own chance to get ahead.HOLT: Senator sanders, a 30 second response, sir.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Great ideas, Governor O\u2019Malley, Secretary Clinton, but here\u2019s the truth. If you have an administration stacked with Wall Street appointees, it ain\u2019t going to accomplish very much.So here\u2019s a promise that I make \u2014 and I mentioned a moment ago how corrupt the system is \u2014 Goldman Sachs, paying a $5 billion fine, gives this country, in recent history, a Republican secretary of treasury, a Democratic secretary of treasury.Here\u2019s a promise. If elected president, Goldman Sachs is not going to have \u2014 bring forth a secretary of treasury for a Sanders administration.(APPLAUSE)MILLER: Senator Sanders, let me ask you a question. You called Bill Clinton\u2019s past transgressions, quote, \u201ctotally, totally, totally disgraceful and unacceptable.\u201d Senator, do you regret saying that?SANDERS: I was asked a question. You know, one of the things, Andrea, and I \u2014 that question annoys me. I cannot walk down the street \u2014 Secretary Clinton knows this \u2014 without being told how much I have to attack secretary Clinton, want to get me on the front pages of the paper, I\u2019d make some vicious attack.I have avoided doing that. Trying to run an issue-oriented campaign.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: I was asked a question.MILLER: You didn\u2019t have to answer it that way, though. Why did you?SANDERS: Well \u2014 then if I don\u2019t answer it, then there\u2019s another front page, so it\u2019s yes (ph).(LAUGHTER)And I mean this seriously. You know that. We\u2019ve been through this. Yes, his behavior was deplorable. Have I ever once said a word about that issue? No, I have not. I\u2019m going to debate Secretary Clinton, Governor O\u2019Malley, on the issues facing the American people, not Bill Clinton\u2019s personal behavior.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: We will take a break. We\u2019ll continue from Charleston right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) HOLT: Welcome back everybody. Finally, before we go tonight, we set out here to understand points of differences between you. We believe we\u2019ve learned a lot here, but before we leave, is there anything that you really wanted to say tonight that you haven\u2019t gotten a chance to say.And, we\u2019ll start with Governor O\u2019Malley.(LAUGHTER)HOLT: Didn\u2019t see that coming, did you?O\u2019MALLEY: Yes, but we\u2019re going to have to get 20 minutes to do it, so.(LAUGHTER)MITCHELL: ...too long (ph).O\u2019MALLEY: I believe there are many issues. I have 60 seconds for this?HOLT: Sixty seconds, we\u2019d appreciate it.O\u2019MALLEY: There are so many issues that we haven\u2019t been able to discuss here. We have not fully discussed immigration reform, and the deplorable number of immigrant detention camps that our nation\u2019s now maintaining. We haven\u2019t discussed the shameful treatment that the people of Puerto Rico, our fellow Americans, are getting treated with by these hedge funds that are working them over.(APPLAUSE)O\u2019MALLEY: We haven\u2019t discussed the fact that in our hemisphere we have the danger of nation-state failures because of drug traffickers; and Honduras, and Guatemala and El Salvador.I guess the bottom line is this, look we are a great people the way we act at home and abroad based on the beliefs that unite us. Our belief in the dignity of every person, our belief in our own common good. There is now challenge that is too great for us to overcome provided we bring forward in these divided times, new leadership that can heal our divides here at home and bring our principles into alignment abroad.We\u2019re on the threshold of a new era of American progress and I believe we have only need to join forces together and cross that threshold into a new era of American prosperity.HOLT: And that\u2019s time.O\u2019MALLEY: Thanks a lot.HOLT: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well Lester, I spent a lot of time last week being outraged by what\u2019s happening in Flint, Michigan and I think every single American should be outraged. We\u2019ve had a city in the United States of America where the population which is poor in many ways and majority African American has been drinking and bathing in lead contaminated water. And the governor of that state acted as though he didn\u2019t really care.He had request for help and he had basically stone walled. I\u2019ll tell you what, if the kids in a rich suburb of Detroit had been drinking contaminated water and being bathed in it, there would\u2019ve been action.So I sent my top campaign aide down there to talk to the mayor of Flint to see what I could to help. I issued a statement about what we needed to do and then I went on a T.V. show and I said, \u201cit was outrageous that the governor hadn\u2019t acted and within two hours he had.\u201dHOLT: And that\u2019s time.CLINTON: I want to be a president who takes care of the big problems and the problems that are affecting the people of our country everyday.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Thank you.Senator Sanders?SANDERS: Well, Secretary Clinton was right and what I did which I think is also right, is demanded the resignation of governor. A man who acts that irresponsibly should not stay in power.Now, we are a great nation \u2014 and we\u2019ve heard a lot of great ideas here tonight. Let\u2019s be honest and let\u2019s be truthful. Very little is going to be done to transform our economy and to create the kind of middle class we need unless we end a corrupt campaign finance system which is undermining American democracy.We\u2019ve got to get rid of Super PACs, we\u2019ve got to get rid of Citizens\u2019 United and what we\u2019ve got to do is create a political revolution which revitalizes American democracy; which brings millions of young people and working people into the political process. To say loudly and clearly,\u201d that the government of the United States of America belongs to all of us and not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.\u201dHOLT: All right. Well thank you and thanks to all of you for being here tonight shedding light on some of the differences as Americans get ready to vote.I also want to thank the Congressional Black Caucus Institute and certainly my friend and colleague, Andrea Mitchell. This has been great. It\u2019s been a great spirited conversation and American people appreciate it.Let me turn it over to my friend Chuck Todd now. Chuck?TODD: Lester thank you and a terrific job moderating this debate tonight, Andrea as well. What a lively substantive debate. We thought there were going to be fireworks, there certainly were.You heard sort of the sharp disagreements when it comes to guns, when it comes to Wall Street Reform, when it comes to health care and even a few things on foreign policy. We\u2019re going to break all of it down here in a few minutes but we\u2019re going to try to sneak in a short break.And when we come back, instant analysis. We\u2019ll see if we can find out what the campaigns are doing. We\u2019re live right here in the spin room in Charleston, South Carolina.ENDAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Conservative Case for Solar Subsidies", "Date": "2016-01-05", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorTO many skeptics, particularly on the right, the spectacular failure of the solar-panel manufacturer Solyndra in 2011, after receiving a $535 million loan guarantee from the Department of Energy, demonstrated the industry\u2019s shaky future and the danger of government efforts to subsidize it to success.Fast forward to today. Solar energy prices have continued to fall rapidly, twice as many Americans work in the solar industry as in coal mining, and last year one-third of new electricity generation came from solar power.Solar, long viewed through the lens of crony capitalism, has shown the ability to inject real market competition in energy distribution, one of the last monopolies in the energy sector, while improving the efficiency of the grid and putting more dollars in the pockets of middle-class Americans. Conservatives, in other words, need to take another look at solar.The case for solar isn\u2019t limited to prices and jobs. Consumers want choice. Unfortunately, in most markets around the country, electricity is still one of the few areas where we have virtually no choice over our supplier. Imagine you want to buy a G.M. car, but you were told you can buy only a Toyota. You\u2019d be outraged \u2014 yet this is how almost all Americans are forced to procure their electricity.Again, to borrow an automotive analogy, you wouldn\u2019t buy a new car just for those few days you had extra errands. Instead, you\u2019d call an Uber or rent a Zipcar. That\u2019s the same role rooftop solar panels can play for our energy challenges \u2014 instead of building another huge plant for a few peak hours, we can build just as much solar capacity as we need.Critics of solar have often said that it produces only \u201cwhen the sun is shining,\u201d and that is true. Fortunately, we need energy most during the daytime \u2014 making rooftop solar a smart choice for consumers while adding energy to the grid when we need it most.And while challenges of storage and metering policies remain, both technology and regulatory models have made significant strides. States like California are considering metering policies that incentivize solar consumers to reduce their demand at peak hours and enable them to sell energy back into the grid when the grid needs it most. Technologies like Google\u2019s Nest \u201csmart\u201d thermostat and Tesla\u2019s home battery are making it easier for consumers to monitor their energy consumption and better store renewable energy when the sun isn\u2019t shining.Of course, conservatives will respond that their core objection remains: Solar functions only because of government subsidies. But there are a couple of issues to consider.For one thing, not all subsidies are created equal, and the government actually has a good track record in promoting new energy technologies. New developments often face two market gaps that can potentially delay or even kill them: the \u201ctechnological valley of death,\u201d in which promising advances hit a technical brick wall, and the \u201ccommercialization valley of death,\u201d in which an effective technology can\u2019t get to market. Government research labs and subsidies have supported a number of forms of energy \u2014 from nuclear energy, to hydraulic fracturing, to photovoltaic solar \u2014 through these troughs.Furthermore, the solar investment tax credit is pretty smart. It\u2019s structured so that as solar power becomes more efficient, the effect of the credit on each watt produced becomes smaller. Ideally, we would let markets decide the winners on their own, but so long as government is intervening in markets, it should do so in an evenhanded way. Similarly, any government support for the solar industry should be impartial, rather than having government bureaucracy pick and choose favored companies as it does through its loan guarantee program. The solar investment tax credit comes close to that ideal.And there\u2019s nothing in free-market economic theory that precludes government support. Markets tend to underproduce what economists call positive externalities \u2014 that is, the broad social benefits, like a cleaner environment, that aren\u2019t captured on a company\u2019s balance sheet.Solar panels, and the companies that make them, are replete with such benefits: They eliminate redundant power plants that otherwise lie idle, empower consumer choice and have fewer negative consequences than most other forms of energy. But markets don\u2019t always reflect these, which is why it makes sense for subsidies to enter the picture.The kerfuffle over the Solyndra collapse aside, many conservatives already agree, and have for years. When I was at the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush, we believed that an across-the-board energy policy was by far the best approach \u2014 and that included solar. From both a market and an environmental point of view, supporting the solar industry should make sense, no matter which side of the aisle you come from.Ben Ho is an economics professor at Vassar and Columbia.\u00a0He served as the lead energy economist for the White House Council of Economic Advisers from 2006 to 2007.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bronx Science Bans Cellphones From Wi-Fi as Students Devour It", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported byBut the change also unleashed tens of thousands of smartphones in the hands of teenagers, eager to gobble away at the nearest Wi-Fi connection like so many hungry termites, eating up their schools\u2019 bandwidth with YouTube streams, Snapchat exchanges and the like. That can leave little capacity for teachers to use the Internet for actual instruction.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to exacerbate the problem we already have any more,\u201d Jean Donahue, the principal at Bronx Science, said.Ms. Donahue noted that the school\u2019s network had been struggling for several years under an increasingly technology-heavy curriculum, and that the Education Department was working with the school to increase its broadband capacity.\u201cWe know,\u201d she added of students\u2019 cellphones, \u201cit doesn\u2019t help.\u201dAnthony Barbetta, the principal of Townsend Harris, a top high school in Queens, said his school\u2019s network had also seen a cellphone slowdown this year. But so far, he has no plans to address it.\u201cI definitely think there\u2019s been an impact,\u201d Mr. Barbetta said. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t told students they cannot be on the Wi-Fi. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s enforceable realistically.\u201cWe\u2019re hoping for an upgrade, just like I think everybody else is hoping to get an upgrade.\u201dWhen Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s administration announced last year that schools would be allowed to decide their own cellphone policies going forward, Bronx Science \u2014 one of the city\u2019s top high schools, where applicants must pass a test to gain entry \u2014 said students could use their phones at lunch and during free periods.Several Bronx Science students on their way home from school last week said they most frequently used the wireless network to send pictures to their friends on Snapchat, an app they said the school did not block; Facebook, by contrast, was not accessible. This being Bronx Science, some students said they found the wireless most useful for statistics classes, or to use Google Slides to put together school projects.\u201cA friend once told me he was watching Netflix\u201d at school, said Eugene Park, a senior and Snapchat enthusiast. \u201cNetflix is not blocked, conveniently.\u201dMiguel Mercado, 16, a junior, said he used the school for YouTube, mostly to listen to music.\u201cAdele\u2019s good,\u201d he offered by way of example.A classmate named Phillip, who was standing beside him, gave a snicker.\u201cWhat? I like Adele,\u201d Miguel said. \u201cIs there a problem?\u201dDespite the new rule barring students\u2019 cellphones on the wireless network, Miguel said he was still able to use it on his phone last week. Many of his schoolmates who were unscientifically surveyed said the same.Since then, amid a national push to increase the speed and connectivity of schools, the department has upgraded the wiring at more than 250 school buildings, Devora Kaye, a department spokeswoman, said. Ms. Kaye added that the city plans to spend $650 million over the next three years to further upgrade school technology.At Bronx Science, Ms. Donahue said she was working with the department to improve the school\u2019s broadband capacity. She added that the department had been quite responsive, helping with short-term upgrades while it works toward a more systemic upgrade.In the meantime, the school was identifying personal mobile devices one by one and blocking them from the network. (Students are still free to use their own data plans, though many complained of spotty service in the building.)Just changing the password is not an option, said Phoebe Cooper, an assistant principal at the school, \u201cbecause the kids will figure it out within days.\u201d\u201cWe tried that,\u201d she explained. \u201cA kid found it, wrote it on his hand and put a picture on Facebook.\u201dAnd students seemed fairly certain they could stay ahead of administrators, anyway.\u201cGive it a month and everyone will be back on,\u201d Kevin Zhang, a senior, said. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly for a lack of trying that people aren\u2019t on it now.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Online Booking Makes Hotel Loyalty Harder to Keep", "Date": "2016-01-18", "News": "Supported byFor the past six months, Erin Gifford, a marketing director based in Washington, has traveled for business at least once a month, mostly to Boston.But she has yet to see a single reward from a hotel chain.She created this approach when new colleagues traveled to Washington for training. They lodged at the Dupont Circle Hotel one week, then moved on to the Hotel Palomar for another week before spending several weeks at an Airbnb property.In the end, she said her hodgepodge approach, made possible by online booking, offered greater flexibility and savings than loyalty to a single chain.It\u2019s not always easy to persuade them.\u201cThe world of digital selling is more complex for hoteliers,\u201d Mr. Anderson said, adding that companies like TripAdvisor with its instant booking service and Google were transitioning to models that resemble online travel agencies.Google started a program last fall called Google Hotel Ads, which allows travelers to book on a personal computer, tablet or smartphone.\u201cGoogle sees a lot of money being made down the booking funnel,\u201d said Douglas Quinby, vice president for research at Phocuswright, a travel industry research firm. Priceline and Expedia advertise extensively through the Google service.Unlike the heavily advertised booking sites, Room Key is relatively low profile. \u201cWe don\u2019t spend a lot of media money,\u201d said Steven Sickel, interim chief executive of Room Key.A guest who shops on one of the founding companies\u2019 websites, but chooses not to book on that site, will be directed to Room Key and will still receive the lowest price, Mr. Sickel said.Still, some believe booking directly with a hotel is a prudent strategy. Marc A. Hoffman, chief operating officer of Sunstone Hotel Investors, is one. \u201cYou get much more positive service by booking direct,\u201d he said, including loyalty points, specific room types and views.Scott Shugrue subscribes to that, but only to a point. He is based in Boston and is a product manager at Liquid, a mobile advertising subsidiary of Publishers Clearing House. He estimates he travels 30 percent of the time for business.He said he belonged to Hilton\u2019s and Marriott\u2019s loyalty programs, and enjoyed room upgrades and additional benefits if they were available, but choosing to stay at one of their hotels is not an automatic decision.\u201cWhat it comes down to is the price, where the meetings are, what I\u2019m doing the next day,\u201d he said. In late December, for example, he said he opted for a boutique hotel in Manhattan for meetings and a chain hotel on Long Island for a company party.For all the possibilities online booking offers, sometimes having hotel loyalty status is a necessity, as A. Blayne Candy, co-founder of Showcall, an events production company in Washington, found out.He had a last-minute business trip to San Francisco in early January and \u201cavailability was coming up nil,\u201d he said. Through the Starwood loyalty program he was able to secure a room.\u201cThe hotels want to own you as a customer,\u201c said Steven Carvell, associate dean for academic affairs at the Cornell hotel administration school.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Looking for Signs That Apple\u2019s Runaway Growth Is Waning", "Date": "2016-01-24", "News": "Supported byAlready, some investors have begun to treat Apple in a new way: as a \u201cvalue\u201d stock, a label typically attached to companies that generate predictable business results or a reliable dividend, rather than ones that deliver runaway revenue growth. Value stocks often command much lower valuations than growth stocks.\u201cPeople were in love with Apple because hits like the iPod and iPhone created phenomenal growth,\u201d said Ernesto Ramos, a fund manager at BMO Global Asset Management, which manages $18 billion and counts Apple as its largest holding. \u201cAs investors shifted their minds around the fact that it\u2019s no longer going to deliver the same sort of huge growth over the next five years, the stock became a value play.\u201dMr. Ramos says his firm still owns Apple in some of its growth funds, but began including the stock in value funds in mid-2013.Switching from being a growth stock to being a value stock can also be a long and painful process. Growth investors need to sell a company\u2019s shares and drive down the price until it is low enough to tempt value investors, who buy stocks they think are cheap compared with the intrinsic value of the company. In the tech industry, a shift from growth to value also often signals to investors that a company is facing newer competitors with more innovative products, raising the question of how relevant the company can remain.\u201cInvestors don\u2019t like to see the words tech and value combined because when growth slows at a tech company, it usually means that something essentially is not working,\u201d said Angelo Zino, a senior analyst at the research firm S&P Capital IQ.A spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment.Any change would have repercussions beyond Apple because its soaring performance in recent years helped lift the broader market. If Apple shares were removed from the equation, the performance of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index in five of the last seven years would drop by about 1 percentage point, according to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices. In 2014, for instance, the index rose 13.7 percent with Apple and 12.9 percent without Apple.The Apple effect is even more pronounced when technology names are isolated. For tech stocks on the S.&P. 500 as a group, annual gain in 2009 declined by 6 percentage points when Apple shares were not included, dropping to 56 percent from 62 percent.The effect was more muted last year as Apple\u2019s growth decelerated, according to the data.Investors have turned to Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet, which owns Google \u2014 collectively referred to as the FANG stocks \u2014 for growth. Those companies are each expected to show annual revenue gains of 23 to 40 percent for the last three months of 2015, while Apple is projected to deliver 3 percent revenue growth, according to Bloomberg data.Mr. Ramos says companies like Amazon have bigger growth potential for his fund than Apple, though he plans to continue owning Apple shares. \u201cAmazon will see about 20 percent revenue growth, and earnings per share are expected to jump considerably,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a very strong growth story.\u201dApple shares have already been buffeted in recent months because of worries about the slowing economy in China, which the company counts as one of its largest markets. Half a dozen companies that provide parts for the iPhone also blamed weak demand from Apple for lower-than-expected earnings, causing worries about the company\u2019s sales trajectory.\u201cIf you wanted to outperform the market, the FANG stocks did better,\u201d said Jonathan Krinsky, an analyst at MKM Partners, though he added that Apple remained a must-watch stock because it composed such a large part of many stock indexes.Investors may still someday reanoint Apple as a growth stock, especially if the company can create a best-selling new product that drives up its sales rate. Wall Street analysts cite Microsoft as an example of a business that lost steam and then made the adjustments necessary to deliver strong revenue growth again.Apple has been reclassified as a value stock before. FTSE Russell, which makes several closely followed stock indexes, found in 2013 that Apple no longer met its criteria to be treated purely as a growth stock. Some of the company\u2019s enormous market capitalization was reallocated to the Russell Value Index, as well as being in the Russell Growth Index. A year later, when the company\u2019s sales had risen strongly with the introduction of the iPhone 6, FTSE Russell placed Apple solely back in the growth index.Tom Goodwin, FTSE Russell\u2019s senior research director, said that stock price, sales growth and analyst expectations determine whether a company is placed in the growth or value index, or in both. About a third of the stocks that Russell tracks are included in both indexes, he said.But until Apple reveals another hit or shows a significant pickup in iPhone sales growth, Apple should be viewed as a value-oriented name, Mr. Zino said.\u201cHistorically Apple was the name to own if you wanted to outperform the market,\u201d he said. \u201cNow there are other places to look.\u201dDoris Burke contributed research from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ways to Be Free", "Date": "2016-01-21", "News": "Supported byWhen you grew up in an unmapped, unwired world and find yourself in this one \u2014 observing the panic when GPS fails or the extent of online status anxiety \u2014 you can\u2019t help wondering if somewhere along the way freedom got lost.Freedom is still out there. We all have our idea of it, the deferred dream. Your psyche builds layers of protection around your most vulnerable traits, which may be closely linked to that precious essence in which freedom resides. Freedom is inseparable from risk.Technology increases choice, but its prime purpose is to increase productivity; that is the amount that can be extracted from you in any given time. Like debt, it never sleeps. It confines you. It distracts you. It binds you. It depoliticizes you through isolation and through the blurring, in the cacophony it delivers, of fantasy with fact.I don\u2019t know if the world is freer than a half-century ago. On paper, it is. The totalitarian Soviet Imperium is gone. The generals who bossed Latin America are gone, generally. Asia has unshackled itself and claims this century as its own. Media has opened out, gone social.Yet minds feel more crimped, fear more pervasive, possibility more limited, adventure more choreographed, politics more stale, economics more skewed, pressure more crushing, escape more elusive.Three things recently caused me to ponder these matters. The first was the appearance, like a letter in a bottle, of a diary from 1973, recording a time when I was in Afghanistan as a 17-year-old hippie. The second was reading \u201cBarbarian Days,\u201d William Finnegan\u2019s wonderful surfing memoir. The third was a question from my son. I\u2019ll take them in order.The diary, written by Leslie Starr, covers three weeks that, as a young woman, she spent with me in Kabul, Bamian (its Buddhas still intact), Band-e-Amir and Mazar-i-Sharif. Starr, from Annapolis, traveled in a VW Kombi, named Pigpen after the keyboardist of the Grateful Dead, that I had driven with two friends to Afghanistan. It took her only 43 years to transcribe her jottings and so reverse time\u2019s arrow.There I am, on Aug. 2, 1973, my 18th birthday, in a cave beside the beautiful lakes of Band-e-Amir, \u201cpropped against bundles, surrounded by chickens, beautiful children, a kitten, a goat, women in the corners\u201d eating. There, the next day, on the \u201cterrible road\u201d from Bamian to Mazar, \u201czooming, crashing along into the night.\u201dThere again, on Aug.ust 10, at the Salang Pass (12,723 feet), camped out and cold with the engine bust. The next day, \u201cwe coasted 40 kilometers, stopped in desperation.\u201d Back in Kabul, I try a cake of, let us say, Colorado inspiration. It packs a punch. Starr writes, \u201cDuring the night I heard Roger talking to Marcus about dying.\u201d Oh, man. She observes these three young men \u201cabout to enter Oxford\u201d who \u201csit around and write in notebooks or read Turgenev.\u201dI\u2019m struck by the haphazardness of that journey; the fact we drove across Iran; the way names likes Mazar and the Salang Pass have become synonymous with war; the idea of us teenagers thousands of miles from our parents, out of contact.How much freer, in many ways, we were. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that the world\u2019s more dangerous. I think it\u2019s that people are more frightened. Fear is a much-trafficked commodity.Which brings me to Finnegan\u2019s wonderful book, a kind of hymn to freedom and passion. Freedom is inside you. It\u2019s the thing that cannot be denied. For Finnegan, that\u2019s surfing and writing. \u201cHow could you know your limits unless you tested them?\u201d he asks \u2014 a question as true before the ferocious energy of the wave as before the infinite possibilities of the written form.He\u2019s a near- contemporary, embracing Kerouac and the Dead, contemptuous of what a friend calls \u201cSuckcess,\u201d hitting the road without a map to find the perfect wave somewhere between Guam and Cape Town, a child of a zeitgeist he describes as \u201chippie culture, acid rock, hallucinogens, neo-Eastern mysticism, the psychedelic aesthetic.\u201d Like me he laments the loss of the lost places, the beaches he was first to tread.A patch of coast may demand a lifetime of study. Wave love, he observes, \u201cis a one way street.\u201d The wave, implacable, will turn on you. \u201cScenes feel mythic even as they unfold. I always feel a ferocious ambivalence: I want to be nowhere else; I want to be anywhere else.\u201d One near- escape produces this catharsis: \u201cOn my knees in the sand, in the twilight, absolutely spent, I was surprised to find myself sobbing.\u201dWhat my son Blaise, who is 21, asked was whether it\u2019s still possible to have such adventures. He thought not \u2014 too much control, too much Google Earth. I suggested he might be wrong and that, on graduation, he might drive from New York to Patagonia. It\u2019s important to experience that \u201cferocious ambivalence,\u201d the threshold of freedom.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hope for L.G.B.T. Rights in India", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorBENGALURU, India \u2014 The green benches of the lower house of India\u2019s Parliament were mostly empty on the afternoon of Dec. 18. It was late in the winter session. An earnest but unhurried debate was taking place between Nishikant Dubey, a member of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, and Shashi Tharoor, a writer, former diplomat and opposition M.P., who was introducing a bill.It wasn\u2019t until the vote was called, and a sudden clamor filled the hall, that the significance of the law became apparent: It proposed to decriminalize gay sex. Dozing M.P.s jumped to their feet and barked across the room. One voice was heard jeering, \u201cTharoor only needs this bill for himself!\u201dThe final tally was 24 votes in favor and 71 votes against, and the bill was sent back to Mr. Tharoor\u2019s drafting table. Yet the debate itself was a hopeful development: Two years after sexual minorities in India were dealt a terrible setback by the Supreme Court, more elected politicians are stepping up for L.G.B.T. rights.Unlike the courts, the politicians speak for constituents. Their statements come from and travel back to the hundreds of thousands of voters they represent \u2014 a national conversation that could do more than any learned court ruling to stop prejudice against L.G.B.T. Indians.Mr. Tharoor intends to change Section 377 of India\u2019s penal code, a Victorian-era provision that punishes \u201cwhoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal\u201d with life imprisonment. Convictions are rare, but the law is sometimes used to harass and blackmail gay men and transgenders.In a country where every kind of sexual preference permeates cultural heritage and lived reality, Section 377 is both antiquated and incongruous. Mr. Tharoor\u2019s bill proposed to rewrite the provision, penalizing only intercourse with minors and nonconsensual sex.For many years, the campaign against Section 377 focused on challenging the provision in court. And the strategy seemed to be succeeding: In 2009, an enlightened ruling from the Delhi High Court found that the clause violated the Constitution\u2019s promise of equality.But on Dec. 11, 2013, a panel of the Supreme Court reversed that decision, adopting an unusual position on judicial restraint. It was a bewildering abdication of the court\u2019s role as a guardian of civil rights, and devastating news for L.G.B.T. activists.A few days later, I joined an angry gathering on the steps of the town hall in Bengaluru, the city at the heart of India\u2019s technology industry. Just one year earlier, the local Pride March had ended on these stairs \u2014 an especially colorful and buoyant parade, with veteran participants and fearless trans-folk joined by giggling tech geeks hoisting banners branded by Google and Goldman Sachs. After the Supreme Court decision, however, the protesters wore black, and chanted, \u201cIf you\u2019re criminal and you know it, clap your hands!\u201d The occasion was called the Day of Rage.Soon, though, the insurgent anger mixed with astonishment at the outpouring of solidarity. On Twitter, even self-described \u201cHindu far/extreme-right-winger patriot-capitalist-conspicuous-consumers\u201d called for Section 377 to be revised by executive ordinance. The evening of the protest, the prime-time news shows were thundering against the Supreme Court decision, and inviting politicians to state their positions on it.Through the gloom there was a glimmer of consolation: The action had just shifted out of the courts and into popular politics.The first formal statement against the ruling came from the maverick Aam Aadmi Party, which had recently captivated the urban middle class with its campaign against corruption and politics-as-usual. It was followed by the Congress Party. Rahul Gandhi, the Congress\u2019s vice-president, said that sexual preferences \u201cshould be left to individuals\u201d \u2014 a mild but unprecedented statement from a leader of India\u2019s then-ruling party.That declaration pushed the Congress\u2019 main rival, the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party, to endorse the Supreme Court verdict. The B.J.P. won the 2014 general election, and today, after a year and a half in power, its leaders have softened their position on L.G.B.T. rights. At a literary festival in November, Arun Jaitley, the minister of finance conceded, \u201cWhen millions of people the world over have alternative sexual preferences, it is too late in the day to propound a view that they should be jailed.\u201dSection 377 remains for now, and as Mr. Tharoor learned, India\u2019s dysfunctional Parliament is still some way from changing it. But the gradual accretion of support for reform from politicians of various persuasions is creating what a wise judicial decision might well have pre-empted: a national conversation about accepting and respecting different sexual lifestyles.A progressive Supreme Court ruling would have revised the law all at once, but it would have done relatively little to change the social stigma and institutional hostility faced by sexual minorities. When major political parties affirm their support for L.G.B.T. Indians, it sends a different kind of writ to both their supporters and officials under their control.In the spring, Mr. Tharoor will reintroduce his bill. He hopes that a full discussion in Parliament will be an opportunity to broadcast that L.G.B.T. rights are \u201cnot about sex but about freedom.\u201d The chances of the bill\u2019s passing are still slim, at least until the B.J.P.\u2019s more liberal voices prevail over the bigoted ones. Indian politicians can be expected to prevaricate, pass the buck or pander to religious conservatives in their base.But some elected politicians have already begun to grapple with their responsibility toward sexual minorities, and thanks to the parallel efforts of activists, a small but growing legislative agenda for queer rights has become evident. A new bill protecting the rights of transgenders has passed in the upper house of Parliament and will be presented in the lower house this year. Last January, Madhu Bai Kinnar was elected mayor of Raigarh \u2014 the first transgender elected to run any Indian city.Unlike in the United States, where L.G.B.T. rights are an issue too hot for many politicians to touch, in India homophobia is diffuse, and hardly features in our culture wars. And so the prospect grows brighter that Section 377 will eventually be changed through legislation \u2014 through a process that appeals not just to India\u2019s Constitution, but to its society as well.Raghu Karnad is the author of \u201cFarthest Field: An Indian Story of the Second World War\u201d and a contributing editor at TheWire.in.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft Profit and Revenue Fall, but Cloud Computing Grows", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Supported byOn Thursday the company said its revenue and profit fell in the last quarter. But it mattered little, as Microsoft made more from cloud computing, and its stock jumped more than 5 percent immediately after the numbers were released.The success of Microsoft\u2019s cloud business under Mr. Nadella, its new chief executive, has put the company\u2019s stock back in favor with investors. Even with recent anxiety in the stock market, Microsoft\u2019s shares are up more than 28 percent for the last year, while shares in rivals like Apple, Oracle and IBM have declined by double digits.By most analysts\u2019 estimates, Microsoft is in second place in the most prominent segment of the cloud services market \u2014 in which computer storage and other services in data centers are rented to customers \u2014 after Amazon. IBM and Google are next.For its second fiscal quarter, which ended on Dec. 31, the company reported net income of nearly $5 billion, or 62 cents a share, compared with $5.86 billion, or 71 cents a share, during the same period a year earlier.Revenue fell to $23.8 billion, down from $26.47 billion a year ago.The figures in the recent quarter reflected a huge deferral of revenue, almost $1.9 billion, related to Windows 10, the company\u2019s latest operating system. Although it collects all the cash up front from selling the software to PC makers and others, accounting rules dictate that the company has to spread its recognition of the money over the life of the product.Without that deferral, Microsoft had $25.69 billion in revenue and 78 cents a share in earnings, better than the average forecast of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters of 71 cents a share in earnings and $25.26 billion in revenue.Even without the Windows deferral, Microsoft\u2019s numbers declined from the previous year, in large part because the company in July sharply scaled back the ambitions of its money-losing smartphone business, acquired from Nokia. The company\u2019s phone revenue plummeted 49 percent when excluding foreign currency fluctuations as a result of the changes, which included cutting the number of smartphones it sells.Microsoft\u2019s cloud business encouraged investors. The company\u2019s intelligent cloud group, which includes its Azure service, rose 5 percent to $6.3 billion. It now has 20.6 million consumer subscribers to Office 365, the cloud version of its productivity applications, up from 9.2 million a year earlier.Last July, Microsoft introduced Windows 10, raising some hope in the industry of a rebound in PC sales. That rebound has not materialized yet.Global shipments of new PCs declined 8.3 percent during the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier, the research firm Gartner recently reported.The revenue Microsoft gets from PC makers for Windows declined 5 percent in the quarter, excluding foreign currency impacts. Revenue from its own Surface line of computers and tablets rose to $1.35 billion from $1.1 billion a year earlier.The company no longer charges most customers to upgrade existing computers to Windows 10, hoping to get as many people as possible running the latest operating system and wooing developers back to Windows. The company has lost considerable influence among developers, who have gravitated to Apple\u2019s iOS and Google\u2019s Android operating systems.In a phone interview, Amy Hood, Microsoft\u2019s chief financial officer, said Microsoft was not yet predicting a turnaround in the PC market. \u201cOur expectation for the PC market is roughly in line with most analysts,\u201d Ms. Hood said. \u201cFor the next year, we understand the market is not likely to grow, but we can still grow.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Sports Fans Risk Life and Limb for a Rolled-Up T-shirt", "Date": "2016-01-30", "News": "Supported byAt Knicks games, it\u2019s the 7th Avenue Squad. The Mets have the Pepsi Party Patrol. The Nets have the inanimate Team Hype. But every team in sports with any semblance of a marketing department has its own version of the Fan Patrol or Fun Police. This unnaturally peppy collective represents a cross between a cheerleading squad and the \u201cmotivators\u201d at a bar mitzvah party. Their demeanor and high energy often totally at odds with the tenor of the game, they attempt to energize the crowd by cavorting with the mascot and dancing with kids on the Jumbotron and hosting the fan contest during breaks in the game. But the highlight of their shift comes when they launch T-shirts into the crowd.It\u2019s become a sports-event ritual as sacrosanct as the seventh-inning stretch or the singing of the national anthem. After making the obligatory I-can\u2019t-heeeeear-you hand gestures, the Pinstripe Police and their cognates start catapulting rolled-up shirts in the general direction of fans. Often the squads are equipped with air cannons. Others go old-school and use slingshots made of surgical tubing. The Phillie Phanatic, never one to be outdone, shoots off free hot dogs using a four-foot pneumatic gun.Reliably, the crowd goes wild. Fans fall over themselves trying to snag a prize. Literally, as David Babusiak of St. John, Ind., can attest. In 2007, Babusiak attended a White Sox game at Chicago\u2019s U.S. Cellular Field. Between innings, the Chevrolet Pride Team fired a shirt into the section where Babusiak was sitting. He made his move for the shirt. So did a gaggle of his fellow fans. In the scrum, Babusiak later claimed, he was shoved to the ground and suffered a permanent back injury. He filed a civil suit against U.S. Cellular Field and the Pride Team, seeking more than $75,000 in damages. The defendants, he alleged, were liable because they were \u201cengaging in an abnormally dangerous activity, namely, shooting free T-shirts as projectiles into an unsupervised crowd of spectators, some of whom may not have been sober.\u201d (Records from the United States District Court in Northern Indiana indicate that \u201cclaims between the parties have been amicably resolved.\u201d)From the perspective of the teams, it\u2019s easy to understand the T-shirt-cannon phenomenon. It\u2019s a cheap and easy way to keep fans happy, especially in the midst of a dreary season. Give them something to look forward to, even during another blowout or uninspired performance, and they might stick around longer and spend more money on concessions \u2014 not to mention keep coming back for more games, perhaps against their better judgment.But from the fans\u2019 perspective, the phenomenon mystifies: Why do spectators all over the world go to such lengths, risking even paralysis, for an inexpensive prize? These shirts, after all, aren\u2019t particularly special or high-quality. They\u2019re of arbitrary size and often emblazoned with the logo of a team sponsor. (A Knicks shirt is arguably cool; much less so when it says \u201cModell\u2019s Sporting Goods\u201d on the back.) So what\u2019s the big deal?That the product is scarce adds some appeal: Not everyone gets a shirt, so those who do feel special. It\u2019s the same reason a sales promotion is billed as a limited-time offer, or a collectible is called \u201cspecial edition\u201d and has its own serial number. That the \u201clucky\u201d fan has to catch a flying polyester projectile also adds a certain cachet that wouldn\u2019t exist if the shirt were simply handed out at the turnstiles.But the real appeal seems to be simply this: The shirts are free.You\u2019ve no doubt heard the expression \u201cIf it\u2019s free, it\u2019s for me.\u201d That\u2019s not just a throwaway line. Free is catnip for humans, an enticement so strong that it sometimes causes us to behave ridiculously \u2014 or at least in ways at odds with common sense and our best interests.One famous series of studies \u2014 repeated, modified and critiqued in equal measure \u2014 has been dubbed \u201cthe Hershey\u2019s Kiss experiments.\u201d Dan Ariely, a professor at the Duke Fuqua School of Business and a nimble behavioral economist, gave subjects a choice of two chocolates. They could buy premium Lindt truffles (which usually cost around 50 cents apiece) for 26 cents each, or they could buy the beloved but mundane Hershey\u2019s Kiss for a penny. In the outcome of this study, participants were equally split between the two chocolates. Fair enough.Then Ariely reduced the price of each chocolate by one cent. The Lindt was now 25 cents; the Hershey\u2019s Kiss was free. What happened? Tastes changed dramatically. A full 90 percent of respondents opted for the Hershey\u2019s. At first blush this makes no sense. The price differential was the same \u2014 still 25 cents more for the Lindt. Why would demand change so drastically? As Ariely later put it, the power that zero \u201cexercises over people\u2019s choice in chocolate nicely demonstrates the irrational draw of free things.\u201dNot that it\u2019s only free chocolate that causes us to act questionably. Ariely is quick to include himself among those seduced by the power of \u201cfree.\u201d Several years ago, he was in the market for a practical minivan. Instead he drove home a sleek Audi. Why? One big reason was that the Audi came with the promise of free oil changes for three years. \u201cIn fact, those services were worth only about $200, but the promise of \u2018free\u2019 anything was very appealing,\u201d Ariely explains. \u201cThey could have offered me a $2,000 discount on the minivan, and I still would have bought the wrong car because the free oil-change offer was so tempting in the heat of the moment.\u201dWho among us can\u2019t relate? We have zero interest in taking part in your telephone survey, but promise us free movie passes and we\u2019ll stay on the line for half an hour answering tedious questions about how many times a week we use soap powder. We opt for \u201cfree\u201d credit cards with exorbitant interest rates over cards with a modest annual fee but much lower interest, even though we know we\u2019re going to carry a balance each month. And how many of us go to Trader Joe\u2019s or Costco with no interest in buying, say, jalape\u00f1o kale chips but gladly stand in line and have a bite when we can try them free? (Empirical analysis of in-store sampling promotions shows that they work: Shoppers spend more money at a store after getting a free sample, as if they feel obligated to return the favor. As Ariely has noted: \u201cReciprocity is a very, very strong instinct. If somebody does something for you, you really feel a rather surprisingly strong obligation to do something back for them.\u201d)We\u2019ll even make long-lasting bad decisions due to the allure of \u201cfree.\u201d Ariely writes about a Dutch movie theater that offered patrons, in conjunction with the release of \u201cThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\u201d the opportunity to see unlimited free movies for an entire year if they got a tattoo of the theater\u2019s logo: a doglike creature flying under a film reel. More than a dozen moviegoers were up for it.Irrationality like this can accelerate when consumers have already paid an exorbitant sum for something. Spending hundreds of dollars on floor seats to watch a crappy basketball team (not to mention $50 for parking and $12 per beer) leaves us feeling entitled to something in return. \u201cEntitled consumers often believe that their every whim should be catered to,\u201d explains Mike Norton, Ariely\u2019s collaborator and a co-author of \u201cHappy Money,\u201d a book on the science of spending. \u201cSports fans in this state of mind likely do more than experience the allure of giveaways,\u201d he told us. \u201cThey can more or less demand them, as though the $500 they shelled out for a ticket gives them a God-given right to one of those flying T-shirts.\u201d Fans aren\u2019t the only ones swayed by the power of free stuff. For years, teams\u2019 radio broadcasters struggled to cajole players and coaches to appear on postgame shows. Then they got smart and started offering guests free watches or steakhouse gift certificates in exchange for their time. Rationally this shouldn\u2019t have affected the players\u2019 behavior. For the most part, these are multimillionaire athletes, often making thousands of dollars per hour. Yet the siren song of a free Timex or Morton\u2019s voucher was too seductive to resist.Or consider a story recounted by a former tennis star in her autobiography. At the height of her popularity, tournaments offered her large appearance fees simply to show up. Despite her initial misgivings, she committed to one such tournament in Japan. \u201cIt was just too far from home, and I was tired from the travel grind,\u201d she writes. \u201cThey kept offering me more and more money for an appearance fee \u2014 well over $100,000 \u2014 but I said no. Finally, they offered to fly my whole family over (for free). That did it. We went, and I won easily.\u201dIn his review of the book, the writer David Foster Wallace was struck by this anecdote and by the player\u2019s \u201codd financial sense.\u201d Wrote Wallace: \u201cShe won\u2019t come for $100,000+, but will come if they add a couple thousand in airfare?\u201d But such is the powerful inducement of \u201cfree.\u201d Had she (or, more likely, her agent) negotiated a bump in fee from, say, $100K to $105K, it would not have changed her mind. But, by accident or design, when the tournament promoter dangled the prospect of something \u201cfree,\u201d it got the job done.One more example: In the early 2000s, the Portland Trail Blazers hired a crew of workers to wash and wax players\u2019 vehicles during practices. Rationally speaking, this was silly: These millionaire athletes were singularly well suited to pay for their own buffing and polishing. Cynical journalists held this out as another example of athletes being pampered and cosseted. But perhaps a shrewd member of the Portland brass realized that the value would outstrip the cost \u2014 that in exchange for the free services, the athletes might do things they ordinarily wouldn\u2019t. Such as play defense. Or hustle for loose balls. Or respect the United States penal code (this was, after all, the height of the Jail Blazers era). It was the N.B.A. version of Google providing its employees on \u201ccampus\u201d with free gourmet food and dry cleaning, all in the effort to boost worker morale and performance.All of which is to say: When we get something for nothing, we feel as if we\u2019re putting one over on the world. Except that often it\u2019s just the opposite.This article is excerpted from \u201cThis Is Your Brain on Sports,\u201d by L.

For three years, I sat down most mornings at my dining room table in my slippers and read newspapers printed in the 1870s. No need to travel to distant archives, or spend fruitless hours turning the wrong pages. I could open a browser, punch in a range of dates and a few search terms, and within seconds have a presorted queue of articles, every one of which was relevant. I could feel confident that when it came to coverage of, let\u2019s say, an embassy of Japanese statesmen arriving in San Francisco in 1872, I hadn\u2019t missed a single mention. I blessed the librarians who had digitized their holdings, and got to work.But there\u2019s a problem with doing research this way: You find exactly what you\u2019re looking for, and nothing you\u2019re not.The whole reason I was writing this book was serendipity. Fresh from a degree in Japanese history, I had been poking happily and aimlessly through the venerable stacks of the New York Society \u00adLibrary when I found treasure. Two floors below street level were the Japanese travel books: shelf after dusty shelf of gloriously ornate and forgotten Victorian volumes, written by intrepid travelers who had spent a month or a season in a Japan that remained, in the later decades of the 19th century, deliciously mysterious to foreign eyes.One of these books, more understated than the others, caught my attention. Titled simply \u201cA Japanese Interior\u201d (1893), it was a lively memoir by a New Haven-born schoolteacher, Alice Mabel Bacon, who had taught for a year in a Tokyo school in the late 1880s. She had, she explained, lived not with the expatriate community in Tokyo, but among Japanese friends \u201cknown long and intimately in America.\u201d This was strange. A Connecticut Yankee of her era simply wouldn\u2019t have intimate Japanese friends, certainly not ones encountered outside Japan. Following where Alice led, I discovered the extraordinary story of three samurai girls \u2014 ages 7, 10 and 11 \u2014 who came to America for a decade in the 1870s to learn Western ways, and then returned to help modernize Japan. One of them had grown up with Alice and her family. I was hooked.Search algorithms leave no room for serendipity, and without that, some of the magic leaks out of the pursuit of the past. I had to be efficient in my research; that\u2019s where Google came in. But whenever possible, I tried to create space for aimless wandering, and every time, the story became more vivid.People call it \u201cresearch rapture\u201d \u2014 the rare and ecstatic moment when you slip the bonds of the present and follow a twinkling detail into the past. I spent most of a week reading about Chiarini\u2019s Royal Italian Circus and Menagerie, which during the summer and fall of 1886 delighted the citizens of Tokyo with \u201cNubian lions,\u201d Bengal tigers, \u201cBrazilian cobras\u201d and feats of \u201cretro-equitation\u201d by a young lady who styled herself La Petite Roland. The empress herself attended, appearing publicly in Western dress \u2014 black silk and a white ostrich feather in her hat \u2014 for the first time. Widespread reports that one \u00adperformer had been gravely injured when, having \u201cinserted his head into the mouth of one of the tigers, the animal suddenly closed its jaws\u201d turned out to be false.Chiarini\u2019s circus received barely two lines in my final draft, but the time was not wasted. I felt the heat of that cholera-ridden summer, saw the surge in ticket sales as the cool of autumn brought an end to the epidemic. I read one editorial criticizing the clowns for condescending to their audiences with \u201cpidgin Japanese, and tiresome tomfoolery,\u201d and another expressing discomfort with the gladiatorial bloodthirstiness of the lion show. I sat alongside the other punters on a ringside bench, craning for a glimpse of the befeathered empress in the imperial box. When at last I wrenched myself away from the spectacle, it was with a deeper sense of the place and time I was trying to evoke.It\u2019s not enough to find every mention of a specific event, even though algorithms make it easy. Sometimes the telling detail \u2014 the yeast that makes the whole lump rise \u2014 isn\u2019t in the headline you\u2019re reading. It\u2019s in the gossip column on the next page, or in the classifieds tucked in the back. The author Laura Hillenbrand, housebound by chronic illness and unable to travel for her research, buys vintage newspapers on eBay. She found the story that became \u201cUnbroken\u201d when she flipped over a clipping about Seabiscuit. She steeps herself in distant decades, and her books are time machines.My book is finished, and it\u2019s time to find a new story to tell. My children are older now, and the library is calling.

As a result, investors expect little growth in the company\u2019s top line this year and are paying only about 10 times estimated 2016 earnings for the stock.The mobile digital advertising market, meanwhile, should almost triple to nearly $200 billion globally by 2019, consultants at eMarketer reckon. Alphabet\u2019s sales are forecast to grow about 15 percent this year. This wind at Alphabet\u2019s back and the possibility that its self-driving cars, robots or medical endeavors will pay off help explain why it commands a price-to-earnings multiple above 20.A subpar earnings report from Apple next week, or a strong one from Alphabet the week after, could bring a new name to the top of the world\u2019s most valuable companies list.Investors are, however, prone to overconfidence in technology trends. Facebook is snagging more and more ad dollars. European antitrust authorities are circling. Moreover, some of Alphabet\u2019s revenue comes courtesy of iPhone users: it cost Google $1 billion in 2014 to keep its search bar on the Apple device, Bloomberg reports based on transcripts of a court case.Alphabet is far more reliant on Internet advertising than Apple is on the iPhone. Ads bring in about 90 percent of the company\u2019s revenue. Any hint of investor skepticism about that market could keep Apple at the top of the list.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft to Notify Users of Government Hackings", "Date": "2015-12-31", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Microsoft says it will begin notifying users of its online services if they have been targets of suspected state-sponsored online attacks, joining a growing list of Internet companies stepping up their security policies with similar measures.Microsoft did not notify the targets of the hacking that the attacks came from state-sponsored sources, a decision that Reuters, citing unnamed former Microsoft employees, said was motivated by a desire to avoid inflaming Chinese government authorities.In a statement responding to the Reuters reporting, Microsoft said it was not sure the attacks had come from state-sponsored hackers in China. It said that at the time, it notified its customers of suspicious activity on their accounts and forced them to reset passwords, without specifying where the attacks might have come from.\u201cWe weighed several factors in responding to this incident, including the fact that neither Microsoft nor the U.S. government were able to identify the source of the attacks, which did not come from any single country,\u201d Microsoft said in the statement. \u201cWe also considered the potential impact on any subsequent investigation and ongoing measures we were taking to prevent potential future attacks.\u201dIn a blog post describing their warnings, Google declined to say exactly how it knew the attacks were state-sponsored, but said its alerts were the result of detailed analysis and victim reports. Google advised users to take additional precautions, like using stronger passwords and turning on two-step verification, which provides users with secondary codes via text messages or phone calls for accessing their accounts.An earlier version of this article misstated the timing of a Reuters report on Microsoft\u2019s handling of a 2012 hacking incident.

A classic \"New Yorker,\" in every sense of the word, Christina was a native of the Upper West Side for over 50 years. She was an avid Riverside Park\n                                        gardener, a frequent face at Fairway, and knew every sidewalk crack and crevasse of the Upper West Side. The daughter of Vera Federoff, of Ryazan, Russia, and Bertrand J. Laney, of New York City, Christina was born\n                                        in Hankow, China, on December 28, 1932, her family fleeing China in 1940, shortly after the Japanese offensive. A true explorer, Christina traveled the world with her family, attending schools in China, Panama,\n                                        El Salvador, and finally, at the University of Texas, and at New York University. It was in 1953, that Christina, in her own words, \"found her Nirvana\"-New York City. For over 30 years, she was involved\n                                        in the entertainment industry, acting in small movie and television roles, then working behind the scenes in public relations, advertising, and film production. At United Artists, Christina was the Assistant to\n                                        the Director of Special Projects for six years. She also worked for the Writer&aposs Guild. Christina was a Vice President of Women of the Motion Picture Industry, and won their Dottie Reeves Humanitarian Award\n                                        for Community Service. Christina&aposs hobbies were manifold. Her diminutive size and powerhouse personality made her a natural spelunker. She was a member of the National Speleological Society for many years.\n                                        A talented artist and poet in her own right, Christina supported Women in Motion Pictures, and the Curtain Club. She championed dozens of causes including: The Humane Society, The New York Historical Society, Sierra\n                                        Club, The Wilderness Society, World Wildlife Fund, The Nature Conservancy, and the ASPCA. Christina was a lifelong volunteer for groups such as Channel 13, The Girl Scout Council of Greater New York, and, for 50\n                                        years, the Riverside Park Conservancy, where she was honored for her volunteer contribution in her beloved garden on 78th Street and Riverside Drive. Before there was Google, there was Christina. A voracious reader\n                                        and a fount of knowledge about a myriad of subjects, especially New York City, family and friends could always rely on Christina for an irrefutable answer. Into her 80s, Christina was a brilliant, plucky, feisty\n                                        spitfire who continued to stimulate her mind by regular attendance at jazz concerts, museums, art galleries, and theater. She was a devoted sister, aunt, cousin, and friend-a tiny woman with a huge spirit, who will\n                                        be deeply missed.

{"Headline": "A Bitcoin Believer\u2019s Crisis of Faith", "Date": "2016-01-14", "News": "Supported byMike Hearn, a British computer programmer, holed up in his two-bedroom apartment in Zurich over several days and nights last week, writing a cri de coeur.Two years ago, Mr. Hearn quit a cushy programming job at Google\u2019s Swiss headquarters to devote himself full time to what was his great passion: the virtual currency Bitcoin. He was one of a handful of developers around the world dedicated to maintaining the basic software that governs both the creation of new Bitcoins and the network on which the financial transactions take place.But a nasty fight has torn apart the small brotherhood of Bitcoin developers and raised questions about the survival of the virtual currency. Mr. Hearn, until recently one of the most prominent leaders of the Bitcoin project, became so disillusioned that in December he sold the few hundred Bitcoins he had left and quietly took a job at a new start-up.The dispute \u2014 which grew out of a question about the number of transactions the Bitcoin network can handle \u2014 may sound like something of interest only to the most die-hard techies. But it has exposed fundamental differences about the basic aims of the Bitcoin project, and how online communities should be governed. The two camps have broadly painted each other as, on one side, populists who are focused on expanding Bitcoin\u2019s commercial potential and, on the other side, elitists who are more concerned with protecting its status as a radical challenger to existing currencies.The divide has led over the last six months to death threats against Bitcoin developers and hacking attacks that have taken down Internet providers. The sense of betrayal is strong on both sides. One of Mr. Hearn\u2019s primary antagonists, a bearded California-based programmer named Gregory Maxwell, also appears to have pulled back from his work on Bitcoin after receiving anonymous death threats.These internal struggles have surfaced at the same time that the Bitcoin technology is gaining credibility on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley. Throughout the various controversies that have plagued the virtual currency \u2014 including many instances of theft and fraud \u2014 the basic software has continued working as expected. That consistency has pushed the value of all outstanding Bitcoins above $6 billion and led many venture capitalists to imagine the technology as the future of finance, a cheaper and faster way to carry out financial transactions of all sorts.The current dispute, though, is a reminder that the Bitcoin software \u2014 like all computer code \u2014 is an evolving product of the human mind, and its deployment is vulnerable to human frailties and divergent ideals.There may yet be a middle ground on the question that began the fight, but for the moment the sides are deadlocked, and that has left the Bitcoin software \u2014 and the virtual currency itself \u2014 in a state of limbo. Mr. Hearn is convinced that the stalemate will soon make it hard to complete even simple transactions and will eventually drive away users and lead to a price collapse. Mr. Hearn\u2019s concerns about this impasse have been echoed, often in less strident tones, by a growing number of other developers, as well as by start-ups that buy, sell and hold Bitcoins.But Mr. Hearn is convinced it is already too late. During nighttime walks in the woods near his apartment in Zurich, he has been trying to figure out where Bitcoin went wrong and what it means for the idealistic beliefs that led him to the project in the first place.\u201cIt never occurred to me that the thing could just fall apart because of people getting crazy and having fundamental political disagreements over the goals of the project,\u201d Mr. Hearn said in a Skype interview from his apartment. \u201cIt\u2019s really shaken my faith in humanity.\u201dAt the time, Mr. Hearn was working on mapping software at Google, a job he\u2019d had since graduating from Durham University, in England. He had no professional involvement with finance or currencies, but the financial crisis convinced him that national currencies were vulnerable to politics and bad decision-making. When a web search led him to the primitive website for Bitcoin, he immediately emailed Satoshi, as the founder had become known.\u201cSo many questions,\u201d Mr. Hearn wrote. \u201cBut it\u2019s rare that I encounter truly revolutionary ideas.\u201dLike many of the programmers who took an early interest, Mr. Hearn admired the rule-bound nature of the system. Only 21 million Bitcoins would ever be created. And the distribution of new Bitcoins was clearly laid out, relying on mathematical algorithms that left no room for human meddling.Satoshi had written the software containing these rules, but after it was released, anyone could see the code and make changes. The people downloading this open-source software essentially voted on which changes to accept based on which version of the software they chose to use. If Satoshi proposed changes that they didn\u2019t like, they didn\u2019t have to download and run it, and anyone could offer an alternative. Bitcoin, like many other open-source projects, was a sort of leaderless democracy \u2014 a new way of governing human behavior online. One computer, one vote, with anyone able to propose new laws.It took a while for Bitcoin to catch on, but by late 2010, when Mr. Hearn started contributing to the code, the currency had begun developing a passionate following. The apparently leaderless structure and seamless functioning of the software won Bitcoin renown among libertarians and anarchists, and soon enough, among entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, drawn to the transparent, mathematical foundations of the project.Mr. Hearn was always a bit different from the rest of the core developers. Whereas most of them were classic techies, with patchy facial hair and ill-fitting clothes, the clean-cut Mr. Hearn had a taste for fashionable jeans and skateboard shoes \u2014 as well as an easy sociability. Within Google, Mr. Hearn became an informal spokesman for Bitcoin, answering queries from the Google co-founder Sergey Brin and leading an in-house email list discussion group that had attracted 400 employees by the time Mr. Hearn left.Mr. Hearn was also, along with Mr. Andresen, of a practical mind-set, most interested in improving the basic experience of holding and using Bitcoins. He was not given to making the big pronouncements common to the more ideological members of the community, about the currency displacing the dollar or euro. He was more focused on the immediate challenges that could trip it up.When tension cropped up among the developers, Mr. Andresen kept the peace by brokering compromises.The bonhomie began to fall apart last year because of what appeared to be a positive development: the continuing growth in the number of Bitcoin users and transactions.The problem was that, early on, Satoshi established a limit on the number of transactions that could be processed by the network every 10 minutes. The cap was meant to ensure that the computers supporting the network, and processing the transactions, would not be overwhelmed by an enormous quantity of data. But Satoshi had suggested that the limit should be temporary, and as the number of transactions coursing through the network inched closer to the cap, delays started to occur and transactions were not going through.For Mr. Maxwell, slower transactions seemed to be a secondary issue to protecting Bitcoin from centralized sources of authority.Mr. Hearn retorted that the technical issue wasn\u2019t such a big deal; ordinary computers could mostly process the larger blocks of transaction data. More important, he argued, was that Bitcoin needed to succeed first as a cheaper, faster payment network, like PayPal or Visa. If Bitcoin wanted to ever compete with mainstream payment systems, which could process tens of thousands of transactions a second, it would have to do away with Bitcoin\u2019s existing limit of fewer than seven transactions a second.The debate was complicated by the financial interests of the people involved. Mr. Maxwell and several of his supporters were then working for a Bitcoin start-up called Blockstream, with $21 million in funding from venture capitalists. Mr. Maxwell\u2019s start-up was trying to make it possible to break off some transactions from the Bitcoin network, making the number of transactions the network could handle less important.After leaving Google, Mr. Hearn had begun taking a salary for his Bitcoin work from the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, one of the most prominent supporters of Bitcoin start-ups in Silicon Valley.As the debate grew increasingly fractious, friendships among the core developers fell apart.\u201cI cannot be the decider for network-level issues,\u201d Mr. van der Laan said via email this week. \u201cNo one \u2018owns\u2019 Bitcoin. No one can decide over Bitcoin as if it\u2019s some kind of company.\u201dMr. Hearn and Mr. Andresen ultimately decided late in the summer that the only way forward was to give the vote to the people actually using the Bitcoin software. They put together their own version of the core software \u2014 largely the same as the current software, but with an allowance for more transactions \u2014 which they called Bitcoin XT. If a clear majority of the system\u2019s users downloaded the software, it would become the new law of the land \u2014 what is known in open-source terminology as a fork.Forks are part of the open-source process and had been used to make small, agreed-upon fixes to Bitcoin. But no one had tried the sort of divisive fork that Mr. Hearn and Mr. Andresen devised, largely because of the risk that it could result in two incompatible Bitcoin networks and create questions about the legitimacy and value of existing Bitcoins.The release of Bitcoin XT was viewed by Mr. van der Laan and Mr. Maxwell as an act of betrayal. Yes, it was democratic, but they said that decisions about the core software should be made by technical experts \u2014 not by populist campaigns.The fight took on a new dimension when a powerful hacker distributed Bitkiller, malicious software that sought out computers that downloaded the Bitcoin XT software and overwhelmed them with traffic. One Internet provider on Long Island said the Bitkiller attacks brought down service for part of southern Long Island for several hours. The biggest American Bitcoin company, Coinbase, was taken entirely off-line for brief periods after declaring support for XT. Not surprisingly, this scared away many Bitcoin users from downloading the new software or even declaring support for it.The hacker responsible for the attack, who appeared to be based in Russia, told Mr. Hearn in an online exchange that someone \u201cpayed me for killing XT\u201d \u2014 though he declined to say who was responsible.In the late fall, Mr. Maxwell and his supporters tried to engineer a compromise. They organized meetings in Montreal and Hong Kong where the leading developers met to discuss alternative ways to scale the Bitcoin system. Mr. Andresen went to the first of these, where Mr. Maxwell\u2019s allies announced their own, more gradual plan for increasing the network\u2019s capacity. But Mr. Andresen and Mr. Hearn both felt that the recommendations didn\u2019t go far enough. Mr. Andresen, who is not normally given to sniping, began to harden his position.\u201cIt\u2019s likely that the current developers will get fired, and some other team will replace them because they are not listening to their customers,\u201d he said in an interview last week.Mr. Maxwell was equally dismissive of Mr. Hearn\u2019s camp \u2014 saying that they had politicized what should have been a technical decision. Then he suddenly dropped out of the conversation in mid-December. He has not explained his absence, but colleagues say he was tired of the rancor.Mr. Andresen said a number of large Bitcoin companies had been asking him to come back in and lead a new version of the Bitcoin software. But if he did return to his old role, he said, he would insist on clear rules about decision-making.Mr. Hearn says he thinks that getting the opposing camps together will now be very difficult. He believes that the dangers of the current impasse have not been reflected in the price of Bitcoin because the full debate has been censored in many of the online forums where Bitcoin is discussed.Despite the discord, Mr. Hearn has not lost faith in all of the ideas behind Bitcoin. The start-up in New York where he has taken a job, R3, is developing Bitcoin-like networks for banks to enable cheaper and faster ways to trade assets of all sorts. The start-up aims to take advantage of the less-centralized record-keeping methods of Bitcoin, but still allow for someone to be in charge, to handle the software and to manage access to the system.This work lacks the purity of Bitcoin, but after months of sleepless nights, fretting about betrayed promises, he said, \u201cI want to be in a professional environment again where people are grounded in some sort of business reality.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Microsoft Acquires Minecraft App for Schools", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Supported byNow Microsoft hopes Minecraft can help it in classrooms, another area where its once-mighty grip has been shaken by companies like Google and Apple.The modifications to the game were created by a start-up, TeacherGaming, that Microsoft is not acquiring. Microsoft declined to say how much it was paying for MinecraftEdu.While Minecraft is known as a game, it is more akin to a digital sandbox, inside which players can construct anything they want, much of it out of block-shaped materials. The creative, rather than destructive, possibilities of Minecraft have caught the eyes of educators, who see it as a supplemental learning tool for everything from anatomy and earth science to math and literature.In the Santa Ana Unified School District in Orange County, Calif., for example, elementary school students in social science classes have met up inside the game and recreated the features of local historical sites they have studied, such as the Mission of San Juan Capistrano. Students in science classes there have used it to demonstrate their understanding of building circuits.Most of Minecraft\u2019s appeal is as entertainment, though. There are more than 100 million registered Minecraft players. It is the top paid app, years after the game was introduced, on the two dominant mobile app stores from Apple and Google, and is the best-selling PC game of all time, according to Microsoft. More than 160 million people have watched over five billion hours of Minecraft videos on YouTube.In short, Minecraft continues to be a huge success a year and a half after Microsoft bought Mojang, the Swedish creator of the game, for $2 billion. But it has not yet buttressed other Microsoft businesses the way company executives had hoped.Some believed, for example, that making Minecraft available for Microsoft\u2019s smartphones could give the struggling devices a lift. They are still struggling.\u201cNow that we\u2019re a little way down the road from the acquisition, it still isn\u2019t clear to me what the synergies are between Microsoft\u2019s core business and Minecraft,\u201d said Jan Dawson, an analyst at Jackdaw Research.\u201cTo be sure, Minecraft itself continues to be a very successful and popular franchise,\u201d Mr. Dawson said, \u201cbut I\u2019m not seeing any evidence that Microsoft is somehow benefiting beyond the performance of Minecraft itself as a stand-alone entity.\u201dClassrooms could be a test of whether Microsoft can use Minecraft to achieve broader company objectives.Microsoft offers productivity tools \u2014 like Office 365 Education, which includes PowerPoint and OneNote, a digital notebook system \u2014 free to teachers and students. And some teachers say they are excited about using Microsoft apps like Skype, the videoconferencing platform, as educational tools with their students.But Google has made strong inroads in schools, reporting recently that its free software program for classrooms, called Google Apps for Education, was now used by more than 50 million students, teachers and administrators worldwide. In such a competitive landscape, the positioning of Minecraft for the classroom as Minecraft: Education Edition may help Microsoft gain more visibility in schools.\u201cObviously, we want to increase the connection Microsoft has to students and teachers,\u201d said Anthony Salcito, vice president for worldwide education at Microsoft. Of products like Skype and OneNote, he added: \u201cMany of these offerings are underused by education.\u201dMicrosoft plans to charge schools $5 per student annually for access to the education edition of Minecraft \u2014 a fee that could limit how widely it is adopted. MinecraftEdu charged a server license fee and a one-time fee based on the maximum number of students who would be using the service at any one time.Microsoft executives said the company would offer volume discounts for districts that want to make the game available to all students. And they said the new edition would offer features that MinecraftEdu does not.While the previous system required schools to run a separate server for multiplayer use of the game, the new system will let students log in with their school IDs from any school computer or personal device. The new version will also update at the same time as the consumer version, a new feature.Joel Levin, a former computer teacher in New York who co-founded TeacherGaming, the start-up that created MinecraftEdu, said the emphasis on creation was what made Minecraft a compelling tool for learning.\u201cI think it wouldn\u2019t work as well as it does in classrooms if it wasn\u2019t so fun to play,\u201d Mr. Levin said. \u201cThe term \u2018chocolate-covered broccoli\u2019 is often applied to bad learning games. It\u2019s fun, so kids are engaged. That gets them in their seats.\u201dThere is little research to date to demonstrate that using Minecraft in schools directly leads to improved academic results. Researchers at the University of Maine recently announced a $2 million grant to study how the game might affect students\u2019 interest in science, math and engineering.Teachers and researchers say they believe Minecraft and other games can improve important skills that students are likely to need later on in their working lives, such as creative problem-solving, collaboration and design thinking.Minecraft, for example, could help students learn to visualize and build solutions for multilayered open-ended problems like how to cross a river when there is no bridge or how to structure Greek architecture, said Eric Klopfer, a professor of science education at Massachusetts Institute of Technology who directs the university\u2019s teacher education program.\u201cIf it\u2019s a well-defined problem, a computer can solve that,\u201d Professor Klopfer said. \u201cWe need students to be able to answer undefined problems.\u201dNick Wingfield reported from Seattle, and Natasha Singer from New York.

He would have heard a very different story about the economy of America.HUCKABEE: I wish I could introduce him the lady who cleans the building where our campaign headquarters is located in Little Rock. Her name is Kathleen (ph). She works all day at a local hospital cleaning, and then she goes to the building where a bank, and our headquarters, and other offices are she spends another seven hours. She works 15 hours a day.I guarantee you she\u2019s not working 15 hours a day because she loves scrubbing toilets, and sweeping floors. She\u2019s working that many hours because that\u2019s what it takes for her to make it work.And, she\u2019s not alone. There are people all over this country who are working like that. Many of them working two jobs \u2014 and they used to have one job, and that would take care of them. But, because of wage stagnation, which we\u2019ve had for 40 years, because the fact that they\u2019re punished for working harder if they work that many hours. The government gets more of their second shift than they do.And, as a result there are a lot of people who are hurting today. I wish the President knew more of them. He might make a change in the economy and the way he\u2019s managing it.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Thank you Governor Huckabee. Senator Santorum?SANTORUM: Well, all he has to do is listen to the Democratic debate and find out how bad the economy is. All they do is complain about the hollowing out of the middle of America, and how America is struggling so badly, and have to make these radical changes in Washington.But they\u2019ve been in control for the last seven years, and what have we seen? The most important jobs, I believe, in this country are the ones that fill the middle. For the 74% of Americans who don\u2019t have a college degree between the age of 25 and 65 are manufacturing jobs. Your governor, and your legislature, and your team here have done an amazing job of bringing manufacturing jobs back to South Carolina.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)SANTORUM: Right here. Right here in Charleston, right down in the street in Boeing (ph). You\u2019ve done a great job, and what\u2019s happened? You\u2019ve grown this economy, you\u2019ve strengthened the center of your state, the middle. That\u2019s because you know that if you\u2019re really going to create wealth and opportunity, you got to get jobs, and good paying jobs for everybody.And, so what\u2019s happened? Two million jobs, manufacturing jobs, have left this country because of Barack Obama. Regulations, EPA, workplace regulations, things driving people off-shore all because of his number one priority, global climate change.Well, let me tell you this, Mr. President. For every dollar of GDP, China creates five times as much pollution as we do here. You want to \u2014 lower global climate change, bring those jobs back to America and let American workers do that job with less pollution.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Thank you, Senator Santorum. Thank you, candidates.Moving to the world stage. The middle east is on the brink of chaos. Iran continues to provoke the United States, North Korea claims it\u2019s tested a hydrogen bomb, and Afghanistan is in danger of falling back into Taliban hands. Critics of the administration say it\u2019s all due to lack of U.S. leadership.To you, Mrs. Fiorina, how do you see America\u2019s role in the world today?FIORINA: America must lead because when we do not lead, when this exceptional nation does not lead, the world is more dangerous and a more tragic place.Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, they all refuse to lead. Worse, they refuse to respond when this nation is provoked. Hillary Clinton famously asked what difference does it make how four Americans died in Benghazi?Mrs. Clinton, here\u2019s what difference it makes. When you do not stand up and say the truth, that this was a purposeful terrorist attack, when you do not say the United States of America will retaliate for that attack, terrorists assume it\u2019s open season.We have refused to respond to every provocation. The President wouldn\u2019t even mention the fact that Iran had taken two Navy boats and our sailors \u2014 hostage. He didn\u2019t mention the fact that they violated the Geneva convention. He didn\u2019t respond to the fact that Iran launched two ballistic missile just a short time ago, in direct violation of a deal they had just signed. We didn\u2019t respond to the fact that North Korea attacked Sony Pictures.When we refuse to respond over, and over to provocation and bad behavior, we will get more provocation and bad behavior. I know most of our allies personally. I have met many of our adversaries. I know our military and our intelligence capability, and I know this. When we will not stand with our allies, when we will not respond to our adversaries, when we do not lead in the world the world is a dangerous and tragic place. I will be a Commander in Chief who will lead.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Thank you.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Well, since we\u2019ve been talking about the Middle East, Senator Santorum, conflicts between Saudi Arabia and Iran have certainly escalated, amid accusations that Saudi Arabia bombed the Iranian Embassy in Yemen after the Saudi Embassy in Tehran was attacked.As we confront an increasingly unstable Middle East, how will you, as president, navigate this administration\u2019s promises to Iran while standing by our historic allies in the region?RICK SANTORUM (R-PA), FORMER SENATOR, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, the historic promises that we have made to \u2014 to Iran in this agreement need to be torn up on the first day in office of the next president.(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: And let me tell you why, because Iran has already torn it up. Iran has not approved the agreement that President Obama has said that they have approved. They have approved a different agreement in their parliament.The fact of the matter is they have violated this agreement. Carly just mentioned some of those violations.They have launched ballistic missiles, tested them, in clear violation.And here\u2019s the pathetic part. The president announced that they were going to impose sanctions. And then President Rouhani went on Twitter and said there would be retaliation.And what did we do?We backed down.Ladies and gentlemen, there are 50 some Citadel cadets in this audience tonight.(APPLAUSE) SANTORUM: I would ask them to stand up if they will. And here\u2019s what I want to tell each and every one of them, as you stand. Here\u2019s what I want to tell them.(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: Whether it\u2019s you\u2019re watching that movie this weekend that just came out when we abandoned our men and women in Benghazi, or whether it\u2019s we treat Iran, that gave courtesies to our sailors, as they made them record a hostage video, let me tell you this, if you choose to serve this country, I will have your back. I will not let America be trampled upon anymore by these radical jihadists.REGAN: Thank you, Senator Santorum.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Governor Huckabee, in Afghanistan, the Taliban is strengthening. Attacks are on the rise and thousands more civilians have been wounded or killed. Much of the Taliban surge can be attributed to the withdrawal of U.S. forces there.You have expressed skepticism with the war there, saying you see no end game in sight.What, then, is your solution to the growing conflict there?MIKE HUCKABEE (R-AK), FORMER GOVERNOR, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Let me put that in context. When I went to Afghanistan, I saw a land that looked like the land of the Flintstones. It was desolate. It was barren. It was primitive.And it\u2019s been that way for thousands of years. They want to take the world back to be just like that.We don\u2019t.We need to make a clear goal as to why we want to be anywhere in the Middle East, and I\u2019ll tell you why we want to be and need to be, is to destroy radical Islam and everything that threatens civilization. It\u2019s not just a threat...(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: \u2014 to Israel or to America, it\u2019s a threat to every civilized person on this Earth. And we need to be equipping not only the Kurds in Iraq, we need to be making sure that those who are willing to fight radical Muslims will do it, but we need to never ever spend a drop of American blood unless there is a clearly defined goal and we can\u2019t make sure we win unless we have a military that\u2019s the strongest in the history of mankind.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.We\u2019ve got to rebuild our navy. It\u2019s the smallest navy we\u2019ve had since 1915, when my grandfather got on a destroyer in World War I when he was in the U.S. Navy. We\u2019ve got young men in Air Force B-52s, one in particular, he\u2019s flying a B-52 that his father flew in the \u201980s and his grandfather flew in the \u201950s. Those planes are older than me.We\u2019ve got to have a military that the world is afraid of, use it sparingly, but when we do, the whole world will know that America is on their tail and they will be on their tail on the ground, never ever to rise up again.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Governor Huckabee, if I could just follow-up with that.Do we need to be in Afghanistan?HUCKABEE: Only if there is a concerted effort to destroy the advance of radical Islamists who are against us. As far as what are we going to make it look like. Frankly, I don\u2019t know what we can make it look like. You can\u2019t create for other people a desire for freedom and democracy.And frankly, that is not the role of the United States. The role of the United States military is not to build schools, it is not to build bridges, it is not to go around and pass out food packets.It is to kill and destroy our enemy and make America safe and that is the purpose we should be there if we\u2019re going to be there.REGAN: Thank you Governor Huckabee.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Ms. Fiorina, nearly 600 women say they were attacked in a German city on New Year\u2019s Eve by men of Arab or North African descent and 45 percent of those alleged attacks were sexual assaults. Twenty-two of those 32 men arrested so far are asylum-seekers. Are you worried about similar problems in the United States?FIORINA: Of course I\u2019m worried about similar problems in the United States. We can not allow refugees to enter this country unless we can adequately vet them and we know we can\u2019t. Therefore we should stop allowing refugees into this country.(APPLAUSE)FIORINA: And by the way, we do not need to be lectured about why we\u2019re angry and frustrated and fearful because we\u2019ve had an illegal immigration problem in this country for 25 years.(APPLAUSE)FIORINA: And we have every right to be frustrated about the fact that politicians stand up in election after election after election and promise us to fix the problem and yet, it has never been fixed.I offer leadership that understands that actions speak louder than words, that results count. We must secure our border. We must fix our broken immigration system. We must enforce a pro-American immigration system that serves our interests, not the rest of the world. I understand what it takes to translate goals into results and that is what I will do as president of the United States. Of course, we should be worried, for heavens sakes.This administration has now told us they don\u2019t know who has overstayed a visa. This administration has told us they don\u2019t even bother to check Facebook or Twitter to find out who\u2019s pledging allegiance to jihadis. We can do better than this, citizens. We need to take our country back.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: I want to stay with you on this. The world shares a common enemy right now in the way of ISIS. Russia, the European Union, Saudi Arabia, Iran, China, we all agree ISIS is a threat and it must be stopped.During World War II, the world partnered with Joseph Stalin, who was arguably one of the most formidable \u2014 despicable figures of the 20th century. But they partnered with him to fight the Nazis.Today, everyone seems to agree we need some kind of coalition to fight ISIS. Do you agree with that? And if so, would your coalition include possibly, Russia and Iran?FIORINA: We need to be very clear-eyed now about who are our allies and who are our adversaries. In the fight against ISIS, Saudi Arabia is our ally. Iran is our adversary. And despite Donald trump\u2019s bromance with Vladmir Putin, Vladmir Putin and Russia are our adversary. We can not...(APPLAUSE)FIORINA: We can not outsource leadership in the Middle East to Iran and Russia. We must stand and lead. The Kuwaitis, the Jordanians, the Saudis, Egyptians, Bahrainis (sic), the Emirates, the Kurds. I know virtually all of these nations and their leaders. And they have asked us for very specific kinds of support: bombs, material, arms, intelligence.We are not providing any of it today. I will provide all of it. We have allies who will stand up and help us deny ISIS territory, which is what we must do to defeat them. We must deny them territory. They will help us do this. And yes, we need a coalition.But only in the United States of America can lead such a coalition. I will lead it. But we must be clear-eyed through this fight. Iran is our adversary. Russia is our adversary. We can never outsource our leadership. Only the United States of America can lead to defeat ISIS. I will.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Ms. Fiorina, thank you.SMITH: All right, thank you, candidates. We\u2019re just getting started. Jobs, Homeland Security, gun rights, all those issues are coming up straight ahead. We\u2019re live from North Charleston and the Republican Presidential Debate. We\u2019ll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Welcome back, everyone, to the Republican presidential debate. On to the next round of questions \u2014 Sandra.SMITH: All right, let\u2019s get started. Senator Santorum, to you first. President Obama has urged technology leaders to make it hard for terrorists to use technology to escape from justice. Hillary Clinton says social media companies can help by swiftly shutting down terrorist accounts.The companies say that they\u2019re already working with law enforcement and any proposed legislation would do more harm than good. Should companies like Facebook and Twitter be required by law to more actively \u2014 be more actively engaged in fighting terror?SANTORUM: I would just say that if we were doing a better job within the government, we wouldn\u2019t need the private sector to do the things that we\u2019re asking them to do.(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: I\u2019ve had a little experience in this in the private sector myself. And what I found was a government with layers and layers of bureaucracy, of people who had some technical expertise but they had no authority, number one.And one of the things I found out about in the bureaucracy is if a lot of people have authority, nobody has authority, number one. And number two, that if you don\u2019t do anything, you don\u2019t get fired.It\u2019s only when you do something and something goes wrong, you get fired. So they do nothing. And that\u2019s what is happening in our Defense Department right now. We have a capability that they\u2019re trying to develop to play defense.We have a lot of technologists that are very skilled. And they\u2019re trying to figure out how to play defense. But what we don\u2019t have is we don\u2019t have folks who are thinking about offense.We don\u2019t have war-fighters. We have technologists. Technologists are not war-fighters. Technologists are thinking, how do I protect cyber-security, how do I secure, how do I protect?SANTORUM: And we need to have a much more dynamic, how do we \u2014 how do we go after them?How do we respond?And we need leadership that\u2019s willing to make sure that when someone attacks us \u2014 and ladies and gentlemen, they\u2019re attacking us as we speak. They\u2019re attacking us all day every day, not just the government, but they\u2019re attacking private sector companies all day every day.They have to learn that we\u2019re going to pay \u2014 they\u2019re going to pay a price when they do so.And then right now, just like in every other aspect of our national security, people who attack us are not paying a price. We need a leader who will make sure that they know when they mess with America, they\u2019re going to pay a price.SMITH: Senator, would you \u2014 would you require anything of those companies like Facebook and Twitter if you were president?SANTORUM: Look, Facebook and Twitter can teach us things. We can cooperate with them. We can share ideas and information. But this is a \u2014 and this is a very dicey area for the government to go in and require the industry to do its job.It needs to develop that capability. We need to be \u2014 have responsible dialogue, but I don\u2019t think requirements are the order of the day.SMITH: Thank you, Senator.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Ms. Fiorina, the president has just issued an executive order to expand the gun laws and background checks. And none of you on stage agree with this.But recent polls show the majority of Americans are in favor of universal background checks.(BOOS)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not in this room.REGAN: It\u2019s the poll data.(CROSSTALK)FIORINA: And we all believe the polling data all the time, don\u2019t we?REGAN: So tell me...(APPLAUSE)REGAN: \u2014 why, in your view, is the president\u2019s proposal a problem?FIORINA: Oh, it\u2019s a problem for so many reasons.First of all, it is yet another lawless executive order. You see, he doesn\u2019t like the fact that Congress has rejected his ideas twice on a bipartisan basis, so he\u2019s decided he just gets to override them.Sorry, Mr. President, not the way \u201cThe Constitution\u201d works.Secondly...(APPLAUSE)FIORINA: \u2014 secondly, he basically admitted in that speech that he hasn\u2019t been paying much attention to enforcing the laws we have. He said, gee, we need a few more FBI agents. That would have helped, perhaps, stop a tragedy here in South Carolina with Dylann Roof, a guy who clearly never should have been sold a gun.In other words, Mr. President, you\u2019re right, we need to enforce the laws we have. Let\u2019s enforce the laws we have. There are criminals running around with guns who shouldn\u2019t have them. We don\u2019t prosecute any of them. Less than 1 percent.But I want to go back to the technology issue for a moment, if I may, as well, because in this regard, I disagree with Senator Santorum. Look, I come from the technology industry and I can tell you there is one thing that bureaucracies don\u2019t know how to do. They do not know how to innovate.We have come seven generations of technology since 2011. We have bureaucracies that are incapable of bringing in that innovation.So, yes, there are some very specific things that we should ask the private sector to help us with, including making sure we have the latest and greatest in algorithms to search through all these databases so that we find terrorists before they attack us, not after it\u2019s too late.And, finally, when a president who understands technology in the Oval Office. Mrs. Clinton, actually, you cannot wipe a server with a towel.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Ms. Fiorina, you\u2019ve said that was when you were CEO of HP, you actually worked with the government.FIORINA: Yes, and see...REGAN: \u2014 to try and combat some of these terrorist threats.FIORINA: As CEO of Hewlett Packard...REGAN: What did you do?FIORINA: As CEO of Hewlett Packard, I was asked very specifically for some very real help. The help I was asked to provide, this is now public information. So I am not revealing what \u2014 something that was \u2014 was classified.We had a very large shipment of equipment, software and hardware, headed to a retail outlet. And I was called by the head of the NSA, who had an urgent need for that capability, to begin laying out a program to track terrorists.History suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.We turned that truck around on a highway and it was escorted to the headquarters in San Jose.In World War II, our government went to the private sector and said, help us do things that we cannot do.The private sector has capabilities that the government does not have. There are some legal authorities that are required.The Sony attack could have been detected and repelled, had legal authorities been passed in Congress allowing private networks and public networks to work together.Those legal authorities have not yet been passed.Yes, I was asked to help.(RINGS BELL)FIORINA: I know the technology industry. They will help again. But they must be asked by a president who understands what they have.REGAN: Ms. Fiorina, thank you.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: All right, Governor Huckabee, you called President Obama\u2019s executive orders on gun control unconstitutional and completely insane.(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: (LAUGHING) Yes, I did.SMITH: You even told gun store owners to ignore the President\u2019s orders.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Yet, innocent people are dying from gun violence in cities like Detroit, Chicago, and Charleston everyday. Is there anything that can be done at the federal level to prevent guns from falling into the hands of criminals?HUCKABEE: Well, why don\u2019t we start by making sure the Justice Department never does an idiotic program like Fast and Furious where the U.S. Government put guns...(CHEERING)HUCKABEE: ...in the hands of Mexican drug lords...(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: ...and end up killing one of our border agents. You know, they want to talk about law abiding citizens, I just find it amazing the President keeps saying the gun show loophole. There is no gun show loophole. I promise you I\u2019ve been to more gun shows than President Obama.SMITH: (LAUGHING)HUCKABEE: And, I\u2019ve bought more weapons at them, and you fill out forms. The President also says things that it\u2019s easier to get a gun now than it is to grow trees. Again, I purchase guns, and I can assure you that it is much more difficult to purchase a firearm than it is to get the ingredients of a salad at the supermarket.What the President keeps pushing are ideas that have never worked. Ideas that would not have stopped San Bernadino, Sandy Hook, Aurora, and at some point you wonder if you keep retrying things that don\u2019t work, maybe we should just see if we could resell all those used lottery tickets that didn\u2019t work real well because that\u2019s the logic of just keep doing the same thing, but something that has failed. Of course, we want to stop gun violence, but the one common thing that has happened in most mass shootings is that they happened in gun- free zones where people who would have been law abiding citizens, who could have stood up and at least tried to stop it and we\u2019re not allowed to under the law.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Thank you, Governor Huckabee.REGAN: Governor Huckabee, an American in San Bernardino murdered 14 people while terrorists with Belgian and French passports murdered 130 people. Were facing a threat within our borders, and from outside the United States. Those European terrorists, they could have come here at any time given that we have a visa waiver program that enables people to travel back and forth. It exists within those countries, and 36 others.In countries around the world, including many in Europe, cannot ensure that their citizens are not jihadists, why are we waiving the visa requirement at all?HUCKABEE: Well, we shouldn\u2019t be and that\u2019s one of the reasons that I think there a lot of voices in our country who are saying it\u2019s time to relook (ph) at the visa program. The European Union is a failure, it\u2019s not allowed for even the economic goals that they were trying to achieve.But, what we\u2019re not seeing is that it\u2019s making Europe less safe, and it\u2019s proven not to be exactly what they all thought it was going to be.Our first and foremost responsibility in this country, and the first responsibility of the President of the United States is protect America, and protect Americans. We have a President who seems to be more interested in protecting the reputation and image of Islam than he is protecting us. And, I want to be very clear...(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: ...that this President.(CHEERING)HUCKABEE: Makes comments like he did the other night, that we have to be so careful because we don\u2019t want to offend Muslims. He needs to read his own FBI crime stats from last year which would show him that of the hate crimes in the country, over 5,500, about 1,100 were religious hate crimes. And, of those, 58% were directed toward Jews. Only 16% directed toward Muslims.Maybe what the President should have talked about the other night is how we ought to be more careful in the anti-semitic comments that are going toward American Jews than toward Muslims because by three times as many...(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: ...they\u2019re being targeted for religious hate crime.REGAN: If you get the visa waiver program, does that shut down international commerce?HUCKABEE: It does not shut down international commerce, but it may slow it down. And, you don\u2019t want to slowdown commerce that is making us safer. It\u2019s worth it. This lady who came and joined with the San Bernardino killer had passed three background checks, and that\u2019s why a lot of Americans didn\u2019t buy it when the President said we\u2019ll bring in Syrian refugees, but don\u2019t worry we\u2019ll check them out.We have a lot of confidence in a president who told us that we could keep our doctor, we could keep our health insurance, and cost us less, and now the latest is if you like your gun you can keep it too, and frankly, we don\u2019t buy it. We don\u2019t believe it. He\u2019s lost his credibility, and his inept...(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: ...inability to work with Congress and pass legislation has led him to do what I never even imagined doing as a governor, and that\u2019s just going and doing it my own way.MOREHUCKABEE: That\u2019s why we elect a president, is to lead, is to be able to shepherd things through. And if I can do it with a 90 percent Democrat legislature in Arkansas, there is no excuse for any president not being able to lead in Washington if he knows what the heck he is doing when he gets there.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Thank you, Governor Huckabee.SMITH: Senator Santorum, many of our military leaders believe America\u2019s critical infrastructure is vulnerable to a terrorist attack. This is the power in our homes, the water we drink, the Internet and phone systems by which we stay connected.If attacked, these essential services that underpin American society could come to a grinding halt. Do you have a specific plan to protect us from this type of attack?SANTORUM: Well, the most devastating attack that could occur is an electromagnetic pulse attack, and that would be an attack that would be triggered by a nuclear explosion in the upper atmosphere of our country.The best way to stop that from happening is to make sure that those who contemplating and actually war-gaming and talking about using it, Iran, doesn\u2019t get a nuclear weapon so they can\u2019t explode that device.(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: And the president of the United States has put Iran on a path to a nuclear weapon. And we have done nothing to do anything to harden our grid. There is actually a bill in Congress that would put money forward to try to put redundancy and harden our electric grid so it could actually survive an EMP.An EMP is a devastating explosion that sends a pulse that knocks out all electric, everything, everything that is connected to any kind \u2014 that is wired, that has a circuit board gets fried out. Everything is gone. Cars stop. Planes fall out of the sky.This is a devastating attack. And this president has done nothing, number one, to take the most probable person to \u2014 probable country to launch an attack and stop them, and has done nothing to try to defend us, particularly our electric grid. The bottom line is, I put the original sanctions on the Iranian nuclear program when I was in the United States Senate. I\u2019ve been fighting for 12 years with one thing in mind, that we must stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. And...(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: Because they\u2019re different than every other country. They do not want a nuclear weapon to defend themselves. They want a nuclear weapon to have theological ends to bring about their mahdi so they can control the world. And that is the most serious threat facing this country right now.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Senator Santorum, I want to stay with you on this, moving to jobs and the economy. In his State of the Union Address the other night, President Obama touted his record on jobs, citing more than 14 million new jobs and boasted of nearly 900,000 manufacturing jobs added in the past six years.Do you dispute his track record of creating jobs?SANTORUM: Well, the numbers just don\u2019t add up. I mean, they have not added manufacturing jobs. Manufacturing jobs have been lost in this country, 2 million of them. The bottom line is that this president has done more to take jobs away from the hard-working people who are struggling the most.And that\u2019s folks who are, as I said, the 74 percent of Americans who don\u2019t have a college degree. And they\u2019re out there talking about, well, we\u2019re going to provide free college for everybody. Well, who is going to pay for it? The 74 percent that don\u2019t have a college degree.They\u2019re not \u2014 nobody is focused. Let\u2019s just be honest, nobody is focused on the people who are struggling the most in America today. We talk about immigration. Talk about the president\u2019s immigration plan. He wants to bring in more and more people into this country. Let people who are here illegally stay in this country.Almost all of the people who are here illegally, and most of the people who came here legally over the last 20 years, they\u2019re working in wage-earning jobs. That is why wages have flat-lined.And we have unfortunately two political parties with most of the candidates in this field for some form of amnesty, some form of allowing people to stay here even though they\u2019re here illegally and for increasing levels of legal immigration.I\u2019m someone who believes that we need to be the party that stands for the American worker. And when we say we need to send people back, I mean we send people back.And let me just make one point. I was in Storm Lake, Iowa, the other day, near a Tyson\u2019s plant, 91 percent of the kids that go to the elementary school there are minority kids. And they said, well, what are you going to do with all of these people, their families, they\u2019ve lived here for a long time?I said, I\u2019m going to give them a gift. I\u2019m going to give them a gift of being able to help the country they were born in.Merge adds XXX were born in.SANTORUM: And I\u2019m going to export America, the education they were able to see. They learned English language. They learned about capitalism. They learned about democracy. You want to stop flow of immigrants?Let\u2019s send six million Mexicans, Hondurans, Guatemalans, El Savadorians...(BELL RINGS)... back into their country, so they can start a renaissance in their country so they won\u2019t be coming over here anymore.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Senator Santorum, thank you.SMITH: Governor Huckabee, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Admiral Mike Mullen, has said the greatest threat to our security is our national debt.Our national debt is now on pace to top $19 trillion. Yet, you as well as Ms. Fiorina have laid forward no plan to reform entitlements. How can you say you\u2019re going to pay down our country\u2019s debt without cutting Social Security or Medicare?HUCKABEE: Well, first of all, let\u2019s just remember that Social Security is not the government\u2019s money, it belongs to the people who had it taken out of their checks involuntarily their entire working lives.(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: For the government to say, well it is fault of working people that we have a Social Security problem, no. It is the fault of a government that used those people\u2019s money for something other than protecting those people\u2019s accounts. So let\u2019s not blame them and punish them.(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: But here is a fact, and I sometimes hear Republicans say well, we\u2019re going to have to cut this and extend the age. You know what I think a lot of times when I hear people say, well, let\u2019s make people work to their 70. That sounds great for white-collar people who sat at a desk most of their lives. You ever talk to somebody that stood on concrete floor for the first 40 years of their working life? Do you think they can stand another five years or 10 years, many of them will retired virtually crippled because they worked hard. And we\u2019re going to punish them some more? I don\u2019t think so. Here\u2019s the fact.(APPLAUSE)HUCAKBEE: Four percent economic growth, we fully fund Social Security and Medicare. Our problem is not that Social Security is just too generous to seniors. It isn\u2019t. Our problem is that our politicians have not created the kind of policies that would bring economic growth.And I still support strongly that we get rid of the 77,000 pages of the monstrous tax code...(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: ... pass the fair tax, supercharge this economy with the rocket fuel that happens with the consumption tax and we don\u2019t have to cut Social Security to any senior who has worked their lifetime for it.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Thank you, Governor Huckabee.SMITH: OK. We\u2019re going to continue this conversation. We\u2019re taking a quick break and then coming up, the candidates\u2019 plans for strengthening the middle class. We\u2019re live in North Charleston with the Republican Presidential Debate. We\u2019ll be right back.MORE(APPLAUSE)(COMMERICAL BREAK)REGAN: Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate live from North Charleston.We want to jump right back in.Sandra is kicking it off.SMITH: All right, thanks, Trish.Well, let\u2019s get started with Ms. Fiorina.Today, the middle class represents about 50 percent of the U.S. population, down from about 61 percent back in 1971. That\u2019s according to Pew Research. The same research revealed a widening income gap in America. The rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer.What will you do to strengthen a middle class that is no longer the majority?FIORINA: For decades, the professional political class in both parties has been talking about the middle class. For decades, Republicans in particular have been talking about reducing the size and scope of government, spending less money, reducing the complexity.And yet, for 40 years, the government has gotten bigger and more expensive.We now have a 75,000 plus page tax code, although politicians have run for office for decades promising reform. And all the while, middle class incomes have stagnated.You see, when government gets bigger and bigger, more powerful, the rich get richer, the poor get poorer and the middle class gets squeezed.We need to understand who the job creators are in this country, because we need more jobs to grow the middle class and to grow the wages of the middle class.Who creates jobs?Small businesses, new businesses, family-owned businesses. (APPLAUSE)FIORINA: They create two thirds of the new jobs in this country and they employ half the people.I started out typing for a nine person real estate firm. My husband Frank started out driving a tow truck for a family-owned auto body shop. And we are crushing small businesses and destroying the middle class.So here\u2019s my blueprint to take back America. Let us first actually reform the tax code from 73,000 pages down to three. There\u2019s a 20-year-old plan to do exactly that.And then let us begin piece by piece to focus on every single dollar the government spends, so that we will spend less overall and still have enough for our priorities. And that requires the government to budget the way you do at home \u2014 examine every dollar, cut any dollar, move any dollar. The fancy term for that is zero- based budgeting, but I call it common sense.Citizens, we\u2019ve got to take our country back.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Thank you, Ms. Fiorina.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Governor Huckabee, you know it used to be you could graduate from high school and get a pretty good job at the local factory, enough to take care of your family and yourself. Those days seem to be gone. It\u2019s pretty hard to do that nowadays.Businesses are increasingly turning to automation to increase their productivity levels. It\u2019s happening right here, in fact, at the Boeing factory in North Charleston.The president says automation threatens workers\u2019 ability to get higher wages.Do you agree with that?And if so, do you have a solution?HUCKABEE: Let me go back to the reason so many people are having a hard time getting ahead. The tax system punishes them.Think about this. If you work really hard and you start moving up the economic ladder, you get bumped into a different tax bracket. So the government thinks it deserves more of your hard work than you do.And it\u2019s one of the reasons that no matter how many different reforms you have to a tax on people\u2019s productivity, you\u2019re still taxing their work, their savings. You\u2019re taxing their capital gains, inheritance, dividends, you\u2019re taxing everything that produces something.And it\u2019s way I really believe it\u2019s time to do something bold, not something minute. This is no time for a tap of the hammer, a twist of the screwdriver. It\u2019s time for something big. That\u2019s why the fair tax transforms our economy.(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: And we don\u2019t punish workers. It\u2019s the only way we\u2019re going to get middle class people moving ahead again, because the harder they work, the more they keep. No payroll tax deducted from their checks. They get their entire paycheck.(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: And, one of the most important parts, it\u2019s built on the common sense with which we raised our kids, and trained dogs. You reward behavior you want more of. And, you punish behavior you want less of. That\u2019s how I raise kids, it\u2019s how I trained our dogs, and folks, it\u2019s not that difficult.We now punish the behavior we say we want more of by taxing it, and we reward the behavior that we say we want less of, so if you make a good investment, we punish you with a tax. If you make a bad investment you can write that off and the rest of the taxpayers will help subsidize you, and bail you out.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Thank you very much, Governor Huckabee.Senator Santorum, 40% of babies born today are born to single moms. That\u2019s twice as high as reported back in 1980, and it\u2019s 11 times as high as in 1940. Studies show that children are always better off economically, most often \u2014 and emotionally, with two parents in a household. From a policy perspective, should the government be doing anything to encourage family formation?SANTORUM: You know, we\u2019ve had this debate about the economy, and we haven\u2019t talked the one issue now increasingly even the right, and even the are coming to agreement. I\u2019ve run around doing 300 town hall meetings talking about a book written by a liberal Harvard sociologist, not a normal thing for me to be talking about, but I now name Robert Putnam who wrote a book called, \u201cOur Kids\u201d.And, he wrote this book, I think, ostensibly to support the Democratic argument that the middle of America\u2019s hollowing out, and income gap is widening, and rich are getting richer. When he studied all the information as to what was going on, he realized that the biggest reason that we\u2019re seeing the hollowing out of the middle of America is the breakdown of the American family.The reality is that if you\u2019re a single parent \u2014 a child of a single parent, and you grew up in a single parent family neighborhood, you went to that single parent family school, the chance of you ever, ever reaching the top 20% of income earners is 3% in America. At least \u2014 I don\u2019t know about you, but that\u2019s not good enough. And, we have been too politically correct in this country because we don\u2019t want to offend anybody to fight for the lives of our children. (APPLAUSE)You want \u2014 You want to be shocked? You read the first few chapters of Mr. \u2014 Dr. Putnam\u2019 book. He talks about Port Clinton, Ohio and growing up there in the 1950\u2019s, and how poor kids actually survived and did well, even though they were poor and disadvantaged. But, then he goes to the towns today and these kids are failing, and failing miserably. They don\u2019t even have a shot, and we won\u2019t even have the courage to have leadership at the federal level \u2014 not with legislation, but the most powerful tool a president have, the bully pulpit to encourage each and everyone of you, churches and businesses, and educators, and community leaders to let\u2019s have a national campaign to rebuild the American family, and give every child its birthright which is a Mom and a Dad who loves them.That will change this economy.(CHEERING & APPLAUSE)REGAN: Thank you.SMITH: Thank you, Senator.We\u2019re not finished yet. More Republican Presidential Debate in North Charleston after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)SMITH: Welcome back, it\u2019s time for the closing statements. Candidates will each get one minute, starting with Senator Santorum.Thank you very much, I want to thank the people of Charleston, which has become a little bit of a second home to me, because I am very privileged to have two young men who go to the Citadel here and they\u2019re here tonight, my son John and my son Daniel.(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: Ladies and gentlemen, America is frustrated and angry and looking for someone who\u2019s a fighter, but I also think they\u2019re looking for someone who\u2019s a winner. Somebody who can go out there and take on the establishment and make a difference. And take on someone who\u2019s going to be the person who\u2019s going to be between a Republican holding the presidency and that\u2019s Hillary Clinton.And there\u2019s one person on this stage, one person in the race who\u2019s done it and done it repeatedly. I\u2019ve taken on Hillary Clinton on the issues you care about. Partial-birth abortion.Go and google Rick Santorum and Hillary Clinton and there you\u2019ll see a five-minute debate. I\u2019ll let you decide who won the debate. I\u2019ll tell you who won, because we passed the bill and I know I\u2019m out of time but I\u2019m going to take some of Rand Paul\u2019s time here for a second.(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: If you\u2019re looking for someone who fought Hillary Clinton on Iran\u2019s sanctions, she was one of four who voted \u2014 who\u2019s deciding vote who voted against Iran\u2019s sanctions, so we didn\u2019t get it in place as earlier as we should have.I\u2019ve fought battles against her. In 1994, I ran against the Clinton machine. James Carville and Paul Begala, ran the race against me when I took on the author of Hillary care.And each one of those battles, I won. You want a fighter, you want a winner, I\u2019d appreciate your vote. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Thank you, Senator Santorum. Governor Mike Huckabee.HUCAKBEE: Well, Rick, I\u2019m pretty sure I did also fight the Clinton machine because every election I was ever in in Arkansas, I assure you, they were behind it, helping finance and campaign for every opponent.And I share with you the understanding that it\u2019s going to be a tough battle. But I spent the first half of my adult life in the private and nonprofit sector, raising a family, understanding how tough it is for people to make it.And that first half of my life is what led me to believe that America needs a different kind of leadership, not people who spent their whole life running from one office to the next, and living off the government dime. And I got involved because I got sick of what I saw.I also believe that there\u2019s got to be some leadership that not only addresses the monetary and military issues of this country, but the moral issues of this country. At the end of every political speech, most of us say, God bless America.But how can he do that when we continue to slaughter 4,000 babies a day?(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: And I want to be the president that treats every person, including the unborn, as a person. And protect them under the 5th and 14th amendments of the constitution. I close with this word from a gentleman in East Texas named Butel Lucre (ph). He\u2019s 100 years old and I met him down in East Texas.HUCKABEE: And he said this to me. \u201cI sure wish, Mike, we had the days when The Ten Commandments were in all of our capitals and in every school, and we prayed again.You know, he may be 100 years old, but I believe some of those old ideas to get this country back where we unapologetically get on our knees before we get on our feet might be the best solutions we\u2019ve ever sought as a country.(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: And I ask for your support and your vote.Thank you.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Thank you, Governor.REGAN: Carly Fiorina?FIORINA: My husband Frank, that I mentioned, I love spending time with. He\u2019s down there. He was real excited the other day because in New Hampshire, he was introduced as my eye candy.(LAUGHTER)FIORINA: You know, everybody out there watching knows this. You cannot wait to see the debate between me and Hillary Clinton. You would pay to see that fight.(APPLAUSE)FIORINA: And that\u2019s because you know I will win. And that\u2019s important. We\u2019ve got to start by beating Hillary Clinton.All of my life, I have been told to sit down and be quiet. Settle. Settle. Don\u2019t challenge the system.That\u2019s what the American people are being told now and we have been told that for way too long \u2014 sit down and be quiet about our God, about our guns, about the abortion industry, settle for illegal immigration that\u2019s been a problem for decades, as so many of our problems have festered for decades. Accept a system of government and politics that no longer works for us.I will not sit down and be quiet. And neither will you.So I ask you to stand with me, fight with me, vote for me, citizens. It is time to take our future back, time to take our politics back. It is time to take our government back. Citizens, it is time. We must take our country back.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Thank you to all the candidates.(CROSSTALK)REGAN: That does it, everyone for the first debate right here in North Charleston.In just about two hours from now, at 9:00 p.m. Eastern seven more candidates are going to be taking to this stage.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Shifts Online Strategy on ISIS", "Date": "2016-01-08", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration on Friday announced an overhaul of its efforts to respond to online propaganda from the Islamic State after months of acknowledgments that it had largely failed in its attempts to counter extremist recruitment and exhortations to violence on social media.The administration has emphasized that it needs the assistance of some of the nation\u2019s biggest technology companies, and a group of top White House and national security officials flew to California on Friday to plead their case with executives. In a reflection of just how urgent the White House considers the efforts, the discussions involved officials like Denis R. McDonough, the White House chief of staff; Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch; James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence; James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director; and Lisa Monaco, the president\u2019s counterterrorism adviser. They met with Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, as well as top executives from Facebook, Twitter and Google. \u201cGiven the way the technology works these days, there surely are ways that we can disrupt paths to radicalization, to identify recruitment patterns and to provide metrics that allow us to measure the success of our counter-radicalization efforts,\u201d Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said before the meeting began in California.A task force will be created in the Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department to coordinate the government\u2019s new effort. The State Department announced the creation of a center to respond to disinformation from extremist groups by highlighting their misdeeds and creating positive images of the West. It hopes to cultivate a global network of governments and nongovernmental organizations to help the effort. After the terrorist attack last year that killed 130 people in Paris, President Obama delivered a series of speeches seeking to reassure the country while demanding rapid changes within the administration to improve responses to jihadist propaganda. But the State Department has largely foundered in its efforts to fashion the kind of war room that would effectively counter the propaganda flowing out of the Islamic State, which is widely seen as adept at using social media to recruit and inspire followers.For help with these challenges, the administration turned on Friday to Silicon Valley. \u201cI do have a lot of confidence that those companies that are run by patriotic Americans are not interested in seeing their tools or their technology used by terrorists to harm innocent Americans,\u201d Mr. Earnest said.Those executives, however, are in charge of global corporations whose revenues are increasingly derived from people outside the United States. The executives have long pushed back on demands by governments to censor posts, provide access to user accounts, or hand over the keys to encryption technologies. If the companies begin to work with the government to monitor and remove posts or create antiterrorism counternarratives, they might have a harder time resisting similar requests from foreign governments.\u201cIt\u2019s a slippery slope with free speech where if you start making exceptions, where do you stop and where do you draw the line?\u201d said Emma Llanso, a director at the Center for Democracy in Technology, a think tank. She said the consequence could be an erosion of trust by consumers. That erosion of trust began in the wake of revelations from Edward J. Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor, who showed previous coordination among some technology companies with American surveillance efforts. Executives are eager to avoid a repeat.There is also the technological challenge of sifting through vast amounts of user-generated content in different languages on a growing number of platforms.Law enforcement officials for years have expressed frustration that technology companies are increasingly creating products like smartphones with encryption technologies that make it difficult, if not impossible, for the government to monitor conversations. But the discussion on Friday, while touching on encryption issues, was expected to focus largely on how social media companies could more effectively police their platforms. Some former top administration officials now work at prominent technology firms, including Jay Carney, a former White House press secretary, who is now a senior vice president at Amazon. Megan Smith, the administration\u2019s chief technology officer, who worked at Google, and Alexander Macgillivray, the administration\u2019s deputy chief technology officer, who worked at Twitter, both attended the meeting on Friday in California.\u201cThis meeting is the latest in the administration\u2019s continuing dialogue with technology providers and others to ensure we are bringing our best private and public sector thinking to combating terrorism,\u201d said Melanie R. Newman, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Thursday Night Roots, N.F.L. Revenue Grows ", "Date": "2016-01-18", "News": "Supported byTV SportsWhatever its problems, the N.F.L. possesses a wizardly skill at conjuring up new money.Millions more are likely to flow from a possible deal to stream all three London games next season. Eventually, streaming rights will become a very big profit center.The money magic has, of late, come from the \u201cThursday Night Football\u201d package, and more will soon flow with a new deal, for at least the 2016 season, to be announced before the Super Bowl.For eight years, the N.F.L. put its Thursday night games solely on NFL Network rather than sell them to an established network that was willing to pay bundles. Still, having the games enabled the channel to raise its profile and allowed it to increase its monthly subscriber fees.But when the league felt compelled to reach a wider audience and turn Thursdays into a pro football night (college football had already done something similar), it solicited broadcasters that could promote the games to a general audience far larger than the cable niche that NFL Network serves. CBS bought the rights in 2014 for $275 million and renewed them in 2015 for $300 million. The network televised eight of the games and simulcast them on NFL Network. The remaining eight games were exclusive to NFL Network. CBS produced all 16 and put its lead announcers, Jim Nantz and Phil Simms, on the broadcasts.The deal has worked. The eight games CBS carried averaged 17.6 million viewers in 2015, up from 16.1 million a year earlier. The comparable games on NFL Network had eight million watching in 2013.CBS deserves consideration to retain the Thursday night deal, having marketed the games as promised and more than doubling viewership. It used its Thursday night stalwart comedy, \u201cThe Big Bang Theory,\u201d to strengthen its Monday night schedule. Making sure the free world knew it had Thursday night games became a major companywide priority at CBS.But there is logic in the league\u2019s shopping it to another buyer to see, if nothing else, which one it might sell a long-term deal to, whenever that happens.NBC seems to have a strong case to succeed CBS because it would be able to use the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, which start Aug. 5, as a promotional platform for the games on multiple channels and online. That heavy promotion would end in 17 days, a few weeks before the N.F.L. season starts. Still, if the league wants to keep building preseason awareness, the Olympics would be a valuable tool. And NBC is familiar with Thursdays; it televises the opening-night game on Thursday, so adding eight games would provide continuity through late October.NBC and CBS are strong in prime time. NBC is ranked No. 1 among viewers 18 to 49. CBS is the most-viewed over all.If any of the networks has a reason to overbid for the Thursday night games, it would be Fox. It is the least viewed of the Big Four networks and is ranked third this season in the 18-to-49 demographic.There is another option that the league is exploring, said two people familiar with the negotiating who were not authorized to speak publicly.Expand the package to 10 games and split them between two networks. In that way, two networks would be marketing Thursday nights, just as two networks promote and televise Sunday afternoons.It has been clear since 2014 that the league has used the sale of Thursday night games as an annual experiment in which it declined to commit to a long-term solution as the media landscape changed, between cord-cutting and myriad digital alternatives.The league\u2019s Sunday and Monday deals with CBS, Fox, NBC and ESPN cannot be changed through the early 2020s, but the Thursday package is an evolving project that could be sold to a nontraditional outlet like Google. As Brian Rolapp, the league\u2019s executive vice president for media, said in 2015, \u201cIn this day and age, to lock into one model isn\u2019t the smartest thing anymore.\u201d\u0095After a negative reaction to the way it presented an NFL Films reconstruction of Super Bowl I that included a panel talking during the action, NFL Network will replay the game\u00a0Friday\u00a0at\u00a08 p.m. Eastern without interruptions for analysis or ancillary programming. The network had built a three-hour program around the game last Friday, with pregame, halftime and postgame shows and as many as seven commentators talking over the original NBC radio call by Jim Simpson and George Ratterman.Email: sandor@nytimes.com Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "General Motors, Gazing at Future, Invests $500 Million in Lyft", "Date": "2016-01-04", "News": "Supported byG.M.\u2019s support includes more than financial backing. As part of the investment, G.M. and Lyft will work on developing an on-demand network of self-driving cars, an area of research that companies like Google, Tesla and Uber have all devoted enormous resources to in recent years.G.M. will also work with Lyft to set up a series of short-term car rental hubs across the United States, places where people who do not own cars can pick up a vehicle and drive for Lyft to earn money. Daniel Ammann, president of G.M., will join the board of Lyft, which is based in San Francisco.\u201cWe strongly believe that autonomous vehicle go-to-market strategy is through a network, not through individual car ownership,\u201d John Zimmer, president of Lyft, said in an interview.G.M.\u2019s $500 million interest in Lyft is the single largest direct investment by an auto manufacturer into a ride-hailing company in the United States, according to data from PitchBook, an alliance that pairs an auto stalwart with the kind of start-up trying to disrupt it. The investment reflects how much consumer automotive habits have been changed by technology over the last decade. With the rise of ride-sharing companies, car manufacturers have raced to adapt to how people can now use each other\u2019s vehicles for rides, which could potentially lead to a decline in car ownership.In an interview, Mr. Ammann said G.M. wanted to be part of the changing business models in transportation. \u201cWe think there\u2019s going to be more change in the world of mobility in the next five years than there has been in the last 50,\u201d he said.Mr. Ammann added that the core profit from G.M.\u2019s business comes from cars sold outside the urban environments where Lyft primarily operates, especially sales of sport utility vehicles in suburban areas.\u201cFrom a G.M. perspective, we view this as much more of an opportunity than a threat,\u201d he said.G.M.\u2019s investment is also a vote of confidence in Lyft, which faces a competitive ride-hailing field. Founded in 2012, Lyft helped promote the ride-sharing craze in the United States, positioning itself as a superior alternative to owning a car or using public transportation. Lyft users can summon a private or shared car with a few taps of an app.Lyft and G.M. did not give a specific timeline for when they expected their autonomous vehicle network to become publicly available, nor did the companies offer details on how the network is expected to function.A mix of Lyft\u2019s existing investors, including the Asian e-commerce giants Rakuten and Alibaba, also contributed to the most recent financing round, as did the Chinese ride-hailing start-up Didi Kuaidi.An earlier version of this article misstated the number of countries in which Uber operates. It is 67, not 68.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Adele Album Resists the Streaming Trend in Music Sales", "Date": "2016-01-05", "News": "Supported byFor the last few years, the prevailing theme in the recorded music business has been that CD and download sales were plunging while streaming has shot up quickly, as listening habits shift online.Last year, 241.4 million albums were sold in the United States, down 6 percent from 2014, according to data released on Tuesday by Nielsen. CDs, once the music industry\u2019s most powerful profit engine, declined to just 125.6 million units last year, a decline of 11 percent from 2014 and 82 percent from their peak in 2001. Nielsen tracks the number of units sold, but not their sales revenue.Downloads of complete albums last year dropped 3 percent to 103.3 million, and downloads of individual songs fell 12.5 percent to 964.8 million, dipping below one billion for the first time since 2007.At the same time, streaming activity nearly doubled in 2015. On-demand audio and video streams on outlets like Spotify, YouTube and Apple Music \u2014 which, unlike radio services, allow users to pick exactly what songs to listen to \u2014 were up 93 percent, to 317.2 billion songs played. Of those, 144.9 billion were audio-only streams. These services, which also include Tidal, Rhapsody and Google Play, let people listen online to millions of songs for subscriptions of $10 or less, or free with advertising.The album was Adele\u2019s first in nearly five years, and was promoted through television appearances, but \u2014 in another break with what has become standard practice in pop \u2014 the singer herself was relatively quiet on social media. According to Nielsen, 62 percent of Adele\u2019s fans are female, and 67 percent are age 35 or older.No other album came close to Adele\u2019s sales. The second-biggest, Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201c1989,\u201d which was released in late 2014, sold 1.99 million copies last year.

{"Headline": "Global Tensions Threaten to Upstage World Economic Forum in Davos", "Date": "2016-01-18", "News": "Supported byTensions reminiscent of the Cold War keep flaring with Russia and in the Middle East \u2014 not to mention over the Korean Peninsula. Europe is struggling to cope with a refugee crisis that risks fracturing the European Union, even as the bloc tries to counter a rising security threat from the Islamic State. Britain may vote this year on whether to leave the European Union altogether. And China\u2019s growth slowdown could prompt the second global financial crisis within a decade.Given those strains, the official Davos theme this time \u2014 \u201cMastering the Fourth Industrial Revolution\u201d \u2014 may sound oddly out of tune, and the various panels on the topic could prove to be little more than sideshows.Klaus Schwab, the World Economic Forum\u2019s founder and one of the best-connected men on the planet, is nonetheless using the forum\u2019s website to urge the cadre of bankers, politicians, tech executives and trend makers to ponder \u201cthe fusion of technologies across the physical, digital and biological worlds, which is creating entirely new capabilities and dramatic impacts on political, social and economic systems.\u201dThe big-thought themes of Davos often billow above current events. Last year, the topic was \u201cThe New Global Context,\u201d a reference to shifting political, economic and social forces in the world. The year before focused on the \u201cReshaping of the World.\u201d If such banners are somewhat elusive, so, too, is the gathering\u2019s ability to map solutions to more immediate problems.But then, problem-solving is not really the point. More than anything, Davos, at about 5,120 feet, is about high-altitude networking.The forum is where hedge fund managers, central bankers, chief executives, social-media magnates, heads of state, self-help gurus, artists, celebrities, fashion models and even archbishops engage in the equivalent of intellectual or corporate speed dating. If all goes well, they may pry open a possible business deal, pad out a contact list or maybe receive enlightenment about affairs outside their professional expertise.Many deal makers retreat to hotel suites for much of the conference, forsaking the official program in favor of a whirl of meetings, emerging only to attend private parties in exclusive chalets on the Davos slopes or invitation-only power dinners.This year\u2019s tech luminaries are to include Jack Ma, the head of China\u2019s online retail giant Alibaba; John T. Chambers, the chief of Cisco Systems, the Internet hardware maker; Eric E. Schmidt, executive chairman of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company; and Sheryl K. Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook.And then there are the captains of the financial industry, including Jamie Dimon, the head of JPMorgan Chase; Gary D. Cohn, Goldman Sachs\u2019s chief operating officer; and top executives from most of the world\u2019s major banks.Also on hand will be a host of regulators who oversee the big banks, including Jacob J. Lew, the United States Treasury secretary, as well as an influential coterie of central bankers who determine monetary policy, including Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank.Foremost among their concerns this year may be whether problems in China, whose rapidly slowing economy has rattled stock and commodity markets around the world, could cause a relapse into global financial instability just as Europe and the United States are recovering from the last crisis. No clear remedies are likely to emerge from Davos, though, because top leaders from China, as in years past, will not be present.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France are conspicuously avoiding the gathering this year, judging it more effective to grapple with pressing problems back home.And then there is the controversy surrounding North Korea. Last fall, the conference organizers took the unusual step of inviting a delegation from Pyongyang. But shortly after North Korea trumpeted a nuclear bomb test on Jan. 5, the Davos organizers disinvited the delegates \u2014 prompting North Korean officials to declare the snub \u201cseriously unjust.\u201dAnd yet, in the honeycomb of private side rooms inside the old nuclear bunker where the main conference takes place, or on the leather couches of the nearby five-star Belvedere Hotel, a favorite place for private dinners and parties, there are always opportunities for key players to make progress on thorny subjects.This year, for instance, Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, is expected to meet on the sidelines with Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of Greece, who defied the fund and Europe\u2019s political elite for many months last year over the terms of a multibillion-euro bailout, risking his country\u2019s exit from the eurozone. More recently, Mr. Tsipras, having turned from a defender of the poor to a mainstream leader eager to save Greece from further financial turmoil, is expected to try to persuade Ms. Lagarde to send more of the fund\u2019s money to Athens.And even if no big policy breakthroughs are achieved, at least there will be star power. Justin Trudeau, the youthful new Canadian prime minister, will give a keynote address aiming to sell a fresh image of Canada to the world.The stalwarts will continue to show up, including Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, who may be pressing his case that Britain should stay in the European Union if the bloc is willing to cut his country a new deal. From the United States, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is leading a delegation including Secretary of State John Kerry and Ashton Carter, the secretary of defense.As for the movers and shakers who have not had time to brush up on this year\u2019s official theme \u2014 how artificial intelligence and robotics are changing humanity \u2014 Mr. Schwab, the forum\u2019s founder, has conveniently published a new book, \u201cThe Fourth Industrial Revolution.\u201dA link on the World Economic Forum\u2019s website whisks readers to Amazon, where the 4,300-kilobyte e-book can be purchased for about $8 \u2014 a digital value that no billionaire should be able to resist.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Larry Page\u2019s Obsessions Became Google\u2019s Business", "Date": "2016-01-22", "News": "Supported byThree years ago, Charles Chase, an engineer who manages Lockheed Martin\u2019s nuclear fusion program, was sitting on a white leather couch at Google\u2019s Solve for X conference when a man he had never met knelt down to talk to him.They spent 20 minutes discussing how much time, money and technology separated humanity from a sustainable fusion reaction \u2014 that is, how to produce clean energy by mimicking the sun\u2019s power \u2014 before Mr. Chase thought to ask the man his name.\u201cHe didn\u2019t have any sort of pretension like he shouldn\u2019t be talking to me or \u2018Don\u2019t you know who you\u2019re talking to?\u2019\u201d Mr. Chase said. \u201cWe just talked.\u201dLarry Page is not a typical chief executive, and in many of the most visible ways, he is not a C.E.O. at all. Corporate leaders tend to spend a good deal of time talking at investor conferences or introducing new products on auditorium stages. Mr. Page, who is 42, has not been on an earnings call since 2013, and the best way to find him at Google I/O \u2014 an annual gathering where the company unveils new products \u2014 is to ignore the main stage and follow the scrum of fans and autograph seekers who mob him in the moments he steps outside closed doors.But just because he has faded from public view does not mean he is a recluse. He is a regular at robotics conferences and intellectual gatherings like TED. Scientists say he is a good bet to attend Google\u2019s various academic gatherings, like Solve for X and Sci Foo Camp, where he can be found having casual conversations about technology or giving advice to entrepreneurs.Mr. Page is hardly the first Silicon Valley chief with a case of intellectual wanderlust, but unlike most of his peers, he has invested far beyond his company\u2019s core business and in many ways has made it a reflection of his personal fascinations.He intends to push even further with Alphabet, a holding company that separates Google\u2019s various cash-rich advertising businesses from the list of speculative projects like self-driving cars that capture the imagination but do not make much money. Alphabet companies and investments span disciplines from biotechnology to energy generation to space travel to artificial intelligence to urban planning.Investors will get a good look at the scope of those ambitions on Feb. 1, when the company, in its fourth-quarter earnings report, will disclose for the first time the costs and income of the collection of projects outside of Google\u2019s core business.As chief executive of Alphabet, Mr. Page is tasked with figuring how to spin Google\u2019s billions in advertising profits into new companies and industries. When he announced the reorganization last summer, he said that he and Sergey Brin, Google\u2019s other founder, would do this by finding new people and technologies to invest in, while at the same time slimming down Google \u2014 now called Google Inc., a subsidiary of Alphabet \u2014 so their leaders would have more autonomy.\u201cIn general, our model is to have a strong C.E.O. who runs each business, with Sergey and me in service to them as needed,\u201d Mr. Page wrote in a letter to investors. He said that he and Mr. Brin would be responsible for picking those chief executives, monitoring their progress and determining their pay.Google\u2019s day-to-day management was left to Sundar Pichai, the company\u2019s new chief executive. His job will not be about preventing cancer or launching rocket ships, but to keep Google\u2019s advertising machine humming, to keep innovating in emerging areas like machine learning and virtual reality \u2014 all while steering the company through a thicket of regulatory troubles that could drag on for years.Mr. Page\u2019s new role is part talent scout and part technology visionary. He still has to find the chief executives of many of the other Alphabet businesses.And he has said on several occasions that he spends a good deal of time researching new technologies, focusing on what kind of financial or logistic hurdles stand in the way of them being invented or carried out.His presence at technology events, while just a sliver of his time, is indicative of a giant idea-scouting mission that has in some sense been going on for years but is now Mr. Page\u2019s main job.In the investor letter, he put it this way: \u201cSergey and I are seriously in the business of starting new things.\u201dMr. Page has always had a wide range of interests. As an undergraduate at the University of Michigan, he worked on solar cars, music synthesizers and once proposed that the school build a tram through campus. He arrived at Stanford\u2019s computer science doctorate program in 1995, and had a list of initial research ideas, including self-driving cars and using the web\u2019s many hyperlinks to improve Internet search. His thesis adviser, Terry Winograd, steered him toward search.\u201cEven before he came to Stanford he was interested in cool technical things that could be done,\u201d Mr. Winograd said. \u201cWhat makes something interesting for him is a big technical challenge. It\u2019s not so much where it\u2019s headed but what the ride is like.\u201dInside Google, Mr. Page is known for asking a lot of questions about how people do their jobs and challenging their assumptions about why things are as they are. In an interview at the Fortune Global Forum last year, Mr. Page said he enjoyed talking to people who ran the company\u2019s data centers.\u201cI ask them, like, \u2018How does the transformer work?\u2019 \u2018How does the power come in?\u2019 \u2018What do we pay for that?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m thinking about it kind of both as an entrepreneur and as a business person. And I\u2019m thinking \u2018What are those opportunities?\u2019\u201dAnother question he likes to ask: \u201cWhy can\u2019t this be bigger?\u201dMr. Page declined multiple requests for comment, and many of the people who spoke about him requested anonymity because they were not supposed to talk about internal company matters.Many former Google employees who have worked directly with Mr. Page said his managerial modus operandi was to take new technologies or product ideas and generalize them to as many areas as possible. Why can\u2019t Google Now, Google\u2019s predictive search tool, be used to predict everything about a person\u2019s life? Why create a portal to shop for insurance when you can create a portal to shop for every product in the world?But corporate success means corporate sprawl, and recently Google has seen a number of engineers and others leave for younger rivals like Facebook and start-ups like Uber. Mr. Page has made personal appeals to some of them, and, at least in a few recent cases, has said he is worried that the company has become a difficult place for entrepreneurs, according to people who have met with him.Part of Mr. Page\u2019s pitch included emphasizing how dedicated he was to \u201cmoonshots\u201d like interplanetary travel, or offering employees time and money to pursue new projects of their own. By breaking Google into Alphabet, Mr. Page is hoping to make it a more welcoming home for employees to build new businesses, as well as for potential acquisition targets.It will also rid his office of the kind of dull-but-necessary annoyances of running a major corporation. Several recently departed Google staff members said that as chief executive of Google, Mr. Page had found himself in the middle of various turf wars, like how to integrate Google Plus, the company\u2019s struggling social media effort, with other products like YouTube, or where to put Google Now, which resided in the Android team but was moved to the search group.Such disputes are a big reason Mr. Page had been shedding managerial duties and delegating the bulk of his product oversight to Mr. Pichai, these people said. In a 2014 memo to the company announcing Mr. Pichai\u2019s promotion to product chief, Mr. Page said the move would allow him to \u201cfocus on the bigger picture\u201d at Google and have more time to get the company\u2019s next generation of big bets off the ground.People who have worked with Mr. Page say that he tries to guard his calendar, avoiding back-to-back meetings and leaving time to read, research and see new technologies that interest him.Given that he is worth in the neighborhood of $40 billion and created the world\u2019s most famous website, Mr. Page has the tendency to attract a crowd when he attends technology events. At last year\u2019s Darpa Robotics Challenge, he was trailed closely by a handler who at times acted as a buffer between Mr. Page and would-be cellphone photographers. That commotion could annoy anyone, but it is particularly troubling for Mr. Page, who, because of damaged vocal cords, speaks just above a whisper and sometimes uses a microphone in small meetings.At home in Palo Alto, Mr. Page tries to have the most normal life possible, driving his children to school or taking his family to local street fairs, according to people who know him or have seen him at such events.And at Google, even events that are decidedly not normal aspire to a kind of casualness. Take the Camp, an exclusive and secretive event that Google holds at a resort in Sicily and where invitees have included Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla Motors and SpaceX, Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, and Tory Burch, the fashion designer.One attendee, who asked to remain anonymous because guests were not supposed to discuss the gathering, recalls being surprised by how much time Mr. Page spent with his children.In public remarks, Mr. Page has said how important his father, Carl V. Page, a computer science professor at Michigan State University who died in 1996, was to his choice of career.\u201cMy dad was really interested in technology,\u201d Mr. Page said at Google I/O in 2013, the last time he took the stage at the event. \u201cHe actually drove me and my family all the way across the country to go to a robotics conference. And then we got there and he thought it was so important that his young son go to the conference, one of the few times I\u2019ve seen him really argue with someone to get in someone underage successfully into the conference, and that was me.\u201dPeople who work with Mr. Page or have spoken with him at conferences say he tries his best to blend in, and, for the most part, the smaller groups of handpicked attendees at Google\u2019s academic and science gatherings, tend to treat him like a peer.The scope of his curiosity was apparent at Sci Foo Camp, an annual invitation-only conference that is sponsored by Google, O\u2019Reilly Media and Digital Science.The largely unstructured \u201cunconference\u201d begins when each of its attendees \u2014 an eclectic batch of astronomers, psychologists, physicists and others \u2014 write something that interests them on a small card and then paste it to a communal wall. Those notes become the basis for breakout talks on topics like scientific ethics or artificial intelligence.The last conference was held during a weekend in June on Google\u2019s Mountain View, Calif., campus, and Mr. Page was there for most of it. He did not host or give a speech, but mingled and went to talks, just like everyone else. That impressed investors and computer scientists who did not expect to see so much of him, but researchers who had come from outside Silicon Valley barely noticed.\u201cI have a vague memory that some founder type person was walking through the crowd,\u201d said Josh Peek, an assistant astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore.Another benefit of these gatherings for the reserved Mr. Page is that they are mostly closed to the news media.When Mr. Page does talk in public, he tends to focus on optimistic pronouncements about the future and Google\u2019s desire to help humanity. Asked about current issues, like how mobile apps are challenging the web or how ad blockers are affecting Google\u2019s business, he tends to dismiss it with something like, \u201cPeople have been talking about that for a long time.\u201dLately, he has talked more about his belief that for-profit companies can be a force for social good and change. During a 2014 interview with Charlie Rose, Mr. Page said that instead of a nonprofit or philanthropic organization, he would rather leave his money to an entrepreneur like Mr. Musk.Of course, for every statement Mr. Page makes about Alphabet\u2019s technocorporate benevolence, you can find many competitors and privacy advocates holding their noses in disgust. Technology companies like Yelp have accused the company of acting like a brutal monopolist that is using the dominance of its search engine to steer consumers toward Google services, even if that means giving the customers inferior information.It is hard to imagine how even the most ambitious person could hope to revolutionize so many industries. And Mr. Page, no matter how smart, cannot possibly be an expert in every area Alphabet wants to touch.His method is not overly technical. Instead, he tends to focus on how to make a sizable business out of whatever problem this or that technology might solve. Leslie Dewan, a nuclear engineer who founded a company that is trying to generate cheap electricity from nuclear waste, also had a brief conversation with Mr. Page at the Solve For X conference.She said he questioned her on things like modular manufacturing and how to find the right employees.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a nuclear background, but he knew the right questions to ask,\u201d said Dr. Dewan, chief executive of Transatomic Power. \u201c\u2018Have you thought about approaching the manufacturing in this way?\u2019 \u2018Have you thought about the vertical integration of the company in this way?\u2019 \u2018Have you thought about training the work force this way?\u2019 They weren\u2019t nuclear physics questions, but they were extremely thoughtful ways to think about how we could structure the business.\u201dDr. Dewan said Mr. Page even gave her an idea for a new market opportunity that she had not thought of. Asked to be more specific, she refused. The idea was too good to share.Doris Burke contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "G.E. Is Moving Headquarters to Boston and Itself Into the Digital Era", "Date": "2016-01-13", "News": "Supported byYet Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chief executive, predicted last September that G.E. would be a \u201ctop 10 software company\u201d by 2020. In recent years, the company has steadily built up its software business, and its industrial products are increasingly loaded with digital sensors, all part of an effort to be a leader in the \u201cindustrial Internet.\u201dNow, in its latest step to remake itself \u2014 and its public image \u2014 as an industrial company for the digital era, G.E. said it was moving its headquarters from its longtime sprawling suburban home in Fairfield, Conn., to the high-tech environs of Boston.The relocation by G.E., long a bellwether of the American economy, illustrates how much old-line companies in nearly every industry have been forced to rethink their businesses for a digital age. It is an opportunity, but also a threat. So Walmart is investing heavily in online commerce to meet the challenge from Amazon, and Ford and General Motors are retooling to keep up with innovators like Tesla and Google.The Boston region, Mr. Immelt said, is \u201can ecosystem that shares our aspirations.\u201dThe area is crowded with 55 colleges and universities, including research centers like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard and Northeastern University. G.E. said it was also attracted by the area\u2019s thriving venture capital and start-up community, and pro-business state and local government.In Fairfield, G.E. has about 800 employees, a tiny percentage of its 360,000 employees worldwide. In Boston, G.E. will also have 800 people, but it will have a different kind of headquarters setting, the company said.Only about 200 will be corporate staff, G.E. said, while the remaining 600 will be mainly \u201cdigital industrial product managers, designers and developers\u201d in a variety of disciplines including data analysis, life sciences and robotics.The new headquarters will be leaner, faster and more open with a constant flow of industry partners, customers and innovators, G.E. executives say. The intent, they say, is that it will be more like walking into a start-up in an urban setting than the remote suburban headquarters of the past.The move fits the recent pattern at G.E., analysts say. \u201cIt affirms G.E.\u2019s digital technology orientation and that strategic commitment for decades ahead,\u201d said Steven Winoker, an analyst at Bernstein Research.For years already, G.E. has been at the forefront of industrial companies seeking to use sensor data and clever software to make its machines smarter, using less fuel and predicting when they need maintenance before breakdowns occur. Executives routinely call it \u201can industrial digital business.\u201dG.E.\u2019s digital push is part of the company\u2019s evolution, as it has focused its investment on the industrial side of its business while sharply cutting its once-huge finance arm in the wake of the financial crisis. In 2011, G.E. opened a separate software unit in San Ramon, Calif., which employs 2,000.The company moved to Fairfield in 1974, when many major companies were leaving New York City for suburbia with its lower taxes and living costs, and good public schools. G.E. first said it was weighing moving its headquarters last June, after Connecticut proposed raising taxes on businesses to close the state budget gap.That prompted G.E. to address the issue with urgency but, in its statement on Wednesday, G.E. said its senior management had been considering the appropriate role and location of its headquarters for more than three years.G.E. has not identified the address of its new headquarters, but the company said it would be in the Seaport District in South Boston, which is becoming a hub for investment by technology, biomedical and pharmaceutical companies.Massachusetts and Boston are offering an ample package of incentives. In news releases welcoming G.E., Gov. Charlie Baker and Mayor Martin J. Walsh said the state offered incentives of as much as $120 million through grants and other programs, and the city offered as much as $25 million in property tax relief.The city and state also agreed to make transportation improvements in the Seaport District and to build an innovation center where G.E. and university researchers can collaborate.Employees will move to a temporary location in Boston starting this summer, G.E. said, with the permanent move completed by 2018.G.E. said that the financial incentives from state and city governments vying for its headquarters were competitive. In the financial negotiations, G.E. wanted incentives and grants to make the move itself essentially cost-free for the company, said a person involved in the talks who was not authorized to speak publicly. But G.E. did not seek tax deals that would continue year after year, he said.In its statement, G.E. said it began its search with an initial list of 40 locations. San Francisco was ruled out partly because of its high living costs, and the longer time difference \u2014 by three hours, compared with the East Coast \u2014 in communicating with G.E.\u2019s units in Europe, where the company has a sizable business. Other cities, including New York, made strong bids, but in the end it was Boston, the person involved in the talks said. G.E. did not estimate the extent of the job losses in Connecticut as a result of the move. The company employs 5,000 people in the state, including the 800 at its headquarters.Jess Bidgood contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ted Cruz\u2019s Evangelical Gamble", "Date": "2016-01-26", "News": "FeatureThe candidate\u2019s strategy to win the White House depends on turning out millions of new religious voters.Supported byIn retrospect, the pastor\u2019s speech that day might be seen as the first (albeit subtle) public move in the eventual bid for the presidency by his son. Already Ted Cruz\u2019s strategists were discussing a run. His longtime adviser Jason Johnson would go on to spend most of 2014 researching how Republicans had won and lost presidential elections, while the senator appeared at various Iowa fund-raising events. When word began to circulate in March 2015 that Marco Rubio and Rand Paul would be announcing their candidacies sometime in April, by the end of the Senate recess, Cruz\u2019s game plan started to emerge. They set their sights on a date in late March, which would allow Cruz to dominate the news and draw a quick infusion of campaign money for at least a week before attention turned to Rubio and Paul. Needing to move quickly, and not wanting to tip off the opposition, Cruz\u2019s senior staff sought out a telegenic venue where a heavily conservative audience could be assembled on a moment\u2019s notice.That was how, 16 months after his father took the stage there, Ted Cruz became the first politician to launch a presidential campaign at Liberty \u2014 the largest Christian university in the world, with an enrollment of 77,000 students. His March 23 speech, which he hand-scribbled the evening before and delivered without benefit of notes or a teleprompter, included this pivotal thought: \u2018\u2018Today, roughly half of born-again Christians aren\u2019t voting. They\u2019re staying home. Imagine instead millions of people of faith all across America coming out to the polls and voting our values.\u2019\u2019 That exhortation, an echo of his father\u2019s plea to \u2018\u2018vote for righteous people,\u2019\u2019 reflected the Cruz team\u2019s key political calculation: Of the 22 states that will be casting their ballots for a Republican nominee between Feb. 1 and March 5, 11 of them feature a Republican electorate that is more than 50 percent evangelical. Even more significant, the first state to vote is Iowa, roughly 60 percent of whose Republican caucus-goers describe themselves as evangelical Christians. As had been the case in recent election cycles, if Cruz could persuade this voting bloc to coalesce around him, then in this crowded field of Republican candidates he would almost certainly emerge the winner in Iowa. And unlike previous caucus winners, Cruz was already building a formidable national campaign organization that could capitalize on an Iowa victory and propel him toward the nomination.One morning early in January, in the lobby of a public library in Onawa, Iowa, I listened to Cruz\u2019s campaign manager, Jeff Roe, as he explained a central challenge of his previous few months. \u2018\u2018Prior to March 23,\u2019\u2019 Roe said, \u2018\u2018if you were to word-cloud \u2018Ted Cruz,\u2019 which we do every day \u2014 take all the Google mentions and Internet searches, dump them into a file and form a cloud \u2014 you can\u2019t find \u2018evangelical.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 In other words, voters were largely unaware of the Tea Party firebrand\u2019s religious faith. To convince evangelicals that Ted Cruz was the \u2018\u2018righteous\u2019\u2019 candidate, Roe told me, his team needed to sell him as such, from the very beginning: \u2018\u2018Regardless of what you\u2019ve got in the bank, you\u2019d better determine the narrative of the campaign, and show that\u2019s who we are, every day.\u2019\u2019Behind the scenes, Cruz and his team were in fevered competition with Rubio, Ben Carson, Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum to lock down the evangelical vote. The Cruz campaign courted movement leaders like Dr. James Dobson, who formally endorsed Cruz on Dec. 17 and joined the candidate on the Iowa campaign trail soon after. Eleven days after Dobson\u2019s endorsement, the Texas political activist and longtime Cruz supporter David Barton gathered about 300 \u2018\u2018faith leaders\u2019\u2019 for a meet-and-greet with Cruz at the ranch of the Republican billionaire Farris Wilks in Cisco, Tex. \u2018\u2018He was with them six hours, and about an hour and 20 minutes of that was nothing but prayer, and Ted was right in the middle of it,\u2019\u2019 Barton told me. \u2018\u2018The spiritual leaders wanted to pray for the country, and he was completely comfortable with that, and that was a pleasant surprise to many of them.\u2019\u2019As a fund-raiser, Ted Cruz has given victory-starved evangelicals some cause to believe that his campaign is, as the Iowa conservative talk radio host and Cruz supporter Steve Deace puts it, \u2018\u2018superior to what we\u2019ve seen from any other movement conservative that\u2019s ever run for the presi\u00addency.\u2019\u2019 Cruz has raised over $50 million from more than 600,000 donations, including those from the Wilks brothers of Texas, who also have given $15 million to Cruz\u2019s super PAC: all numbers that establish him as a top-tier candidate. He has built large campaign organizations in the states immediately following Iowa \u2014 New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada \u2014 and has also traveled extensively through the March 1 \u2018\u2018Super Tuesday\u2019\u2019 states of Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Arkansas and Oklahoma. Though his team is not staffed with the sort of elite Republican operatives who work for Rubio and Jeb Bush, it has thus far waged one of the most professional and error-free campaigns in the field.The results of these efforts will become manifest on Feb. 1, when Iowa Republican voters will settle the current hard-fought contest between Cruz and Donald Trump. Trump poses a threat to Cruz\u2019s presidential ambitions because, unlike the Texan, he does not seem to possess an electoral playbook, and instead can get by with something Cruz lacks: a lot of potential voters seem to like him and are titillated by the idea of him as president. Exactly two weeks before the Iowa caucus, when Trump himself spoke at Liberty University, he botched a Bible quotation and, against university rules, uttered a profanity, two miscues that Cruz would never commit. All the same, Liberty\u2019s president, Jerry Falwell Jr., declared that \u2018\u2018Donald Trump is a breath of fresh air,\u2019\u2019 and Trump has pulled ahead of Cruz in some national polls of evangelical voters.But Cruz\u2019s campaign manager, Roe \u2014 a beefy veteran operative from Kansas City, Mo., with narrow, gleaming eyes \u2014 told me that by at least one unit of measurement, their tactics were already working. \u2018\u2018In the word clouds we used to do before he announced, the words that always came up were \u2018Texas,\u2019 \u2018Tea Party,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Roe said confidently. \u2018\u2018Now it\u2019s \u2018Christian,\u2019 \u2018evangelical,\u2019 \u2018conservative,\u2019 \u2018leader,\u2019 \u2018strong.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019The last remark provoked knowing chortles in the stairwell. The volunteers came from 26 different states, but the plurality of them were Texans. The undecided Iowa voters they met on doorsteps or on the phone often commented on their unmistakable accents. The volunteers would acknowledge their origins and then say: \u2018\u2018Well, is there anything we can tell you about Ted? Because we\u2019re from Texas, and we know him really well.\u2019\u2019 As one of them, Maggie Wright \u2014 a 70-year-old from the Fort Worth area who made her rounds in a sedan painted with portraits of Cruz \u2014 recounted to me: \u2018\u2018We say: \u2018Well, we know Ted\u2019s positions. He\u2019s for states\u2019 rights, for all the Constitution, he will not allow us to bash the gays but won\u2019t let anybody do jihad on the Christians.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019Though Cruz must do well in Iowa to establish momentum in the other early caucuses and primaries, the state in recent history has been a dubious springboard to national success. Since 1976, three winners of Iowa\u2019s contested Republican caucuses have ultimately gained the national party\u2019s nomination, but only one \u2014 George W. Bush, in 2000 \u2014 went on to become president. The last two caucus winners, Huckabee in 2008 and Santorum in 2012, managed to rally Iowa\u2019s social conservatives but lacked both the resources and the breadth of support to compete against John McCain and Mitt Romney, whose campaign themes were less pitched to the Christian right.And so the Cruz campaign has sought to assure Iowa evangelical leaders of two things: that Cruz is one of them, and that he can win the presidency. In return, Cruz\u2019s campaign team has sought from Iowa evangelical leaders not only their endorsement but also their commitment to rally congregants to the polls. Leading this effort has been Rafael Cruz, who since his son\u2019s announcement has spent 29 days in Iowa, talking to fellow evangelical ministers in groups ranging from 25 to 350.Bob Vander Plaats, a major evangelical activist in Iowa, told me, \u2018\u2018Evangelicals have really felt a great need to have one of the their own in the White House, and the last couple of election cycles they\u2019ve frankly felt a bit used.\u2019\u2019 He went on to say that in the general election, \u2018\u2018we\u2019ve gone with the guy who can win, but let\u2019s not talk about principles and wink-wink he\u2019ll deliver once he\u2019s there. And I think you now see that frustration in the huge numbers who stay home on Election Day.\u2019\u2019 Vander Plaats has enthusiastically endorsed Cruz; he says the conventional wisdom regarding an evangelical nominee can be proved wrong.\u2018\u2018When you run a true conservative like Ronald Reagan, you\u2019re going to win,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018George W. Bush, who said his mentor was Jesus \u2014 you win. The past two elections, we\u2019ve been leaving millions of conservatives home, because they see no reason to vote. Not this time. Now we have a full-spectrum conservative in Ted Cruz. This is a base election, and everyone knows it. And I think he crushes Hillary.\u2019\u2019It\u2019s a notable feature of Cruz\u2019s political r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that he became an outsider only after the insiders rebuffed him. He first materialized in the political world as a domestic-policy adviser for the 2000 presidential campaign of George W. Bush. He quickly became known for his arrogance and ambition: One story was that he introduced himself to a colleague with the proclamation, \u2018\u2018I\u2019m Ted Cruz, and I\u2019m going to be Texas\u2019s first Hispanic governor.\u2019\u2019 Little of today\u2019s ideological staunchness was apparent back then. As one of the Bush campaign\u2019s top officials recalls of him: \u2018\u2018Conservative? Yes. Principled conservative torchbearer fighting the fight in the bowels of the campaign? Nope.\u2019\u2019Cruz wrote in his 2015 autobiography, \u2018\u2018A Time for Truth,\u2019\u2019 that it was \u2018\u2018a crushing blow\u2019\u2019 when he failed to receive a top post in the Bush administration. Not long after becoming the Texas solicitor general in 2003 at age 32, Cruz confided his ambitions for higher office during a four-hour meeting with the Republican establishment\u2019s reigning guru, his fellow Texan Karl Rove. The Bush consigliere advised the young solicitor general to bide his time. He spent the next few years developing a reputation as a notably tough and creative lawyer, winning several high-profile Supreme Court cases, and in 2008 he left office for a partnership at a private firm in Houston. The following year, Cruz decided to run for state attorney general after it appeared that the seat might become vacant. Cruz devotes several pages in his autobiography to describing how he persuaded former President George H.\u2009W. Bush to endorse him, only to be bullied by Rove into withdrawing his name so that a Bush crony could run in his place. (An adviser involved in the machinations told me that Cruz had misleadingly implied to the elderly Bush that he would be the only Republican in the race, when in fact it was well known in Republican circles that two friends of the Bushes were also eyeing the job.)Today\u2019s Washington outsider made a second pitch to the Republican establishment in 2010, before he kicked off a long-shot campaign for the Senate seat being vacated by Kay Bailey Hutchison. Both the state and national Republican chieftains offered him little in the way of encouragement. While trying to convince the Texas party chairman at the time, Steve Munisteri, that he could be a legitimate candidate, Cruz asked, \u2018\u2018What if I managed to raise $5 million?\u2019\u2019 Munisteri recalls saying, \u2018\u2018Well, then at the end of the day, that\u2019s $5 million you won\u2019t have anymore.\u2019\u2019It was only then that Cruz began to make a virtue out of his inability to impress the insiders. His 2012 Senate race was straight out of the Tea Party playbook, complete with endorsements from Sarah Palin and Rand Paul. Compared with his current quest for the presidency, the Senate candidate Cruz\u2019s courting of evangelicals was comparatively muted. This was because his chief opponent, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, was himself a rock-solid social conservative. Still, the upstart could not afford to cede the evangelical vote to Dewhurst. Cruz\u2019s former digital director Vincent Harris (who is now affiliated with Rand Paul\u2019s campaign) says that Cruz\u2019s father played an important role in his upset victory. \u2018\u2018When Ted couldn\u2019t be somewhere, Rafael was always there, and he got those crowds so fired up,\u2019\u2019 Harris recalls. \u2018\u2018Rafael was the dog whistle to evangelicals, saying things that libertarian and Tea Party types wouldn\u2019t hear as much but that evangelicals really understood.\u2019\u2019After scoring his upset victory in 2012, Cruz took his Tea Party platform with him to Washington, while his evangelical predilections remained in the margins. (Unlike his current monologues on the presidential campaign trail, Cruz\u2019s numerous speeches in 2013 seldom if ever contained biblical references. Though he quoted from Proverbs during his 21-hour anti-Obamacare floor speech, Cruz actually spent far more time reciting the Dr. Seuss book \u2018\u2018Green Eggs and Ham.\u2019\u2019) What did resurface was the same arrogance that had alienated his Bush colleagues, and that Cruz in his autobiography says he put behind him after the Bush experience taught him \u2018\u2018to treat others with greater respect and humility.\u2019\u2019Cruz has continued to struggle to get along with his Republican allies. Just 10 days after winning his Senate election in Nov. 2012, Cruz spoke in Washington before a decidedly friendly gathering hosted by the Federalist Society, of which he is a member. Many of the attendees had supported the presidential campaign of Mitt Romney. In his speech, Cruz gleefully mocked the conservative credentials of the vanquished candidate, saying, \u2018\u2018I\u2019m pretty certain Mitt Romney actually French-kissed Barack Obama\u2019\u2019 during their final debate. As one attendee who had contributed to both Cruz and Romney later said, \u2018\u2018He managed to offend so many good people in that room who had killed themselves for Mitt.\u2019\u2019Cruz also wasted little time offending his Republican colleagues in the Senate, well before any ideological battle lines had been drawn. Barely a month after the new Texas senator was sworn in, the Republican senators held a retreat in an ornate Library of Congress reading room. According to a senior aide who was present, Cruz \u2018\u2018arrived late, raring for a fight, sat down and almost immediately started engaging aggressively and theatrically in a way that was so out of place for Senate politesse, but especially for someone brand-new. People were looking around like, \u2018Who the hell does this guy think he is?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019But the questions about whether the guy named Ted can win the nomination, let alone the presidency, run deeper than concerns over his likability. In particular, the campaign\u2019s audacious decision to focus more on revving up the evangelical community than on broadening its outreach to young and Hispanic voters is a high-risk strategy that, should it backfire, might do more than cost Cruz the White House. His deeply conservative rhetoric could cost Republicans the Senate, erode their majority in the House and reinforce the party\u2019s reputation among emerging demographic groups as the party of embittered and narrow-minded white men.Cruz makes a special point in his stump speech to mock this apocalyptic scenario. After all, he tells audiences, the same fears were voiced in 1980, about an idealistic conservative candidate whom the Washington elite considered an extremist. Instead, Cruz reminds them, the outsider named Reagan inspired millions of disenchanted voters who yearned for a return to American primacy, following the failed policies of a Democratic president both at home and abroad.Even Cruz\u2019s own advisers find fault with this analogy. As one of them said to me: \u2018\u2018I think he\u2019s much more of a movement conservative than Reagan was. I mean, he\u2019s not putting Sandra Day O\u2019Connor on the Supreme Court.\u2019\u2019 The Reagan-Cruz parallels break down on other levels as well. America is not in a recession, as it was in 1980. The Republican nominee\u2019s opponent will not be an unpopular president but instead, in all likelihood, a female nominee who will be seen as a history maker. Reagan benefited from a less-polarized electorate, attested to by the fact that he garnered 27 percent of the Democratic vote in 1980. By contrast, only 7 percent of the 2012 Democratic electorate chose Romney, who, unlike Cruz, had governed in the blue state of Massachusetts. And the Reagan Revolution was abetted by the shift of white Southerners, who had long viewed themselves as Democrats, to the Republican Party. That revolution has already been fought and won by the Republicans. To win the general election without reaching toward the center, Cruz will have to create his own groundswell with another conservative voting group.The supposition that evangelicals could be this group is also shaky. Cruz\u2019s team argues that about 10 million such voters who did not vote in the 2000 election turned out for Bush in 2004 and have stayed home since. The Bush campaign strategist Matthew Dowd maintains that the increase in evangelical voters was much smaller, prob\u00adably closer to two million. (Given that the overall turnout increase from 2000 to 2004 was less than 17 million voters, and that nearly half of those voters went for John Kerry, the 10 million estimate would seem to be mathematically un\u00adlikely.) Dowd argues as well that the dominant issue in 2004 for all voting groups, including evangelicals, was national security; socially conservative causes like marriage and abortion, Dowd says, \u2018\u2018didn\u2019t even make the top five.\u2019\u2019 Researchers also dispute that Romney drove away evangelicals in 2012. \u2018\u2018In fact, they were overrepresented \u2014 they were 20 percent of the population but made up 26 percent of the electorate,\u2019\u2019 says Robert P. Jones, of the Public Religion Research Institute. Moreover, 78 percent of them cast their ballots for Romney, the same share of the evangelical vote that Bush received in 2004.But perhaps the diciest assumption made by the Cruz campaign is that it not only can turn out more registered evangelical voters than Romney did but also can recruit millions of unregistered evangelicals at the same time. Every demographic group includes many people who have no interest in the political process, and persuading them to engage is not as simple a matter as offering an appealing slate of issues. Should she become the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton will be mining the electoral turf for new voters as well. And in general, the task is an easier one for Democrats, given that their targets are more densely concentrated in urban areas. Cruz\u2019s strategists assert that Clinton will not inspire voters the way Obama did, and this may well be true. But the same might be said of Cruz among various voter groups. With his hard-line stance on immigration, will he repel even more Latino voters than Romney, who received a paltry 27 percent of their votes? Though Cruz might catalyze large pockets of unregistered evangelicals, Jones and others suggest that such voters are primarily in states like Alabama and Tennessee that are already firmly in the Republican column. Pursuing them with a deeply conservative platform could gain Cruz very few electoral votes, while costing him significantly among moderate voters in swing states like Virginia and Ohio.For some Republicans, this situation suggests a more disquieting comparison. \u2018\u2018What\u2019s flawed about Cruz\u2019s approach is that it\u2019s the same argument Barry Goldwater made in 1964,\u2019\u2019 says Doug Gross, a longtime fixture in the Iowa Republican establishment who worked on the Bush and Romney campaigns of 2000 and 2008 and has not endorsed anyone in the 2016 field. Though 80 percent of Republicans fell in line with Goldwater at the polls, only 36 percent of voters under 30, 38 percent of women and 6 percent of nonwhites preferred him over the landslide winner, Lyndon Johnson. \u2018\u2018While Cruz may seem pure and virtuous within the confines of his own base, you can\u2019t get elected with those voters, because there simply aren\u2019t enough of them. Now, within the Republican Party, the establishment and Tea Party are probably in a standoff. But within the general electorate, there are far more of me than there are of him.\u2019\u2019There is only one way to know for sure what will happen if Republican voters nominate Ted Cruz \u2014 and some in the party establishment are already braced for it, with Job-like resignation. As Gross told me: \u2018\u2018We may have to learn this lesson the hard way. This may well be the year that Cruz wins the nomination and we have to have a bloodletting as our medieval cure.\u2019\u2019This country, Cruz said, is \u2018\u2018in crisis.\u2019\u2019 But, he added, \u2018\u2018I\u2019m here this morning with a word of hope and encouragement and exhortation. All across the state of Iowa and this country, people are waking up. There is a spirit of revival that is sweeping this country.\u2019\u2019 The candidate went on in a cadence that frequently descended into stage whispers or attenuated pauses, his face clenched in Shakespearean rapture, varying barely a syllable from the monologues he would deliver with equal fervor in 27 other stops on this six-day swing through the Hawkeye State.Whether Cruz was making a personal connection to this audience in Boone \u2014 whether they truly liked the messenger and not just his message, whether they saw in him the affable Reagan to whom he invited comparison \u2014 was difficult to judge. But at least a dozen times during his reliably 32-minute oration, someone standing nearby me murmured, \u2018\u2018Amen.\u2019\u2019 Some of their faces went taut with resolve as he declared: \u2018\u2018The men and women of this room scare the living daylights out of Washington. And when politicians are terrified, liberty is never safer. What we are seeing is a grass-roots army coming together!\u2019\u2019Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Virtual Reality Takes Us", "Date": "2016-01-21", "News": "Supported bySundance New FrontierThe New York Times Opinion section presents three groundbreaking virtual reality films from the Sundance New Frontier lineup. These videos explore a range of topics and new approaches to nonfiction storytelling.__DANFUNG DENNISAs a young photographer, I was transfixed by the iconic wartime images of great photographers like Robert Capa and James Nachtwey. Their vision of the world far transcended my own. Hoping to emulate their effect, I trained myself to follow in their footsteps, covering the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as a freelance photojournalist for The New York Times and Newsweek.But I found that my photographs were not having the impact that I had hoped. There was something too abstract and flat about them, a quality that allowed anyone viewing them to remain distant from images of suffering. Frustrated by the barriers, I built a camera that could shoot steady, cinematic video in a war zone, and I made a feature-length film following a United States Marine in Afghanistan.While the film provided a glimpse into the brutal reality of war, it was only a small window into that world. I wanted to go further, to pull people through that window onto the front lines and let them witness it firsthand.I started the technology company Condition One in order to build a new camera to shoot in stereoscopic 3D, 360-degree video. We want to initiate a new generation of viewers jaded by flat images into the visceral emotions of being immersed in a whole new world.The power of virtual reality is its command of presence \u2014 its ability to transport the viewer into another world, and have him feel present in it. These experiences are technically difficult to create and require significant computing power, but once presence is achieved and sustained, it is breathtaking.One of the first tests I did with our prototype V.R. camera was leaving it in the path of a herd of wild American bison. When I viewed the result through a V.R. headset, I watched them walk straight up to me, snort in my ear and look me straight in the eye. I felt the strong presence of this massive animal, a descendant of a species that was once ruthlessly hunted to the brink of extinction. And I found that I cared about this bison in a much deeper way than I had before.In V.R., we instinctively feel a surge of empathy for those whose experiences we are immersed in. The suffering of people in war zones becomes our suffering, just as the killing of animals in the wild and in factory farms becomes a source of our pain as well.Referencing his own limitations of perspective, Einstein once wrote of grief, \u201cOur task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.\u201dThrough V.R., we now have a chance to do just that.__NONNY DE LA PE\u00d1AAs I walked around the scene wearing goggles, I became deeply absorbed in the drama. Suddenly, I realized that the cable on my headset was straining as I tried to move closer in order to \u2014 intervene? Wow. It was like nothing I had ever experienced before.As a journalist, I knew immediately that this was a space where important stories could be told. As a documentary filmmaker, I had often faced the challenge of having to build a visual recreation of an event from the past. And so I began to experiment: Could I use virtual reality to offer a better understanding of how events transpired, and to make people connect to stories they might otherwise ignore? Could I reach younger audiences who are accustomed to digital worlds and gaming platforms, and help them become informed global citizens? To me, these are the ultimate goals of journalism.I dedicated the next seven years of my life to finding out, using sound as a foundation for storytelling. With my film \u201cHunger in Los Angeles,\u201d the first V.R. documentary shown at the Sundance Film Festival, in 2012, I used real audio from a food bank where a man waiting in the long line collapsed into a diabetic coma before he received food. At the premiere, I watched with amazement as my audience tried to walk around the \u201cseizure victim\u201d on the ground, while many emerged from the goggles crying.I pushed further with \u201cUse of Force,\u201d using cellphone video to recreate a scene in which United States Border Patrol officers beat and Tasered a migrant to death. I brought a witness to a lab, where I motion-captured her bodily and facial movements while she recalled her memories of the night. Rather than watching a video of her telling you what happened, you hear and see her own re-creation through her body as much as her words. The story is visceral.I kept experimenting with what this remarkable medium can do, concentrating on the kind of socially consequential topics that are sometimes difficult to keep an audience focused on with traditional journalism techniques. With \u201cProject Syria,\u201d you stand inside a thoroughly researched re-creation of a street in Aleppo as a bomb goes off. The segment is based on video and audio captured before and after the real event, photographs of the location and Google Earth maps. In \u201cOne Dark Night,\u201d about the shooting of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman, you see only the events that were documented by 911 calls, within a simulation based on architectural plans of the condominium complex and Mr. Zimmerman\u2019s videotaped police testimony.We were able to push even further with \u201cKiya,\u201d a tragic story of a domestic violence homicide that you see here. In this film, two sisters try to save a third sister from being shot by her former boyfriend. It uses Freedom of Information Act material gathered after the homicide; interviews with the sisters and the police; and most important, recordings of two 911 calls that captured the entire sequence of events to re-enact a tragedy and bring new attention to the issue of domestic violence.I have now seen tens of thousands of people respond to these pieces, and I know that they work. They tell important stories in an entirely new way, and they use the immersive power of virtual reality \u2014 its ability to generate intense empathy on the part of the viewer \u2014 to wring from the audience the intense emotional connection that these stories deserve. Kiya\u2019s story still haunts me, and I hope that you are moved by it, too.Nonny de la Pe\u00f1a is an immersive journalist in Los Angeles and the chief executive of Emblematic, a company that makes virtual reality content. \u201cKiya\u201d is her fourth work at the Sundance Film Festival.__GABO ARORA and CHRIS MILKIn Liberia, Ebola was real, killing people by the thousands. But no matter how much information our round-the-clock news coverage provided, nothing on TV could convey the sensation of being there and experiencing the crisis. So we decided to create \u201cWaves of Grace.\u201dWhereas traditional media conveys information \u2014 often stoking fear and sensationalism in the process \u2014 V.R. can convey connection and empathy for our fellow human beings.We knew right away that the story should be told in the voice of a survivor, so we sought out Decontee Davis, who was already emerging as a survivor advocate. At first she wasn\u2019t convinced, so we put her in a V.R. headset and played one of our previous films for her, about a refugee. Right away she understood the unique potential of V.R. to summon emotion in the viewer.Through this medium, you not only hear Ms. Davis\u2019s story of survival, but you feel it. It is overwhelming, a physical force that radiates from her, detectable only by humans\u2019 sixth sense: empathy. After we met her, we realized that telling her story wouldn\u2019t just be better in V.R. It was only wholly tellable in V.R. We were able to tell not only her own unique story, but Liberia\u2019s as well. People need to know \u2014 not simply watch \u2014 what it feels like to find hope amid death and disease.We want \u201cWaves of Grace\u201d to add a new perspective to the Ebola crisis: your own. Rather than swarm the viewer with fear-inducing stats and information, through V.R. this film opens a door for the viewer. The experience welcomes you into another person\u2019s life to share her heartaches and healing. Ms. Davis taught us how to persevere in the face of abject despair. She brought hope into our lives that we\u2019ll take with us long after the containment of the Ebola crisis. We hope that after experiencing her story, you will feel the same.These virtual reality films are produced by independent filmmakers who have received support from the nonprofit Sundance Institute New Frontier program.Advertisement"}

Flatiron declined to disclose its valuation.As part of the deal, Flatiron gets more than money. Roche will buy several of Flatiron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s software products, which are based on subscriptions, in a move that is set to expand the start-up\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stream of recurring revenue and better position it for a future initial public offering. The partnership between the two companies is nonexclusive, and Flatiron can continue to work with other pharmaceutical companies.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe plan to go public in two to three years,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nat Turner, Flatiron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief executive and co-founder, said in an interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo do so, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to meet certain financial metrics, and this investment sets us up to do that.\u00e2\u0080\u009dLike many other big pharmaceutical companies, Roche is dealing with threats to its core business from generic-drug makers on the low end. It is also facing a shift in the health care payment system, in which insurers are paying more for treatments when they have been shown to be effective. Roche, a major player in the oncology market, said it would use Flatiron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s data to bring new drugs to market faster, keeping its drug pipeline full of innovative new treatments for which it can charge a premium. Generic versions of those drugs will not be available for several years. It will also use Flatiron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s data to better match patients with the treatments that will be most effective.\u00e2\u0080\u009cFlatiron has tremendous data that helps us understand how medicine reacts in patients,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Daniel O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Day, the chief operating officer at Roche. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a long-term strategic investment, and the strategic collaboration benefits us. The value in the investment is not to generate a financial return.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Turner said Flatiron was weeks away from finalizing its funding round in November when Roche said it was interested in investing in the company that he founded with Zach Weinberg in 2012. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was clear that Roche would be a great partner and bring brand value to Flatiron,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Turner said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe wrapped up the deal in about a month.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Turner and Mr. Weinberg founded Flatiron with the aim of organizing the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cancer data and making it easy to analyze. The hope was that cancer centers, pharmaceutical companies and other health care professionals could create treatments faster and pair patients with more effective regimens when armed with information about how drugs performed in the real world. The company has about 250 employees and has its headquarters in New York City.Flatiron\u2019s two founders had previously started an advertising technology company called Invite Media, which they sold to Google in 2010. They became interested in health care and oncology after watching several family members and friends battle cancer.Flatiron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s growth has tracked the rising interest among health care players in personalized medicine, a practice that tailors treatments to individuals. The aim is that personalized medicine will improve patient outcomes more quickly and help reduce health care costs in the United States, which now account for a significant percentage of the economy. President Obama said in last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s State of the Union address that the health care industry should invest more in personalized medicine, and venture capital investors and entrepreneurs have flooded the space.According to the National Venture Capital Association, investment in health care services more than doubled in 2015 to $720 million, and rose 60 percent in 2014 to $345 million.Other investors in Flatiron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s latest round include Allen & Company, the Scottish investment firm Baillie Gifford and the health-care-focused investment firm Casdin Capital. Previous investors include GV, formerly known as Google Ventures, and First Round Capital.

{"Headline": "U.S. Proposes Spending $4 Billion on Self-Driving Cars", "Date": "2016-01-14", "News": "Supported byDETROIT \u2014 With automakers and technology companies rushing to develop self-driving cars, the Obama administration on Thursday pledged to expedite regulatory guidelines for autonomous vehicles and invest in research to help bring them to market.Until now, the federal government has taken a hands-off approach to regulating new technology that allows vehicles to operate independently and without an actual driver.\u201cWe are bullish on autonomous vehicles,\u201d Mr. Foxx said. \u201cThe actions we are taking today bring us up to speed.\u201dThe government\u2019s new support includes a request in President Obama\u2019s proposed budget for the next fiscal year for $4 billion, to be spent over 10 years, to finance research projects and infrastructure improvements tied to driverless cars. Mr. Foxx said that autonomous vehicles had the potential to reduce traffic accidents and significantly improve safety on America\u2019s roads. He estimated that as many as 25,000 deaths could have been avoided last year if driverless technology had been in widespread use.\u201cWe are entering a new world here, and we know it,\u201d he said.The executives welcomed the government\u2019s proposed investment and its fast-track approach to developing a framework for regulating driverless models.\u201cIt takes real collaboration with our regulators so this is done right and done safely,\u201d said Mark Reuss, head of global product development at General Motors, the nation\u2019s largest auto manufacturer.Mr. Foxx said the government expected to issue guidance to companies within six months on the functions that autonomous vehicles must be able to perform to be considered safe.He said the government already had authority to allow limited deployment of 2,500 autonomous vehicles by an individual company for a two-year period.In addition, he urged companies to seek interpretations of existing federal vehicle standards from regulators for new technologies under development.He cited one such case, in which regulators recently confirmed that a remote, self-parking system developed by the German automaker BMW met federal standards.\u201cThis is the right way to drive innovation,\u201d said Mr. Foxx, adding that federal regulators were also working with various states to create a consistent national policy for driverless cars.Several automakers have vowed to have autonomous cars ready for consumers to buy within the next 10 years.But without guidance from regulators, companies have been uncertain about the legal environment that awaits their new vehicles. \u201cThe industry is anxious to have a framework, particularly in terms of safety,\u201d Mr. Reuss said.Mr. Foxx declined to say whether he expected bipartisan support for the proposed $4 billion driverless-car investment in the president\u2019s budget.He also said the government needed to address other related issues about the vehicles over the next six months.\u201cThere are liability issues that need to be thought through,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do several things at once.\u201dThe cooperative stance taken between regulators and carmakers is also extending to other areas involving vehicle safety.On Friday, the administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration will hold another meeting with auto executives to draft voluntary measures by carmakers to improve safety.The meeting is expected to complete several new safety measures, such as how companies can increase the number of vehicle owners who take recalled models in for repairs, according to one official briefed on the subject.Mark R. Rosekind, head of the safety agency, has been working closely with the auto companies on the voluntary measures after a record number of safety recalls over the last two years.He and Mr. Foxx are expected to announce the safety initiatives in an appearance Friday at the auto show.An article on Friday about federal support for the development of driverless cars referred incompletely to President Obama\u2019s $4 billion request for research into autonomous car technology and infrastructure. While the request is included in his proposed budget for the next fiscal year, it would be spent over 10 years, not one year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Now, Self-Driving Cars Still Need Humans", "Date": "2016-01-17", "News": "Supported bySUNNYVALE, Calif. \u2014 Car enthusiasts, after hearing industry executives discussing the self-driving technology being built into their vehicles, might be forgiven for thinking robotic cars will soon drive themselves out of auto showrooms.Mr. Musk also said that within a year or two, it would be technically feasible to summon a Tesla from the opposite side of the country.But there is a growing gap between what these executives are saying and what most people think of when they hear executives or scientists describing autonomous or driverless cars.What Mr. Musk and Mr. Ghosn are describing \u2014 cross-country-driving hyperbole aside \u2014 are cars with advanced capabilities that can help drive or even take over in tricky situations like parallel parking on a busy street.Truly autonomous cars that do all the work, like the bubble-shaped vehicles Google has been testing near its Silicon Valley campus, are still at least a decade away from ferrying people around town, said Xavier Mosquet, a senior partner at the Boston Consulting Group and managing director of the firm\u2019s Detroit office.\u201cThis is going to be a journey, and a reasonably long one,\u201d he said.Cars are beginning to drive on their own in certain situations, and in the coming years, they will do increasingly more under computer control. They will follow curving roads, change lanes, pass through intersections, and stop and start.But they will require human supervision. Significantly, on many occasions, the cars will in effect still tell their human drivers, \u201cHere, you take the wheel,\u201d when they encounter complex driving situations or emergencies.In the automotive industry, this is referred to as the handoff problem, and automotive engineers acknowledge that there is no easy solution. Automotive designers have not yet found a way to make a driver who may be distracted by texting, reading email or watching a movie perk up and retake control of the car in the fraction of a second that is required in an emergency.The danger is that by inducing human drivers to pay even less attention to driving, the safety technology may be creating new hazards.Although Dr. Thrun left Google several years ago, he is still involved in the field of artificial intelligence. He describes himself as an enthusiastic Tesla owner. On a recent test drive, he cataloged the car\u2019s limitations and errors, including those he described as \u201ccritical interventions\u201d in which the driver must override the car\u2019s behavior.The Tesla Autopilot system permits drivers to remove their hands from the wheel, but it prompts them to regain control after a brief period. It will also warn a driver to retake control in certain situations.The Tesla performed well in freeway driving, and the company recently fixed a bug that had caused the car to unexpectedly veer off onto freeway exits. However, on city streets and country roads, Autopilot\u2019s performance could be described as hair-raising. The car, which uses only a camera to track the roadway by identifying lane markers, did not follow the curves smoothly. It also did not slow down when approaching turns.On a recent 220-mile drive to Lake Tahoe from Palo Alto, Calif., Dr. Thrun said he had to intervene more than a dozen times.The company said that on Jan. 9, it introduced a new version of the Autopilot software that offered both restrictions and improvements in handling.Like the Tesla, the new autonomous Nissan models will still require human oversight and will not drive autonomously in all conditions. Nissan\u2019s engineers acknowledged that even their most advanced models would not be autonomous in every situation, including snow, heavy rain and even some nighttime driving.\u201cThere are certain limitations depending on the condition of the weather. For example, if you are in heavy snow or rain, it is impossible to have autonomous driving,\u201d said Tsuyoshi Yamaguchi, Renault-Nissan\u2019s executive vice president for technology development. \u201cWe should make sure the vehicle recognizes it and gives a caution to the driver.\u201dThe situation is further complicated by laws and regulations that require cars to be controlled by humans. In Europe, the 1968 Vienna Convention required that \u201cevery moving vehicle or combination of vehicles shall have a driver,\u201d and \u201cevery driver shall at all times be able to control his vehicle.\u201d Although an amendment has been proposed, no new legislation is yet in place.None of that has discouraged some enthusiastic Tesla owners. Doug Carmean, a Microsoft computer designer who commutes daily between Seattle and Redmond, Wash., said he had encountered the Tesla Autopilot offramp bug and found it \u201cscary.\u201dYet as much as 45 minutes of his commute each day is in slow, stop-and-go traffic, and his car will effortlessly and predictably follow the car ahead, permitting him to surf the web on the Tesla\u2019s giant display.\u201cEven though it has these frightening movements, I\u2019ve come to enjoy it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sense of awe and pleasure.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And they are available to hire out for \u201cspace-based video surveillance.\u201dBut there is more to the station than spacemen strumming guitars and picking flowers.Airbus, a giant military contractor, contacted Frontex last year about what it called a \u201cfloating frontier surveillance platform\u201d that could be used to monitor \u201cinland waterways, and estuaries, lakes.\u201d A Massachusetts company wanted to sell \u201ca field-deployable Rapid DNA Analysis System\u201d to generate DNA profiles \u201cin 84 minutes.\u201d A third company said it could create \u201calgorithms to predict border crossings.\u201dBut the most otherworldly idea belonged to UrtheCast. Its cameras, one for video and the other for still images, could be used for the \u201cdetection of borders activities,\u201d UrtheCast said in an email to Frontex. UrtheCast said its cameras offered \u201can unprecedented capability for an integrated persistent space surveillance,\u201d as well as what it called \u201cextraction of situation awareness at certain regions, facilities or events.\u201dA spokesman for Frontex said that the agency did not accept UrtheCast\u2019s offer, which was made in 2013, the year the cameras were launched into space from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.

And UrtheCast has signed a five-year, $65 million contract with an unnamed customer, according to Canadian securities filings.One of its most recent filings said that \u201cmany government customers\u201d needed satellite imagery \u201cto supervise and manage, among other things, resources, animal migrations and national borders.\u201d A variety of customers used UrtheCast services \u201cto track environmental changes, natural disasters and human conflicts,\u201d the filing said.Daniel Huot, a NASA spokesman, said in an email, \u201cNASA did not have any involvement with the UrtheCast payload (it was pitched to and flown by our Russian colleagues) so I would have to direct you back to UrtheCast or Roscosmos.\u201dRoscosmos did not respond to requests for comment.The field of satellite imagery is competitive, since selling pictures from above is not as unusual anymore. In addition to dedicated spy satellites, there is a growing crop of companies with pictures to sell, or that offer their cameras for specific projects.Claire Barthelemy contributed research from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Milos Raonic Wins Match While Grieving for Victims of a Shooting in Canada", "Date": "2016-01-23", "News": "Supported byThe Australian Open is tennis\u2019s largest snow globe, with foreign participants insulated from the world they left behind by several time zones in addition to the usual force field of focus that envelops players during the two weeks of a major tournament. But on Saturday morning in a cafe on the tournament grounds, a breaking news story penetrated Raonic\u2019s bubble.Raonic, 25, was shaken by the news but firm in his resolve to advance to the tournament\u2019s second week, for the fourth time in six appearances here. After dispatching Troicki, 6-2, 6-3, 6-4, to set up a meeting with fourth-ranked Stan Wawrinka, the 13th-seeded Raonic eschewed the usual highlight rehash during his on-court interview. Fighting back tears, he said: \u201cThere was a shooting in Saskatchewan at a high school, so my thoughts go out to that community and the school and families and everyone affected. We wish you the best, and today\u2019s victory was for that community and a quick recovery.\u201dRaonic was born in Montenegro and immigrated to Canada with his family at age 3 to seek refuge from a regional conflict. He said in an interview later that he wanted to show solidarity with other grieving Canadians. \u201cStuff like this doesn\u2019t happen much back home,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure not just in that small community but throughout Canada, it was a lot of people that were sort of heartbroken over it.\u201dThe tragedy provided the dose of perspective that has eluded Raonic on occasion since he advanced to the 2011 tournament\u2019s fourth round as a 20-year-old qualifier. Every year since, he has returned and confidently stated his intentions to win a major in the next 12 months, only to have his progress slowed by a succession of injuries to his right hip, right foot and lower back.Raonic reached a career-high No. 4 in the Association of Tennis Professionals rankings in May. He marked the milestone by having surgery to repair a pinched nerve in his foot. As soon as the foot healed, his back began bothering him. Raonic, who stands 6 feet 5 inches and weighs 216 pounds, perceived the injuries as obstacles randomly dropped in his path to test his will. Then a chiropractor helped him connect the neuro-musculoskeletal dots.Raonic has a slight curvature in the spine, which he knew about. He only recently discovered that he has a misaligned jaw. For the past two months, he has worn a bite splint, removing it only to eat. He wears it during matches, he said, so he does not grind his teeth.\u201cIt corrects the way your jaw aligns to alleviate small muscle tension from constantly clenching,\u201d said Raonic, who identified only one drawback to wearing the bite splint while playing tennis.\u201cI fiddle around with it too much,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI\u2019ve been told the real results you start to feel after six months. It is something that has allowed me to really feel good, especially considering the back issues that I\u2019ve had.\u201dRaonic was introduced to tennis at a club near his family\u2019s home in Thornhill, Ontario. He was 8 years old, and the sport quickly became his all-consuming passion. \u201cI sort of stopped doing everything else,\u201d he said. \u201cI used to ski. I still play basketball a little bit. I\u2019ll play soccer but more in a safe environment, never on a full-grass pitch.\u201dDid a childhood devoted to the repetitive movements in tennis contribute to the spate of injuries he has experienced in his 20s? Raonic does not doubt it. \u201cKnowing what I know now about physical preparation,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019d put a kid into gymnastics from a very young age, I\u2019d put a kid into swimming, just to develop all these stability muscles and body awareness and balance over time. I guess I didn\u2019t do that, so I\u2019m sort of playing a little bit of catch-up.\u201d\u201cI have an inability after matches are over to sort of switch off and relax completely,\u201d Raonic said. \u201cI think he can bring that calm to me. With the vast knowledge that he has, and he has great sort of sense of how to approach, how to talk to people, I think he can help me in those kind of different situations.\u201dRaonic\u2019s partnership with Moya began auspiciously, with a victory over the 17-time major winner Roger Federer in the final of a warm-up tournament in Brisbane. Raonic faced four break points, none of which were converted, in his first two matches in Melbourne, both straight-sets victories, against Lucas Pouille and Tommy Robredo.Troicki, who won a warm-up event in Sydney, broke Raonic in the third set on the way to a 4-1 lead. An unruffled Raonic lost only seven points in the last five games. Five years ago, Raonic became the first Canadian in the Open era to be seeded in the men\u2019s singles in a major.

We thought you were gone for good but \u2026 apparently not.Oh, I know we should have guessed. That whole dream business in your letter about \u201cwalking with Sybbie under the great trees\u201d and \u201clistening to the pigeons cooing in their branches\u201d and your eyes filling with tears. It was like getting an Instagram post from Wordsworth. And suddenly there you were, looking as hearty and plow-horsey as ever, and there was Sybbie, giving a sweet li\u2019l hug to Georgie (and checking Marigold for signs of a pulse).But here\u2019s the thing, Tom. We were pretty sure we\u2019d quit you.I mean, for what felt like half a century, you kept rattling on about how you didn\u2019t fit in at Downton Abbey. About how hard it was being trapped between \u201ctwo worlds\u201d and what a drag it was having to reconcile your leftist leanings with the beatific Tory example of your in-laws. And after a while, Tom, we got it, we really did, and finally there didn\u2019t seem anything to do with you but pack you on the next boat to Boston.Of course, we didn\u2019t want to do it, but it was for the good of the show. Take Rose, for instance. (No, I\u2019m not going to add \u201cplease.\u201d) That dear sweet girl knew enough \u2014 just barely enough \u2014 to recognize that her narrative arc had flatlined, so when they decided to banish her to the Hamptons, she went without a peep. Took one for the team, Tom.But you, you lunkhead, you just wouldn\u2019t listen.So you\u2019ll understand why we were a little nonplused to see you at the end of Episode 3. Especially because you were stealing focus from something truly momentous: the long-awaited consummation of The World\u2019s Most Glacial Courtship.As you know, Tom, Mr. Carson and Mrs. Hughes have been submerging their feelings for so long they make \u201cRemains of the Day\u201d look like hard-core porn. I can\u2019t say their nuptials were ever seriously imperiled, even if Mrs. H did at one point plan to walk down the aisle in a horse blanket. The day was sort-of-not-really saved when meddlesome Mary suggested they borrow one of Cora\u2019s embroidered evening coats. Only Cora caught them in the act and got all hissy about them rifling through her cupboards.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen her so angry,\u201d said Anna, and I don\u2019t think I have, either. (I wonder if Elizabeth McGovern stuck a Post-it note on Baron Fellowes\u2019s computer: \u201cLet me scream! Just once!\u201d)Well, of course, Cora had good reason to be in such a bad mood. She had breakfasted on nothing but tea \u2014 a troubling window into the Crawley women\u2019s diet \u2014 and she had just come from a very contentious meeting with the board members of Downton Cottage Hospital, who have been debating whether to merge with the Royal Yorkshire County Hospital, a process that would mean consolidating fund-raising operations and enhancing technoxxck;j;kafdls2jt-b2n-jjjsddxxa \u2026Sorry, Tom, that was my head nodding once more onto the keyboard; this story line just does that to me. The good news is Cora felt awful about losing her cool and wound up gifting the coat to Mrs. H.So the wedding turned out to be just delightful \u2014 upstairs on one side of the aisle, downstairs on the other \u2014 and there were bagpipes, and Mr. Carson said, \u201cThat a woman of such grace and charm should entrust her life\u2019s happiness to my unworthy charge passeth all understanding.\u201dI mean, it was lovely, Tom, and then you come barging in with that whole Dorothy-back-from-Oz business: \u201cI learned that Downton is my home and that you are my family. If I didn\u2019t quite know that before I left, I know it now.\u201dFine, fine, but what narrative function do you have in mind, Tom? See, Mary\u2019s got the pigs covered. Violet and Isobel have cornered the health care market. Spratt is helping to rehabilitate escaped convicts. Had you come a week earlier, you might have helped to cheer up gloomy old Edith, but wouldn\u2019t you know? As soon as she announces she\u2019s \u201cstaring middle age in the face,\u201d out pops Bertie Pelham, the estate agent she met last season in Brancaster. (He\u2019s played by the equally fictional-sounding Harry Hadden-Paton.)They had a pretty sexy evening together putting Edith\u2019s magazine to bed, and by the time they\u2019re done, Bertie\u2019s saying things like \u201cYou inspire me,\u201d and I don\u2019t know, he seems like the type of guy who might go through with his own wedding and not be so careless as to be slaughtered by Nazi thugs. So that\u2019s progress, isn\u2019t it?I guess what it comes down to, Tom, is this: Once Sybbie\u2019s been lateraled to the nearest nanny, you\u2019re going to have start pulling some story freight.

But tell me your take on the decision \u2014 and on what the popularity of WhatsApp means in general \u2014 while I pretend to listen.The new plan seems much smarter, and it\u2019s riding the crest of a larger trend: People love messaging so much that they may be willing to do a whole bunch of things from inside their messaging apps \u2014 buy stuff, book stuff, talk to customer service people and just generally engage in that great American pastime we call commercial activity. The benefit to WhatsApp (and Facebook\u2019s other messaging app, Messenger) is obvious; the company takes a cut of transactions and potentially makes billions.It\u2019s also good for developers. App stores are overstuffed, and getting people to download your app and use it requires a lot of marketing dollars and some luck. So if you want people to use your shopping or delivery or ride service, make it compatible with messaging \u2014 there\u2019s less competition there, and it doesn\u2019t require that users download new apps.Do you agree? Are chat-based services the next big thing?Here\u2019s the thing: The lowest common denominator across the world, as far as communication goes, is messaging apps. They offer low-cost data transmission. They require only basic writing, which nearly everyone does daily. Texting, particularly among millennials, is more popular than talking on the phone. I know I often would rather text someone than take a call.We already see this in other services, albeit in nascent forms. You know by now that Twitter is the social network of choice for directing obscenities at airlines when a flight is delayed. And Facebook Messenger is dabbling in the \u201cchat for business\u201d concept as well.Anyway, I am on board with the notion that chat and text will be the interface of the future. Or at least the predominant one for some time ahead.Here\u2019s a question I have: At what point do Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp end up on a collision course? Aren\u2019t they essentially doing the same thing for the company?But a future of many chat apps will be a terrible inconvenience for me \u2014 there\u2019ll be so many places to block you!Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Maurice Hines Opens His Heart in \u2018Tappin\u2019 Thru Life\u2019", "Date": "2016-01-07", "News": "Supported byIn his dressing room this week at New World Stages in Manhattan, where his autobiographical show, \u201cTappin\u2019 Thru Life,\u201d opens on Monday, he talked about how much fun he was having but also how hard it was to have just finished 10 preview performances in a row. His mother always instructed him and his brother to tell the truth, he said. \u201cWhen they ask you if you\u2019re tired, say yes.\u201dTo help arrange the anecdotes into a show, Mr. Hines brought on Jeff Calhoun, a director (\u201cNewsies\u201d ) who had started out as a Broadway hoofer. At their first meeting, Mr. Calhoun asked if Mr. Hines had any more photos. \u201cMy mother saved everything, and she left everything to me,\u201d Mr. Hines said. \u201cI was the brother to take care of all the stuff.\u201dDuring \u201cTappin\u2019 Thru Life,\u201d those photos, many of them impossibly adorable, are projected onto portable panels. \u201cThe show is about hanging out with Maurice, and he\u2019s showing you his mother\u2019s scrapbook,\u201d Mr. Calhoun explained in an interview.The photos and the stories lead into tributes that Mr. Hines sings to the many celebrities he and his brother worked with: Ella Fitzgerald, Frank Sinatra, Lena Horne, Judy Garland. The big names are almost all singers, but he is always dancing, embellishing his vocal delivery with the upper-body flair of Fayard Nicholas. He taps all through the show, mincing the floor with small and quick steps to punctuate his stories, and in several stand-alone dance numbers. One is a re-creation of the bump-and-grind routine that the brothers learned as boys from their ex-chorus-girl grandmother.\u201cHe feels the responsibility of passing the torch,\u201d Mr. Calhoun said.In his dressing room, Mr. Hines was eager to plug the Maurice and Gregory Hines Performing Arts Center, a school and theater that he and a real-estate developer plan to open in Harlem. But \u201cTappin\u2019 Thru Life\u201d is itself a kind of school in showbiz etiquette. The lessons are there in the way Mr. Hines shares attention with each member of the hard-swinging Diva Jazz Orchestra. (He compliments their cleavage, and they laugh at his jokes like a whole crew of Ed McMahons.) They\u2019re there in how he connects with his audience, making every \u201cyou\u201d in the lyrics about them, shaking hands with people in the front row.\u201cMy mother always said: \u2018You don\u2019t count. They count,\u2019\u201d Mr. Hines recalled. \u201cThey showed up to see you, so you give them everything you got.\u201dThat\u2019s a lesson he learned not just from his mother. \u201cMy father always told us, when we started meeting these famous people: \u2018When you sit with them, you got nothing to say. You listen,\u2019\u201d Mr. Hines recalled. \u201cIf you\u2019re sitting there with Nat King Cole, what do you know?\u201d\u201cI look at the kids today and my heart goes out to them,\u201d he added, because they don\u2019t have the examples that he did. \u201cDiahann Carroll, Harry Belafonte,\u201d he said, \u201cWe\u2019ll never see their like again.\u201d His advice? \u201cGoogle them!\u201d That\u2019s what he does before every show: Watch them on YouTube, \u201cbecause that\u2019s how great I want to be.\u201dOnstage and off, the recommendations and names and stories with punch lines flow. For Mr. Calhoun, the main challenge has been to get his people-pleasing star to open his heart more. \u201cEarly on, it seemed like Maurice would save his best stories for dinner,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is very protective of other people, and he worried about what the audience would want to hear.\u201dOne story that didn\u2019t make it into the show until late in the process is about how the Hines brothers didn\u2019t speak to each other for 10 years.\u201cIt\u2019s still hard for me to talk about,\u201d Mr. Hines said. \u201cPeople think it was show business jealousy, but it was a personal thing and we promised our mother we would never discuss it.\u201cSiblings have their problems, but Gregory and I always understood and supported each other,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was so laid back, so effortless, and he would always say that he never had to worry about the audience when we performed together because I would get them. Because I was relentless. That\u2019s how we worked so well together.\u201d\u201cI see him then,\u201d Mr. Hines said. \u201cEspecially when I\u2019m tired.\u201d\u201cSince my mother and father died, it\u2019s been very lonely,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut this show helps me.

{"Headline": "Myanmar\u2019s Peace Prize Winner and Crimes Against Humanity", "Date": "2016-01-09", "News": "Supported byYet Aung San Suu Kyi seems to plan to continue this Myanmar version of apartheid. She is now a politician, and oppressing a minority like the Rohingya is popular with mostly Buddhist voters.What all this means in practical terms is that Muhammad Karim is dead at 14.Muhammad lived in a giant concentration camp with tens of thousands of Rohingya. The government has taken away citizenship and statehood from the Rohingya over the years, and they are deprived of free movement. Muhammad wanted to sneak away by boat, paying human traffickers to join a tide of desperate Rohingya boat people seeking passage to Malaysia. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t let him, because it was too dangerous,\u201d said his mother, Sara Hatu.Then Muhammad suffered a scratch on his heel. Nobody thought much about it, but soon he had trouble opening his jaw.He apparently had caught tetanus. Like most of the children in the concentration camp, he wasn\u2019t able to get vaccinations, including a simple tetanus shot.After he got sick, the local medical assistants and the on-and-off clinic couldn\u2019t help him. Finally his mother got special permission for him to leave the camp to be hospitalized, but by then it was too late. \u201cAfter two days, he came back as a corpse,\u201d his mother said.A hundred feet from his hut, another family is also mourning. Bildar Begum, a 20-year-old woman, contracted hepatitis A, according to neighbors. Hepatitis A is normally not life-threatening, but she, too, couldn\u2019t get the medical help she needed, and so she died late last year, leaving a 2-year-old son, Hirol.\u201cIf she was not Rohingya, she would surely still be alive, I can say that 100 percent,\u201d said Enus Monir, a community leader.And now Hirol is starving: At 28 months, he weighs just 19 pounds. On the World Health Organization weight-to-age sheets, he is off the charts. The minimum on the charts is the third percentile, and Hirol is far below that.Some of the families in the camp have substantial savings in the banks in Sittwe a few miles away. But because they have been locked up since 2012, they can\u2019t access their own bank accounts to feed their families.The global response has been pathetic. Partly that\u2019s because Myanmar makes it difficult for aid groups and journalists to see the Rohingya, so that they are largely invisible.The United Nations has been dysfunctional in Myanmar. Another internal U.N. document shared with me (both provided by a critic of U.N. passivity on the issue) warns that U.N. staff members in Myanmar are feuding with one another and it raises \u201cthe question of possible complicity of the U.N. in potential crimes against humanity.\u201dYet aid groups have been barred from many areas, and the systematic destruction of the Rohingya remains one of the 21st century\u2019s most neglected human rights catastrophes.Aung San Suu Kyi avoids even saying \u201cRohingya.\u201d The United States Embassy in Myanmar likewise seems to sidestep the word in its official statements, a cringeworthy capitulation.\u201cThe Obama administration definitely could be doing a lot more,\u201d said Matthew Smith of Fortify Rights, a human rights group focused on Myanmar. That includes backing an international investigation and pushing Myanmar publicly and privately to take steps to restore citizenship and free movement to the Rohingya, as well as assuring that aid groups are allowed to help them. Other politicians have also been mostly quiet; the issue has barely surfaced at all on the U.S. presidential campaign trail.An enormous amount has gone right in Myanmar in recent years, especially the rise of democracy. But that same rise of democracy has also empowered racist and xenophobic demagoguery, making the problems of the Rohingya harder to solve. In the recent Myanmar elections, Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s party refused to nominate a single Muslim candidate.Aung San Suu Kyi is regarded by many Burmese as too conciliatory toward the Rohingya, because she remains silent rather than denouncing them at every turn. But for those of us who have deeply admired her for years, her willingness to sacrifice principle for political expedience is wrenching to watch.Defenders of Myanmar and of Aung San Suu Kyi note that the country has many problems; they see the Rohingya as one misfortune in a nation with a vast swath of misfortunes. The priorities, as they see them, are economic development, democracy and an end to the country\u2019s many local conflicts, and they protest that it\u2019s myopic to focus on the problems of one ethnic group in a nation so full of challenges.Yet to me, there is something particularly horrifying about a government deliberately targeting an ethnic group for destruction, locking its members in concentration camps and denying them livelihood, education and health care. When kids are dying in concentration camps, after being confined there because of their ethnicity, that\u2019s not just one more problem of global poverty. It\u2019s a crime against humanity, and addressing it is the responsibility of all humanity.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trust the Iowa Locals", "Date": "2016-01-25", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorPella, Iowa \u2014 \u201cThere he is!\u201d I said after spotting the crowd near the fountain, a couple of dozen media minions, holding cameras and microphones, all waving for attention. Jeb Bush was in my Iowa neighborhood, and I needed an interview. That\u2019s what I do. I\u2019m a small town radio news guy.I report on everything \u2014 community events, City Council meetings, car wrecks, the occasional drug bust, murder or tornado. When I was asked if I was worried about satellite radio taking away our listeners, I told them I\u2019d worry as soon as I saw Howard Stern at a local City Council meeting.Since 2007, I\u2019ve been covering the Iowa caucuses. Those weeks when our local news becomes your national news. We do our best to put the candidates through their paces.And here I was, about to let my listeners down. In a few hours Mr. Bush was to give a speech to several hundred locals, and his staff had told me over the phone that they \u201chope\u201d I understand that he is \u201cway too busy\u201d for an interview.Still, I elbowed my way through the crowd. Security looked me up and down, then ignored me. Must be my suspenders, I thought. I parted some branches, finding an opening in the crowd by the trunk of a tree, to see who was interviewing Mr. Bush.It was Mr. Big himself \u2014 David Muir, the anchor for \u201cWorld News Tonight\u201d on ABC. I sighed. Of course Mr. Bush would deal with the big media first \u2014 for many candidates and their staff, that\u2019s all they know.I saw a friend who works for a local newspaper. He grabbed my arm and whispered, \u201cYou get Bush yet?\u201d\u201cNope, he\u2019s too busy,\u201d I said, perhaps too loudly. A lady holding a boom mike scowled at me, finger to her lips.We watched Mr. Muir lead his interview, as dashing in person as he is on TV. Maybe more. Perfect hair. Teeth. A genetic miracle. His blue suit fit perfectly. Glancing around, I caught our reflections in a shop window. Thank God for radio and print, I thought.I\u2019m not sure how many presidential candidates I\u2019ve interviewed over the years. Too many to count. Some of the candidates resonated with Iowans, others didn\u2019t. In 2008, Barack Obama and Mike Huckabee got some love; Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, John McCain and Rudy Giuliani didn\u2019t. Some play the media like a violin, others are clueless. Some understand how crucial local coverage is, others don\u2019t.I remember back in 2012 when Sarah Palin was still considering running. She was in town making an appearance and her security waved me through. Later that evening during a pause in activities, I asked the security director why he let me approach. \u201cThe suspenders,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd wrong side of 50.\u201dIn 2008, Joe Biden was great. He made all of us small media guys and gals feel as if we\u2019d known him forever. Joe was never in a hurry. Never \u201ctoo busy.\u201d Hillary? \u201cToo busy.\u201d She occasionally dipped her toe into the waters of rural Iowa, but preferred our larger cities. (Yoo-hoo, Hillary! I\u2019m right here!)Mitt Romney gave me a couple of interviews, but his staff wouldn\u2019t let him out of arm\u2019s reach, and I felt as if I was a quarterback with a mike in the middle of a football huddle.In 2012 Rick Santorum was around so much, it was like he was a neighbor. He fit in just fine \u2014 sweater vest and all. In 2007, Chris Dodd, a Democratic senator from Connecticut, moved into the state, but it didn\u2019t help him. He looked too much like lots of city folk do: afraid he was going to step in a pile of cow poop.At a summit on agriculture in Des Moines in 2015, when all the original candidates were in the race, Republicans seemed to know very little about agriculture. Mr. Bush, George Pataki and Rick Perry were somewhat conversant with agricultural issues. The rest appeared to think food magically appeared on grocery-store shelves. The national media, from what I could tell, were equally clueless. Every corner of this country is different. People in Montana might be concerned about the loss of glaciers in Montana. In California, the drought. In Louisiana, the oil industry. In Texas, border issues. In coastal New England, the fishing industry.Martin O\u2019Malley had to Google the price of corn and beans \u2014 not a good thing to have to do in Iowa. Lindsey Graham knew the price of corn and beans, but not much else about Iowa\u2019s economy.Years ago, I remember Mr. Obama made a lot of time for locals, and answered our questions. All of them. Why had Mr. Obama singled us out rather than someone with big names? \u201cYou are the media who live here,\u201d a staffer told me, \u201cwho the community knows and trusts.\u201dIn local media, most of us have worked hard to be respected in our communities. People know our personalities, our biases, and are interested in how the candidates interact with us. Sure, the big media asks great questions about the economy, foreign affairs, health care, you name it. But my questions might be a little different, like, what do you think about the low prices of corn and beans?

{"Headline": "Fund Managers Win With Tech Stalwarts and Burly Brand Names", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byBets on the biggest purveyors of technology \u2014 companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft \u2014 powered three of the top-performing funds of the fourth quarter.Mr. Baker, who has managed the fund since 2009, said he believed that the best companies combined top technology with burly brand names and large scale. Take Alphabet, he said. \u201cNot only does it have a great brand, but every day it does seven to eight times as many searches as all of its competitors combined. So every day its search accuracy is improving that much faster than competitors\u2019.\u201dAs befits a growth investor, Mr. Baker is a technophile. He will riff at length about the technological themes that undergird his picks, like the omnipresence of cloud computing, the maturation of solar power and the promise of artificial intelligence. Skeptics complain the information age isn\u2019t yielding benefits comparable to the industrial revolution, but that is humbug, he says.\u201cThe steam engine, to take advantage of that, you needed to dig canals and put in railroads. The peak change was 75 to 100 years after the invention.\u201d As far as the microchip goes, he said, \u201cAll of the infrastructure is in place, and we\u2019re entering the period of peak economic and social change.\u201dEven video game makers are benefiting, he said. Consider Activision Blizzard, another top holding and the producer of Call of Duty and Guitar Hero. A decade ago, its market comprised a few million game consoles and personal computers, Mr. Baker said. \u201cNow you have a billion smartphones, all of which you can play a video game on.\u201d And Activision Blizzard is trying to broaden its share of the mobile market with its pending acquisition of King Digital Entertainment, maker of the game Candy Crush.Mr. Baker\u2019s fund, with an expense ratio of 0.83 percent, returned 13.34 percent for the quarter, compared with 7.04 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.\u201cBrands hold their value, and a global brand isn\u2019t dependent on one geography,\u201d she said. Est\u00e9e Lauder, Starbucks and Nike were all among her fund\u2019s recent stakes. \u201cTheir markets are growing because they address the whole world,\u201d she said.Sturdy brands also drew her to Constellation Brands, which owns the United States rights to popular Mexican beers like Corona, Modelo and Pacifico, as well as a groaning cellar of wines. \u201cIn good times and bad, people still drink wine and beer,\u201d she said.Ms. Starke took over her fund about a year and a half ago. It then held more than 80 stocks. She set about paring that number, with an aim of keeping the portfolio at 30 to 50 holdings. \u201cIn large-cap growth, it\u2019s hard to outperform with a big portfolio,\u201d she said. \u201cA concentrated portfolio is the way to do it.\u201d With too many holdings, a fund can end up looking too much like the broader market and merely matching its return.She also plowed a greater portion of the fund\u2019s money into her top picks. Previously, the top 10 holdings accounted for about 14 percent of the portfolio, she said. Now they are more than 40 percent.The fund\u2019s biggest sector weightings are information technology, health care and consumer discretionary. Those tend to produce the best earnings growth, she said. \u201cI\u2019m looking for healthy earnings growth and healthy sales growth,\u201d she said.Ms. Starke\u2019s fund, with an expense ratio of 1.12, returned 9.92 percent in the fourth quarter.Like Mr. Baker\u2019s fund, it lately held shares of Microsoft. Mr. Kleinschmidt said the fund had owned the stock for about a decade, even as the company was seen as falling behind competitors like Apple and Google. But Microsoft kept putting up strong numbers, he said.\u201cForget the name,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I just gave you their market share, their cash flow, their return on equity, if I showed you all of that, would you be interested? Yes. Most people would be.\u201dFacebook, an overlap with both Mr. Baker\u2019s and Ms. Starke\u2019s top holdings, is a more recent purchase. Mr. Kleinschmidt said he was attracted to the social network\u2019s enormous customer base, about 600 million people when the company went public in 2012. Tocqueville bought shares in the months after Facebook\u2019s initial public offering, when the stock sagged. \u201cI reasoned a smart management team would be able to figure out how to make money on 600 million users,\u201d Mr. Kleinschmidt said. Facebook says its network has grown and estimates more than a billion people use its service daily.Mr. Kleinschmidt has patience. As he has with Microsoft, he will stick with a stock for years. His fund\u2019s annual turnover ratio is 15 percent. In contrast, the average actively managed stock fund tracked by Morningstar turns over about two-thirds of its portfolio annually.\u201cOne of the hardest things to do in this business \u2014 and yet one of the best things \u2014 can be to sit on your hands and not let the market\u2019s noise convince you that you have to do something,\u201d he said.Mr. Kleinschmidt cautioned that his turnover might increase in coming months. As a contrarian, he said he often finds buying opportunities when the market sags, as it has lately. \u201cThe essence of a contrarian thinker is to lean against the wind. You do that by looking into situations where the prevailing feeling is, \u2018Oh, my God.\u2019\u201dMr. Kleinschmidt\u2019s fund, with an expense ratio of 1.25 percent, returned 10.97 percent in the fourth quarter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Self-Driving Cars May Get Here Before We\u2019re Ready", "Date": "2016-01-21", "News": "Supported bySOMETIME in the future \u2014 although no one quite knows when \u2014 your morning commute may look something like this: Open an app, summon a car and wait for the arrival of a driverless vehicle that will whisk you to work like a ghost chauffeur.The short answer: We are not.\u201cThe technology is really advancing faster than we had originally anticipated,\u201d said Steve Hill, the director of the governor\u2019s office of economic development in Nevada, the first state to pass legislation allowing driverless cars to be tested, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t really say that Nevada, or really any place else, has really developed the policies that will be needed to facilitate the industry moving forward.\u201dBy many accounts, Mr. Hill is right. Even though fully autonomous cars could be ready for the road within the next decade, only 6 percent of the country\u2019s most populous cities have accounted for them in their long-term plans, according to a study from the National League of Cities, an advocacy and research group.\u201cIf governments are not equipped to react quickly when automated vehicle technology is ready for use by consumers, that will be a challenge, and it has the possibility to delay consumer benefits from this technology,\u201d said Emily Castor, director of transportation policy at Lyft, which has announced a $500 million partnership with General Motors dedicated in part to developing autonomous cars.Representatives from G.M. and other members of the World Economic Forum\u2019s automotive committee will meet in Davos on Friday during closed-door sessions to discuss some of the auto industry\u2019s most pressing issues, including the regulation of self-driving vehicles, according to Alex Mitchell, the head of automotive industry at the World Economic Forum.Google, Uber, Tesla and a host of automakers have been moving at full speed to develop driverless technologies. Although the federal government has expressed support, it has so far left regulatory decisions to state and local governments.\u201cParadoxically, despite a lot of cities thinking this technology is coming, very few have started to plan for it,\u201d Mr. Mitchell said.Last week, Anthony Foxx, the United States transportation secretary, pledged that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration would help set standards for fully automated vehicles within the next six months.That\u2019s encouraging for companies that have been bullish on driverless technologies, but have until now faced a patchwork of cautious legislation: Only a handful of states have passed laws relating to the testing of autonomous cars, and no state expressly allows a completely driverless vehicle on the roadCalifornia\u2019s Department of Motor Vehicles recently proposed requiring a licensed driver to be in the car at all times. That could be a disappointment for companies like Google, which is currently testing a fully autonomous vehicle in Mountain View, Calif.\u201cWe\u2019re encouraged that federal authorities want to work with states and chart a path forward for self-driving cars,\u201d said Johnny Luu, a spokesman for Google. \u201cWe stand ready to work with policy makers at all levels to educate them about the benefits of this technology.\u201dMany local governments see the potential for driverless vehicles to solve urban ills like parking, congestion and even mobility for lower-income residents.But drafting policy for a technology that is not yet on the market makes it much more complicated to answer important practical questions: Do we need extra lanes, but less parking? More curbside space? How will the cars communicate with traffic signals, and who will be responsible when there\u2019s an accident?\u201cIt\u2019s probably more fair to say that we are engaging on the issue than we have developed a plan for it,\u201d said Ron Achelpohl, the director of transportation and environment for the Mid-America Regional Council, an association of local governments in nine counties in Kansas and Missouri. \u201cUntil these vehicles start penetrating the market, it\u2019s going to be difficult to account for how people use them and behave differently.\u201dSome automakers already sell vehicles with a number of semiautonomous functions, meaning that the cars can intervene on a driver\u2019s behalf but still require a human at the wheel. Some Ford vehicles, for example, can come equipped with the ability to sense when it is drifting into another lane and correct the steering, or even help the driver park.But some who advocate driverless cars say that the full benefits come only from a completely autonomous vehicle \u2014 no human required.\u201cThe long-term goal is to have full autonomy, because that\u2019s really where you start to see the benefits from a city perspective, from a safety perspective,\u201d said Brooks Rainwater, the director of the City Solutions and Applied Research Center at the National League of Cities.A car that could spend the day picking people up and dropping them off, for instance, could greatly reduce the need for parking. Companies like Lyft, for example, hope that urbanites of the future will even forgo car ownership altogether.That could have big implications for places like Los Angeles, a city known for both its massive parking structures and its limited use of public transportation.\u201cWhen you think about the impact on our physical city, the idea of maybe smaller roads, more compact travel, repurposing parking structures and parking lots,\u201d said Ashley Z. Hand, the transportation technology strategist for the city of Los Angeles, \u201cit\u2019s a huge opportunity.\u201dFaced with the prospect that driverless technology will quickly outpace regional policy, other local governments across the country have committed more efforts to driverless vehicles. The motivations are not just practical: Driverless car companies can bring more jobs, grants and positive attention.Mr. Hill\u2019s office in Nevada, for example, recently announced that it would create a specific unit devoted to autonomous cars that could serve as a single point of contact for the industry. Driverless cars could also play a large role in which city is awarded $40 million from the Department of Transportation as part of its new Smart City program.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of cities talking as we speak,\u201d said Susan Shaheen, a co-director of the transportation sustainability research center at the University of California, Berkeley. Austin, Tex., where Google is also testing its driverless cars, is already planning to apply for the Smart City challenge, according to the mayor, Steve Adler.\u201cA driverless car doesn\u2019t break very many traffic laws, doesn\u2019t drink while it drives, doesn\u2019t get distracted, really pays attention,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Punctual Patient", "Date": "2016-01-26", "News": "It was two years into the treatment, and T., a retired executive, still continued to fantasize about being my ideal and favorite patient. She repeatedly attempted to please me by trying to say whatever she thought I would like to hear, despite the fact that I kept reminding her that this was her treatment, not mine.Through our explorations it had become clear that pleasing others was second nature to her, the way she navigated in the world, particularly around women whom she considered to be mother figures. She enslaved herself by compulsively fulfilling other people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expectations, which she recognized to be her own projections of her perfectionism. In turn she felt exploited by the very same people she tried to please and resented it.T. always showed up exactly on time. She did not come in too early, which allowed her to avoid meeting other people in the waiting room and thus to keep pretending that she was my only patient. And in all the years we had worked together she had never been late, not even once.I, on the other hand, cannot say the same about myself. Punctuality is not my forte, and despite my attempts to be on time, there had been some occasions when I came to the waiting room a few minutes late. T., in response, would typically make some general comments about the importance punctuality had played in her life. She was self-critical about everything she did, but her punctuality \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a measurable quality \u00e2\u0080\u0094 allowed her to know that she was, at least in this respect, in the right.One day, when we started our session a few minutes late because of my tardiness, T. sat up on the couch and said she was enraged at me for being late. She went on to tell me that she read somewhere that one of the warning signs of a \u201cbad therapist\u201d was lateness and that she felt the whole session would be completely wasted as a result of my being late. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs a matter of fact,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbeing on time is not good enough for me \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I operate on \u00e2\u0080\u0098atomic time.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Although I had a vague notion of what T. meant by \u00e2\u0080\u009catomic time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I looked it up on Google after the session and read: \u00e2\u0080\u009cInternational Atomic Time (TAI) is a time scale that uses the combined output of some 400 highly precise atomic clocks. It provides the exact speed at which our clocks tick.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn the following weeks we continued to talk about this issue. When T. first mentioned \u00e2\u0080\u009catomic time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I, having had my own struggles with perfectionism, felt caught, as if she had discovered my weakness, and I felt guilt and shame. But I soon regained my footing. One day I told T. that while I acknowledged my lateness as a problem, I was a human being, not a machine, that I was comfortable with my \u00e2\u0080\u009chumanity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that while I would continue to try to be punctual, I would be unable to see her on \u00e2\u0080\u009catomic time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn fact,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said to her, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis may sound paradoxical, but while I consider seeing you on time as very important, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think that meeting you on \u00e2\u0080\u0098atomic time\u00e2\u0080\u0099 will be helpful to you.\u00e2\u0080\u009dT. did not seem pleased with my response. In the sessions that followed the issue of time became a constant conflict between us. For a while, we \u00e2\u0080\u009cagreed to disagree.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But the issue could not be avoided. When I was expecting her for a session she would ring the bell, and when I looked at the clock on my computer it showed the precise time of 4:00 p.m. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 our designated meeting. Although I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be ready to see her, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d feel a mounting resistance to what I perceived to be her tyrannical wish to control me. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be dammed if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll rush to the door,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d think as I walked extra slowly.Both of us were now caught in what is called in contemporary psychoanalysis an \u00e2\u0080\u009cenactment\u00e2\u0080\u009d: I felt pressure to act according to T.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s internal fantasies, to which I had feelings and attitudes of rebellion. This became a subtle drama in which both of us took part.T. had had a difficult upbringing. She grew up with a mentally ill mother, a father who abandoned the family, and eight older siblings, who were shipped in and out of the house by child protection services, a fate that T. was spared. She was very attached to her mother. Since her mother neglected T.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s basic needs and was irrationally punitive, T. learned early that pleasing her mother was a matter of life or death and so was resolved to become a \u00e2\u0080\u009cgood girl\u00e2\u0080\u009d in order to survive. She also sought the approval of her older siblings, but they mocked her for being her mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pet.The issue of time was loaded with all sorts of meanings: T.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother had a clock in the living room which was always set 15 minutes fast, thereby distorting the sense of time as well as the broader sense of reality; T. had a recurrent memory of her mother sitting on a chair lost in her own world; T. would sit at the window alone for hours waiting for her siblings to show up. Waiting became so painful for T. that she could not differentiate between waiting for a few minutes and waiting for hours \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the two felt the same to her.At one point in our sessions, T. confessed that before she arrived for a session she had a wish to merge with me so that the two of us would become one. She had a fantasy that when she rang the bell I would appear like a good mommy who was totally ready to fulfill her wishes. If I was not on time then the spell was over, the magic was broken, and the entire session would go to waste. At another time she confessed that she, in fact, envied my flexibility, and wished that she could get rid of her compulsive rigidity. I, in turn, got to understand her despair on a much deeper level and empathized with her desperate need to have me there as the reliable mother she had never had.Oddly, my tardiness \u00e2\u0080\u0094 my failing to appear magically to merge with her on atomic time \u00e2\u0080\u0094 fostered her ability not only to embrace reality but also to focus on pleasing herself rather than others.

{"Headline": "Education Technology Graduates From the Classroom to the Boardroom", "Date": "2016-01-17", "News": "Supported byJudging by the number of learning apps available to classrooms around the country, the education technology market aimed at elementary through high schools is booming.The money pouring into ed tech tells a different story, however. Despite the volume of novel products aimed at schools, the biggest investments are largely going to start-ups focused on higher education or job-related skills \u2014 businesses that feed a market of colleges, companies and consumers willing to spend to promote career advancement.The financing trend highlights the difficulties facing the numerous young companies that develop apps for school use. Many of those tech start-ups have been able raise early-stage financing, often in comparatively small amounts; a subset of those, mimicking techniques established by popular consumer apps, have grown quickly by giving away their products.But industry analysts say school start-ups that have not yet figured out how to make money are likely to have a harder time raising mid-stage financing this year \u2014 which could lead to a bit of a shakeout in the industry.\u201cWe have yet to see that aha business model in the space,\u201d said Matthew Wong, a research analyst at CB Insights. \u201cThe pressure is now on those companies to show they can provide scalable revenue models.\u201dMany big companies also pay for corporate learning services to administer and track internal programs like sexual harassment training. That has already led some academic-focused start-ups to rethink their audiences.\u201cA very simple explanation is: In corporate, they have money,\u201d said Josh Coates, the chief executive of Instructure, an ed tech company that has broadened its strategy.In 2011, Instructure began marketing a learning management system, called Canvas, to universities and school districts. Last year, the company expanded its business into employee-training platforms for corporations. Mr. Coates said he expected that Instructure would eventually derive much of its revenue from companies, which pay higher fees than schools.\u201cIf they can make an employee 2 percent better by paying $50 for corporate training, they are going to do that in a heartbeat,\u201d Mr. Coates said. \u201cA school can\u2019t do that kind of calculation. It\u2019s not an obvious return on investment.\u201dInstructure went public in November and, as of the close of business on Friday, had a market capitalization of about $490 million.The increased availability of connected devices in turn has paved the way for a new generation of learning apps, websites and software services. Some have attracted large user bases by offering a free basic product to teachers while charging schools a site license fee to use a more premium product.Yet software start-ups hoping to sell to schools face particular challenges. The market is divided into about 13,500 districts, each with its own curriculum review and often monthslong purchasing processes. And while digital tools have great potential to make education more accessible and efficient, it is unclear whether the latest wave of technology will significantly improve learning and academic outcomes for the majority of students over the long term.Some ed tech start-ups are hedging their bets by expanding beyond schools to corporations, professionals and even parents.Because many school start-ups are so new, Mitch Kapor, a partner at Kapor Capital, a venture capital fund that has invested in more than 30 education start-ups, predicted that it would take seven to 10 years for the school ed tech market to become clearer.\u201cI think we will see some successes,\u201d said Mr. Kapor, creator of the software Lotus 1-2-3. \u201cBut we\u2019re also going to see lots of companies get off to a good start, falter, end up being acquired, or fail.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "European Antitrust Chief Takes Swipe at Privacy Issue", "Date": "2016-01-17", "News": "Supported byMUNICH \u2014 Margrethe Vestager, the European Union\u2019s antitrust chief, warned on Sunday that the collection of a vast amount of users\u2019 data by a small number of tech companies like Google and Facebook could be in violation of the region\u2019s tough competition rules.Ms. Vestager\u2019s comments are the latest in a growing chorus of European criticism about the privacy practices of American tech giants, many of which rely on crunching data based on people\u2019s social media posts, online search queries and e-commerce purchases to fuel their digital advertising businesses.The comments by Ms. Vestager, who, as the region\u2019s top competition official, has sweeping powers to fine companies that are found to abuse their dominant market positions, show that European officials are stepping up their fight to strengthen data protection. In the European Union, an individual\u2019s right to privacy is viewed on par with other fundamental rights like freedom of expression.\u201cIf a few companies control the data you need to cut costs, then you give them the power to drive others out of the market,\u201d Ms. Vestager said at the DLD conference, a gathering of digital executives and policy makers.She said that \u201cit\u2019s hard to know\u201d how much data is given up when using an online messaging service. \u201cBut it\u2019s a business transaction, not a free giveaway,\u201d she continued. \u201cAs consumers, we need to be treated fairly.\u201dMs. Vestager\u2019s warning shot in the often-rancorous privacy debate comes ahead of a Jan. 31 deadline for Europe and the United States to reach a new data-sharing agreement.\u201cIf someone like Google or Facebook has all of the data, then that\u2019s not good,\u201d Mr. Samwer said here on Sunday.But for Ms. Vestager, a 47-year-old Danish politician who has garnered both fans and detractors for her ambitious competition activities, adding data protection to her portfolio could prove difficult.On Sunday, Ms. Vestager denied claims that Europe was unfairly targeting American tech companies, although some executives in the United States have claimed that European officials are trying to bolster local technology companies at the expense of their large American rivals.Ms. Vestager added that she was not against further consolidation within the industry, despite European antitrust officials\u2019 balking at a number of recent proposed takeovers in the region\u2019s telecommunications sector that they said would reduce competition at the consumer level. Future mergers, she said, should not reduce consumer choice and worsen market competition.\u201cYou can\u2019t just go out there and buy yourself a monopoly,\u201d Ms. Vestager said.Advertisement"}

But in its latest round of fund-raising, it is seeking to raise $500 million through a debt offering, in which investors will gain the right to convert their notes to equity, according to the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the company\u2019s plans were private.The move may help Spotify, which is privately owned, compete against Apple, which introduced a streaming service last year and recently crossed 10 million paying users, as well as Pandora, which has dominated Internet radio in the United States, but has plans to enter the world of on-demand audio, in direct competition with Spotify and Apple.Spotify announced in June that it had 75 million users, 20 million of whom pay, but its numbers are thought to have grown substantially since then. By August, Spotify told record distributors that it had as many as 22 million paying users. It operates in 58 countries, and recently began advertising for jobs in Japan, raising speculation that it would soon begin operating in that country, which is the world\u2019s second-largest music market but one long resistant to streaming.Spotify, one of the most highly valued private technology companies, has been a regular subject of speculation regarding an initial public offering, or as a possible acquisition target by one of the giants of Silicon Valley.

About this he declared: \u201cI\u2019m not going to count my death as a personal failure.\u201dMs. Coutts writes like she sings, which is to say her tone is not beautiful or especially rich, but prickly and a bit wild. She places little value on being likable. Amid shelves of soft and self-consciously therapeutic illness memoirs, this quality makes \u201cThe Iceberg,\u201d her first book, very likable indeed.The story she has to tell is doubly dark because, when Mr. Lubbock discovered he had an aggressive cancer, the couple\u2019s first child, a son, was just 18 months old. Thus \u201cThe Iceberg\u201d is a story about one of the two men in the author\u2019s life losing his wits while the other begins to gain his. Tragedy set beside joy throws both into topographical relief.This book is about love and witness. \u201cThere is going to be destruction: the obliteration of a person, his intellect, his experience and his agency,\u201d Ms. Coutts writes. \u201cI am to watch it. This is my part.\u201dShe chronicles in close detail the fluctuations of her husband\u2019s illness. She also delivers acute writing about her own physical and mental burdens. \u201cI have never cried like this,\u201d she writes early on. \u201cThe fatigue of it is seismic. This is crying as main violence to the self.\u201dShe adds, in words that give this book its title: \u201cThe shock feels greater because the tears are my first intimation of scale. I am nearing the iceberg. My tears are sonar. They release on impact a faint understanding of what lies beneath: a vast solid, the floating mass of ice that is still to come.\u201dMr. Lubbock was well read; Ms. Coutts knows how many books he owned because she built the family\u2019s bookshelves. Another dark irony in \u201cThe Iceberg\u201d is that Mr. Lubbock\u2019s brain tumor grows in the area of speech and language.\u201cTom\u2019s language,\u201d she observes, \u201cis the sky we live under.\u201d It\u2019s a clich\u00e9 to remark that we have lost a part of ourselves when a loved one dies. Ms. Coutts renders this notion concrete when she writes: \u201cHis repertoire and verbal sure-footedness was always mine to share. Through him I had access to a store of language: quotes, stories, songs, ideas, poems learned by heart.\u201dThough the author is a vigilant caregiver, she scorns the baggage that comes with that acknowledgment. \u201cIt is a monstrous evil this sainthood,\u201d she writes. \u201cA deformity. Worn like a caul.\u201dShe sometimes wishes she were not strong at all. \u201cI want please to be one of the weak,\u201d she says. \u201cThe weak are held close and given tea. They are hugged and warmed by the fire. The strong are revered but kept at a distance. They live outside the village.\u201dHer husband was a terrific writer yet Ms. Coutts never quotes his art criticism. She is not much more forthcoming about her own life. I had to turn to Google to discover the name of her band. She never tells us \u2014 an essential detail in any life story \u2014what her parents did for a living.These sorts of things could have been tucked inside a few paragraphs, and would have been grounding. Who exactly are these interesting, well-educated, bohemian Londoners and where did they come from? Yet part of me must acknowledge that the pared-down quality of this memoir adds universality and is part of its tensile strength.By the end, Mr. Lubbock\u2019s tumor has pushed through his skull. It is a \u201cvolcanic excrescence\u201d that sticks out, the author writes, like a horrific potato. But friends are around, and good things to eat are smuggled into hospitals \u2014 Mr. Lubbock was a foodie \u2014 and finally a hospice. \u201cStilton on an oatcake brings an opera of sighs,\u201d she tells us. \u201cHe nearly weeps.\u201d\u201cThe Iceberg\u201d may not be a classic of the illness memoir genre, but it lands with real and unconventional force. Its cover should be stamped this way: \u201cContains not one glib sentence.\u201dNear the end she comments: \u201cChildbirth is nothing. Death is mighty.

{"Headline": "Kamasi Washington\u2019s Giant Step", "Date": "2016-01-21", "News": "FeatureWith his popular, political, uncategorizable jazz, the young saxophonist has become something his genre rarely produces anymore: a celebrity.Supported byAt that moment, Washington was at his aunt\u2019s dance studio, trying to figure out where to put all the dancers. Lula Washington \u2014 whose troupe would be doing the dancing, at least if her nephew could convince her \u2014 knew that there would be a crowd onstage, and she didn\u2019t want her people to get lost in it. Kamasi listened patiently, then got down on the floor and sketched the Nokia stage, insisting that it was more spacious than she imagined. Maybe a riser here? She looked skeptical. They would work it out somehow, she said, but she did not seem persuaded. (As it turned out, Kamasi\u2019s vision exceeded the limits of this particular stage: Lula\u2019s dancers did not perform in the show.)I assumed that \u2018\u2018The Epic\u2019\u2019 referred to some momentous story from the past or, more broadly, to the sweep of the album\u2019s musical ambitions. But as far as I could tell, Washington had never told the story in public before, nor (apparently) had he told his own aunt. We looked at him expectantly.The answer was more involved than I had guessed. \u2018\u2018After I recorded the music,\u2019\u2019 he began, \u2018\u2018I had this dream about a group of young warriors living in a village beneath a mountain.\u2019\u2019 He went on: \u2018\u2018At the top of that mountain, there\u2019s this gate, protected by a guard. The warriors spend all their time training to kill the guard and seize control of the gate. One by one, they are defeated by the guard. But the last warrior has the power to win, and the guard hesitates for the first time, because he sees that the warrior\u2019s heart is good and that his own time has come.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018That was all in one dream?\u2019\u2019 Lula asked.Kamasi nodded. Actually, he said, he went on to have a series of interrelated dreams, a hall of mirrors in which it turns out that the guard wasn\u2019t really killed by the young warrior. He said it would take him three hours \u2014 no, days \u2014 to tell us the whole thing. He planned to turn it all into a graphic novel with an illustrator friend.I asked what all this had to do with jazz. Kamasi again nodded.\u2018\u2018The guard is the person who protects the music and pushes it forward,\u2019\u2019 he said. The hope of the young warrior, he continued, is to take his place and impose his own standards. This explained, perhaps, why the first track of \u2018\u2018The Epic\u2019\u2019 is called \u2018\u2018Change of the Guard.\u2019\u2019 It begins with a bright series of chords laid down by the pianist Cameron Graves, followed by a tidal wave of reeds, choir and strings. A brash and infectiously bombastic wall of sound, the opening stirs memories of the grand, modal style that John Coltrane patented in the 1960s. When I first heard \u2018\u2018Change of the Guard,\u2019\u2019 I was struck by its unabashed evocation of an era that Washington never experienced directly.Unaware of the manga-style story that inspired the title, many listeners heard it as an allegory of that greatest of American epics, the African-American freedom struggle since slavery. Certainly Washington looked well cast for the part, a bearded, dashiki-clad man with an Afro whose sheer size seemed to convey the magnitude of his ambitions. \u2018\u2018The Epic\u2019\u2019 tapped into an intense nostalgia for an era when, as Washington puts it, \u2018\u2018music was a sword of the civil rights movement.\u2019\u2019 But it has awakened those feelings in listeners who, in most cases, were not alive to know that era. The audiences lining up to see his band have been unusually large (Washington plays in concert halls, not small jazz clubs), unusually multiracial and unusually young. And they do something that people at jazz concerts seldom do anymore: They dance. When I saw him perform in Brooklyn, the audience roared when he came onstage, as if he were a rock star. (He will, in fact, be joining Guns N\u2019 Roses in the lineup at the Coachella festival in April.)It would be unfair, and a little silly, to ask whether Washington might be the next Coltrane. In any case, there\u2019s room for only one Coltrane in the theology of jazz. But with his overt spiritualism and his humble bearing, Washington has reawakened the widespread longing for a Coltrane-like figure who might lead jazz out of the desert of obscurity and restore its spiritual purpose. He is not the first such figure \u2014 Pharoah Sanders, Albert Ayler and David S. Ware have been cast as prophetic messengers in the wake of Coltrane\u2019s death in 1967 \u2014 but he is the first to come along in some time. Stranger still, he comes from a city that few people even associate with jazz.\u2018\u2018You know what record this is?\u2019\u2019 he asked.\u2018\u2018Yeah, yeah. .\u2009.\u2009.\u2019\u2019 Rickey hummed the tune. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t know who\u2019s playing, though.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018The drummer played in your band. He used to dye his hair blond.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018Blond hair and played in my band?\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018It\u2019s Ronald Bruner Sr.\u2019\u2019Bruner Sr., who played with the Temptations, is the father of two of Kamasi\u2019s bandmates: Ronald Bruner Jr., also a drummer; and the bassist and singer Stephen Bruner, who makes brooding, ethereal indie-funk under the name Thundercat and whose nimble playing is all over Kendrick Lamar\u2019s latest album. Like the Marsalis brothers, many musicians in the Los Angeles scene come from musical families. Kamasi told me that \u2018\u2018Change of the Guard\u2019\u2019 is a tribute to men like his father and Bruner Sr., musicians who \u2018\u2018had something to say but never had a chance to say it\u2019\u2019 beyond Los Angeles. Throughout the 1980s, Rickey Washington led a Christian jazz band, which Bruner joined after giving up secular music. When Kamasi first expressed a desire to play, his father sent him to church. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s the best place to learn,\u2019\u2019 Rickey said. \u2018\u2018You play every week, and you\u2019ve got to play a groove. It doesn\u2019t come any other way but with a groove. They\u2019re clapping on two and four, and you\u2019re moving to the music. If you listen to Kamasi, you know what the groove is, because it\u2019s right in his body.\u2019\u2019I went to hear Washington play gospel a few days later at a Nigerian evangelical church. The stage was bathed in pink and purple lighting worthy of a Prince show. Hundreds of parishioners, overwhelmingly Nigerian, many in African ceremonial clothes, swayed to gospel songs made faster and funkier by Nigerian highlife beats. Washington\u2019s solos were modest in length, as befit a sideman, but he kept his big, preacherly sound. Whenever he played, the music came into stirring focus, and his flowing African robes gave him the air of a griot or medicine man.\u2018\u2018I always noticed that \u2019Trane thing, that spirituality, in Kamasi\u2019s playing,\u2019\u2019 said the guitarist Greg Dalton, who performs under the name Gee Mack and who once employed Washington in a band. \u2018\u2018You can have all the technique in the world, but if you can\u2019t connect with an audience, it doesn\u2019t matter. And this man, Kamasi, is a poet.\u2019\u2019 The church\u2019s pastor wasn\u2019t aware that Washington is a rising star of the tenor sax, but as we left the church, a young boy came up to tell us that he had just seen him on television. Washington smiled at the boy. \u2018\u2018Do you play an instrument?\u2019\u2019 he asked.That sense of home, of African-American pride and identity, reverberates throughout \u2018\u2018The Epic.\u2019\u2019 It\u2019s not just the tributes to his grandmother and great-grandmother, or the concluding hymn to Malcolm X, which incorporates Ossie Davis\u2019s eulogy as well as one of Malcolm\u2019s speeches. It\u2019s the album\u2019s soaring panorama of black American musical history, from gospel and blues to jazz, doo-wop and funk, offered as a celebration of black beauty in the face of adversity. Its sound is particularly evocative of the early 1970s, when Marvin Gaye, Curtis Mayfield and Stevie Wonder were composing their own epics and jazz musicians like Max Roach were playing spirituals with gospel choirs. The Afro-futurist cover of \u2018\u2018The Epic,\u2019\u2019 too, suggests an early \u201970s LP: a picture of Washington in a black dashiki against an interstellar backdrop, saxophone in hand.That blend of rebellious intent and retro self-fashioning is hardly unique to Washington. It permeates the cultural renaissance spawned by Black Lives Matter, a movement that has combined Black Power nostalgia with an exuberant faith in the revolutionary potential of technology and social media. \u2018\u2018The Epic\u2019\u2019 is arguably the most ambitious expression thus far of this renaissance, whose touchstones also include Claudia Rankine\u2019s prose-poem \u2018\u2018Citizen,\u2019\u2019 Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019s memoir \u2018\u2018Between the World and Me,\u2019\u2019 D\u2019Angelo\u2019s album \u2018\u2018Black Messiah\u2019\u2019 and Kendrick Lamar\u2019s \u2018\u2018To Pimp a Butterfly,\u2019\u2019 with its indelible refrain, \u2018\u2018We gon\u2019 be alright.\u2019\u2019 Not surprisingly, \u2018\u2018The Epic\u2019\u2019 has found a particularly receptive following among black intellectuals. As Robin Kelley, a historian at U.C.L.A. and a biographer of Thelonious Monk, puts it, \u2018\u2018In a world where you feel like blackness is under assault and you\u2019re looking for a way to express joy, pain and possibility, \u2018The Epic\u2019 speaks to what black people feel inside.\u2019\u2019 The writer Greg Tate, who calls Washington the \u2018\u2018jazz voice of Black Lives Matter,\u2019\u2019 told me that his music offers \u2018\u2018a healing force, a place of regeneration when you\u2019re trying to deal with the trauma of being black in America.\u2019\u2019I mentioned Tate\u2019s assessment to Washington as we stood in the midday heat on Crenshaw, a main boulevard in South Central, in front of a Senegalese shop where he has his dashikis made. At the mosque next door, a small group of men was gathered, and an old man was selling baked chicken and cornbread from a cart. \u2018\u2018Music is an expression of who you are, and \u2014 at least in that sense \u2014 I think I epitomize Black Lives Matter,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m a big black man, and I\u2019m easily misunderstood. Before I started wearing these African clothes, people would assume that I was a threat and that it was O.K. to be violent toward me.\u2019\u2019 He scratched his beard and paused to reflect. \u2018\u2018The harsh reality in our communities is that the greatest representatives of order, the police, are basically against you, so you feel as if you live in a society without order.\u2019\u2019Washington grew up with a constant fear of violence. The middle child of his parents\u2019 three sons, he was born in 1981, at the beginning of an era plagued by crack cocaine, gang warfare and police brutality that culminated a decade later in the Rodney King riots. The first house he lived in, on 74th and Figueroa in South Central, was, he said, \u2018\u2018deep in the hood.\u2019\u2019 (At one point, Rickey found the body of a prostitute in the backyard.) When he was 3, his parents divorced, and his mother, a chemistry teacher, moved to a better part of South Central. Soon Rickey Washington left, too, moving to Inglewood, and Kamasi split his time between the two homes. Both neighborhoods were a considerable step up from 74th and Figueroa, Kamasi said, but still \u2018\u2018there were gunshots and sirens every night.\u2019\u2019His turn to jazz was hardly unexpected. \u2018\u2018Kamasi was hearing \u2018A Love Supreme\u2019 before he even knew what he was listening to,\u2019\u2019 his father told me. He started out on drums at 3 and began studying the clarinet at 9. But Kamasi says he mostly listened to hip-hop until he was 11, when a friend of his older brother gave him a mixtape of Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers with the trumpeter Lee Morgan. (That friend, Lamar Van \u00adSciver, is now a hip-hop and R&B producer.) \u2018\u2018That\u2019s when I finally got into jazz,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018All of a sudden, I became aware of all this music I had around me at home.\u2019\u2019 He studied his father\u2019s vinyl collection and taught himself to play Wayne Shorter songs on soprano saxophone.At 13, Washington announced to his father that he wanted to be a jazz musician. To test his seriousness, Rickey asked his son to sing a Charlie Parker solo. (\u2018\u2018I knew if you couldn\u2019t sing it, you couldn\u2019t play it,\u2019\u2019 Rickey said.) Kamasi sang the head and solo of Parker\u2019s 1951 bop classic \u2018\u2018Blues for Alice\u2019\u2019 note for note. His father\u2019s reward was a Conn 6M alto saxophone, the same model Parker played. He played the alto in church for nearly a year, then switched to tenor \u2014 his father\u2019s. \u2018\u2018He took my tenor!\u2019\u2019 Rickey said. \u2018\u2018A Selmer Mark VI, the best saxophone they make. He didn\u2019t realize how valuable it was.\u2019\u2019 It\u2019s the only tenor Kamasi has ever played.Coltrane became his obsession. His favorite record was \u2018\u2018Transition,\u2019\u2019 a defining work of Coltrane\u2019s classic quartet. It was avant-\u00adgarde yet still melodic, exhilaratingly expressive but never chaotic. \u2018\u2018He was just treading a line in a way that was powerful,\u2019\u2019 Kamasi said. \u2018\u2018\u2009\u2018Transition\u2019 was like the rarest of the rare steaks without being raw. You could still eat it.\u2019\u2019 He modeled himself on Coltrane, not just his sound but also his legendary practice regimen \u2014 as long as 12 hours a day, with sometimes hours spent on a single scale or even a single note. Washington was soon averaging nine hours a day; as if to summon the master\u2019s spirit, he often worked on Coltrane tunes. He and Cameron Graves, who is now his pianist, \u2018\u2018used to compete with each other to see who could practice the most.\u2019\u2019 It was a monkish existence, Washington said. \u2018\u2018Becoming a musician is a strange thing. It\u2019s not all cupcakes and ice cream. You\u2019re trying to master an instrument, and you sometimes can\u2019t tell if you\u2019re getting better. You love it, but you also hate it.\u2019\u2019Music was not the only thing Andrews\u2019s students had in common: Most of them were growing up black, male and at risk in Los Angeles. \u2018\u2018We could have gone into gangbanging,\u2019\u2019 Bruner told me. \u2018\u2018That model was available to us. I was in a situation that got out of control, and a friend of mine died. But that difficulty made everyone stronger. The threat of being caught up in that makes you push harder.\u2019\u2019They had Andrews to keep them on track. A tall, solidly built man now in his late 60s who wears a mustache and a Tuskegee baseball cap, Andrews radiates self-confidence, drive and impatience with excuses. Over breakfast one morning at a local soul-food restaurant, he told me how he made sure his players kept their grades up and emphasized the importance of craftsmanship and professionalism. \u2018\u2018Kamasi can do the Archie Shepp thing or the \u2019Trane thing and ride that note,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018but he knows how to take it back.\u2019\u2019Washington received a different kind of mentoring in Leimert Park, where he and his friends went to after-hours jam sessions. Leimert Park was designed by the Olmsted firm in the late 1920s as a whites-only planned community, but by the 1960s it had become an African-American neighborhood. After the 1965 Watts riots, Leimert Park became a center of the Black Arts movement, a cultural offshoot of the Black Power movement. Lined with fig trees and exuding community pride, Leimert Park was as close to an oasis as you could find in South Central. Even during the crack epidemic, it remained a home to black-owned art galleries, bookstores and clothing shops.When Washington began going there in the mid-1990s, it was in the middle of a revival. Its mecca was the World Stage, the nonprofit performing-arts gallery established by Billy Higgins and the poet Kamau Da\u00e1ood, a leader of the Black Arts movement. Higgins and Da\u00e1ood envisioned the World Stage as an extension of the \u201960s jazz activism pioneered by Da\u00e1ood\u2019s mentor, Horace Tapscott. It could barely seat 50 people, but it attracted some of the greatest musicians in jazz and helped inspire a scene that cut across divisions of generation and genre. \u2018\u2018We were in Leimert Park every night,\u2019\u2019 Washington says. \u2018\u2018We\u2019d get in everywhere without money. I still don\u2019t know how we did it.\u2019\u2019Snoop was particularly demanding when it came to the placement of notes in relation to the beat, and Washington struggled at first to hear the beat the way Snoop did. After a while, though, he began to discern what he calls \u2018\u2018the little subtleties,\u2019\u2019 the way, for example, \u2018\u2018the drummer D-Loc would lock into the bass line.\u2019\u2019 He continued: \u2018\u2018It wasn\u2019t like the compositional elements in Stravinsky. It wasn\u2019t about counterpoint or thick harmonies. It was more about the relationships and the timing, the one little cool thing you could play in that little space. It might just be one little thing in a four-minute song, but it was the perfect thing you could play in it. I started to hear music in a different way, and it changed the way I played jazz. Just playing the notes didn\u2019t do it for me anymore.\u2019\u2019 He came to see hip-hop as a relative of jazz. \u2018\u2018All forms are complex once you get to a really high level, and jazz and hip-hop are so connected,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018In hip-hop you sample, while in jazz you take Broadway tunes and turn them into something different. They\u2019re both forms that repurpose other forms of music.\u2019\u2019Washington often skips in conversation from Kendrick Lamar to Coltrane, and from Charlie Parker to Stravinsky. The reason that we don\u2019t see these connections, he says, is that we\u2019re captives of \u2018\u2018preconceived notions,\u2019\u2019 the most confining being the very idea of \u2018\u2018jazz.\u2019\u2019 Some musicians complain that even the word \u2018\u2018jazz\u2019\u2019 deprives them of a popular audience; others see it as an insult. As the trumpeter Nicholas Payton recently put it, \u2018\u2018\u2009\u2018Jazz\u2019 is an oppressive, colonialist slave term.\u2019\u2019 For musicians like Payton, \u2018\u2018jazz\u2019\u2019 is a white establishment label that cuts their music off from other black musical forms; they prefer terms like \u2018\u2018black art music,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018black classical music,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018black creative music\u2019\u2019 or simply \u2018\u2018black music.\u2019\u2019But Washington\u2019s criticism of musical categories is at once more expansive and more subtle than Payton\u2019s. For Washington, the problem is not merely that categories ghettoize forms of music, but that they prevent us from fully listening. All music, he believes, deserves a fair hearing \u2014 even much ridiculed forms like \u2018\u2018smooth jazz.\u2019\u2019 I had brunch one morning with Washington and his girlfriend, Tiffany Wright, an earnest young woman with long braids who established a private elementary school in Wilshire under her own name, the Wright Academy. An insidiously saccharine ballad by the smooth-jazz saxophonist Najee came on. I asked Washington if it bothered him that some people mistook this sort of jazz for the real thing.\u2018\u2018I don\u2019t have an aversion to it,\u2019\u2019 he said. In fact, he went on, he liked some smooth jazz, notably the saxophone player Grover Washington Jr. (no relation). Gently taking me to task for my snobbery, he noted that Najee, like many smooth-jazz players, had roots in gospel \u2014 and that in any case, no musical genre is entirely devoid of value.\u2018\u2018You want my layman\u2019s interpretation?\u2019\u2019 Wright volunteered. \u2018\u2018Kamasi is totally nonjudgmental, in all areas. It makes life a lot less stressful.\u2019\u2019That mellow, West Coast inclusiveness is another pointed contrast between Washington and the young Wynton Marsalis, who once declared, \u2018\u2018There is nothing sadder than a jazz musician playing funk.\u2019\u2019 When Washington and his trombonist, Ryan Porter, trade riffs, they make no secret of their love of Maceo Parker and Fred Wesley, two of the horn men in the James Brown band. \u2018\u2018It wasn\u2019t a mistake to call James Brown\u2019s music funk, but I\u2019m not sure it was good for jazz,\u2019\u2019 Washington told me. Jazz, as he sees it, is not so much a genre as a way of styling music. Which means that if he is playing Debussy\u2019s \u2018\u2018Clair de Lune\u2019\u2019 \u2014 as he does in a languorous, brazenly sentimental arrangement on \u2018\u2018The Epic\u2019\u2019 \u2014 it\u2019s jazz.Surprisingly, given that Washington toured with Snoop and later Lauryn Hill, one genre you don\u2019t hear on \u2018\u2018The Epic\u2019\u2019 is hip-hop. \u2018\u2018I was already playing all that,\u2019\u2019 he explains. \u2018\u2018When I got to do my music, I wanted to play like me.\u2019\u2019In 2011, after two years of testing their ideas at Piano Bar, Washington and his friends decided that it was time to go into the studio. They all pitched in to rent the Kingsize Soundlabs in Echo Park, canceled all their gigs for December and barely left except to sleep. The musicians weren\u2019t paid for their work, because they were all playing on one another\u2019s records. By the end of the month, they had 192 songs; 45 were under Washington\u2019s leadership. He chose 17 for \u2018\u2018The Epic,\u2019\u2019 14 of them his own compositions. The album came out on Brainfeeder, an independent label run by Ellison.The music on \u2018\u2018The Epic\u2019\u2019 was already quite dense, with three people on horns, two drummers, two bassists, two keyboardists and a singer, but Washington wasn\u2019t done tinkering. While touring with Chaka Khan, he began to write choir and string parts. Washington told me that he wanted to evoke Stravinsky\u2019s \u2018\u2018Symphony of Psalms\u2019\u2019 in the choir and string arrangements, but they\u2019re equally reminiscent of Marvin Gaye\u2019s \u2018\u2018What\u2019s Going On\u2019\u2019 and Curtis Mayfield\u2019s \u2018\u2018Superfly.\u2019\u2019 Above all, \u2018\u2018The Epic\u2019\u2019 breathes new life into the black consciousness or \u2018\u2018spiritual\u2019\u2019 jazz of the early 1970s, when saxophonists like Pharoah Sanders, Gary Bartz, Joe Henderson and Billy Harper grafted free jazz sonorities onto hard-bop melodies and danceable grooves, often embroidering them with African percussion as well. An expression of the cultural nationalism that spread across urban black communities in the 1970s, spiritual jazz has often been dismissed as Afrocentric kitsch in histories of jazz, but it was popular in black America, and it was the jazz that Rickey Washington played on the stereo at home. It aimed to move the audience but also instruct them. If they didn\u2019t get the message, the album titles spelled it out: \u2018\u2018Black Unity,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Black Saint,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018In Pursuit of Blackness,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Power to the People.\u2019\u2019In a 1966 essay, \u2018\u2018The Changing Same (R&B and New Black Music),\u2019\u2019 Amiri Baraka called for a new \u2018\u2018unity music,\u2019\u2019 a synthesis of jazz and black vernacular styles that would \u2018\u2018include all the resources, all the rhythms, all the yells and cries, all that \u00adinformation about the world, the Black ommmmm\u00admmmmm\u00admmmmm, opening and entering.\u2019\u2019 Kamasi Washington is far from being the first musician of his generation to set off in search of that om. Jason Moran, Robert Glasper, Steve Coleman and other East Coast musicians have been working toward such a synthesis for years. But Washington and the West Coast Get Down have managed to strike a chord with audiences in a way that has eluded most of their peers on the East Coast.Serendipity, of course, has been an important ingredient in their success. As Greg Tate told me, \u2018\u2018You have to go to mysticism to explain how these things come together at the same time: the best heroic jazz origin story since the Marsalis brothers, being on Kendrick Lamar\u2019s record and Flying Lotus\u2019s label, and Black Lives Matter.\u2019\u2019 But the Los Angeles scene would not have had the same impact without Washington\u2019s personal charisma, his deeply spiritual sound and his welcoming, Buddha-like aura. He may not be a major innovator, but he is a remarkably forceful communicator: in the words of Kamau Da\u00e1ood, \u2018\u2018a perfect vessel for the coming together of generations in his music.\u2019\u2019After dinner, the men gathered on sofas around Kamasi, who sat in a chair in front of a fireplace. He was wearing a dashiki and a knitted Jamaican cap; he seemed to be deep in thought, his eyes in some far-off place. The first speaker was Bennie Maupin, who played bass clarinet on Davis\u2019s \u2018\u2018Bitches Brew\u2019\u2019 and a variety of reed instruments in Herbie Hancock\u2019s fusion band Headhunters. He began by asking Kamasi to explain the meaning of his name.\u2018\u2018It was intended to be Kumasi, the capital of the Ashanti tribes in Ghana,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018To be under the kuma tree is to bring people together, to bring peace.\u2019\u2019 Rickey Washington and a friend had gotten lost one night in Kumasi while they were on tour in Ghana in the late 1970s. \u2018\u2018A guy came out of his house and gave them a place to stay for the night,\u2019\u2019 Kamasi said. \u2018\u2018The hospitality was higher than anything he\u2019d experienced in Watts, where you might just get robbed. He wanted to name me after that city, but since this was before Yahoo and Google, he misremembered what it was called.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018Yeah, I was into that whole consciousness thing when I named him,\u2019\u2019 Rickey said. \u2018\u2018The kuma tree brings shade, and I prayed that Kamasi would be a person who brings people together.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018The energy in this music is a healing energy,\u2019\u2019 Maupin continued, praising Kamasi\u2019s wisdom and kindness, promising to stand behind him and urging him to choose his friends carefully and be mindful of his health. Coltrane, he recalled, had regretted \u2018\u2018wasting so much time\u2019\u2019 at the end of his short life.The composer and flutist James Newton, a burly man with long, graying dreadlocks, was next. \u2018\u2018To have this group of men here for you: Do you realize how heavy that is? And do you realize that Art Tatum, Mingus, Eric Dolphy, Stravinsky and Schoenberg were all once living in a 20-mile radius, here in Los Angeles? Most of these things you know already, but now you\u2019ve been put in the position of being a great hope. Don\u2019t let your children become a casualty of your career or the industry. As Bennie said, we\u2019d all go to war for you.\u2019\u2019Reggie Andrews spoke briefly, reminding Washington that his most successful students had always taken care of their bodies. It was one of several pointed warnings about health: The one white man at dinner was Washington\u2019s nutritionist, whom Rickey hired to help Kamasi lose weight. (Two months later, while on tour in Stavanger, Norway, Kamasi would slip on a snow-covered cobblestone road and fracture his fibula, making these warnings seem even more urgent.) Kamau Da\u00e1ood, a soft-spoken and contemplative man with a white goatee and light-brown eyes, remembered his own mentor, Horace Tapscott, who had \u2018\u2018brought together all the outcasts, all the renegades\u2019\u2019 in the Pan Afrikan Peoples Arkestra. He paid elegiac tribute to Tapscott\u2019s project, but he also alluded to the failures of his own generation and spoke of the importance of family and responsibility. \u2018\u2018In Horace\u2019s band, one section was vegetarian and meditating, but the other was nodding off\u2019\u2019 on heroin.The speeches went on for more than an hour. They were stories of the jazz life, pitched somewhere between sermon and self-admonishment. These elder statesmen were welcoming their friend\u2019s son into a very exclusive fraternity, but also warning of the dangers in store. \u2018\u2018This really felt like being down South,\u2019\u2019 Newton said. \u2018\u2018Yeah, South L.A.,\u2019\u2019 another guest corrected him.Kamasi listened attentively, speaking only when spoken to: If the young jazz warrior was carrying a weapon, he kept it well hidden. \u2018\u2018It takes some of the pressure off to hear from these men who have been down this road before,\u2019\u2019 he told me later, \u2018\u2018since I\u2019m on this journey and I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going.\u2019\u2019 But as I watched him that evening, I was struck by how small he suddenly looked, surrounded by the guardians of Los Angeles jazz. At the end of the ceremony, Rickey Washington faced his son and said: \u2018\u2018You have now received the wisdom of your elders. What you do with it is on you.\u2019\u2019Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Challenging Uber, Lyft Bets on a Road Wide Enough for Two", "Date": "2016-01-09", "News": "Supported byThe word \u201cmonopoly\u201d has a distinctly nefarious ring to it, conjuring up images of thuggish industrialists in smoky rooms, scheming to undermine their rivals.Yet in Silicon Valley, it\u2019s not at all uncommon for one company to dominate a particular field. Google is the runaway leader in online search. Facebook is the largest social network in the world by a wide margin. Amazon is far and away the biggest e-commerce site.But while market dominance is hard to break, that doesn\u2019t stop upstarts from trying. In the case of Uber, it is Lyft that is doing its best to keep up.\u201cWe\u2019re gaining share in the United States,\u201d said John Zimmer, Lyft\u2019s president and co-founder. \u201cThat\u2019s not what happens when one player has a complete monopoly.\u201d\u201cThe mere possession of monopoly power, and the concomitant charging of monopoly prices, is not only not unlawful; it is an important element of the free-market system,\u201d Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in that opinion. \u201cThe opportunity to charge monopoly prices \u2014 at least for a short period \u2014 is what attracts \u2018business acumen\u2019 in the first place; it induces risk-taking that produces innovation and economic growth.\u201dIn the book \u201cZero to One,\u201d which he wrote with Blake Masters, the investor and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel offers tips on how to create monopolies, arguing that once achieved, they lead to more innovation.\u201cMonopolies drive progress because the promise of years or even decades of monopoly profits provides a powerful incentive to innovate,\u201d he writes. \u201cThen monopolies can keep innovating because profits enable them to make the long-term plans and to finance the ambitious research projects that firms locked in competition can\u2019t dream of.\u201dAnd regulators have not been cracking down on Silicon Valley. Given how many big technology companies loom large in their respective markets, there have been relatively few big antitrust actions brought against tech giants.\u201cThis is different from the old monopolies of the industrial age,\u201d Robert Reich, the former labor secretary, said of technology companies.Unlike United States Steel or Standard Oil, two of corporate history\u2019s biggest brutes, today\u2019s tech monopolies are rarely the exclusive provider of an essential commodity. Instead, many achieve their initial dominance by distinguishing themselves in a crowded marketplace, then rapidly taking market share thanks to the power of network effects \u2014 that is, the more people use a service, the more valuable that service becomes to other people, who join in and make the service all the more popular.Network effects helped Google, Facebook and Amazon run away from their competitors, and are helping Uber today. Google wasn\u2019t the first search engine, Facebook wasn\u2019t the first social network, and Amazon wasn\u2019t the first to sell goods online. There are still many other sites for search, social and e-commerce. But despite an array of options, users keep coming back to the market leaders.Some argue, however, that the regulatory framework needs to adjust for a new kind of market dominance.Along with network effects, another hallmark of today\u2019s tech monopolies is that, perhaps fearing obsolescence, they diversify. While Microsoft still makes its Windows and Office software, it also owns Skype and has a big video gaming business. Google is now a subsidiary of Alphabet, a new parent company that is also home to a health care company, a self-driving-cars division and a venture capital firm. Amazon is expanding its cloud computing and streaming-media businesses. And Facebook has diversified into messaging with WhatsApp, photos with Instagram, and virtual reality with Oculus Rift.This, too, creates challenges for regulators. When mergers and acquisitions are part of the natural life cycle of start-ups and venture capital, it isn\u2019t easy to block deals that might hypothetically reduce competition down the road. As a result, regulators have blessed many acquisitions that, to critics, appear to be deeply anticompetitive.Gary Reback, a lawyer who helped prompt a landmark antitrust investigation into Microsoft and is now pursuing Google in Europe, makes the case that Google bought its way to dominance in online advertising through the acquisition of DoubleClick, bought its leadership in mobile by purchasing Android and bought its strong mapping franchise in the deal for Waze. Similarly, Facebook bought two of its nearest rivals, WhatsApp and Instagram. If any of those deals had been blocked, Mr. Reback argues, behemoths like Google and Facebook might today be facing more concerted competition.\u201cOnce one of these companies gets a monopoly, it\u2019s easy to spread the monopoly to adjacent markets by acquisition,\u201d Mr. Reback said. \u201cYou would think antitrust enforcers would know this by now.\u201dWhile monopolies in the tech industry are perhaps easier than ever to achieve, industry experts contend they are also more vulnerable than ever before. The advent of the smartphone and widespread access to broadband Internet connectivity have democratized access to creative new technologies.\u201cSun Microsystems. EMC. Cisco. All these were considered the dominant market players in their category at the time,\u201d said Rich Wong, a venture capitalist at Accel Partners. \u201cThen the vast majority of them got whacked by this thing called the cloud.\u201dAnd of course, billions of people browse the web without Google, use other social networking apps besides Facebook, and shop on websites besides Amazon. Though no upstarts have replaced them yet, none are immune to disruption.As for Uber, if it\u2019s not a monopoly already, it is the giant in the ride-hailing market, at least in the United States. One rival, Sidecar, shut down last month, and Lyft is its last meaningful competitor on a national scale. (Uber faces a tougher road abroad, where it is tangling with regulators in Europe, recently withdrew from Frankfurt and is fighting against entrenched rivals in China and other international markets.)As the underdog, Lyft is trying to put more drivers on the road and acquire new users. Like Uber, the company is private, and neither shares much information about performance. But Mr. Zimmer said the company was quickly increasing market share in the United States. He also sees the on-demand ride business as different from search or social media and more like telecommunications companies, where several big competitors can compete on service.\u201cJust like AT&T and Verizon need three bars of coverage,\u201d he said, \u201cwe get down to two to three minutes of wait time for a vehicle to arrive. Once it gets to that point, there\u2019s no difference in behavior between services. That\u2019s when you compete on experience.\u201dStill, Lyft will be hard pressed to unseat Uber.\u201cThe network effects hold competition at stiff arm\u2019s length,\u201d said Steve Cheney, an entrepreneur and co-founder of Estimote, a micro-location platform for mobile developers.Or perhaps the ride-hailing market is big enough for both Uber and Lyft. Monopolies don\u2019t necessarily mean there is no competition whatsoever. While a company like Uber may take a huge lead in market share, others, like Lyft, may still have room to profit and even prosper. Even Google has not managed to squash every other search engine.\u201cMicrosoft has a decent search business. A lot of Yahoo\u2019s profits still come from searches on Yahoo properties,\u201d said Roelof Botha, a partner at Sequoia Capital, which has investments in WhatsApp and Airbnb. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a \u2018winner takes most\u2019 than a \u2018winner takes all\u2019 phenomenon.\u201dShould that be the case in the ride-hailing industry, Uber and Lyft may become something truly competitive by Silicon Valley standards: a duopoly.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alphabet Shakes Up Its Robotics Division", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byOver the last two months, Alphabet, the new holding company that separated Google from its collection of speculative projects, has reframed the robots effort, moving it from a stand-alone division inside Google to a piece of the X research division. The company has also hired Hans Peter Brondmo, a technology industry veteran who last worked at Nokia, to help with management.Courtney Hohne, an X spokeswoman, confirmed the moves, but declined to comment further.A reorganization of the robots group is one of several recent moves inside the X division, which used to be called Google X but was rebranded with the Alphabet reorganization and recently unveiled a new logo.A range of companies, including tech competitors like Amazon and car manufacturers, are signaling their interest in robotics.\u201cEverything is happening, from industry manufacturing to self-driving cars to drones to personal robots to A.I. systems,\u201d said Fei-Fei Li, director of Stanford University\u2019s artificial intelligence laboratory.X has several projects in varying degrees of completion, but has lately been \u201cgraduating\u201d them as stand-alone companies or preparing them for such a move. The life sciences group, for example, is now called Verily. X also recently hired an auto industry veteran to lead its self-driving car effort \u2014 called Chauffeur internally \u2014 and noted that the project was a good candidate to be spun out.Robotics has gone in the opposite direction for reasons that are personal and practical. The division was created in 2013 by Andy Rubin, who led the development of the widely used Android operating system software, and it has been without a leader since Mr. Rubin left in 2014 to start a technology incubator that helps young start-ups turn their ideas into businesses.So in December, the division was moved inside X. The X team will first have to review the various projects and refocus them toward solving specific problems that would be reframed as a particular moonshot effort, according to Ms. Hohne.The group\u2019s most recent hire, Mr. Brondmo, will help with that process. He has a background as a product manager. He graduated from M.I.T. and has led successful Internet start-ups, including an early digital video company, an Internet marketing firm and Plum, a social networking company, which was acquired by Nokia in 2009. At Nokia, he developed an unannounced camera project until it was canceled in 2014.Mr. Brondmo declined to comment.After starting the robotics division, Mr. Rubin quickly went on a buying spree, purchasing a number of promising companies, including Boston Dynamics, the maker of experimental military robots, and Schaft, an elite group of Japanese roboticists from the University of Tokyo.The effort was called Replicant internally \u2014 a nod to \u201cBlade Runner,\u201d the 1982 science fiction film \u2014 and at one point was considering deals to supply robots to load and unload trucks for a major package delivery company.But while the companies were promising, Mr. Rubin invested in several technologies that had industry observers scratching their heads about his overall direction. Mr. Rubin originally said that the robotics division would be a 10-year moonshot, and when he was in negotiations to acquire companies he talked about the possibility of the driverless Google car rolling up to your house and the Google robot jumping off the back bumper.\u201cAndy Rubin acquired some of the best, innovative companies out there, but also a mix that leaves one wondering about how he imagined it all fitting together,\u201d said Tandy Trower, founder and chief executive of Hoaloha Robotics, which is developing robots to help older people and people with disabilities.Mr. Rubin now directs an artificial intelligence-oriented investment incubator called Playground Global. It is based in Palo Alto, Calif., a few miles from his old offices, and has received investments from Google, Foxconn and others.Mr. Rubin did not respond to emails seeking comment.Google\u2019s robotics effort stalled after his departure, going through a variety of leaders, including James Kuffner, a Carnegie Mellon roboticist who has since joined Toyota\u2019s research and development laboratory in Palo Alto, and Jonathan Rosenberg, who is a troubleshooter for Larry Page, the Google co-founder who is Alphabet\u2019s chief executive.Many in the industry say it is likely to be awhile before companies, Alphabet included, can get through the many technological and regulatory hurdles that stand in the way of robots becoming a huge business.\u201cDespite the acceleration of robotics technology, accessibility to it may take longer than we anticipate,\u201d said Mr. Trower. \u201cOther examples are the new regulations that are being put in place to address the use of autonomous cars or flying drones.\u201dAn article on Saturday about a revitalization of Google\u2019s robotics division misstated part of the background of Hans Peter Brondmo, who has been hired to help manage the unit, now part of the X research division of the Alphabet holding company. He graduated from M.I.T., not the M.I.T. Media Lab.Advertisement"}

He doesn\u2019t do much of either anymore \u2014 he mostly uses his smartphone to pay for things.Mr. Craine\u2019s money choices point to the millennial-led shift toward new digital financial services, a change in behavior that threatens to upend the consumer banking industry. The popularity of the services has left the major banks rushing to adapt, even as they have regained their footing after the financial crisis.Americans in their 20s and early 30s, analysts say, offer a glimpse of tomorrow\u2019s banking market. \u201cTheir relationship with the financial system is very different \u2014 it\u2019s an electronic one, on their smartphones,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cThat can and will be very disruptive to the banking system.\u201dInvestment worldwide in start-ups focused on retail banking markets rose to nearly $6.8 billion in 2015, according to CB Insights, a research firm. That is more than triple the $2.2 billion in 2014.The major banks have all taken steps to address the new reality. Citigroup, for example, has teamed up with Lending Club, an online lender. In October, the bank set up a separate unit, Citi FinTech. In a memo to the staff, Stephen Bird, the new chief executive of global consumer banking, said the bank had reached a \u201cpivotal point,\u201d when \u201ctechnological change is intensifying\u201d and \u201ccompetitors are everywhere.\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Bird called the new unit the \u201cspearhead\u201d of the bank\u2019s move into the future. The long-range goal, he said, is to provide an array of banking and money management services that are as effortless to use as ordering and paying for a ride on Uber.\u201cIt\u2019s a big opportunity for us if we can move fast enough,\u201d Mr. Bird said. \u201cIt\u2019s both an opportunity and a threat.\u201dWhile the fintech insurgents are moving and growing quickly, they must overcome big challenges of their own before reshaping the industry. They are still relatively small and niche players in the sprawling retail banking business. They are not deposit-taking institutions, where consumer savings are insured by the government.They also lack the legal and regulatory apparatus that traditional banks have built over many decades. Already, some of the new services are facing regulatory scrutiny. In November, Apple, Google, Amazon, PayPal and Intuit formed a Washington-based advocacy group, Financial Innovation Now, to promote policies to \u201cfoster greater innovation in financial services.\u201dStill, some banking habits are changing across the population. In 2010, 40 percent of Americans with bank accounts visited a physical branch once a week, while only 9 percent made a mobile transaction weekly, according to survey research by Javelin Strategy and Research. By 2014, the percentage reporting weekly visits to bank branches fell to 28 percent, while the weekly mobile banking share tripled, to 27 percent.Vanessa Montes de Oca, 20, lives in Covina, Calif., and she combines being a college student with part-time work at a nearby Sam\u2019s Club. She has an account at Chase Bank, but uses it only to receive her direct-deposit paychecks and to make debit payments. She has no credit cards, viewing them a path to overspending and financial peril.So Ms. Montes de Oca chose a new credit card alternative, Affirm, to make purchases at an online clothing retailer, UNIF. In the last year, she has made five purchases, ranging up to $460. She pays Affirm in installments over three to 12 months.She used the Affirm smartphone app without qualms. It seemed, she said, a \u201csolid service\u201d \u2014 smooth and fast, with the payment amounts and terms clearly stated. That screen in her hand, she added, is where she pays bills, communicates and seeks answers. \u201cMost of the business of my life is on my phone,\u201d said Ms. Montes de Oca, who is also a Venmo user.The migration to mobile computing may well work to the advantage of the digital-only entrants as people of all ages become more comfortable using a smartphone as the remote control for their finances.Wealth management services, for example, skew toward an older demographic. At SigFig, a San Francisco start-up that offers an online investment advisory service, the average user is 47 years old. Still, the share of SigFig users tapping in from mobile devices has increased steadily, to 50 percent.\u201cPeople have such a daily relationship with their smartphones now, almost no matter what their age,\u201d said Mike Sha, chief executive of SigFig.Venmo is riding a surge of popularity, mostly among millennials. The volume of payments through Venmo, a unit of PayPal, more than tripled in the most recently reported quarter, to $2.1 billion.Venmo, according to William Ready, senior vice president for products and engineering at PayPal, is beginning to cross generations, as younger adults persuade their parents to use the smartphone app for sending money and splitting payments.Yet the cross-generational embrace seems to be going slowly. Mr. Craine, the tech support worker, urged his parents, who are in their mid-50s, to use Venmo. But they are not yet converts.\u201cI tried,\u201d Mr. Craine recalled, \u201cbut they are reluctant to deal with money that way on a smartphone.\u201dMadeleine Fleming, 25, an online product manager who lives in Brooklyn, ran into the same obstacle when she tried to persuade her mother, who is in her late 50s. \u201cShe\u2019s a lot less tied to her phone than I am,\u201d Ms. Fleming said.Ms. Fleming frequently sends small, monetary gifts to friends and relatives with get-well or cheer-up messages. For example, she says, a cousin who is a teacher in New Orleans had a tough week recently. Ms. Fleming sent her $10 via Venmo, with a note of encouragement that urged her to buy herself a drink.\u201cIt\u2019s a small thinking-of-you gesture,\u201d Ms. Fleming said. \u201cI think it\u2019s the next level of thoughtfulness.\u201dAdvertisement"}

As some investors press Yahoo to fire her, Ms. Mayer is crafting a last-ditch plan to streamline the company \u2014 including significant layoffs \u2014 that is expected to be announced before month\u2019s end.While many Yahoo workers are keeping their heads down, just doing their jobs, others have lost faith in Ms. Mayer\u2019s leadership, according to conversations with more than 15 current and former employees from all levels of the company, most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because of continuing ties to Yahoo and its strict policy against leaks.More than a third of the company\u2019s work force has left in the last year, say people familiar with the data. Worried about the brain drain, Ms. Mayer has been approving hefty retention packages \u2014 in some cases, millions of dollars \u2014 to persuade people to reject job offers from other companies. But those bonuses have had the side effect of creating resentment among other Yahoo employees who have stayed loyal and not sought jobs elsewhere.Only 34 percent of employees believe that Yahoo\u2019s prospects are improving, according to surveys conducted by Glassdoor, a firm that collects data on jobs and employers. That compares with 61 percent who are optimistic at Twitter, another troubled tech company, and 77 percent who see a bright future at Google, Ms. Mayer\u2019s former employer.\u201cBasically, it shows employees losing faith in Marissa Mayer and Yahoo,\u201d said Scott Dobroski, a spokesman for Glassdoor who analyzed the data.Yahoo declined to comment on employee morale but said that turnover is normal at Silicon Valley companies. While thousands of people have left, many others have been hired, offsetting some of the losses. \u201cWe\u2019re still hiring, and our application numbers are strong,\u201d Yahoo said in a statement.One Yahoo employee who was interviewed said she was praying to be laid off so she could collect a severance payment and move on with her life. Others said they were actively looking for their next jobs \u2014 a task made more difficult because of the taint of failure that potential employers sometimes associate with anyone at the struggling company.\u201cBrands are important out here for employers,\u201d said Nick Parham, a career coach in San Francisco who has had several Yahoo clients. \u201cThey are going to look harder at people from Facebook and Salesforce, companies that have winning strategies.\u201dEmployees\u2019 faith in Ms. Mayer began crumbling in earnest in August 2014, when Yahoo embarked on a series of stealth layoffs, current and former insiders said. For months, managers called in a handful of employees each week and fired them. No one knew who would be next, and the constant fear paralyzed the company, according to people who watched the process.Last March, Ms. Mayer told the staff at an all-hands meeting that the bloodletting was finally over. Shortly thereafter, she changed her mind and demanded more cuts. All told, about 1,100 people lost their jobs in the layoffs.Contributing to the employees\u2019 disenchantment were Ms. Mayer\u2019s protracted deliberations over a corporate reorganization last year that led to the departure of several key lieutenants and broke up the much-ballyhooed mobile team, prompting many mobile engineers to seek other jobs.As Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Ms. Mayer acquired more than 20 companies, but ultimately struggled to turn around the web pioneer.For all of Yahoo\u2019s problems, many of its employees still have a deep affection for the company, whose products were the gateway to the Internet for a generation of web users and still remain popular, with more than 1 billion monthly visitors.\u201cWe all want to make as much impact as we can and leverage Yahoo\u2019s existing strengths,\u201d said Austin Shoemaker, who now manages Yahoo\u2019s instant-messaging efforts after his start-up, Cooliris, was acquired by Yahoo in 2014.The company has long struggled to overcome two big challenges: the industrywide drop in display advertising that has traditionally been its primary revenue source and the distraction inherent in trying to excel at many different things, from news and fantasy sports to web searches and email.Jeff Bonforte, Yahoo\u2019s senior vice president for communications products, said that Ms. Mayer had always told people that it would take three to five years for the company\u2019s turnaround efforts to show results.\u201cIt would be nice to give Yahoo one thing to magically save the company overnight,\u201d Mr. Bonforte said in an interview last month, adding that the idea was unrealistic. Ms. Mayer has invested in technology, he said, \u201cto give Yahoo a chance to be incredibly integral to this next phase of where the Internet is going.\u201dHe said that Ms. Mayer was the best boss he had ever had, but acknowledged some truth in the common criticism that she was tightfisted with praise and sometimes displayed a harshness that could be demoralizing.\u201cMarissa is the type of boss that makes you feel like you\u2019re disappointing her at all times, so I always feel like I\u2019m on the verge of being fired,\u201d said Mr. Bonforte, who is widely respected for both his talent and his irreverence. \u201cIt\u2019s never, \u2018Way to go, Jeff!\u2019\u00a0\u201dThe latest loss was Prashant Fuloria, whose company, Flurry, was sold to Yahoo in 2014. Ms. Mayer put him in charge of Yahoo\u2019s critical advertising technology last January, but he quit in December to work on start-up ideas. Ms. Mayer has put on a brave face despite all the turmoil.Just before the party, Ms. Mayer and the company\u2019s other directors decided to stop pursuing the original Alibaba spinoff plan and instead slim down and spin off Yahoo\u2019s core business.Now, everyone is waiting for details of that plan, which Ms. Mayer has promised to outline by the time the company reports its fourth-quarter financial results this month.Mr. Bonforte said those outside forces were beyond his control.\u201cThat\u2019s the problem with a turnaround,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world gets to decide, \u2018Time\u2019s up.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Top Digital-Privacy Watchdog Zeros In on U.S. Tech Giants", "Date": "2016-01-24", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 The latest standoff between Europe and American tech companies runs through a quiet street just north of the Louvre Museum, past chic cafes and part of the French national library, to the ornate office of Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin.One thing is clear, she says: The practices of American businesses, and tech companies in particular, are squarely in her sights.\u201cAmerican companies do not have an immediate right to collect data on our citizens,\u201d Ms. Falque-Pierrotin, 56, a blunt-speaking career civil servant, said recently in an interview, her voice increasingly animated. \u201cIf they are on our soil, then they need to live with the consequences.\u201dShortly after, the national regulators, led by Ms. Falque-Pierrotin, demanded that the European Commission and the Commerce Department reach a new deal by Feb. 1. Negotiators have been talking almost daily since October \u2014 including discussions in Brussels and Davos, Switzerland, in recent days. Still, they remain at loggerheads over how American intelligence agencies monitor Europeans\u2019 digital profiles, according to several officials, who would speak only on the condition of anonymity.Failure to find a compromise, company executives and officials warn, could disrupt billions of dollars of trade between two of the world\u2019s largest economies. Nearly all major multinational companies, including manufacturers like General Electric and drug makers like Pfizer, routinely move customer and employee data between regions.The biggest impact, though, will be felt by United States technology giants like Facebook and Google, which depend on reams of personal data from people\u2019s social media posts, search queries and online purchases to fuel digital advertising businesses. Those efforts often lead to tensions in Europe, where privacy is considered as sacrosanct as freedom of speech.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Deal or no deal, Ms. Falque-Pierrotin is in a position to play a major role. If negotiators agree to a new pact, she and Europe\u2019s other privacy watchdogs will help decide whether the new agreement meets the region\u2019s tough standards. If no deal is reached, she could impose further restrictions on how data is transferred across the Atlantic when European regulators gather on Feb. 2.After receiving degrees from some of France\u2019s top business and civil service schools, Ms. Falque-Pierrotin has spent three decades leapfrogging among government agencies and state-sponsored nonprofits. In the late 1990s, though, she began focusing more on privacy and the digital economy. She joined France\u2019s data-protection authority in 2004 and quickly rose within its ranks.In person, Ms. Falque-Pierrotin comes across as soft-spoken and formal. But her advocates and targets alike say she can be tenacious, though fair-minded. In recent years, she has gained a reputation for taking on some of the world\u2019s largest tech companies, including Google.Even with the confrontation with Google, French privacy experts say Ms. Falque-Pierrotin has regularly contacted local and international companies. She has often taken a less combative approach than other national watchdogs, they say, particularly those in Germany, where officials have often been quick to blame American companies for flouting local rules.Ahmed Baladi, a lawyer at Allen & Overy who represented Google in a previous French data-protection case, said Ms. Falque-Pierrotin aggressively led her agency, known as the Commission Nationale de l\u2019Informatique et des Libert\u00e9s, or CNIL. \u201cBut her strategy also has focused on communication, not just enforcement,\u201d he added.That nuanced approach may prove handy as last-minute discussions about a new trans-Atlantic data-transfer agreement flounder.National authorities may start legal proceedings \u2014 and potentially issue fines \u2014 against companies they think run afoul of Europe\u2019s tough data-protection rules if a new deal is not reached.Ms. Falque-Pierrotin, for instance, has already received complaints against several unnamed companies, though she is waiting until February before deciding whether to begin investigations into how certain companies move data from France to the United States.Vera Jourova, Europe\u2019s justice commissioner in charge of the European negotiating team, still thinks a new data-sharing agreement can be reached, but warns that \u201ca deal will only be made if there\u2019s an equitable approach in the United States\u201d to safeguard Europeans\u2019 privacy rights.Bruce Andrews, the deputy secretary of the Commerce Department, dismissed Europe\u2019s concerns, saying that the United States had already offered the European Commission a number of guarantees on how its citizens\u2019 data would be treated.\u201cWe\u2019ve agreed to make major changes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe U.S. takes individuals\u2019 privacy very seriously.\u201dIn December, Ms. Falque-Pierrotin sent letters to several American agencies, including the Commerce Department and the Federal Trade Commission, asking for meetings to discuss the current impasse. She received only a short response. Not responding fully to Ms. Falque-Pierrotin\u2019s entreaties may prove costly. Already, the French regulator and other European agencies have sent letters to international companies reminding them that the current mechanisms for transferring data are on shaky legal ground.A number of digital-rights advocates, including Mr. Schrems, are also preparing new privacy cases if a data-transfer deal is not reached by Feb. 1.That will most likely cause more problems for American tech giants, pushing Ms. Falque-Pierrotin and her European counterparts to consider new investigations \u2014 and, eventually, fines. But her position on protecting personal data continues to appear unwavering.\u201cDoes the U.S. provide sufficient privacy guarantees?\u201d she said. \u201cUntil now, the answer is no.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Taxing Google and Other U.S. Giants Is Dividing Europe", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Supported byBRUSSELS \u2014 For some European nations, big American corporations like Google are seen primarily as employers and technological innovators whose presence can help with their global competitiveness.But for others, the multinational giants are seen as having used complex accounting to sidestep corporate taxes. That, some argue, makes them prime targets at a time when governments are grasping for revenue to fill budget deficits and trying to address populist concerns about inequality.The divide, long present in Europe, is playing out with new intensity.European Union officials in Brussels are intent on imposing a blocwide standard for taxation and clawing back what they consider to be improper tax breaks granted by national governments to multinational companies.While some countries like France and Germany are happy to see back taxes collected from big corporations as a result of the effort, others are essentially saying they would rather the companies keep all or some of their tax breaks as long as they bring prosperity.The difference in approach may not rank with more existential problems for the European Union, like how to control the migrant influx without sacrificing open borders across much of the Continent. But it shows how tax policy cuts to the core of economic competitiveness for most countries in Europe, where sustained growth and balanced budgets have been hard to achieve lately.Ms. Vestager made her comments about Britain\u2019s deal with Google on the same day that the European commissioner for financial affairs and taxes, Pierre Moscovici, proposed measures meant to close a number of corporate tax loopholes across the European Union.The European Union wants no member state to use tax policy to achieve an unfair business advantage over its neighbors. But the ability of European countries to tailor tax practices to their own purposes is a matter of national sovereignty that many leaders are unwilling to cede to Brussels. That is true for the countries that are trying to compete for jobs and foreign investment brought by multinational titans like Google, Apple or Facebook as well as for those trying to wring more tax revenue from rich companies to help support a struggling economy.\u201cNational governments have competing objectives here,\u201d Neal Todd, an international tax expert and partner at the law firm Berwin Leighton Paisner, wrote in an email message to reporters on Thursday. \u201cWhilst nearly all governments want multinationals in general (and U.S. tech groups in particular) to pay more tax,\" he wrote, \"none of them want to change their own rules only to find that businesses simply relocate to warmer fiscal climes.\"Although the British prime minister, Mr. Cameron, defended his Google deal, his political opponents have criticized it as too generous to the company and not reflective of the full magnitude of its British revenue for the 10 years it covers.In studying the Cameron-Google agreement, Ms. Vestager may follow up on a request of the Scottish National Party, a British opposition party, which has sent a letter to the European Commission criticizing the tax deal with the search giant. A spokesman for Ms. Vestager\u2019s office said on Thursday that the complaint would need to be studied to see if it warranted a formal investigation.The issue could be particularly delicate, coming as Mr. Cameron has been trying to negotiate better terms for Britain within the European Union. As soon as June, Britain may hold a referendum in which voters would be asked whether they want to remain in the bloc or leave it.But Christian Cubitt, a Cameron spokesman, declined on Thursday to elevate the tax dispute to the level of the debate on Britain\u2019s place in the European Union. He said simply that it was \u201ca decision for the commission\" to decide whether to investigate, although he stressed that Google had agreed to pay all the tax that is due.Britain is by no means alone in seeking to handle corporate tax matters on its own terms.Italian financial police officials were to issue an investigative report to Google on Thursday, indicating whether the company has paid sufficient taxes in Italy since 2008. Although Google has not been accused of wrongdoing, tax officials say the delinquent amount could be about 300 million euros, or about $325.3 million.Google is also in discussions with France over back taxes. Last week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the company\u2019s executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, met with the French economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, to discuss the matter.There has been no public discussion of how much in back taxes is being sought by France\u2019s Socialist government, but local news reports have placed the figure as high as \u20ac500 million.Google\u2019s official response to reports of those negotiations has been the same, which it repeated yesterday: \u201cGoogle complies with the tax laws in every country where we operate. We continue to work with the relevant authorities.\u201dThe biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Ms. Vestager is also investigating tax arrangements between Ireland and Apple, and Luxembourg and Amazon over whether the companies received preferential tax deals that broke the European Union\u2019s state-aid rules. A decision in the Apple case is expected in March, at the earliest; the Amazon case could also be decided in the coming months. The companies and governments say they have done nothing wrong.In previous cases where Ms. Vestager has ruled that corporate tax arrangements violated European Union law by favoring certain companies, governments have been ordered to recoup back taxes that they would rather not collect lest they signal to other multinationals that their countries are not business-friendly.While Ms. Vestager is investigating cases where countries might have let companies pay too little tax, the proposals by Mr. Moscovici on Thursday are meant to prevent tax avoidance before it happens by closing gaps in cross-border rules to channel profit to subsidiaries in lower-tax countries.In a news conference, Mr. Moscovici said losses from the loopholes amounted to nearly \u20ac70 billion a year, discriminated against small business and angered ordinary citizens.His proposals mean to deter European governments from, for example, letting companies shift profit to low-tax jurisdictions. Mr. Moscovici said his proposals also showed Europe\u2019s eagerness to put into effect international standards endorsed by the leaders of Group of 20 major economies last year.Mr. Moscovici\u2019s measures would also require corporations to fully disclose all of their taxes, profit, revenue and other financial data to the administrations of all countries where they operate.The proposals, though, might be hard to turn into law. They would require the unanimous approval of European Union governments, and some could balk. And the measures would not affect the low across-the-board corporate tax rates that countries like Ireland use as an inducement to attract foreign companies.Oxfam, an antipoverty group, criticized Mr. Moscovici as taking an ineffective \u201clowest common denominator approach\u201d to the tax overhaul.British lawmakers aligned with Mr. Cameron\u2019s government were wary of Mr. Moscovici\u2019s proposals.\u201cGlobally, there is a battle raging for jobs and growth,\u201d said Ashley Fox, the leader of the delegation of British Conservatives at the European Parliament. \u201cThe E.U. must ensure that its proposals do not act as a deterrent to international investment and employment.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Friday about divisions in Europe over the taxing of multinational corporations misidentified the recipients of written comments about European tax policies from Neal Todd, an international tax expert. They were sent to the news media, not to Mr. Todd\u2019s clients.James Kanter reported from Brussels, and Mark Scott from Rome. Stephen Castle contributed reporting from London, Elisabetta Povoledo from Rome, and Aurelien Breeden from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why This Is the Iowa Poll That Everyone Was Waiting For", "Date": "2016-01-30", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RacePerhaps no political poll is more eagerly anticipated and receives more attention than the last Des Moines Register poll before the Iowa caucuses.The hype ahead of the survey is easy to understand. Conducted by Ann Selzer, it has one of the most impressive track records in polling \u2014 nailing the results even when many other polls predict a different outcome.The Selzer poll became famous in 2008 when it showed Barack Obama winning with a stupendous turnout from voters who hadn\u2019t previously participated in the caucus. In the 2014 midterm election, the survey found Joni Ernst winning her Senate race by a comfortable seven-point margin \u2014 no other poll showed Ms. Ernst ahead by even four points. She won by eight points.That kind of track record has brought extraordinary expectations for a single poll \u2014 and it\u2019s only a matter of time before the poll fails to live up to them.\u201cWe need to pierce this mystique of infallibility; it does me no favor,\u201d Ms. Selzer said in an interview, referring to the expectation that her poll would nail the results time and time again. \u201cThe law of averages would say that at some point this is not going to happen.\u201d She\u2019s right.If the success of Ms. Selzer\u2019s poll is perhaps understood a bit too well, then what makes her poll different probably isn\u2019t appreciated enough. The Selzer poll differs from most other public surveys sponsored by mainstream media organizations in two respects. First, she conducts the poll by calling voters from the state\u2019s voter registration file, a common practice in campaign polling but rare among news media pollsters. She also uses an extremely simple way to determine who is likely to vote.Ms. Selzer says she places more stock in the way she screens for likely voters. But how her methods differ highlight some of the biggest debates among campaign pollsters, and offer clues for why some polls are so wrong \u2014 or so right.Most polls conducted by mainstream media organizations call random telephone numbers, which yields a sample of American adults \u2014 whether they\u2019re registered to vote or not. Pollsters need to screen out people who say they\u2019re not registered to vote, and they take a caller\u2019s word on that.The Selzer poll \u2014 and campaign pollsters \u2014 take a different approach. They call telephone numbers from voter registration files, a data set of all of the registered voters in a state. Many voters provide their telephone numbers on their voter registration forms when they register, but it\u2019s not hard to fill in the missing ones from other sources.As we said, Ms. Selzer doesn\u2019t attribute most of her success to the use of the voter file.But it is worth mentioning her use of this data because the polls are sharply divided on exactly this matter, especially on the Democratic side. So far this year, Mr. Sanders leads in every poll conducted by random dialing, except those from NBC News/Marist, where Mrs. Clinton holds a narrow lead. Yet Mr. Sanders has never led a survey that used the voter file \u2014 including The Des Moines Register poll tonight, and all those before it.Relying on the voter file has risks in the Iowa caucuses because people can register on caucus night. (In 2008, about 4 percent of the Democratic caucus electorate did so).But it has potential advantages. The simple step of screening out self-identified unregistered voters can introduce errors and bias, if the people who identify as being registered and with a certain party are unrepresentative. A poll using the voter file is all but assured to include the right proportion of registered partisans and independents, men and women, young and old. It would include the right proportion of people who voted in 2012, past primary voters or whatever other information is on the file \u2014 and there is a considerable amount.If a random-digit-dialing poll\u2019s sample of adult men is unusually Democratic, for instance, then the group of Democrats would end up too male \u2014 since the poll will simply filter the electorate to those people who call themselves Democrats. A CNN poll this month showed men as a majority of likely Democrats, which seems unlikely; 57 percent of registered Democrats in Iowa are women, according to data from L2, a nonpartisan voter file vendor.To take another example: What if the people who respond to telephone surveys are particularly politically engaged? Might the young voters who respond be more likely to be registered than young people in general \u2014 resulting in a sample of registered voters who are younger than in reality? It\u2019s possible.Voters could even misreport whether they\u2019re actually registered to vote.Even if a poll perfectly captures the opinion of registered voters, it might still miss the results if it makes an inaccurate forecast about who will vote and who will not.Many mainstream media pollsters determine who is likely to vote with a slew of questions, like whether the respondents have voted before, whether they know where their precinct is or whether they\u2019re enthusiastic. Some of these questions are of uncertain value. The Obama campaign pollsters, for instance, criticized the notion that people need to know where their precinct is to be considered likely voters. You can easily search for it on Google at the last minute.Most pollsters then narrow the sample in proportion to the expected turnout: If the pollster believes 50 percent of adults will vote, then they might include the 50 percent of voters \u2014 the so-called cutoff \u2014 deemed likeliest to vote based on those questions. Often they choose a slightly higher cutoff than the expected turnout, on the assumption that poll respondents are likelier than nonrespondents to vote \u2014 but exactly how much likelier is somewhat unscientific.The Selzer likely-voter screen is different and simple. The poll asks voters one question: whether they will vote. If they say they will \u201cdefinitely\u201d or \u201cprobably\u201d vote, they\u2019re a likely voter in the caucus. That\u2019s it. Ms. Selzer makes no assumptions about the size of the electorate.The advantage is that Ms. Selzer doesn\u2019t need to make any judgments about turnout, which is notoriously hard to predict \u2014 especially in a caucus. While the range of plausible turnout in a general election is fairly narrow (say 54 percent of adults in 2000 to 62 percent in 2008), it is wide in the Iowa caucuses. In 2008, the Democratic turnout nearly doubled over 2004.Even if a pollster does have a pretty decent guess about turnout, the often unacknowledged truth is that cutoffs are often dubiously arbitrary and extremely sensitive. Moving the cutoff by a few percentage points can swing the results by a lot more than you might expect \u2014 enough to flip the results of a survey.Worse still, it\u2019s a great opportunity for pollsters to tweak their results to get what they consider to be a more reasonable finding.But Ms. Selzer\u2019s question isn\u2019t perfect either. A growing body of evidence shows that self-reported vote intention is not especially accurate. Voters are prone to overestimate their likelihood of voting, and there are even people who say they won\u2019t vote but ultimately do.The people who ultimately turned out were also far likelier to be Republicans, who led by three points among the voters who were verified to vote in a postelection analysis. Democrats led by two points among people who said they would definitely vote, according to the Pew data, and four points among those who said they would \u201cdefinitely\u201d or \u201cprobably\u201d vote. (It should be noted that Ms. Selzer, in the midterms, used only those who said they would \u201cdefinitely\u201d vote).This might well be better than the more complex and arbitrary turnout methods built by other media pollsters. But it is not magic or a \u201csecret sauce.\u201d It\u2019s a well-studied, well-known measure. And it\u2019s not perfect.Ms. Selzer is sticking with simplicity, however. \u201cOur method has worked so far, so it\u2019s very difficult to convince anyone that we should change our method,\u201d she said. So far, she says, those who say they will vote but don\u2019t and those who say they won\u2019t vote but do cancel each other out.Of course, even if Ms. Selzer\u2019s methodology was perfect, there\u2019s no reason to expect her results will be. It\u2019s the nature of the game; even a perfectly conducted poll will occasionally yield imperfect results, and sometimes terrible ones.This year, the causes for concern are as great as ever. Mr. Trump skipped the final debate right in the middle of the survey. Late-breaking advertisements have gone on the air. The sheer number of candidates might bring even more late volatility than usual, since voters supporting less viable candidates might choose to make their vote count.\u201cAll I can say is that we\u2019re going to take our best shot and worry \u2014 worry a lot.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Schwarzman Scholars Announces Inaugural Class to Study in China", "Date": "2016-01-10", "News": "Supported bySome of the recipients, selected from a pool of 3,000 applicants, already seem well on their way.Lt. Daniel Glenn, 28, is a graduate of the United States Naval Academy. He did his scholarship interview via Skype from a secret location in Iraq, where he is the officer in charge of a Navy special operations platoon that defuses bombs and underwater explosives. Lieutenant Glenn has also founded two philanthropic organizations, and he broke a Guinness World Record for running a mile in an 80-pound bomb suit (8 minutes and 30 seconds). He told his interviewers that he intended to eventually run for the Senate.At his Manhattan office on Thursday, Mr. Schwarzman said that he had modeled his fully funded master\u2019s program on the Rhodes scholarship, but that his was \u201cglobal with a bit of a U.S. twist.\u201dHis goal is to establish a $450 million endowment that would fund up to 200 students every year: 45 percent from the United States, 20 percent from China and 35 percent from other countries. Mr. Schwarzman, who according to Forbes is worth $9.6 billion, has personally contributed $100 million and has raised another $275 million from foundations and corporations including BP, Dow Chemical and Credit Suisse.As Mr. Schwarzman spoke, the Chinese stock market was closed after a free fall, and he waved away an assistant bearing phone messages, telling her, \u201cThat can wait.\u201dInterviews with 300 semifinalists for the scholarship were conducted in Beijing, Bangkok, London and New York, and Mr. Schwarzman said he had been involved in the interview process in London and New York. David Petraeus, the former director of the C.I.A., and Jared Cohen, the director of Google Ideas, were among the judges.Mr. Schwarzman described his role as a sort of warm-up act, greeting applicants in groups and assuring them that the interview would not be a test, but \u201cmore like an interview with Charlie Rose.\u201d The applicants were, however, asked to play with Legos \u2014 as part of a team competition to construct a model building better and faster than other applicants.Other, similar master\u2019s scholarship programs have a presence in China, notably Rhodes, which recently awarded its first round of scholarships to Oxford to students from China. Mr. Schwarzman, who has been building relationships with the Chinese ruling elite since China\u2019s government bought a $3 billion stake in Blackstone in 2007, said he created Schwarzman College to offer better networking opportunities. He said that Jack Ma, founder and chairman of Alibaba Group, had agreed to give internships to some Schwarzman scholars, and that Niall Ferguson, the historian, and Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary, would serve as visiting professors.Perhaps more significantly, Mr. Schwarzman said, his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s would have access to some of the most influential people in the Chinese power structure. Noting that President Xi Jinping is a Tsinghua alumnus, Mr. Schwarzman described the university as a place where \u201cyou meet a lot of very well-connected, important people.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Insurers Brace for the Self-Driving Future and Fewer Accidents", "Date": "2016-01-07", "News": "Supported byWheelsAS autonomous driving technology advances, perhaps the most notable benefit is the promise of a striking reduction in accidents.At risk is the lifeblood of the industry \u2014 $200 billion in premiums that the insurers collect every year from policyholders, KPMG says.According to KPMG\u2019s report, the insurance industry could contract by as much as 60 percent by 2040 as accident damage payouts and premiums fall.Even Warren E. Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate owns Geico, has said that widespread adoption of autonomous technology poses \u201ca real threat\u201d to the industry.\u201cThis technology will be disruptive to the insurance industry,\u201d Mr. Albright said. \u201cThere will be winners, and there will be losers. There will be fewer companies than there are today. But the question is, Who will survive?\u201dIt could even result in fewer cars for companies to insure. A recent report from Barclays Capital said that autonomous technology would lead to a 40 percent decline in sales and a 60 percent drop in the number of cars on the road.Already, the changes are happening. Devices like automatic braking, adaptive cruise control (it adjusts the car\u2019s speed to match that of the traffic ahead) and sensors that automatically keep the car from drifting outside a lane are available. And this does not include the fully autonomous cars that companies like Google and automakers have been testing for years.Insurance companies have, accordingly, been examining potential changes to the current business model.KPMG\u2019s report envisions a future in which insurers will depend more on commercial accounts for revenue as companies offering ride-sharing and mobility on demand become more prevalent. Individual policyholders will decline as households get by with one car, or no car at all.And as the cost of covering losses declines, so will the premiums insurers collect. \u201cCurrently, the personal auto sector accounts for almost $125 billion in loss costs,\u201d the report said. \u201cBy 2040, we believe this sector could cover less than $50 billion in loss costs.\u201dState Farm has been working with Ford, the University of Michigan Mobility Transformation Center and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, among others, to figure out how best to adapt to what\u2019s coming.\u201cAutomated technology has been a major industry issue,\u201d Chris Mullen, director of State Farm\u2019s technology research program, said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s been what everyone is talking about, so as you can imagine, we have put quite a bit of focus on understanding it.\u201dPart of that understanding, she said, had been accepting that the changes had already begun \u2014 and are happening faster than many experts had predicted several years ago.\u201cA lot of what is disturbing the industry is the pace at which this technology is expected to come,\u201d she said. \u201cState Farm has responded to changes in our industry throughout our existence. Changes are coming again, and we\u2019re investing the resources to understand how these changes will affect the industry.\u201dMs. Mullen said that the changes to which insurance companies had to respond in the past included the advent of seatbelts, collapsible steering columns and airbags. Those devices changed automotive safety, but not until car insurance had been around for a few decades.\u201cThis is not just about technology,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are issues of behavior that need to be understood \u2014 how will people react to these new systems? Cybersecurity is another issue that\u2019s been at the forefront of this.\u201dMr. Albright said that devising a strategy to face the new world of auto insurance would be as expensive for insurers as it was tricky.\u201cIt will take time and cost billions of dollars,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s enormous skepticism in the insurance industry about the pace that changes will come, but they\u2019re going to come sooner than people think.\u201dPart of the problem, Joe Schneider of KPMG pointed out, was that insurance companies rely on past behavior to predict the future. What happens when there is little experience to base decisions on?\u201cThe insurance industry is historically data-driven,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s been an actual person behind the wheel of every car for 100 years, and all of a sudden saying the rules are going to be different going forward, that\u2019s a very difficult situation to wrap your head around.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Carmakers Set to Grab Spotlight at International CES", "Date": "2016-01-04", "News": "Supported byDETROIT \u2014 When Mark Fields attended his first consumer electronics trade show in 2007 as head of Ford Motor\u2019s Americas division, the auto industry was hardly noticed among the thousands of tech companies gathered in Las Vegas.\u201cWe couldn\u2019t even get space in the convention center to do interviews, and had to do them back at the hotel,\u201d Mr. Fields, now Ford\u2019s chief executive, said on Monday.It is one way the auto industry has become increasingly entwined with Silicon Valley in recent years.Ford, for example, is expected to unveil plans on Tuesday to expand its testing of autonomous vehicles and bolster its SYNC in-car communications and entertainment systems.Despite some news reports, Mr. Fields said Ford would not be announcing a major tie-up with Google \u2014 or any other tech company \u2014 to build driverless cars together.\u201cIn some cases we will do things on our own and other cases we will partner with others,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are going to keep those conversations private for competitive reasons.\u201dWhile tech companies like Google are moving aggressively to develop autonomous vehicles, traditional automakers are moving just as fast to add technology that allows cars to brake and steer themselves independently.Ford will triple the size of its autonomous vehicle fleet to 30 cars from 10, and step up testing at its proving grounds as well as on public roads in California.The goal, Mr. Fields said, is to develop fully autonomous cars by the end of the decade. But the increase in research indicates the company needs more time before it can commit to producing driverless cars for sale.\u201cWhen we do come out with it, it needs to work and the technology needs to be accessible to everyone and not just luxury-car drivers,\u201d he said.Other automakers will use International CES as a showcase for new electric vehicles that usually would be introduced at major auto shows.General Motors is expected to show the production version of its new all-electric model, the Chevrolet Bolt, at a news conference on Wednesday featuring the company\u2019s and chief executive, Mary T. Barra.Volkswagen, the German automaker under scrutiny for cheating on diesel emissions tests, is also expected to introduce a prototype of a new electric vehicle.In all, nine automakers will hold news events at CES, and they will be joined by dozens of auto suppliers involved in autonomous vehicle programs.A new study by the McKinsey consulting firm predicts that up to 15 percent of new vehicles could be fully autonomous by 2030. In addition, the study expects unique software \u2014 rather than engines and styling \u2014 to become the prime factor that differentiates vehicles in the future.Some automakers are already sharing the costs and content of software to stay ahead of Silicon Valley giants like Google and Apple that are developing their own vehicles.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.On Monday, Toyota and Ford said they would adopt the same software to link smartphone apps to dashboard screens in their vehicles. The software, which was developed by Ford, will integrate apps from phones into cars, as well as navigation and mapping information.Suppliers like Delphi Automotive and Continental will demonstrate new features that automate cars to improve safety and avoid collisions.Delphi will show off an automated version of the Audi SQ5 in Las Vegas that interacts with other cars and traffic lights, and will introduce technology that allows drivers to change radio stations or adjust temperature controls with hand gestures.Other auto companies, ranging from start-ups like Faraday Future to luxury car brands like Mercedes-Benz, are also expected to introduce electric and autonomous models at the show.The critical factor in adopting the new technology will be how easy it is for drivers to operate, whether it is an app on a touch screen or an automated steering system that can avoid accidents.Regulators are also preparing their own set of rules for autonomous cars at the state and federal levels.\u201cWe are light years away from where the industry was at this show just a few years ago,\u201d Mr. Fields said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really big deal now, and it\u2019s going to stay that way.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Farhad and Mike\u2019s Week in Tech: Cars With, and Without, Drivers", "Date": "2016-01-09", "News": "Supported bySo let\u2019s get into the meat of this week\u2019s happenings. It\u2019s all about cars, a topic that brings me a sense of wistfulness ever since I moved to New York and gave up my ugly, busted old beater.Please tell me what is going on. If the state ever allows me to be a father, will my children grow up learning how to drive? Or are smart cars going to be the new norm?All of that said, Uber\u2019s role here is interesting. The company has opted to research all of its tech in-house rather than, say, pairing up with an automaker as Lyft did. Perhaps that\u2019s to keep the research proprietary instead of sharing it with companies like G.M., which could become far more adversarial with Uber down the line. (For now, Uber has struck uneasy partnerships with automakers, helping drivers finance car purchases with certain discounts.)The advent of this type of technology could also affect the cost and implementation of auto insurance \u2014 something that ride-sharing companies like Uber could certainly benefit from.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Transcript of the Preliminary G.O.P. Presidential Debate", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Supported byBusiness woman, former CEO of Hewlett Packard, Carly Fiorina.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)(APPLAUSE (CHEERING)(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)(BELL RINGING)(LAUGHTER)I talked about that eight years ago, and I\u2019m talking about it now. I talked about the importance of preserving life, of not just saying we\u2019re going to defund Planned Parenthood, but let\u2019s do something bolder. Let\u2019s get rid of abortion once and for all by applying the Fifth, and Fourteenth amendment to every person from conception because that means that we recognize that no person can be deprived of life or liberty unless they have due process. And, that\u2019s not happening in our country.And, I believe, and continue to practice that we need the Fair Tax to revive our economy. To make it so that people are able to be rewarded for their work rather than punished for it.(APPLAUSE)Senator Santorum, four short years ago you won Iowa. You beat Mitt Romney, pretty much shocked the country. But, just the other day you talked about what is in the greater good for your campaign. Is Monday night your last stand?SANTORUM: You know, listening to what your network was talking about prior to this race, this debate, reminded me of the coverage that many on this floor are getting. This race, this debate, was called the, \u201cUndercard Debate\u201d. The undercard debate.It wasn\u2019t advertised significantly. In fact, the entire hour lead up to this there was no conversation about any of the four people on this debate stage, and that is the chronic situation.In fact, they listed \u2014 they put a poll up from Wall Street Journal/NBC News, they listed the candidates, and they failed to mention I wasn\u2019t listed. I got zero, why? Because they \u2014 NBC, Wall Street Journal poll never includes my name on the list.This is what the media has been doing over the past year, and trying to segregate, and take Iowans out of the process. What Iowans deserve...(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)(APPLAUSE)(BELL RINGS)SANTORUM: You know, this, again, more of the politics of trying to get people to throw stuff at each other. I\u2019m not going to throw mud at anybody on this stage tonight. I\u2019m not going to throw mud at anybody on the stage later.(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: I\u2019m not going to attack Donald Trump. What I\u2019m \u2014 Mike Huckabee and I were asked to come to an event where money was going to be raise to do help our veterans. You know, I thought about it.(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: And I thought about. I said well, wait a minute, now, if there were no political considerations and I had some time because I\u2019m not doing anything at 9:00 tonight.(LAUGHTER)And so if I had some time, would I go...(BELL RINGS)SANTORUM: ... if I could help raise money for veterans? And the answer was yes, I would. And so I\u2019m going.(APPLAUSE)GILMORE: Well, Bill, can I first...HEMMER: Thank you, senator. One moment. We\u2019ll get to you in a moment, Governor. We have a few coming up.MACCALLUM: So it will come as no surprise that there is an idea out there that there is a civil war brewing within the GOP over the meaning of conservative and the question of who is electable.There are some in the GOP who are so outraged by Trump and Cruz that they say they would actually rather have Hillary Clinton in the White House.(BOOING)The people in Iowa showed up and they are still showing up. Hundreds and hundreds of them at every event. I have done over 150 events in the state of Iowa and I have 15 more coming up.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)What they ask me about is Carly, tell us why zero based budgeting is so important. Tell us why you are a leader who is going to produce results. Tell us how you are going to defeat ISIS. Tell us how we are going to replace Obamacare.In other words, I\u2019m going to put my faith every single time not in the pundits, not in the polls. Most definitely not in the national media. I\u2019m going to put my faith in the common sense and the good judgment of the voters of Iowa.And the last time I looked, you hadn\u2019t started voting yet. So, on Monday night, I hope you will stand with me, fight with me, caucus for me. Because...(BELL RINGS)(APPLAUSE)But never mind that, I want to return to something. I\u2019m the only veteran, Bill and Martha in this race. And I\u2019m not going to any Donald Trump event over across town on some sort of faux veteran sort of issue.I\u2019m going to speak to you tonight about the issue that really confronts veterans. I\u2019m going to talk to you about the concerns that they have got with the veterans administration.The lousy appeals process that they have got. The fact that sometimes they get good service at the V.A. and sometimes they don\u2019t and the fact that post traumatic stress syndrome is not properly recognized. That psychology positions are unavailable in the Veterans Administration.(APPLAUSE)One candidate in this race has criticized so-called \u201cNew York values\u201d. So tell me, in your opinion, are New York values different than Iowa values?(LAUGHTER)This much I will tell you. I wish that some of those New Yorkers had funded as much of my campaign as they did the corporately funded candidates, but they didn\u2019t.And to be honest with you, when I say I\u2019m \u2014 wish they had, I\u2019m glad they didn\u2019t. I\u2019m not a New York-funded campaign. I\u2019m not bankrolled by the corporatists, I\u2019m not bankrolled by Goldman Sachs and Citibank and AIG and all the big brokers \u2014 brokerage houses and the billionaires.I\u2019m sponsored by people like Thomas, a part-time Uber driver in Pennsylvania who sent me $25 this week. He\u2019s between jobs. He\u2019s driving an Uber car. But he believed in what I\u2019m talking about enough that, even on a limited, part-time income, he sent me $25 to help in my campaign.I\u2019ll stand with the Thomases of the world any day. I\u2019ll leave all the discussion of the big financiers to other candidates. But there\u2019s only a few of us in the entire Republican process who are not corporately funded by the same group.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.And let me just finish by saying, you want to know why things never change depending on whether Democrats or Republicans are in power, and why Republicans in Iowa and the rest of the country are so frustrated?The reason is, is because if you follow the money, the same folks who finance the Democrats finance the Republicans, and no matter what the speeches and the ads, they get the same results.If you want a different result, I\u2019m available.(APPLAUSE)Senator Santorum, according to Google, the Paris terror attacks were the largest story that was searched in 2015, with nearly 1 billion searches of that story worldwide.There have been at 18 terror attacks so far this year \u2014 in just January alone, in 2016, and it will likely, as we all know, get worse. But what can an American president do to stop these terrifying killings?We have to have an honest discussion with the American people about the nature of the threat that we confront. This president says that ISIS has nothing to do with Islam, and as a result has put together a strategy that doesn\u2019t take care of what the reality is, which is ISIS has established a caliphate.A caliphate is like a kingdom ruled by \u2014 a caliphate is ruled by a caliph, a kingdom is ruled by a king. Only the difference is a caliphate is also a religious title, and it is both a religious call to help this state, as well a \u2014 to \u2014 to make the state stronger.The reality is that ISIS has established a caliphate, and is using that to attract people around the globe to follow them as the leaders of the Sunni world.And you say, \u201cwell, how do we stop them from following them?\u201d Well, to be a legitimate caliphate, you have to control land and operate a state under sharia law.If you don\u2019t do that, you cannot call for that support. And so the answer is we must take their land and make them...(BELL RINGS)... illegitimate in the eyes of the Muslim world. So I would put troops on the ground and take the land back from Iraq and return to its rightful ownership in Iraq. That would delegitimize them.(APPLAUSE)Actually \u2014 actually, it is ISIS, followed closely by Iran. And those two things are linked, so that when our president cozies up to Iran, all of our allies in the Middle East, who are ready to help us defeat ISIS, wonder whose side we\u2019re on. And the truth is, under this president, we are on Iran\u2019s side, not our allies\u2019, who would help us defeat ISIS.You know, one of the things we have to start with is understanding that we must stand up to adversaries. So Hillary Clinton famously asked, what difference does it make how four Americans died in Benghazi? This is the difference it makes, Mrs. Clinton.That, Mrs. Clinton, is what difference it makes.(APPLAUSE)But we have seen Putin\u2019s quote-unquote \u201chelp\u201d in Crimea and in Ukraine. And this week the U.K. implicated him in the poisoning death of one of his rivals. So are you foolish to think that we can ever work with Vladimir Putin?But let\u2019s be very clear about how we take out ISIS. And I think Rick Santorum is exactly right. You take away their land.But one of the things we have to do is a comprehensive strategy to get ISIS. First of all, take away their access to social media platforms. They are using the same social media platforms to recruit, and to train, and to direct people as I use to see pictures of my grandkids. That\u2019s ridiculous.The second thing, go after them financially. Wage war with them. Make it so nobody can do commerce with ISIS. Not a nickel of transfer. Any company, any country, that even gets close to dealing with them, absolutely put sanctions on them. Make them pay.And finally, you have got to go after them militarily. And that means we send the land, the sea, the air forces, the A-10 Warthogs dropping ordnances on every truck and every tank, and we obliterate them. But we have to understand that they are a force that\u2019s getting bigger. And with any kind of cancer, you don\u2019t contain it, you eradicate it. And that\u2019s how we have to fight ISIS, comprehensively. That\u2019s what I would suggest we do.(APPLAUSE)And I\u2019m the candidate who is best qualified to deal with this issue. A degree in foreign policy in Russian area studies. I\u2019m the only United States Army veteran having gone to Europe during the Cold War as United States Army Intelligence agent, the governor during the 9/11 attack, the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security for the United States for five years.And this is what I will do. If I become the president, I\u2019m going to rebuild the United States military. We\u2019re going to take the sequester off the defense budget. Give the Navy the ships it needs. Refit the United States Army. Refit the United States Marine Corps.And on this international guerrilla war, we need to recognize our Special Forces, our intelligence community, and the people that we need in order to really protect us.And finally, this war of ideas, we must win this. We must say to the world that radical Islamism is the threat. It isn\u2019t just confined to ISIS. It is worldwide. And if we win the war of ideas, then we will win the international guerrilla war.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)Is this Presidency, and presidency, simply too small a David to slay the Goliath of government?The other day I was in Newton, Iowa. It used to be a vibrant place where Maytag washers and dryers were built. Went out of business in 2007, all those shops went to Mexico. All those people lost their jobs. There was a guy in my forum that day, he lost his job. He still has never found an employment that got anywhere near the job that he had.Let me ask you, how many people do you think living around the Beltway know a guy like that? Care about a guy like that? Not many. And, that\u2019s because they\u2019re six of the ten richest counties in America that surround Washington D.C. People who live in the bubbles of the high finance world of New York, the government world of Washington, the entertainment world of Hollywood, don\u2019t have a clue about how hard people out here in Iowa are working every single day.And, I believe one of the values of campaigning in Iowa, you can\u2019t win unless you go out and talk to farmers and housewives \u2014 and welders, and unemployed truck drivers, and I hate...(BELL RINGING)(APPLAUSE)And the only way to control the money is to ask the federal government to budget the way you do, to examine every dollar, to cut any dollar to spend \u2014 to move any dollar.The fancy word for that is zero-base budgeting. I call it common sense. That three-page tax code I talk about all the time here in Iowa? It\u2019s been around for 20 years. But politicians don\u2019t want to talk about it, and you bet the lobbyists don\u2019t want to talk about it.In fact, nobody wants to vote on a three-page tax code or zero- base budgeting, although they\u2019ve both been around for a long time. You know why? Because if you get those two things done, you are goring everybody\u2019s ox.You are taking the political establishment apart. You are actually challenging the status quo, which is what we need in the Oval Office. So you know who I\u2019m going to count on? The citizens of this great nation, because you have extraordinary power.But when you do not use it...(BELL RINGS)... you are losing it. So take out your smartphones, folks. The people of Iowa know what I\u2019m talking about. You take out your smartphones. if you agree with me that three-page tax code needs to be passed, lobbyists aren\u2019t going to be in my office.If you agree we gotta finally pass zero-base budgeting, take out your smartphones. Press one for yes, ladies and gentlemen. Press two for no. Citizens, we must take our country back.(APPLAUSE)Your critics would argue that\u2019s exactly what you did at Hewlett Packard when 30,000 people lost their jobs. If it did not work at H.P., why would it work at the federal government?Secondly, at Hewlett Packard, as you know \u2014 the people of Iowa know this \u2014 we went through a tough time. The worst technology recession in 25 years \u2014 a great company called Gateway used to do be right here in Iowa. But they didn\u2019t make the tough calls necessary to save all those jobs, and so they lost every one of those jobs.Yes, I\u2019ve had to make some tough calls. We saved 80,000 jobs. We went on to grow to 160,000 jobs. And, frankly, I think the American people know we need a president who\u2019s going to make some tough calls.So let me tell you where I\u2019m going to start. The American people got a bill passed through Congress that said we could fire the top 400 senior executives at the V.A. for dereliction of duty.When we know that 307,000 veterans have died waiting for health care and the V.A. handed out $142 million worth of bonuses for superb performance, I\u2019m going to start by firing 400...(BELL RINGS)... senior executives at the V.A.(APPLAUSE)She leans on her parents for help. She says she can\u2019t buy presents for her children. We are all sympathetic to this woman\u2019s plight. On the other hand, the G.O.P. is supposed to be the party of smaller government. So what would you look her in the eye and say?History suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.This is an opportunity for America. It\u2019s an opportunity for us to get those jobs back. And by the way, do you want to solve global climate change? Take 2 million jobs from China in manufacturing and moving them back here to the United States, where we produce one-fifth the CO2 when we make things.(APPLAUSE)We can help \u2014 we can do every \u2014 we can do it all. We can take care of the environment. We can create more jobs here. Seventy-four percent of Americans don\u2019t have a college degree.And unfortunately most folks who, in the Republican Party, don\u2019t talk about what we\u2019re going to do to create jobs for people who feel like neither political party cares about them.(BELL RINGS)When you elect me, we\u2019ll create opportunities for working men and women in this country \u2014 all over this country.(LAUGHTER)But that person you asked Rick about a moment ago, that lady that\u2019s making 10,000 bucks a year, do you know what our poverty programs do to people? They keep them in poverty.They keep them in poverty because we have these arbitrary thresholds...(APPLAUSE)My mother grew up in a house, oldest of seven kids. She had lived in a house that didn\u2019t have floors. Just dirt. No electricity. No running water. I resent it when people say, oh, people are poor because they want to be. No, they are not.Nobody wants to be poor. And that\u2019s a stupid, foolish thing, mean thing to say. People are poor because they don\u2019t know how to get out of the hole. And government shouldn\u2019t push them back in the hole which is what our policies do when they punish people who want to go to work and don\u2019t let them out. (APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)You and others say that you would rip up that deal. But, really, by the time the next president is in office, won\u2019t that horse be well out of the barn?And that\u2019s very dangerous because it means people in the Middle East have to begin to react to that right now. The United States, I think, has to continue to exercise its influence in the Middle East, stay active, and not do this pull-back type of program that we are seeing all over the place with President Obama, which is creating this kind of danger.The world is a more dangerous place now than when I was an intelligence agent. We have not only this international guerrilla war but also these challenges from these other countries as well.But, Martha, I want to say one more thing to you and Bill. I disagree with Carly Fiorina when she says that it\u2019s just a political class in Washington. The truth is that the country has changed. And there are powerful forces at this point that are really controlling our lives. And that\u2019s why people are so angry.One of those is government, which is regulating everything through the Environmental Protection Agency, through other places. But the biggest one is the organized establishment media.And I just noticed just now you gave Carly Fiorina two one-minute answers in a row. This media across the country is manipulating and shaping and framing this campaign and has been for at least a year now in order to get the kind of choices that people are going to have an opportunity to see.This is wrong. It has to change. And when I\u2019m president, it\u2019s going to change.(APPLAUSE)(LAUGHTER)When it comes to the tragic mass killings that we have seen in this country, Donald Trump says that what we need to do is build quote \u201cmore institutions for people who are sickos.\u201dCharles Krauthammer also says that in some cases involuntary commitment would help. And you have agreed with that. Given that institutions would be extraordinarily expensive to begin building, how much is too much to ask on this from the American taxpayer?But I do believe this is one of the really principle issues in this campaign. The president and Hillary Clinton are working very hard to change the culture of this country in order to put us in a position where we can\u2019t exercise Second Amendment rights.That\u2019s wrong. I am a board member of the National Rifle Association.If gun control...(BELL RINGING)(APPLAUSE)The Conservative Club for Growth has had an issue with your policy on taxes for years. In fact, it called you, \u201cTax Hike Mike\u201d. And, the record shows state spending in Arkansas increased 54% when you were in charge, 94% if you include federal dollars during that same period. When it comes to helping people at the margins, $30,000, $32,000 dollars a year, what\u2019s better? A tax and spend approach, or shrinking government?I also was able to see per capita income growth in my state go up by 50%. I think that\u2019s a pretty darn good record. Look at the overall record and it was fine.But, it\u2019s not about stats from when I was governor. Look, one of the reasons I support the Fairtax is because it\u2019s the one thing, Bill, that would truly empower people at the bottom of the economy by no longer punishing them for their work.If a guy works an hourly job, and he works eight hours, gets paid for it, terrific. But, if he works 16 hours, he doesn\u2019t get a double paycheck because he\u2019s going to be bumped up into a new tax bracket, and the government will get more of his second shift than he will. So, we\u2019ve actually punished him for being industrious, hardworking, and that is a foolish economic policy...(BELL RINGING)(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: Well, in fact, the plan that I put forward is scored by the Tax Foundation as bringing three and a half million jobs into this country, and we have provisions in the flat tax for the corporate side that actually has a phase in of manufacturing. Manufacturers initially don\u2019t pay any income tax. Ten percent the next year, and 20.We\u2019re going to also have a repatriation provision which says that if you have money overseas, and you\u2019re Apple, and you got a couple hundred billion dollars there, bring it back. The most you\u2019ll be taxed 10%, invest it here in America. Create jobs here in America with all that money that\u2019s sitting overseas.We also \u2014 it\u2019s not just taxes. It\u2019s regulation. I\u2019ve pledged to cut every single Obamacare \u2014 I mean, excuse me, Obama regulation, including Obamacare, and remove those regulations that cost more than a hundred million dollars in the economy. That will liberate \u2014 and that includes waters of the U.S., and the ozone regulations, they \u2014 the mercury regulations. All of these just crush our manufactures and don\u2019t create an opportunity for us to survive.And, remember, China produces five times as much CO2 and other pollutants per dollar of GDP as we do.(BELL RINGING)SANTORUM: You want to help the environment? Bring jobs back to America.(APPLAUSE)HEMMER: Senator, thank you.MACCALLUM: Still more to come from the Republican Presidential debate tonight.We\u2019ll see you, just a moment \u2014 back.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK )MACCALLUM: We are back live at the Iowa events center and this question goes to Carly Fiorina. In the last debate you said as part of your introduction, quote, \u201c And unlike the other woman candidate in this case I actually love spending time with my husband.\u201d(LAUGHTER)FIORINA: He is right there. He is right there.MACCALLUM: But back in September in an interview you said that you would stick only to the record, your record versus Hillary Clinton\u2019s record. And never resort to personal attacks. So what changed?FIORINA: It wasn\u2019t a personal attack. I was pointing out the fact that Hillary Clinton will do anything to gain and hang on to power, anything. Listen, if my husband did what Bill Clinton did, I would have left him long ago.(APPLAUSE)FIORINA: So, here\u2019s the deal. Hillary Clinton has been climbing the ladder to try and get power and here now she is trying for the White House. She is probably more qualified for the big house, honestly.(LAUGHTER)She has escaped prosecution more times than El Chapo, perhaps Sean Penn should interview her.(LAUGHTER)The woman should be prosecuted.(APPLAUSE) FIORINA: And while Mrs. Clinton has flown hundreds of thousands of world around the global, I have too. And I know flying is an activity not an accomplishment. While I know that she has held many positions and many titles she has not accomplished much of anything in her life. She has gotten every single foreign policy challenge wrong.(BELL RINGS)She continues to lie to the American people. It\u2019s called the Clinton way. Both Bill and Hillary practice it, the Clinton way. Say whatever you have to say, do whatever you have to say. Lie as long as you can get away with it. Hillary Clinton cannot be the president of these United States.(APPLAUSE)MACCALLUM: All right. Carly, I want to stay with you on this next question as well.You waded into the Planned Parenthood early on. You took some heat for it. Now the people who shot that undercover video are the ones who got indicted and Planned Parenthood is untouched. Hillary Clinton has been crowing about this. Any regrets about this?FIORINA: Well, you know, Hillary Clinton hasn\u2019t been indicted either. So that tells us a lot about our justice system in this country. But, look, the facts of Planned Parenthood have not changed, folks, and I will not be rendered silent on this issue or any other issue.And it doesn\u2019t matter what stage I\u2019m on. Here are the facts. Planned Parenthood engages in partial birth abortion, in late-term abortion. They alter those abortion techniques to harvest and sell body parts. They have admitted that they are not going to accept compensation for this anymore.The reality is, most Americans find this practice horrific. Most Americans find horrific that Hillary Clinton\u2019s position on this is it\u2019s not a life until it\u2019s born. Most Americans find horrific Hillary Clinton\u2019s position or the Democrat party\u2019s position, that a young woman does not need her mother\u2019s permission to get an abortion.But if you are 13 years old, you can get an abortion, but you can\u2019t go to a tanning salon without your mother\u2019s permission. A president Fiorina \u2014 in a president Fiorina budget, there will not be one dime for Planned Parenthood, although there would be a lot of money for women\u2019s health and we will finally pass the pain capable unborn child protection act.I will always stand for life and religious liberty...(BELL RINGS)... because this is about the character of our nation.(APPLAUSE) MACCALLUM: Thank you Carly Fiorina. Let me just ask a quick question here to Senator Santorum.Carly Fiorina was the only one of the GOP candidates to attend the March for Life in Washington last week. Where were you.SANTORUM: Well, I\u2019ve been to the March for Life for about 25 years and I thought \u2014 I think that\u2019s a pretty good record.(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: Spoken at it a few times and I have shepherded every single piece of pro-life piece of legislation that\u2019s passed over the last 20 years. I\u2019ve either authored it or shepherded it through the United States Congress and I\u2019m pretty proud of that record too.(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: But we have an election going on and there was some snow coming. So I decided that maybe it would be better for me to get out and do some campaigning and not be stuck as my wife and kids were for a week, piling out of two and a half feet of snow.So, here\u2019s what I would say. If you want someone that is going to talk a good game, there are a lot of folks on this stage that have talked a good game on the issue of life.Not only have I talked a good game on life and I\u2019ve done some things. But I\u2019ve also lived it. You know, one of the things Saint Francis said was, you know, if you preach the gospel, then if you have to, speak.The bottom line is, that twice in my life, we were counseled to have an abortion, one with our son Gabriel and one with our little girl Bella. And neither time did Karen and I for a moment think about it because we know that life begins at conception.We know the dignity of every human life and we know the potential of every child, no matter how long that life lives. And that is a message that can come across to all Americans and without having to say a word and defend the institution of life and the dignity of life in this country.(APPLAUSE)FIORINA: Martha, can I just say we\u2019ve been talking tonight about a lot of issues and we\u2019ve also been talking about the fact that the game is rigged and frankly, the media has a lot to do with that.It is outrageous frankly, that Fox News, and you, would question the pro-life credentials of Rick Santorum.(APPLAUSE)FIORINA: That is outrageous.(APPLAUSE)HEMMER: Thank you Ms. Fiorina.Governor Gilmore. Who are the moderate Muslims do you seek advice and counsel from on how to deal with the threat from radical Islamic terrorism?GILMORE: You know Bill, that raises, I think, the question of the future of the Republican party. The question is \u2014 first of all, I stand second to no one in standing up to radical Islamism. I understand that ISIS is a piece of that but it is a world-wide phenomena that has manifested itself in Paris, in 9/11, in San Bernardino, in Boston.I recognize all that. But I also recognize this. This is a strain of Islamism that cannot be supported and cannot be stood for. And what we need is for people in the Muslim community in the United States to stand up and be counted and to say that this is not right.And yes, I have met with some people. And I\u2019m not going to identify who they are. I met with them last week. And they told me some terrible stories about how they have been harassed and their children have seen them be harassed.And I said to them. You have got to stand up and condemn this radical Islamism because it\u2019s the war of ideas that we are going to have to win to go along with our military conflicts that are coming forward.But the point is Bill...(BELL RINGS)... we cannot have a Republican party that scapegoats anyone, Hispanics, Muslims, any women, African Americans, anyone. If that becomes the future of the Republican party, I don\u2019t want to be a part of that.HEMMER: Thank you governor.(APPLAUSE)HEMMER: Governor Huckabee. Here in Iowa 43 percent of Democratic caucus goers describe themselves as socialist. That\u2019s a higher number than those who say they are capitalist. I guess you could say, they\u2019re feeling the burn.(LAUGHTER)HEMMER: This is a country rooted in capitalism, the United States of America. How did we get here?HUCKABEE: I honestly don\u2019t understand how anybody with IQ above plant life would honestly think...(LAUGHTER)HUCKABEE: ... that we would be better off if we let the government have all of the private property and that the government would dole out what they thought we should have.I\u2019m not \u201cfeeling the Bern,\u201d Bill. I\u2019m not feeling it.(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: And when Bernie Sanders promises these kids free college, I\u2019m telling them, because I get asked, what about free college? I said, look, if we give you free college when you are 20, pal, you are going to be paying for it when you are 30, when you are 40, and when you are 50.(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: There is no such thing as the government giving you anything. They will definitely make a mess of it.And I just think there are a lot of people who have never understood the basic understanding of economics, that you do not make people rich by tearing down those who are you providing jobs, and you don\u2019t help poor people by taking away.You give them jobs. Let them work. Let them earn. And then you let them keep the money that they earned. That\u2019s how we build a great economy.(APPLAUSE)HEMMER: Thank you, Governor.Senator Santorum, the president says politics in America have become meaner over the past several years with him in the White House. Two weeks ago at the State of the Union he said the following. \u201cA president with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide.\u201dHEMMER: Lincoln and Roosevelt, that\u2019s pretty good company. If he is right, do Republicans share some of the blame?SANTORUM: The president of the United States has been the most divisive president in \u2014 certainly in my lifetime. This is a man who constantly...(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: He is not trustworthy. You can\u2019t sit down and negotiate with him. He won\u2019t keep a deal. We have heard that over and over again. And here is what he does that really, really creates the friction in Washington.He personally attacks people. He ascribes motives to them that aren\u2019t true and then he tears them down. How are you going to work with someone if you don\u2019t treat them decently, honestly, and respectfully?I was a tough fighter when I was in Washington. I had very sharp elbows. I fought. I went there and joined a game named Jim Nussle here from Iowa with the \u201cgang of seven.\u201d And we, in four years\u2019 time, took a Congress that had been controlled by Democrats for 40 years, and brought in the first Republican majority because we fought and we fought tough.But you know what? I was able to then work with those same people that we fought with and able to pass welfare reform. Unborn Victims of Violence Act. Pro-life bills. Health savings accounts.A whole laundry list of things not because I was mean, but because I was able to be respectful in the disagreements. And that\u2019s what we need in Washington, someone who can be respectful and still unite this country.(APPLAUSE)HEMMER: Thank you, Senator.MACCALLUM: All right. Coming up, we will have the closing statements from our candidates tonight as we continue live from the Iowa Events Center in Des Moines. We\u2019ll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HEMMER: In the closing few moments, the candidates have an opportunity to make a closing statement, 30 seconds for each. And, we want to start tonight with the former Virginia Governor, Jim Gilmore.GILMORE: Well, thank you very much, Bill. And, thank you, and Fox and Google for including me in this debate tonight. I think it\u2019s been a wonderful opportunity.I\u2019m the son of a meat cutter. My father worked for Safeway stores for 45 years. My mother was a secretary, she ended her career as the Secretary for the Methodist Bishop. I didn\u2019t have a father that could give me a million dollar loan to start my business. But, my father did talk character, and he provided for his family, and he was a wonderful example.And, I\u2019m not about to go across town tonight to carry the coat for some billionaire. Instead, I intend to run for President of the United States, speak to the issue of this international war, and challenge that we\u2019re in. This issue of veterans rights, and the issue of Second Amendment rights, and I ask for your support...HEMMER: ... Thank you, Governor.(APPLAUSE)MACCALLUM: Alright, let\u2019s go now to Senator Rick Santorum.SANTORUM: I just want to thank the people of Iowa. Over the last five years I\u2019ve done 700 speeches and town hall meetings all throughout the state of Iowa, and it has been an incredible right. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)I want to thank all the wonderful folks like Pastor Carey (ph) Gordon (ph) who gave me a smooth stone and said you go slay Goliaths. Someone like Jim and Janet Cook who over this past Christmas gave up Christmas presents for their kids, and they have more than I do, just they can help me and my campaign.That\u2019s the kind of people...(BELL RINGING) SANTORUM: ... in Iowa. And, here\u2019s what I\u2019m asking you to do. You\u2019re good people. You know good leaders. Lead. Pick the right person, not what the polls say. Not who the money give people to. Pick the leader you know is best for this country. Thank you.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)HEMMER: Governor Huckabee.HUCKABEE: Well, this week there was a little dust up about a video we put together with the music of Adele, so I thought it\u2019d be appropriate for me to begin tonight by saying, \u201cHello, Iowa. It\u2019s me.\u201dMACCALLUM: (LAUGHING)HUCKABEE: And, you know me. You gave me the largest number of votes in the history of the Iowa caucus eight years ago, and I think you did it because you trusted me, you believed that I had your best interest at heart.When I was governor I had a little plaque in my office in the Governor\u2019s office, and it simply said this. Come, let us reason together.(BELL RINGING)HUCKABEE: I believe the next President needs to put that plaque in the oval office, and needs to lead this country by saying, \u201cCome, let us reason together.\u201dGod bless you, and thank you for your support.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)HEMMER: Thank you, Governor.MACCALLUM: Carly Fiorina.FIORINA: In over 150 events I have come to know and love the people of Iowa. And the people of Iowa know what the rest of Americans have figured out, this ain\u2019t working anymore. The government no longer works for those who pay for it. The professional political class says and does whatever they need to do to win, and then does whatever they please.We need to return to a citizen government. That is why I am running for President. The media, the establishment, they all want to tell you this elections over, they know who\u2019s going to win it, except that you haven\u2019t...(BELL RINGING)FIORINA: ... cast a single vote yet. So, the people of Iowa, stand with me, fight with me. Caucus for me. It is time to take our country back.MACCALLUM: Thank you, Carly.(APPLAUSE)HEMMER: That concludes our debate tonight, but the night has just begun.MACCALLUM: In one hour, seven more candidates take the stage for a debate hosted by Bret Baier, Megyn Kelly, and Chris Wallace. But, up next, the O\u2019Reilly Factor.Good night, everybody.Advertisement"}

Designers and their fans alike are so stoned on storytelling and the seductions of reference that one starts to yearn for the preliterate \u2014 or pre-Internet, anyway \u2014 world.DetroitTulsaTwin PeaksElm StreetHorrorsThe ScreamHalloweenAmerican YouthBelgian YouthBig BubbleFor good measure, Mr. Simons threw in Martin Margiela, Cindy Sherman, the Boy Scouts, CBGB and \u201cThe Breakfast Club.\u201d He also revisited his own back pages by evoking the influential \u201cFear Generation\u201d collection for spring 2002 that first put him on the map.Put that in your big bubble and smoke it.\u201cHe managed my father\u2019s money,\u201d Jade Jagger said backstage during a brief preview of the cobwebby silver and diamond heritage style jewelry she designed to accompany the collection. That is, it was de Red\u00e9 who introduced her father, Mick Jagger, to Rupert zu Loewenstein, the Spanish-born Bavarian prince who eventually came to manage the Rolling Stones\u2019 money so cannily that, as Ms. Jagger also noted, \u201cHe made them all very rich.\u201dBaron de Red\u00e9\u2019s credentials are more entertaining when you learn that they were largely fictitious. The fashionable set has always gone for a good story, and Baron de Red\u00e9\u2019s was ripe enough to obscure his true origins as a middle-class adventurer from upstate Troy, N.Y.His reference to peaceniks was the most persuasive to this viewer, owing largely to the wonderful hippie-style military regalia he showed, along with shorts over leggings, covetable olive drab trench coats, soft suits of burgundy velvet, and regimental jackets whose swirling motifs, appliqu\u00e9d on sleeves, were devised by Wes Wilson, godfather of West Coast psychedelia.Taken together, these were four of the more poetically rendered shows in recent memory. Each in its own way helped set a course not just for men\u2019s wear, but for fashion as a force beneficial to culture. It is decidedly not in the nature of the French to publicly dwell on disaster, yet few here were unaffected by the Nov. 13 terrorist attacks in Paris. Thus, as notable as the security measures instituted at various show spaces throughout the city is the psychic bulwark these designers provided through optimistic visions of Paris\u2019s creative future.In Mr. Owens\u2019s case, vision took the form of clothes in immense volumes, cargo trousers with pockets as big as panniers alternated with shrunken, tailored jackets or boiler suits that looked paint-splattered. There were sculptural garments of no known category sprouting sleeves as if for vestigial limbs. That the sleeves were tied back into the body of the garments, straitjacket-style, reminded a viewer that controlling the fundamental unruliness of human bodies is among Mr. Owens\u2019s continuing concerns. You can see it in his assiduously crafted physique, and in virtually everything he has ever designed.Mr. Simons also has restraints on his mind, but of the human resources kind. Chafing under the demands of producing a never-ending series of collections as artistic director of Dior, the LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton powerhouse from which he resigned unexpectedly in October, he has gone back to his roots as an gifted indie.Staged in a rickety wooden maze before an audience kept standing and against the aural background of a recorded conversation between David Lynch and the composer Angelo Badalamenti, Mr. Simons produced a deft and modest show of supersize letter jackets; tailored coats in traditional British woolens; immense and holey boyish sweaters with ragged hems that tenderly evinced the designer\u2019s respect for the innovations of his Belgian countryman Mr. Margiela and for the fragile landscape of boyhood.Now in his fifth year at Louis Vuitton, Mr. Jones has settled into his role as the ultimate journeyman creator. Calling his collection \u201cFuture Heritage\u201d seems hubristic until one considers that Mr. Jones\u2019s instincts and design chops have rendered him a real rainmaker for the brand.Of course, the collection \u2014 workmen\u2019s jackets with appliqu\u00e9d pockets, geometrically patterned blanket coats of cashmere, silk pajama suits with Cocteau-esque ribbon drawings, laser-cut shearling bathrobe coats, slim three-button suits in French blue, a leather jean jacket of such complex fabrication they made only a single one \u2014 had virtually nothing to do with Baron de Red\u00e9.Vuitton is an accessories house, above all, and in the end, it is pens on chains, spinel rings, key chains and black-on-black Keepall monogram bags that will set cash registers ringing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Decoding Airline Fare Classes to Make the Most of Your Miles", "Date": "2016-01-12", "News": "Supported byThe GetawayDo you know what a Q fare is? How about an X or a Z? When you browse for flights on an airline\u2019s website, assorted letters appear in your search results. Travelers often miss them. Or see them but don\u2019t factor them into their decision about which flight to choose. But these letters matter. Because of them, the person to your left may receive more award miles than you, reach elite status faster than you, or change her itinerary at no cost while you pay a $200 fee \u2014 yet you\u2019re both in the same cabin. What gives?As many frequent fliers know, the visible class distinctions on airplanes (Economy, Premium Economy, Business, First) are further divided into invisible groups called fare classes, or booking codes. Different airlines assign different letters to these classes, which can also vary from carrier to carrier. Knowing the ABCs of fare classes may help you attain elite status, avoid penalties for changing and canceling flights, and rack up miles, among other things. If you\u2019re aiming to earn award miles by flying an airline that\u2019s partners with your primary carrier, it\u2019s particularly important to learn how to make fare classes work in your favor.What those charts don\u2019t show are details about the flexibility of each fare class. To see the complete rules, including how much you have to pay for itinerary changes, you often have to go deep in the flight search process, almost to the payment page. That said, airline websites tend to make it clear early on in a search whether a ticket can be refunded and if changes can be made. I\u2019ll touch on this again below. For now, let\u2019s look at how fare classes relate to earning award miles, and miles that count toward elite status.I\u2019ll use Delta as an example because its website displays fare class letters clearly above the price of each flight. Members of Delta\u2019s reward program earn award miles based on ticket price, not distance flown. The higher the price, the more miles you can use toward award travel. Additionally, program members earn Medallion Qualification Miles, which are based on both distance flown and fare class paid. These qualification miles are used to determine your status: Silver, Gold, Platinum or Diamond.While searching for a round-trip flight from Los Angeles to Panama City on Delta.com, I saw a business class ticket with two stops for $2,014 in fare classes Z, A and G. Call it Ticket No. 1. There was also a Business class ticket for $2,756 in fare classes J and F and F. Call it Ticket No. 2.According to Delta\u2019s fare class chart, if I bought Ticket No. 1, I would earn 150 percent of the distance I fly. So the approximately 3,000-mile flight to Panama would earn me 4,500 qualifying miles. If I bought Ticket No. 2 , I would earn 200 percent of the distance I fly. So the flight to Panama would earn me 6,000 qualifying miles.Is there a winner? It depends on what you\u2019re after. Ticket No. 1 is $742 cheaper than Ticket No. 2. But it earns 1,500 fewer qualifying miles. And it\u2019s nonrefundable. Ticket No. 2 costs more. It earns more qualifying miles. And it\u2019s refundable.Sure, one advantage of some higher-priced tickets is the ability to cancel a trip or make changes at no additional cost. (Keep in mind, though, that sometimes the cheaper flight is still cheaper even if you end up paying a change fee.)It\u2019s especially important for members of airline loyalty programs to understand fare classes when deciding whether to credit miles to their primary carrier or a partner airline. Travelers who are not careful can end up with few miles and, in some instances, none at all.For example, Turkish Airlines partners with United. Some Economy tickets (fare classes Y, B, M, H or S) on a Turkish Airlines-operated flight earn you 100 percent of the United award mileage. But an economy ticket in fare class E or Q is a discount code that earns you 75 percent. It gets worse. Fare classes V, T and L are deep-discount economy tickets for which you receive only 50 percent. Alas, that\u2019s better than a W, G or P fare class, where you receive no mileage.When your primary carrier is giving you little or no mileage for travel on a partner airline, you\u2019re often better off crediting your flight to the partner airline.When miles matter, another thing to bear in mind is that while some fare classes put you in the Business cabin, they\u2019re essentially upgraded Economy tickets that don\u2019t earn many miles.

I wasn\u2019t sure how much you meant it.\u201dCall it Goode timing, Abbots. Handsome Henry Talbot, having been dangled before us like some matrimonial worm at the end of last season, has come back to pick up where he left off. Indeed, he may be one of the few remaining bachelors in England whose entrance can prompt Mary to gasp, \u201cGolly!\u201dWhat, exactly, do we know about this bobby dazzler? Worryingly little. He has \u201cadequate but not overwhelming\u201d prospects, according to his aunt, and if he is to inherit any kind of title, \u201c40 strong men would have to drop dead.\u201d (\u201cWell,\u201d answers Violet, \u201cnothing is impossible.\u201d)He could well be after Mary for her loot \u2014 car habits are expensive to maintain \u2014 but when you\u2019ve been holed up in Yorkshire as long as Mary (where all the eligible men look like Sergeant Willis) and you\u2019ve gone out to a fancy London restaurant in your aunt\u2019s dress (because you weren\u2019t planning to stay more than a day) and you\u2019re worried you look \u201crather shabby\u201d (as if) and your date for the evening very conspicuously rolls his eyes up and down your body and declares that you\u2019re the \u201copposite of shabby\u201d \u2026 well, the hell with fiscal caution, I say.Which is why, over dinner, Mary is inspired to drawl, \u201cI hope this means you\u2019re boiling up to make a pass before we\u2019re done.\u201d\u201cProbably,\u201d he concedes. \u201cBut will you accept?\u201d\u201cNo, but I shall enjoy the process immensely.\u201dAll right, Abbots, it\u2019s not exactly Bogart and Bacall, but just when \u201cDowntown\u201d story lines seemed to have dwindled to an ember, Henry and Mary have pumped in a bellows-blast of oxygen. Here\u2019s Andy casting moo-cow eyes (I think?) at Daisy. Here are the Carsons staggering back to Downton in a daze of carnal knowledge. (Mr. C appears to have taken his new wife warts and all.)Even Granny Violet \u2014 recalling, perhaps, her ancient affair with Prince Kuragin \u2014 is moved to declare that \u201cMary needs more than a handsome smile and a hand on the gear stick.\u201d And when her son expresses surprise that she knows what a gear stick is, she snaps, \u201cI know more than you think!\u201d(What. A. Slut.)Still, as \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d is always the first to remind us, sex has its unintended consequences. Just ask poor Baxter, seduced long ago into a ruinous crime and now trembling at the prospect of testifying against her corrupter. \u201cAll that is needed for evil to triumph,\u201d Molesley reminds her, \u201cis for good men to do nothing.\u201d You or I might have smacked him upside the head for his sententiousness, but Baxter squares her jaw and resolves to do what\u2019s right, so other young women don\u2019t get ruined or, at the very least, \u201cchanged.\u201d (Me, I can\u2019t wait to get a load of this Peter Coyle character: the Rasputin of servant girls.)Baxter also does her best to save Daisy from tasting the ripened fruit of her idiocy. Convinced that Cora is the one standing between Dad-in-Law and Yew Tree Farm, Daisy rushes up to have it out with her ladyship, only to learn that Mr. Mason is in like Flynn (and thanks in large part to Cora\u2019s urging). Stymied by yet another of Baron Fellowes\u2019s arrested plot developments, Daisy wanders back downstairs to ponder the pendulum swings of her fevered little brain. \u201cYesterday I thought I hated [Cora], and today she saved our lives.\u201d Daisy, if it helps to clarify your thinking, you\u2019ll still be annoying tomorrow.We\u2019re left, then, with the triumphal tableau of Mr. Mason embracing his new tenancy. Given that his happiness is built on the ruins of the Drewe family \u2014 a tragedy that has never particularly interested Baron Fellowes \u2014 I couldn\u2019t quite bring my hands together. Although my ears did perk up when the old man said, \u201cI know now where I can lay my bones.\u201dAnd if Daisy ever tires of hanging out with the in-law, she might consider following the arc of Upwardly Mobile Gwen. Five seasons ago, Gwen was a mere housemaid, inching toward a non-service career under the benevolent eye of Lady Sibyl. Tonight, she returns with full bourgeois bona fides, having snagged some (not overly dynamic) guy named John Harding and given birth to a batch of little Hardings. Did I mention she\u2019s as cute and winsome and breathy as ever, even if most of the Crawleys don\u2019t recognize her? (As Daisy, in a rare lucid moment, points out, \u201cThey don\u2019t look us in the face.\u201d)The example of Gwen\u2019s escape velocity leaves Daisy inspired and Barrow irked, and as for Mary \u2026 well, hearing of her late sister\u2019s largess makes her realize she\u2019s not exactly Clara Barton. I feel fairly certain, for instance, that Sybil would never have snorted at the Carsons for honeymooning in Scarborough. (Perhaps the sin suite at the Royal Liverpool wasn\u2019t available?) Surely, though, Dead Sis was smiling when Mary swept Anna off to London to avert another miscarriage and even paid extra for Dr. Ryder\u2019s dawn patrol. To quote that clever Abbot Lcan in Austin, Tex., it was indeed a stitch in time, and we will cross our fingers in anticipation of a bouncing baby, or something close thereto, by the Christmas episode \u2014 even as we recall that, in the eyes of Baron Fellowes, the Bateses are as flies to wanton boys.Department of Other Stuff \u2026.\u2022 Mrs. Hughes has decided to go by her old name, but dear Lord, could the Crawleys have been any crankier about having to address her as Mrs. Carson? You\u2019d think they\u2019d been forced to eat with their toes. Suck it up, aristos!\u2022 Lord G\u2019s gut pangs are coming so frequently now they need their own theme music. You\u2019ll recall that last season Baron Fellowes let him off lightly with an ulcer, but I can\u2019t help thinking some more dire fate is in the offing. Tremble.\u2022 What with Molesley invoking Edmund Burke and Mrs. Patmore likening Daisy to Madame Defarge and Mr. Bates casually tossing out the name of Diaghilev, it was quite a high-culture week for the downstairs staff. Not one to be outflanked intellectually, Violet made a funny allusion to Ariadne\u2019s thread and somehow got a glimpse into the future writings of Ayn Rand: \u201cFor years I\u2019ve watched governments take control of our lives, and their argument is always the same \u2014 fewer costs, greater efficiency. But the result is the same, too. Less control by the people, more control by the state until the individual\u2019s own wishes count for nothing. That is what I consider my duty to resist.\u201d And if you thought that would make the hospital plotline any more interesting, you were wrong.\u2022 In addition to playing Lady Shackleton, Harriet Walter can currently be seen in your local multiplex as the doctor ministering to Chewbacca\u2019s wounds. Funny business, an actor\u2019s career.\u2022 Speaking of \u201cStar Wars,\u201d I\u2019ve heard from several Abbots who thought the recent usage of \u201cover to the dark side\u201d was a bald anachronism. I confess I\u2019m wondering the same thing about Dr. Ryder\u2019s \u201ccautiously optimistic,\u201d even if it does hail from \u201cmedical novels.\u201d (Were there a great many medical novels in 1925? Was Dr. Arrowsmith ever cautiously optimistic?)So share, Abbots! As we draw closer to the season\u2019s meridian, what are your hopes and dreams for the show\u2019s characters? Will Mary embrace the gear stick? Or will she choose the man who imports guinea pigs from Peru? Will Baxter bring the spark of hope back to Molesley\u2019s eyes? Will Violet become the first female pope? Will Robert make it to Christmas? Will Edith someday give birth to Pelhams 1, 2 and 3? Will Tom do anything? Anything at all?Next week!An earlier version of this article misidentified the character who made a funny allusion to Ariadne\u2019s thread. She is Violet, not Isobel.Louis Bayard is the author of \u201cRoosevelt\u2019s Beast,\u201d \u201cThe Pale Blue Eye\u201d and \u201cMr. Timothy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Happiness Code", "Date": "2016-01-14", "News": "FeatureA new approach to self-improvement is taking off in Silicon Valley: cold, hard rationality.Supported byThe goal of the \u2018\u2018CoZE\u2019\u2019 exercise, Smith explained, was to \u2018\u2018peek over the fence\u2019\u2019 to a new self; by doing something that makes you uncomfortable and then observing the result. There was an anticipatory hush, and then the room erupted. One person gave a toast. A product manager at Dropbox broke into song. In a corner, a programmer named Brent took off his shirt, revealing a milky chest and back, then sat with his head bowed. (He would later walk around wearing a handwritten sign that read, \u2018\u2018Please touch me.\u2019\u2019)The exercise went on for an hour, and afterward, participants giddily shared their stories. One person described going onto the patio and watching everyone else through the window, in order to experience a feeling of exclusion. Another submerged his hand in a pan of leftover chicken curry, to challenge his natural fastidiousness. Unexpectedly, he enjoyed the experience. \u2018\u2018It felt playful,\u2019\u2019 he said.Some of these problems are byproducts of our brain\u2019s reward system. We cash checks quickly but drag our feet paying credit-card bills, no matter the financial cost, because cashing a check generates a surge of dopamine but paying a bill makes us stressed. Other mistakes are glitchier. A person who owes back taxes might avoid talking to the I.R.S. because of a lingering monkey-brain belief that avoiding bad news keeps it from being true. While such logical errors may be easy to spot in others, the group says, they\u2019re often harder to see in ourselves. The workshop promised to give participants the tools to address these flaws, which, it hinted, are almost certainly worse than we realize. As the center\u2019s website warns, \u2018\u2018Careful thinking just isn\u2019t enough to understand our minds\u2019 hidden failures.\u2019\u2019Most self-help appeals to us because it promises real change without much real effort, a sort of fad diet for the psyche. (\u2018\u2018The Four-Hour Workweek,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up.\u2019\u2019) By the magical-thinking standards of the industry, then, CFAR\u2019s focus on science and on tiresome levels of practice can seem almost radical. It has also generated a rare level of interest among data-driven tech people and entrepreneurs who see personal development as just another optimization problem, if a uniquely central one. Yet, while CFAR\u2019s methods are unusual, its aspirational promise \u2014 that a better version of ourselves is within reach \u2014 is distinctly familiar. The center may emphasize the benefits that will come to those who master the techniques of rational thought, like improved motivation and a more organized inbox, but it also suggests that the real reward will be far greater, enabling users to be more intellectually dynamic and nimble. Or as Smith put it, \u2018\u2018We\u2019re trying to invent parkour for the mind.\u2019\u2019This is all the more surprising given that the workshops, which cost $3,900 per person, are run like a college-dorm cram session. Participants stay on-site for the entire time (typically four days and nights), often in bargain-basement conditions. In San Leandro, the organizers packed 48 people (36 participants, plus six staff members and six volunteers) into a single house, using twin mattresses scattered on the floor as extra beds. In the kitchen, I asked Matt O\u2019Brien, a 30-year-old product manager who develops brain-training software for Lumosity, whether he minded the close quarters. He looked briefly puzzled, then explained that he already lives with 20 housemates in a shared house in San Francisco. Looking around the chaotic kitchen, he shrugged and said, \u2018\u2018It\u2019s not really all that different.\u2019\u2019Those constraints produced a peculiar homogeneity. Nearly all the participants were in their early- to mid-20s, with quirky bios of the Bay Area variety. (\u2018\u2018Asher is a singing, freestyle rapping, former international Quidditch All-American turned software engineer.\u2019\u2019) Communication styles tended toward the formal. When I excused myself from one conversation, my interlocutor said, \u2018\u2018I will allow you to disengage,\u2019\u2019 then gave a courtly bow. The only older attendee, a man in his 50s who described himself as polyamorous and \u2018\u2018part Vulcan,\u2019\u2019 ghosted through the workshop, padding silently around the house in shorts and a polo shirt.If the demographics of the workshop were alarmingly narrow, there was no disputing the group\u2019s studiousness. Over the course of four days, I heard not a single scrap of chatter about anything unrelated to rationality. Nor, so far as I could discern, did anybody ever leave the house. Not for a quick trip to the Starbucks a mile down the road. Not for a walk in the sprawling park a half-mile away. One participant, Phoenix Eliot, had recently moved into a shared house where everyone was a \u2018\u2018practicing rationalist\u2019\u2019 and reported that the experience had been positive. \u2018\u2018We haven\u2019t really had any interpersonal problems,\u2019\u2019 Eliot told me. \u2018\u2018Whereas if this were a regular house, with people who just like each other, I think there would have been a lot more issues.\u2019\u2019When I first spoke to Galef, she told me that, while the group tends to attract analytical thinkers, a purely logical approach to problem-solving is not the goal. \u2018\u2018A lot of people think that rationality means acting like Spock and ignoring things like intuition and emotion,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018But we\u2019ve found that that approach doesn\u2019t actually work.\u2019\u2019 Instead, she said, the aim was to bring the emotional, instinctive parts of the brain (dubbed \u2018\u2018System One\u2019\u2019 by Kahneman) into harmony with the more intellectual, goal-setting parts of the brain (\u2018\u2018System Two\u2019\u2019).At the orientation, Galef emphasized this point. System One wasn\u2019t something to be overcome, she said, but a wise adviser, capable of sensing problems that our conscious minds hadn\u2019t yet registered. It also played a key role in motivation. \u2018\u2018The prefrontal cortex is like a monkey riding an elephant,\u2019\u2019 she told the group. \u2018\u2018System One is the elephant. And you\u2019re not going to steer an elephant by telling it where it should go.\u2019\u2019 The challenge, Galef said, was to recognize instances in which the two systems were at war, leading to a feeling of \u2018\u2018stuckness\u2019\u2019: \u2018\u2018Things like, \u2018I want to go to the gym more, but I don\u2019t go.\u2019 Or, \u2018I want my Ph.D., but I don\u2019t want to work on it.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 She sketched a picture of a duck facing one way and its legs and feet resolutely pointed in the opposite direction. She called these problems \u2018\u2018software bugs.\u2019\u2019Afterward, I chatted with O\u2019Brien and Mike Plotz, a circus juggler-turned-coder, about the program\u2019s appeal. When I asked Plotz why he thought the workshops attracted so many programmers, he glanced at O\u2019Brien. \u2018\u2018I think most of us are fairly analytical,\u2019\u2019 he began. \u2018\u2018We like to think about how complex systems work and how they can be optimized.\u2019\u2019 Because of this, Plotz added, he tends to notice patterns of behavior, in himself and in others. \u2018\u2018When you realize that people are complex systems \u2014 that we operate in complicated ways, but also sort of follow rules \u2014 you start to think about how you might tweak some of those variables.\u2019\u2019Deliberately or not, CFAR\u2019s application process also filters out many of the less committed. There is an extensive, in-person interview, conducted by an instructor. Afterward, participants are required to fill out an elaborate self-report, in which they\u2019re asked to assess their own personality traits and behaviors. (A friend or family member is given a similar questionnaire to confirm the accuracy of the applicant\u2019s self-assessment.) \u2018\u2018We get a fair number of people who say, \u2018I want to come to the workshop because everybody I work with is really irrational and I want to fix them,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Anna Salamon told me. \u2018\u2018Which is not what we are looking for.\u2019\u2019Despite this rigorous vetting, Salamon acknowledged that the center\u2019s aims are ultimately proselytic. CFAR began as a spinoff of MIRI, which Yudkowsky created in 2000, in part to study the impending threat posed by artificially intelligent machines, which, he argued, could eventually destroy humanity. (Yudkowsky\u2019s concern was that the machines could become sentient, hide this from their human operators and then decide to eliminate us.) Over the years, Yudkowsky found that people struggled to think clearly about A.I. risk and were often dismissive of it. In 2011, Salamon, who had been working at MIRI since 2008, volunteered to figure out how to overcome that problem.When I spoke with Salamon, she said that \u2018\u2018global catastrophic risks\u2019\u2019 like sentient A.I. were often difficult to assess. There wasn\u2019t much data from which to extrapolate; this not only made the threats harder to evaluate but also discouraged researchers from digging into the question. (Studies have shown that people are more likely to avoid thinking about problems that feel depressing or vague and are also more likely to engage in mental \u2018\u2018discounting\u2019\u2019 \u2014 assuming that the risk of something bad happening is lower than it actually is.) CFAR\u2019s original mandate was to give researchers the mental tools to overcome their unconscious assumptions. Or as Salamon put it, \u2018\u2018We were staring at the problem of staring at the problem.\u2019\u2019Like many in the community, Salamon believes that the skills of rational thought, as taught by CFAR, are important to humanity\u2019s long-term survival, in part because they can help us confront such seemingly remote catastrophic risks, as well as more familiar ones, like poverty and climate change. \u2018\u2018One thing that primates tend to do is to make up stories for why something we believe must be true,\u2019\u2019 Salamon told me. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s very rare that we genuinely evaluate the evidence for our beliefs.\u2019\u2019It was a point of view that nearly everyone at the workshop fervently shared. As one participant told me: \u2018\u2018Self-help is just the gateway. The real goal is: Save the world.\u2019\u2019As a lecturer, Smith had a messianic quality, gazing intensely at students and moving with taut deliberation, as though perpetually engaged in a tai-chi workout. Goal factoring, Smith explained, is essentially a structured thought exercise: a way to analyze an aspiration (\u2018\u2018I want to be promoted to manager\u2019\u2019) by identifying the subgoals that drive it. While some of these may be obvious, others (\u2018\u2018I want to impress my ex-girlfriend\u2019\u2019) might be more embarrassing or less conscious. The purpose of the exercise, Smith said, was to develop a process for seeing your own motivations honestly and for spotting when they might be leading you astray. \u2018\u2018These are blind spots,\u2019\u2019 Smith warned. \u2018\u2018Blind spots that can poison your ability to keep track of what\u2019s truly important to you.\u2019\u2019To begin the factoring process, Smith asked each of us to choose a goal, list all the things we believed would come from accomplishing it and then brainstorm ways to achieve each thing. If you wanted a promotion to make more money, was there another way to get a higher salary \u2014 say, by asking for a raise or changing jobs? Finally, Smith said, we should imagine having achieved each of those subgoals. Were we satisfied? If not, that indicated the presence of a hidden motive, one that we had either overlooked or didn\u2019t want to acknowledge.Though the exercise didn\u2019t strike me as especially penetrating \u2014 garden-variety introspection made punctilious \u2014 it was hugely popular. My group in the goal-factoring session included Ben Pace, a sweetly lumbering 18-year-old in a suit jacket and running shoes, who tended to balance his notepad on his knee like an old-timey newspaper reporter. Pace had flown over from Britain for the workshop, which he discovered at 15 by reading the LessWrong blog. He had applied to Oxford for the fall, and was hoping to attend. \u2018\u2018I was feeling very worried about it,\u2019\u2019 he confided, \u2018\u2018but then I goal-factored it and realized that I could get many of the same things I want from Oxford in other ways.\u2019\u2019While Pace said that he had come to the workshop to practice the techniques of rationality, others had more pressing worries. During one break, I chatted with Andrew, a software developer specializing in mobile platforms who asked to be identified only by his first name to protect his privacy. Andrew acknowledged that he tended to struggle in social situations and suffered from depression and anxiety. \u2018\u2018My brain has a lot of ridiculous social rules,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018I tend to be very closed off. And then there\u2019s a switch where I\u2019m almost completely open. It\u2019s this binary transition.\u2019\u2019Andrew said that he had initially been dubious of applied rationality, which he first heard about in a Reddit philosophy forum. Over time, though, he found that using the techniques made it easier to catch himself in the act of rationalizing a bad decision or avoiding an unpleasant task, like applying for a job. Initially, Andrew said, he assumed that he was simply afraid of rejection. But when he used aversion factoring \u2014 like goal factoring, but focused on what makes you avoid an unpleasant but important task \u2014 he made a surprising discovery. While visualizing how he would feel about applying for jobs if there were no chance of rejection, he realized that he still found the task aversive. In the end, he determined that his reluctance was rooted in a fear not of rejection but of making a bad career choice.It was a significant insight, the kind more typically won through hours of talk therapy. And indeed, some participants reported that the techniques had genuinely changed their lives, either by helping them with mental-health issues like attention deficit or obsessive-compulsive disorder or simply by allowing them to recognize unquestioned assumptions. For a few \u2014 especially a set of high achievers for whom success hadn\u2019t brought happiness \u2014 that process had been nearly tectonic. \u2018\u2018For most of my life, I believed \u2018If I do a good job, good things will happen,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 one person told me. \u2018\u2018Now I ask, \u2018If I do a good job, what does that mean?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019Others, though, seemed to see rationality less as a fundamental recalibration and more as a tool to be wielded. One participant, Michael Gao \u2014 who claimed that, before he turned 18, he made $10 million running a Bitcoin mine but then lost it all in the Mt. Gox collapse \u2014 seemed appalled when I suggested that the experience might have led him to value things besides accomplishment, like happiness and human connection. The problem, he clarified, was not that he had been too ambitious but that he hadn\u2019t been ambitious enough. \u2018\u2018I want to augment the race,\u2019\u2019 Gao told me earnestly, as we sat on the patio. \u2018\u2018I want humanity to achieve great things. I want us to conquer death.\u2019\u2019Given that I had already undergone a fair amount of talk therapy myself, I didn\u2019t expect the workshop to bring me much in the way of new insights. But then, at one point, Smith cited the example of a man with a potentially cancerous mole who refuses to go see the doctor. It was part, he said, of \u2018\u2018a broader class of mental errors\u2019\u2019 we\u2019re all prone to: the belief that avoiding bad news will keep it from becoming true. While this didn\u2019t strike me as particularly revelatory at the time, it turned out to be a stealthy insight. For an exercise the next day, I listed all the reasons I was avoiding talking with a financial planner, something I had intended to do for months. Many of them were pedestrian. Getting my financial records together would be tedious, and I was also mildly embarrassed by my income, which is on the low side. Working through the problem, though, I realized that the actual reason was humiliatingly simple: I was afraid of hearing that I needed to spend less and save more. Like mole man, I was afraid of what I might learn.But are such realizations alone enough to create change? Fears can be stubborn and not particularly easy to argue with. When I mentioned this to Smith, he shrugged. \u2018\u2018Hiding from the painful states of the world doesn\u2019t prevent them from happening,\u2019\u2019 he said. Then, like a strict parent telling a sniffling child to shape up, he added: \u2018\u2018The point isn\u2019t just \u2018How do I get myself to go to the doctor this time?\u2019 It\u2019s \u2018How do I make it so that I will never be susceptible to that type of thinking error again?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019Among other things, they found that people are typically both risk-averse and loss-averse: more likely to choose a guaranteed payout of $1,000 than to gamble on winning $1,400 when there\u2019s a 20 percent chance they could end up with nothing. They also discovered that people tend to underestimate the chance of a low-probability event occurring, thus inadvertently exposing themselves to terrible risks. (The 2011 tsunami, for example, caught the Japanese off guard and devastated parts of northeastern Japan.)In the past few decades, psychologists have identified dozens of cognitive biases, including \u2018\u2018gambler\u2019s fallacy\u2019\u2019 (believing that a coin toss is more likely to come up heads if the previous five flips were tails); \u2018\u2018anchoring\u2019\u2019 (the tendency to rely heavily on one piece of information \u2014 usually the first thing we learn \u2014 when making a decision); the \u2018\u2018Ikea effect\u2019\u2019 (disproportionately valuing things that you\u2019ve labored over); and \u2018\u2018unit bias\u2019\u2019 (assuming that a \u2018\u2018portion\u2019\u2019 is the right size, which accounts for our tendency to finish off an opened bag of cookies).What makes CFAR novel is its effort to use those same principles to fix personal problems: to break frustrating habits, recognize self-defeating cycles and relentlessly interrogate our own wishful inclinations and avoidant instincts. Galef described \u2018\u2018propagating urges\u2019\u2019 \u2014 a mental exercise designed to make long-term goals feel more viscerally rewarding \u2014 as an extension of operant conditioning, in which an experimenter who hopes to increase a certain behavior in an animal will reward incremental steps toward that behavior. Goal factoring and aversion factoring, she added, came out of behavioral economics, as well as research on a cognitive bias known as \u2018\u2018introspection illusion\u2019\u2019: thinking we understand our motives or fears when we actually don\u2019t. (That illusion is why the factoring process begins with listing every reason you\u2019re either avoiding something or pursuing a goal, and then uses a second round of thought experiments to ferret out hidden factors.)Figuring out how to translate behavioral-economics insights into a curriculum involved years of trial and error. Salamon recruited Galef, a former science journalist, in 2011, and later hired Smith, then a graduate student in math education at San Diego State. (Smith first met Yudkowsky at a conference dedicated to cryonics, in which a deceased person\u2019s body is stored in a supercooled vat, to be resuscitated in a more advanced future.) In early 2012, the group began offering free classes to test its approach and quickly learned that almost none of it worked. Participants complained that the lectures were abstract and confusing and that some points seemed obvious while others simply felt wrong. A session on Bayes\u2019s Theorem was especially unpopular, Salamon recalled, adding, \u2018\u2018People visibly suffered through it.\u2019\u2019The group also discovered a deeper problem: No one was very motivated to make his or her thinking more accurate. What people did want, Salamon recalled, was help with their personal problems. Some were constantly late to things. Others felt trapped by their own unproductive habits. Nearly everyone wanted help managing their email, eating better and improving their relationships. \u2018\u2018Relatively early on,\u2019\u2019 Salamon said, \u2018\u2018we realized that we had to disguise the epistemic rationality content as productivity advice or relationship advice.\u2019\u2019In the end, the group built a curriculum largely from existing research into human behavior, but the goal of Applied Rationality remained the same: to provide tools, not advice. \u2018\u2018Unlike a lot of self-help programs, we don\u2019t advocate particular things that people should do,\u2019\u2019 Galef told me. \u2018\u2018We just encourage them to look at the models that are driving their choices and try to examine those models rationally.\u2019\u2019 She shrugged. \u2018\u2018People are already making predictions, whether or not they\u2019re aware of it. They\u2019re already saying \u2018I\u2019ll be miserable if I leave this relationship\u2019 or \u2018I won\u2019t be able to make any difference in this big global problem because I\u2019m just one person.\u2019 So a lot of what we do is just trying to make people more aware of those predictions and to question whether they\u2019re actually accurate.\u2019\u2019The TAPs session was led by Salamon, a thin, muppety woman with a corona of brown hair. As a graduate student, Salamon studied the philosophy of science, and her lectures often seemed to take the wry view of humans as only marginally more evolved chimps. Involuntary TAPs already drive much of our behavior, she said \u2014 \u2018\u2018Like: See open bag of Cheetos. Put in hand\u2019\u2019 \u2014 but could also be made intentional and productive.My partner for the TAPs exercise, a soft-spoken engineer who works at Google, told me that he had tried TAPs before, but with limited success. \u2018\u2018For a while, I was trying to drink more water, so I set up a TAP to drink a glass of water the minute I got to work,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018It worked for a few weeks, but then I stopped. I started just wanting to get to work.\u2019\u2019 Now, he said, he was considering changing his TAP, to cue himself to drink water when he wanted a break. \u2018\u2018Maybe it\u2019ll help me stop reading Reddit,\u2019\u2019 he added.If TAPs felt slightly gimmicky, like rat-maze training for adults, other techniques seemed more profound. My favorite was propagating urges, the one that focused on motivating yourself to reach long-term goals. What makes things like weight loss or learning to play the violin difficult, Salamon said, is that they often conflict with System One-driven urges (wanting a nap, craving a cookie). And because long-term goals typically require sticking it out through a series of unpleasant intermediate steps (eating less, practicing the violin), it can be easy to lose the original motivation. \u2018\u2018Things we feel rewarded by, we do automatically,\u2019\u2019 Salamon added. \u2018\u2018When I want Thai food, I\u2019ll drive there, look at the menu, go inside, order. I don\u2019t have to convince myself to take those steps. But in other cases, the connection is lost.\u2019\u2019The solution, she said, is finding a way to make long-term goals feel more like short-term urges, especially because our brains are wired to associate actions and rewards that follow closely in time. (To discourage bad habits, conversely, you should stretch out the time between an action and its reward. \u2018\u2018If you want to stop reading stuff online instead of working, have the pages load more slowly,\u2019\u2019 Salamon advised.) Because of this powerful association, small but immediate negative experiences can have disproportionate impact: the aversive moment of getting into a cold swimming pool can overwhelm the delayed rewards of doing morning laps. To override that resistance, she said, you need to associate the activity with a powerful feeling of reward, one with a stronger neurochemical kick than the virtuous goals (\u2018\u2018being healthier\u2019\u2019) that we normally aspire to. The next step is to come up with a mental image that vividly captures that feeling and that you can summon in moments of weakness. \u2018\u2018It has to be a very sticky image,\u2019\u2019 Salamon said. \u2018\u2018If it isn\u2019t, you won\u2019t experience that gut-level surge of motivation.\u2019\u2019 She told a story about how Smith overcame his aversion to doing push-ups, which made him feel unpleasantly hot and sweaty, by tapping into his obsession with longevity: now he pictured the heat from the exercise as a fire that burned away cell-damaging free radicals.What made propagating urges so compelling, at least for me, was that it cut to the heart of a fundamental internal struggle: the clash between the shortsighted impulses that drive our daily behavior (checking email until it becomes \u2018\u2018too late\u2019\u2019 to go to the gym) and the long-term aspirations that might make us genuinely happier if we could only persuade the petulant toddler in our minds to get onboard.In a practice session, I paired up with Brian Raszap, a programmer at Amazon with a gentle smile and empathic manner. The aim of the exercise was to troubleshoot a long-term goal that we had each been struggling with and then create a new, sticky image to use as motivation. Raszap went first. He explained that he and some co-workers go to a Brazilian jujitsu class during lunch, usually once or twice a week. \u2018\u2018When I go, I love it,\u2019\u2019 Raszap told me. \u2018\u2018I feel so good. But half the time, I don\u2019t go.\u2019\u2019We talked through the problem for a while, then I asked Raszap to describe the feeling that he got from the class. He brightened. After working out, he told me, he is very relaxed, filled with a deeply pleasurable lassitude. When I asked if he could tap into that for motivation, Raszap nodded. \u2018\u2018Maybe that would work,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018I usually think about wanting to get better at jujitsu. But maybe instead, I can think about feeling really good this afternoon.\u2019\u2019Many of CFAR\u2019s techniques resemble a kind of self-directed version of psychotherapy\u2019s holy trinity: learning to notice behaviors and assumptions that we\u2019re often barely conscious of; feeling around to understand the roots of those behaviors; and then using those insights to create change. But there was something unsettling about how CFAR focused on superficial fixes while overlooking potentially deeper issues. While talking with Raszap, I began by asking why, if he truly wanted to go, he often skipped the jujitsu class. Raszap listed practical obstacles: Sometimes he doesn\u2019t want the interruption; sometimes he just has a lot to do. But he also said that even the idea of attending the class more regularly makes him feel anxious. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s a feeling of not doing enough,\u2019\u2019 Raszap told me. Perversely, the workout only heightened his fear of failing, of missing the next class. This was coupled with a claustrophobic sense of obligation, what Raszap called \u2018\u2018a fear of foreverness\u2019\u2019 \u2014 \u2018\u2018Like, if I go today, I\u2019ll have to keep going forever.\u2019\u2019When I told Raszap that these last anxieties sounded like the sort of thing that might benefit more from psychotherapy than from behavior-modification techniques, he agreed. \u2018\u2018I do have a good therapist, and we do talk about this,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018But it\u2019s a different approach. Therapy is more about grand life narratives. Applied rationality is more practical, like, \u2018What if you went to jujitsu in the evening, rather than at lunch?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019Yet applied rationality doesn\u2019t typically acknowledge this gap. Proponents of rationality tend to talk about the brain as a kind of second-rate computer, jammed full of old legacy software but possible to reprogram if you can master the code. The reality, though, is almost certainly more complex. We often can\u2019t see our biggest blind spots clearly or recognize their influence without outside help.Several weeks after the workshop, I asked Salamon whether CFAR was intended to be a kind of D.I.Y. therapy, because that seemed to be how some participants were using it. She demurred, saying that the instructors have occasionally recommended counseling to participants who exhibit truly alarming behaviors and beliefs. But she considered therapy-grade problems to be relatively rare. \u2018\u2018Ninety percent of the time, when people aren\u2019t remembering to fill out their expense forms, there\u2019s nothing deep there,\u2019\u2019 Salamon said. Even when a participant does have a deep-seated issue, she added, the techniques can still be effective. \u2018\u2018You just have to give things a bit more space,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018And not expect that they\u2019ll yield to hacks.\u2019\u2019And while some exercises seemed useful, other parts of the workshop \u2014 the lack of privacy or downtime, the groupthink, the subtle insistence that behaving otherwise was both irrational and an affront to \u2018\u2018science\u2019\u2019 \u2014 felt creepy, even cultish. In the days before the workshop, I repeatedly asked whether I could sleep at home, because I lived just a 15-minute drive away. Galef was emphatic that I should not. \u2018\u2018People really get much more out of the workshop when they stay on-site,\u2019\u2019 she wrote. \u2018\u2018This is a strong trend ... and the size of the effect is quite marked.\u2019\u2019As it turns out, I wasn\u2019t the only one to find the workshop disorienting. One afternoon, I sat on the front steps with Richard Hua, a programmer at Microsoft who was also new to CFAR. Since the workshop began, Hua told me, he had sensed \u2018\u2018a lot of interesting manipulation going on.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018There\u2019s something about being in there that feels hypnotic to me,\u2019\u2019 he added. \u2018\u2018I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a social pressure, exactly, but you kind of feel obliged to think like the people around you.\u2019\u2019 Another woman, who recently left her software job in Portland, Ore., to volunteer with CFAR, said her commitment to rationality had already led to difficulties with her family and friends. (When she mentioned this, Smith proposed that she make new friends \u2014 ones from the rationalist community.)But there was also the fact that the vibe was just a little strange, what with the underlying interest in polyamory and cryonics, along with the widespread concern that the apocalypse, in the form of a civilization-destroying artificial intelligence, was imminent. When I asked why a group of rationalists would disproportionately share such views, people tended to cite the mind-expanding powers of rational thought. \u2018\u2018This community is much more open to actually evaluating weird ideas,\u2019\u2019 Andrew told me. \u2018\u2018They\u2019re willing to put in the effort to explore the question, rather than saying: \u2018Oh, this is outside my window. Bye.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 But the real reason, many acknowledged, was CFAR\u2019s connection to Yudkowsky. Compulsive and rather grandiose, Yudkowsky is known for proclaiming the imminence of the A.I. apocalypse (\u2018\u2018I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if tomorrow was the Final Dawn, the last sunrise before the earth and sun are reshaped into computing elements\u2019\u2019) and his own role as savior (\u2018\u2018I think my efforts could spell the difference between life and death for most of humanity\u2019\u2019).When I asked Galef and Smith whether they worried that the group\u2019s association with Yudkowsky might be off-putting, they seemed genuinely mystified. Galef said the group designed its own curriculum, without consulting Yudkowsky, and also worked hard to remain \u2018\u2018value neutral,\u2019\u2019 emphasizing the techniques of rational thought rather than focusing on MIRI. Smith was more direct. Yudkowsky, he said, is \u2018\u2018entangled in our origins.\u2019\u2019 Then he shrugged. Newton was a jerk, he pointed out, \u2018\u2018but that doesn\u2019t affect physics.\u2019\u2019To keep people on track, CFAR holds online practice sessions for 10 weeks after a workshop and also assigns \u2018\u2018accountability buddies\u2019\u2019 to encourage participation. The center is debating whether to develop an online version of its workshops that anyone can access. At the same time, it is also considering whether it would be \u2018\u2018higher impact\u2019\u2019 to focus on teaching rationality to a small group of influential people, like policy makers, scientists and tech titans. \u2018\u2018When I think about the things that have caused human society to advance, many of them seem to stem from new and better ways of thinking,\u2019\u2019 Galef added. \u2018\u2018And while the self-help function of the workshops is great, I wouldn\u2019t be devoting my life to this if that was all that I thought we were doing.\u2019\u2019I hadn\u2019t planned to practice the techniques myself, but in the weeks after the workshop ended, I found myself using them often. I began to notice when I was avoiding work \u2014 \u2018\u2018finishing\u2019\u2019 a section of the newspaper (unit bias!) or doing other unproductive foot-dragging \u2014 and then rationalizing the lost time as mental \u2018\u2018preparation.\u2019\u2019 I also found myself experimenting more and noting the results: working in a library rather than a coffee shop (more effective); signing up and paying for spin classes in advance (ditto); going to a museum on the weekend rather than doing something outdoors (so-so). Against all odds, the workshop had cracked open a mental window: Instead of merely muddling through, I began to consider how my habits might be changed. And while it was hard to tell whether this shift was because of the techniques themselves or simply because I had spent four days focusing intensely on those habits, the effect was the same. Instead of feeling stuck in familiar ruts, I felt productive, open and willing to try new things. I even felt a bit happier.When I emailed some of the other participants, most reported a similar experience. Mike Plotz, the juggler turned coder, told me that he had recently done \u2018\u2018a flurry of goal-factoring.\u2019\u2019 Among other things, he wanted to understand why he spent so much time checking Facebook every morning before work. Plotz said that he knew the Facebook habit wasn\u2019t helping him and that he often ended up running late and feeling harried. After goal-factoring the problem, Plotz said, he realized that what he really wanted was autonomy: the feeling of being able to choose what he did each morning. Now, he said, rather than passively resisting work through Facebook, he gets up an hour earlier and does whatever he wants. \u2018\u2018This morning I got up, made coffee and listened to \u2018Moby-Dick,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Plotz said when we spoke. \u2018\u2018So I\u2019d say that, so far, it\u2019s going well.\u2019\u2019I asked Plotz if he could tell whether the changes he made were due to the applied-rationality techniques or simply the product of a more active, problem-solving mind-set. \u2018\u2018In some ways, I think the techniques are that: a way to kick you into a more productive state of mind,\u2019\u2019 he told me. But he also noted that they supplied a framework, a strategy for working through the questions that such a mind-set might raise. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s one thing to notice your thoughts and behaviors,\u2019\u2019 Plotz said. \u2018\u2018Turning that into a technique that actually lets you accomplish stuff? That\u2019s hard.\u2019\u2019Jennifer Kahn is a contributing writer for the magazine.

{"Headline": "Daniel Doctoroff Takes His Business to Hudson Yards", "Date": "2016-01-26", "News": "Supported bySquare FeetDaniel L. Doctoroff, the powerful former deputy mayor who pushed to add glittering offices and apartments to industrial areas in New York, giving much of the skyline its current look, is moving to a neighborhood of his making.For Mr. Doctoroff, who served in the Bloomberg administration, the move may seem like vindication. For more than a decade, he championed the construction of a football stadium in the area, to help lure the Olympic Games to New York. But despite spending years on the effort, and millions of dollars of his personal fortune, the former investment banker watched as controversy engulfed the stadium plan, before it was defeated by state officials. The 2012 Olympics ended up taking place in London.Still, zoning changes that accompanied the proposal paved the way for the current wave of development, a top-to-bottom transformation that Mr. Doctoroff said was ultimately his goal.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be immodest, but I do take a lot of pleasure and pride in what the Olympics catalyzed,\u201d said Mr. Doctoroff, who added that he came up with the idea of naming the neighborhood Hudson Yards. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s a little bit like coming home.\u201dUnder the deal, Sidewalk Labs, where Mr. Doctoroff is chief executive, will take 67,000 square feet across a floor and a half at 10 Hudson Yards, an office tower being developed by the Related Companies and the Oxford Properties Group.Mr. Doctoroff said he considered about 200 potential locations in Manhattan for Sidewalk, a tech firm focused on urban quality-of-life issues whose parent company is Alphabet, the holding company for Google. Sidewalk is now based in Lower Manhattan, in the Woolworth Building.Joining Sidewalk at 10 Hudson Yards, in a space whose floor-to-ceiling windows provide striking views in four directions, will be Intersection, a tech firm that Sidewalk and other investors acquired last year. In a complicated play, Intersection was created from the merger of the Control Group and Titan, companies that were behind the creation of LinkNYC, the program now installing Wi-Fi kiosks on city sidewalks.In several ways, Mr. Doctoroff\u2019s new digs can seem a homage to his past. Their design, by the firm Design Republic, will recall the look of the Bloomberg-era City Hall, where employees of all titles mixed in an open-floor layout, he said. Likewise, Sidewalk and Intersection employees will sit side by side, he added.\u201cYou will walk in, and it will feel like it is one company,\u201d Mr. Doctoroff said. \u201cWe will try to create a feeling of being very forward-looking without appearing to be immature.\u201dScheduled to open in August, Sidewalk\u2019s new offices will be leased under a 10-year contract with Related, according to Related officials. When the lease is up, Coach, the luxury fashion house whose headquarters will also be at 10 Hudson Yards, will have the option to lease Sidewalk\u2019s two floors, if the company wants to expand, a Coach spokeswoman said.Coach, which also owns a stake in the building and has its own lobby there, will arrive in April, the spokeswoman said.Neither Related nor Sidewalk would disclose the financial terms of Sidewalk\u2019s deal. But real estate brokers who work in the area say that tenants at 10 Hudson Yards are paying about $70 to $80 a square foot.Mr. Doctoroff\u2019s lease represents the close of a chapter. With it, Related said, 10 Hudson Yards, which broke ground in 2012 as the first major new office tower in the neighborhood, is now fully occupied, with tenants like SAP, the software company; BCG, the consulting firm; and L\u2019Or\u00e9al, the cosmetics company. But getting there took a while.Most of the neighborhood was rezoned more than a decade ago, in 2005, and development was slow to take root, even when considering the effects of the recession. Despite progress since, walled-off sidewalks add to a work-in-progress vibe, and there are more cranes in the air than towers.Though the actual rezoned area covers about 45 blocks, which historically included a mix of tunnel ramps, stables and apartments, Related controls the bulk of the neighborhood, or a 28-acre parcel, most of which is over train tracks.\u201cPeople thought we were nuts, but we believed in what we were doing,\u201d said Stephen M. Ross, the chairman and founder of Related, which is itself relocating to the area. In 2019, it will move to 30 Hudson Yards, in a nine-floor, 250,000-square-foot berth, from the Time Warner Center in Midtown. \u201cI think the vision we have for Hudson Yards is that this will become the new heart of New York City,\u201d Mr. Ross added.While Related\u2019s expansive project is in many ways the area\u2019s centerpiece, it\u2019s hardly alone.Also taking shape is Manhattan West, a five-acre, seven-million-square-foot mixed-use complex from Brookfield Property Partners that is suspended over tracks as well. Its first tower, a 62-story rental with 844 apartments, will open in 2017.But at Hudson Yards, Mr. Doctoroff\u2019s plan for a stadium, which would have hosted track and field events and also have been home to the New York Jets football team, ran into considerable opposition. Some critics were worried about game-day traffic, while others were unhappy that public money would go to a facility used only sporadically. Under pressure, the state\u2019s Public Authorities Control Board denied the plan in 2005.Along the way, Mr. Doctoroff attracted his share of critics, who say his pro-development policies worsened the city\u2019s rich-poor divide.Ron Shiffman, an urban planner who served on the city\u2019s Planning Commission, said that eliminating industrial zones hurt start-ups involved with manufacturing. Offices for white-collar workers and shops selling luxury goods won\u2019t benefit the middle class, Mr. Shiffman added.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say he was a malevolent individual, far from it,\u201d Mr. Shiffman said of Mr. Doctoroff. \u201cI just don\u2019t think he was sensitive enough or had experience enough with what was happening in other parts of the city.\u201dWhile it may take years for the neighborhood to fulfill its promise of tens of millions of square feet of office space, millions of square feet of hotels and stores, and tens of thousands of new apartments, the city could reap rewards sooner, Mr. Doctoroff said.Indeed, based solely on buildings that are finished, will be soon or are in the planning stages, Hudson Yards could generate $30 billion in tax revenue over the next three decades, Mr. Doctoroff said, adding in ever-optimistic terms, that \u201cthe West Side is New York\u2019s future.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Jean Dubuffet, the Art Brut Founder, a Gallery Show", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Supported byInside ArtJean Dubuffet is not necessarily the hottest artist around; in fact, his colorful oil painting \u201cCote Chipote\u201d failed to sell at Christie\u2019s in November, despite a relatively low estimate of $9 million to $12 million.But the artist and sculptor, who died in 1985, remains one of the most important postwar artists of the 20th century \u2014 often grouped with Giacometti and Bacon \u2014 and is perhaps best known for founding Art Brut, an early outsider art movement.Now the Acquavella Gallery has decided to devote both floors of its Upper East Side townhouse \u2014 as well as a hardcover catalog \u2014 to a monographic show on Dubuffet that will open April 15.\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t realize how good he is,\u201d said Mark Rosenthal, an independent curator who is organizing the show. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping this will change that.\u201d\u201cEvery curator\u2019s interested in who\u2019s not being looked at, who ought to be looked at,\u201d added Mr. Rosenthal, who has served as head of 20th-century art at the National Gallery in Washington and at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.Featuring Dubuffet\u2019s work between 1943 and 1959, the show includes loans from private collections as well as museums like the Met, the Museum of Modern Art and the Guggenheim.The gallery has mounted shows on other 20th-century artists \u2014 Picasso, Matisse, Mir\u00f3, L\u00e9ger \u2014 but never Dubuffet, though it has sold close to 100 of his pieces.\u201cThe moment is so right for Dubuffet,\u201d said Nicholas Acquavella, an owner of the gallery. \u201cWe will see so many young artists with their jaws dropped to see stuff they\u2019ve only seen in textbooks. He\u2019s so relevant to what\u2019s happening today.\u201dDubuffet was famous for his materiality \u2014 where Rauschenberg worked with trash, Dubuffet used earth.\u201cHe\u2019s the opposite of an artist who settled on a technique,\u201d Mr. Acquavella said. \u201cHe was constantly recreating the process.\u201dSit with the artist N. Dash in her studio in Long Island City, Queens, and you\u2019ll notice that she is constantly worrying a tiny piece of cloth in her hand, working over the fabric with her fingers.This is not a nervous habit; this is her art.For 15 years, Ms. Dash, 35, has photographed fabric sculptures made of cotton swatches that she carries around \u2014 \u201cwhat people use to buff their cars\u201d \u2014 until the pieces resemble scraps from a baby blanket a child could not bear to surrender.\u201cI think of it as an alternative recording device, where the body has the capacity to register information through touch onto the material,\u201d she said. \u201cIt prioritizes physical experience and is outside of language.\u201dMs. Dash then arranges the weathered scraps in various configurations and photographs them in her studio. Now some of those works, along with her paintings, will be on view at the Casey Kaplan gallery on West 27th Street in Chelsea starting on May 3.Her paintings are composed of adobe earth that she brings back from New Mexico \u2014 where she lived for a time \u2014 sifting debris from the dirt to make her own paint.Ms. Dash always carries the fabric with her \u2014 three pieces at a time in different stages of deterioration.\u201cI stop working on each one when they can\u2019t handle the wear anymore and will simply disintegrate,\u201d she said.\u201cWords can be limiting,\u201d Ms. Dash continued. \u201cThis is one of the most effective ways in which I communicate.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my responsibility to make this work,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t question it.\u201dThe photography dealer James Danziger was doing a Google search when an image popped up by the artist Hans Breder.\u201cI came across his work completely by accident,\u201d Mr. Danziger said, \u201cand realized he was very much a missing piece of the puzzle between the nexus of photography and contemporary art.\u201dSo he went out to Iowa to meet with Mr. Breder, 80, and decided to make his work the opening show at his new gallery on Feb. 29; after 10 years in Chelsea, Mr. Danziger is moving to Rivington Street.\u201cThe Lower East Side is a vibrant, creative place where art has space to breathe,\u201d Mr. Danziger said. \u201cIt now feels to me like the best place to showcase new ideas.\u201dThe exhibition will focus on Mr. Breder\u2019s \u201cBody/Sculptures\u201d series from the late 1960s and early \u201970s, which used mirrors. Mr. Danziger selected them from boxes in Mr. Breder\u2019s attic.\u201cThey were as fresh as the day that they had been made and had not been seen before,\u201d Mr. Danziger said. \u201cI have yet to find someone in the photography world who knows who Hans Breder is, in spite of fact that he showed in three Whitney Biennials.\u201dMr. Breder is happy to be having his work seen in New York. \u201cI never thought of myself as a photographer,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cI just thought of it as a way to get my ideas across.\u201dThe Museum of Modern Art has acquired five significant works by black artists: William Henry Johnson\u2019s wood panel, \u201cThree Girls\u201d (1941); Chris Ofili\u2019s linen, \u201cThe Raising of Lazarus\u201d (2007); Kerry James Marshall\u2019s acrylic, \u201cUntitled (policeman)\u201d (2015); Mark Bradford\u2019s canvas, \u201cLet\u2019s Walk to the Middle of the Ocean\u201d (2015); and Kara Walker\u2019s charcoal, \u201c40 Acres of Mules\u201d (2015).\u201cThese acquisitions reflect our ongoing attention to strengthening the museum\u2019s holdings of works by black artists in all mediums,\u201d said Ann Temkin, MoMA\u2019s chief curator of painting and sculpture, \u201cand the institutional commitment to changing the constitution of the collection.\u201dMichael McGinnis, the former president of Phillips auction house, is becoming a partner at the Mnuchin Gallery, starting on March 1.

{"Headline": "Intel\u2019s Earnings Fall in Fourth Quarter, but Beat Expectations", "Date": "2016-01-14", "News": "Supported byA lot has changed in recent years. The PC market has been in a long, slow decline, and Intel does not have the same clout with companies that build smartphones, which are today\u2019s hottest gadgets.But even if some of its financial clout has waned, Intel\u2019s spending continues to be a key indicator of the health of the tech world. Intel is still \u2014 by a good stretch \u2014 the world\u2019s biggest semiconductor maker and perhaps the only company of its kind with the resources to keep improving chip technology.If computer chips do not continue to improve, the entire tech industry stalls. Semiconductors have leapt from computers and mobile phones to all sorts of devices, including cars, appliances and toys. They are increasingly connected to the fast-growing computer \u201cclouds\u201d of companies like Amazon and Google, which are powered by vast data centers of computer servers that mostly use Intel chips.Intel\u2019s financial results are a sort of proxy for growth in cloud-based services, said Thomas Kurian, the president of product development at Oracle, one of the world\u2019s largest software companies. \u201cIf they ship a lot, it means a huge growth in new cloud projects,\u201d he said.In quarterly earnings reported by Intel on Thursday, the company\u2019s revenue was up slightly from the same period last year, but money from data center chips was up markedly.Intel reported that its net income in the fourth quarter of 2015 fell 1 percent to $3.6 billion, or 74 cents a share, from the year-earlier quarter. The company said revenue climbed 1 percent, to $14.9 billion.The net income was above the expectations of Wall Street analysts. They had anticipated 63 cents a share on revenue of $14.8 billion, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters.For all of 2015, Intel revenue was $55.4 billion, down 1 percent from 2014. Net income was $11.4 billion, down 2 percent.Intel\u2019s share price was down about 4 percent in after-hours trading Thursday evening.No doubt, Intel\u2019s influence has changed in recent years.Intel still gets 59 percent of its revenue from chip sales to PC makers like HP Inc. and Dell, just as Microsoft and other makers of PC software count on the demand for new PCs to sell their products. Now PCs are a tough business: On Tuesday, the market research firm IDC said 276 million PCs were shipped worldwide in 2015, a drop of 10.4 percent from 2014.\u201cPCs don\u2019t matter as much as they used to,\u201d said Jay Chou, an analyst with IDC. \u201cThey\u2019re only part of the story that includes mobile devices and cloud computing.\u201dOn Thursday, Intel said data center chip sales, not just to clouds but to older kinds of computing, rose 4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015. Along with Intel\u2019s much smaller businesses in memory and sensor chips for devices, data center chips accounted for than 60 percent of the company\u2019s operating profit margin.Since the PC industry is sliding, using Intel as an indicator of the health of the rest of tech is not as easy as it used to be. Analysts say the number to watch now is Intel\u2019s investment in Moore\u2019s Law. Named for an Intel co-founder, Gordon Moore, that is the observation that computing power, figured in the density of transistors on a chip, tends to double every 18 to 24 months. That effectively means that $2 of computing power today will cost $1 in 2018.Keeping up with Moore\u2019s Law is increasingly expensive. In 2001 research and development, along with marketing and sales, cost Intel about $8 billion. In 2015, Intel said Thursday, it cost $20.1 billion.As a percentage of revenue, the number has crept up too, and on both counts it is at a cost few companies could manage. Besides Intel, which develops new chips ahead of everyone, the last big semiconductor makers are GlobalFoundries, Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. Each has to invest billions to stay in the game.\u201cIntel can decide if Moore\u2019s Law is 18 or 24 or 36 months long,\u201d said Amit Daryanani, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets.Last year, Intel scared many technologists when it announced that a critical next step in delivering on Moore\u2019s Law would happen about a year later than expected. The company has since released numerous charts showing this was a temporary blip.If it was more than a blip, developers of those self-driving cars, connected drones and other new devices will also struggle to make improvements.Relax, said Stacy Smith, the chief financial officer of Intel.\u201cMoore\u2019s Law is the heartbeat of our company,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the core of our competitive advantage.\u201dIndeed, Intel\u2019s corporate identity is wrapped up in this concept of ever-improving chips.\u201cThey can\u2019t risk not being seen as the leading engineering company,\u201d Mr. Daryanani said. \u201cThe beauty of this thing is that this way, they are in control of their own destiny, and not a lot of tech companies can say that.\u201dAnd if that costs billions, so be it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook to Shut Down Parse, Its Platform for Mobile Developers", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Most of what Parse does involves things most people will never see. Parse helps developers with support and tools, so that independent programmers can spend more time writing code and less time on keeping up the back end. Developers who use Parse include those at Quip, a productivity app, and Expedia\u2019s Orbitz, a travel website. Facebook would make money from Parse by storing data from developers and sending customers product notifications.Achieving that goal, however, would be no easy feat. Microsoft, Google and Amazon have similar developer offerings, along with a much richer set of other computing tools and services that developers need. Amazon Web Services, in particular, has in the past two years stressed both its developer tools and analytic services, so companies can think about what to build next. In every case, these companies can also benefit by selling other computing services, like complex commercial databases, which Facebook does not provide.Parse seemed like a good opportunity for expansion. At the time, Internet businesses were in the midst of a major industry change, as users were shifting away from desktop computing and increasingly relying on mobile devices. Parse, the thinking went, could provide Facebook the opportunity to be the foundation of a whole new generation of developers building mobile apps in the age of the smartphone.Facebook also would have had to invest untold millions of dollars in capital and, more importantly, engineering talent, to get the Parse business fully off the ground to have a better chance at making a dent in competitors like Amazon, Microsoft and Google.Moreover, Facebook has already made two big, risky bets in Oculus, the virtual reality platform, and WhatsApp, the messaging service. Neither service currently generates material revenue for Facebook.Parse may have touched millions of people through the apps that developers built there, but that mattered little against Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s size. With more than 1.5 billion registered users, a population of even 15 million customers is not 1 percent of Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s audience. Building up Parse, it seems, eventually became more of a distraction than it was worth.\u201cMoving forward we want to dedicate more resources to high-impact products and services in areas like analytics, monetization, discovery, and authentication,\u201d Michael Kirkland, a Facebook spokesman, said in a statement. \u201cAs a result, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made the difficult decision to wind down support for Parse.\u201dOther Silicon Valley companies have encountered similar difficulties. Inside Cisco Systems, in its heyday, there was pressure to build businesses that yielded $1 billion or more in revenue, since anything less could not affect the overall company. Facebook, which unlike other clouds has not sought to rent computing and software to businesses, must essentially find this from social networking.Developers who used Parse will have a set of tools and a year-long window to be able to migrate their data off of the platform to other services.\u201cWe\u2019re proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished together with the Parse community, and we thank them for their support,\u201d Mr. Kirkland said.FollowAdvertisement"}

It did not give updated estimates on drone sales on Wednesday, nor did it say how many users may not be registered yet.But at a news conference at the International CES in Las Vegas, Michael Huerta, the agency\u2019s administrator, indicated that many users had not registered their drones and said he recognized the difficulty in informing the public about the requirement. The Consumer Technology Association said at the news conference that it expected 1 million recreational drones to be sold in 2016.\u201cNow that we have set up the registration system, our challenge is to make sure everyone is aware of the requirement and registers,\u201d Mr. Huerta said. Recreational users who do not register can face penalties of as much as $27,500.Charged by Congress in 2012 to come up with first-time rules for the then-nascent drone industry, the F.A.A. had struggled with the order even as sales of drones soared and reports of crashes and near-misses with airplanes grew. Lax federal rules have prompted many cities and states to come up with stronger rules that have spurred clashes with the federal agency.Companies have clamored for permission to use drones for activities like land inspections, wedding photography and package deliveries.\u201cA lot of our recent public focus has been on recreational drones, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also been working on a rule that will allow routine, safe commercial and other nonhobby operations of small unmanned aircraft,\u201d Mr. Huerta said.FollowAdvertisement"}

Tell us how you teach it. ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS: Tackle Shakespeare With Yoda, You WillIn \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Empire Strikes Back,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Yoda admonishes his apprentice, Luke Skywalker, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWars not make one great.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Later, in \u00e2\u0080\u009cReturn of the Jedi,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he quips, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen 900 years old you reach, look as good you will not.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In case you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t catch on, Yoda inverts his syntax. In other words, Yoda practically speaks Shakespearean.Taking inspiration from Yoda and Mr. Doescher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mash-ups, students can try \u201cShakespearifying\u201d scenes from the \u201cStar Wars\u201d franchise \u2014 or from other popular films or TV shows.HISTORY: Finding Echoes of the Past in FictionThe events in \u00e2\u0080\u009cStar Wars,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the opening credits reveal, happened \u00e2\u0080\u009ca long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But did similar events happen before?That is the question posed by \u00e2\u0080\u009cStar Wars and History.\u201dBut, even without knowing or trying to guess Mr. Lucas\u2019s inspiration, students can apply their knowledge of history to make connections between the fictional universe in \u201cStar Wars\u201d and actual past events. SCIENCE: The Physics of Space BattlesShoer, a Ph.D. candidate in aerospace engineering, says any real space battles would likely have \u00e2\u0080\u0094 yawn \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00e2\u0080\u009crelatively long periods during which Newtonian physics govern the motions of dogfighting spacecraft, punctuated by relatively short periods of maneuvering.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because spacecraft typically are sharply curtailed by the realities of propulsion and orbit dynamics \u00e2\u0080\u0093 \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot just of their own ships in orbit around planets and suns, but those planets\u00e2\u0080\u0099 orbits.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Of course, special effects in movies are designed to be dramatic. But to what extent do they defy physics?Have students watch almost any battle scene in \u201cStar Wars\u201d and consider: Are the laws of physics being bent or ignored? How might reality differ from the fantasy depicted?MATH: Creating Fractal IslandsTo incorporate math into this activity, students can generate fractal islands to represent a planet\u2019s continents \u2014 a hands-on activity adapted from Dr. Chartier\u2019s book \u201cMath Bytes: Google Bombs, Chocolate-Covered Pi, and Other Cool Bits in Computing.\u201d  Students can make these continents by hand using a pencil, paper and two dice. (We will assume one die is red and the other blue, although you could just roll twice.)  To start, begin with a square. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s endpoints are at (0,0), (0,16), (16,0) and (16,16). Now, follow these steps, for each of the four line segments:Here are different shapes generated by this activity:Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t imagine these shapes appearing as masses of land on distant planets? To add sophistication to the end product, students can use a computer.  As they iterate, students are creating a fractal island \u2014 or a newly revealed continent on a distant planet in a galaxy far, far away. ECONOMICS: The Death Star, Too Big to Fail?At the end of \u00e2\u0080\u009cStar Wars: Episode VI \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Return of the Jedi,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the heroic Rebel Alliance defeats the evil Galactic Empire, destroying the second Death Star, the empire\u00e2\u0080\u0099s central space station (and superweapon). Audiences typically respond to the destruction of the Death Star with triumphant cheers.But over the years, a number of perhaps more reflective fans have paused to question the consequences of this event. In his movie \u00e2\u0080\u009cClerks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d for example, the writer and director Kevin Smith has his protagonists debate the ethics of destroying the second Death Star, whose construction was still underway, given the collateral damage to the contractors (\u00e2\u0080\u009cplumbers, aluminum siders, roofers\u00e2\u0080\u009d) building it.As a financial engineer, I have another concern: the economic repercussions for the \u00e2\u0080\u009cStar Wars\u00e2\u0080\u009d galaxy. In a recent working paper, I brought the analysis of financial systemic risk to bear on this question. I found that the resulting financial crisis would cause a serious galactic depression of astronomical proportions \u00e2\u0080\u0094 so large, in fact, that it suggests the rebel victory might have been a pyrrhic one.Students can read through Dr. Feinstein\u2019s economic analysis and offer their critique. Do they accept his assumptions? Does his conclusion make sense? And, does his \u201cStar Wars\u201d investigation help to make the case for continuing to study how to model financial contagion and measure systemic risk?ART: Take a Selfie, Create a New \u201cStar Wars\u201d CharacterStudents might be surprised to learn that the character Yoda was essentially modeled after its creator\u2019s own face. Stuart Freeborn built his reputation by staring deep into the faces of others, defining their best features and digging into his makeup kit to make sure everyone else noticed them, too. He learned how to accentuate a cheekbone from none other than Marlene Dietrich. The arch in Vivien Leigh\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyebrow owed some of its impish charm to him. But decades into his career, when George Lucas asked him to create a centuries-old Jedi master, Freeborn took a long look at a face that he had never considered with much professional interest: His own. The character of Yoda would become a fun-house distortion of Freeborn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own reflection.The article continues:In the mirror, Freeborn could examine the contours of the crown of his skull, fully exposed by a hairline that completed a retreat years before. Freeborn etched deep wrinkles into Yoda\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bald scalp that were exaggerated replicas of the lines that creased his own forehead when, for example, he zeroed in on the tight-focus particulars of Yoda\u00e2\u0080\u0099s physiognomy. The pointed chin, the compact nose and the thin, pursed lips all made the leap from the mirror to the model. The only feature he borrowed from someone else was the upper lip: It was a hairless version of Albert Einstein\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, Freeborn said. He hoped that it might trigger a subconscious association and that viewers might intuit Yoda\u00e2\u0080\u0099s extraordinary intelligence.Inspired by Mr. Freeborn\u2019s creation, students can design their own \u201cfun-house distortion\u201d of their reflection or selfie. Together, the class can assemble a new cast of characters for the not-yet-released \u201cStar Wars\u201d films.JOURNALISM: \u201cStar Wars\u201d in The New York TimesHere are but a few.

{"Headline": "F.C.C. Proposes Changes in Cable Set-Top Box Market", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The cable set-top box, long a scourge of consumers and a moneymaker for cable companies, appears set for a makeover.The move could have broad implications for the industry, allowing Google, Amazon and Apple, for instance, to expand their footprints in the media industry with devices that would blend Internet and cable programming in a way the television industry has resisted. The reactions on Wednesday reflected those possibilities: The technology industry widely cheered the proposal, while the cable industry criticized it.The F.C.C., though, said its focus was on improving people\u2019s television experience. The clunky technology of cable boxes, and the burdensome requirements of long-term contracts, have long been a source of customer complaints. Tech companies like Apple and Amazon make devices that connect to televisions and have new interfaces, but they provide streaming Internet video and do not replace the cable box.The F.C.C. said the agency\u2019s five commissioners would vote on the proposal on Feb. 18. The proposal will most likely have the support of the three Democratic commissioners, including Mr. Wheeler, and will be opposed by the two Republican commissioners.Tech companies have pushed a vision of TV viewing that would look and feel more like a smartphone interaction, with users selecting and using apps rather than scrolling through hundreds of channels on cable TV. Netflix and Amazon have also challenged the industry head-on, offering original programming and streaming-video packages that have led consumers to cut their cable subscriptions all together.The proposed rule would require cable and satellite providers to give device makers access to cable and satellite programming. While that is possible today, cable and satellite companies often impose restrictions on third-party device makers. As a result, there has been a virtual lock on the set-top box market by cable and satellite companies, with 99 percent of their users leasing one or more boxes from them.\u201cConsumer choice should fuel the video box market, not cable company control,\u201d Senator Markey said on Wednesday. \u201cI commend Chairman Wheeler for his proposal to help ensure that consumers are not captive to bloated rental fees forever.\u201dSenior officials at the agency said the plan would not affect contracts between cable and media companies. Consumers would still have to pay their satellite and cable provider for their programming. The cable bundle, in which people pay for dozens or hundreds of stations or none at all, is expected to remain in place.Still, media executives expressed concern that the change could undermine the foundation of their businesses. The concern is that the new arrangement could negate contracts between cable companies and entertainment companies, in which the cable companies pay television groups billions of dollars a year for the rights to distribute programming. Those contracts stipulate how the programming can be distributed, for instance, whether it is included in video-on-demand packages, how it is branded, certain copyright protections and the treatment of advertising.The executives said the proposal could allow a new set of companies, like Google or Apple, to step in to distribute and sell ads in and around television programming that they neither paid to create, or license. A set-top box can control the flow of data on users\u2019 viewing habits, the sort of information that is at the heart of Google\u2019s business.\u201cDistributors will be forced to reconsider what they pay for programs that can be siphoned off, repackaged and resold, drying up the revenue needed to underwrite quality shows,\u201d said Alfred C. Liggins, the chief executive of TV One, a digital cable and satellite network that serves 57 million households. \u201cThese arrangements \u2014 including critical terms such as channel placement, advertising, scheduling and more \u2014 are the lifeblood of the video marketplace today.\u201dAt the same time, television networks like HBO, Showtime and CBS have introduced a range of \u00e0 la carte offerings that allow people to subscribe to an individual network without paying for the full cable bundle.Efforts to hand over programming to tech firms would \u201cslam the brakes on this progress and harm consumers,\u201d Nomi Bergman, president of Bright House Networks, said. \u201cIt\u2019s the ultimate example of the government trying to fix something that isn\u2019t broken.\u201dTrade groups representing Google, Amazon and TiVo say the set-top-box industry would inject fresh competition into the TV market, leading to more options and lower prices for consumers. Mr. Wheeler, who has favored rules that support streaming-video providers, is expected to act with haste to make sure the rules are adopted before he leaves his job. His term could end next year. If approved, consumers will most immediately see its effects in their pocketbooks, advocates say. They could start using just one device to access video content \u2014 whether it be Internet streaming or cable television.Marta Tellado, president and chief executive of Consumer Reports, said the changes were long overdue.\u201cWith the ever-increasing price of cable and all of the advances in technology,\u201d she said, \u201cwhy should consumers have to keep renting a set-top box?\u201dCecilia Kang reported from Washington, and Emily Steel from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Looking Beyond the Internet of Things", "Date": "2016-01-01", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 If you have sent email on Google or used Microsoft\u2019s browser or databases, you have touched the technology handiwork of Adam Bosworth.Mr. Bosworth, a tall and grizzled but still trim 60-year-old, is a Johnny Appleseed of sorts in the tech industry, with a penchant for being intimately involved in the creation of generations of widely used technology.While it is never easy to predict what the next big thing will be, identifying what Mr. Bosworth is working on is always good for clues. Right now, along with competitors at companies like Amazon and Google, he is building what some call a \u201cdata singularity.\u201dAll those devices and sensors would also wirelessly connect to far-off data centers, where millions of computer servers manage and learn from all that information.Those servers would then send back commands to help whatever the sensors are connected to operate more effectively: A home automatically turns up the heat ahead of cold weather moving in, or streetlights behave differently when traffic gets bad. Or imagine an insurance company instantly resolving who has to pay for what an instant after a fender-bender because it has been automatically fed information about the accident.Think of it as one, enormous process in which machines gather information, learn and change based on what they learn. All in seconds.It is lofty language, no doubt, but he and others believe they are on the brink of one of the next big shifts in computing, perhaps as big as the web browser or the personal computer.But building an automated system that can react to all that data like a thoughtful person is fiendishly hard \u2014 and that may be Mr. Bosworth\u2019s last great challenge to solve.It is difficult to say just how big this business could be, but there are two good indicators: Analysts at Gartner estimate that by 2019 retail cloud computing \u2014 the data center side of the equation Mr. Bosworth is working on \u2014 will double in size, to $314 billion. The sensors on objects will be a $2.6 trillion business, an increase of 250 percent, Gartner estimates.Mr. Bosworth went to Harvard with Bill Gates, where he took just one class in computers while studying Asian history. He nonetheless landed a job on Wall Street, where he persuaded his bosses to give him $1 million for minicomputers \u2014 the cutting edge of computing before personal computers \u2014 that could deliver the first instant reports on how business was doing.He got interested in tech\u2019s next big thing, PCs, and wrote an early spreadsheet program. He joined Microsoft in 1989. His first years there were spent on databases, but as the Internet got big he helped turn browsers from software that looks up web pages to software that interacts with the web.He and Mr. Gates repeatedly argued over the importance of the Internet, according to people there at the time. Mr. Gates may also have goaded Mr. Bosworth, knowing he is the sort who does not like to be told something is not possible.\u201cHe sees out into the future, but not too far that you can\u2019t build something,\u201d said Brad Silverberg, a Seattle venture capitalist who has known Mr. Bosworth since 1981 and was his boss at Microsoft. \u201cIf you want to make sure something gets done, tell him not to do it.\u201dThe son of a demanding private school headmaster, Mr. Bosworth also clashed with Larry Page, Google\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, while working there on interactive software and a failed effort to build online health services.\u201cWe had styles that weren\u2019t synergistic,\u201d said Mr. Bosworth. \u201cHe looks intensively at massive amounts of data-gathering, and assumes he\u2019ll be able to do something with it using math. I was focused on getting people to communicate with other people.\u201dMarc Benioff, the chief executive at Salesforce and a friend of Mr. Bosworth, asked him to look at the technology being used at the San Francisco company, which was founded in 1999 and was one of the first to use cloud computing technology.Over lunch a few months later, Mr. Bosworth told Mr. Benioff that his once-revolutionary company was in peril.\u201cComputers are 50 times faster than when Salesforce started,\u201d he said. \u201cI told Marc, \u2018There is a whole new technology that is going to overtake you, the way the web overtook Microsoft.\u2019\u201dThat technology \u2014 the data singularity \u2014 is what Mr. Bosworth is now working on at Salesforce.If he is right, this new era in computing will have effects far beyond a little more efficiency. Consumers could see a vast increase in the number of services, ads and product upgrades that are sold alongside most goods. And products that respond to their owner\u2019s tastes \u2014 something already seen in smartphone upgrades, connected cars from BMW or Tesla, or entertainment devices like the Amazon Echo \u2014 could change product design.Analysts foresee a scramble to own and manage these systems and their data, and ever more power accruing to just a few companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft, which already have the global computing systems and reach to make it happen.Few outfits have the engineering talent to manage this sort of thing. One year after starting the business, for example, Microsoft\u2019s cloud handles a trillion sensor messages a week.Salesforce, which is worth $54 billion, is an underdog compared to that tiny group of tech behemoths. It lacks global data centers, but does control important data, like information about what customers are buying.Who will ultimately control that data, from the sensors to the cloud and back, is one of the most contentious questions in tech.\u201cYou\u2019ve got Amazon knowing everything about purchasing, Google knowing everything about what people do on the Internet, and Salesforce knowing everything about the revenue side of a business,\u201d said Scott Raney, a venture capitalist at Redpoint Ventures who invests in companies related to what Mr. Bosworth is working on.\u201cLay computer processing on all that, and it\u2019s powerful to a point where a little creepiness sets in; no one else will have the data,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m buying the stock of all the companies. I just hope they\u2019ll be benevolent dictators.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Georgia Town Teaches \u2018Fight Back\u2019 as Option in Mass Shootings", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byDOUGLASVILLE, Ga. \u2014 When the police held town hall meetings here in the past, they were lucky to see a half-dozen people. But the topic of the most recent one was \u201cActive Shooter: A Citizen\u2019s Guide to Planning for Survival.\u201d And the place was packed.Chief Gary Sparks, an Army veteran with 29 years on the police force, set the mood with an opening chat that was part folksy pep talk and part pragmatic self-defense lecture. The world has changed, he told the crowd: Google the floor plans of stadiums and concert sites before going to them. Study the layout of your grocery store. Make a note of places to make a quick exit or to hide. And be ready to pounce, if you must, with maximum aggression.\u201cYou can\u2019t go out here and not have a mind-set to win the fight,\u201d Chief Sparks said. \u201cCan\u2019t go around here with no sheepish-type mind-set. There ain\u2019t no sheep dogs. Everybody in Douglasville, we tigers, lions, bears, elephants, whatever you want to be.\u201dHeld one night during the week after Christmas, the Douglasville meeting attracted about 80 people: worried retirees, worried office workers, worried teachers and parents, and a worried 21-year-old in a heavy metal T-shirt, Chris Wallace, who said he felt particularly exposed in crowded public places. He was thinking about applying for a concealed carry permit.\u201cYou can never be too safe,\u201d he said.Over the course of 90 minutes, the police encouraged them to adopt a view of the world that was, in essence, the default view of police officers: Keep your head on a swivel. Constantly triage potential threats. Incessantly toggle through angles of escape and plans of attack.The police screened a video in which a fictional gunman clad in black blasted away at fictional white-collar employees during their mundane workday. \u201cThe authorities are working hard to protect you and to protect our public spaces,\u201d the baritone narration went. \u201cBut sometimes bad people do bad things.\u201d The workers were shown running, hiding and, in the end, attacking the gunman as he barged through a door.While the odds of an American being involved in an active-shooter event remain extremely slim, a 2014 F.B.I. study showed that about 11 such shootings occurred each year on average between 2000 and 2013, with the frequency increasing.Public safety officials have long recommended that people evacuate or hide in \u201clockdown\u201d during attacks, but in the last couple of years officials have also widely accepted fighting back as a last resort. The idea of proactive self-defense was embraced wholeheartedly in Douglasville, a suburban city of 32,000 just west of Atlanta. Danine Mezzell, 57, said she came to the meeting here after sitting in the local mall during the heart of the holiday shopping season wondering how she would survive an attack without her handguns, which she has a permit to carry but which the mall prohibited her from bringing.\u201cI was like, \u2018Wow, we\u2019re just sitting ducks here,\u2019\u201d she recalled.Bennie J. Amey, 50, a gospel musician and informational technology worker, said he was glad that the police were emphasizing an aggressive response. He hoped that domestic and foreign terrorists would get the message that Americans \u201care people who fight.\u201dAbout halfway through the meeting, the officers showed a second video in which an instructor from ACT Cert, a private \u201cattack countermeasures training\u201d company, told a group of college students how to increase their chances of survival if a gunman broke into their classroom. In the video, many of the students moved out of what the instructor called the \u201ckill zone\u201d: the gunman\u2019s initial view of the room. Some of them gathered on either side of the door. When a man pretending to be the attacker entered the room, they pounced on him, grabbing his forearms and wrestling him to the floor.A question-and-answer session followed the video. Kimberly Fugate, 49, a middle school Spanish teacher, said that her public school had a lockdown plan, and that she had told her students to hide and be quiet if there were an attack. \u201cWhat else can I do?\u201d she asked.The chief said that if the opportunity presented itself, she could \u201cjab that guy in his eyeball\u201d with a pencil. \u201cYou bite his nose off.\u201d The students, he said, could kick the attacker while he was down \u201cwith a hundred little feets.\u201dMore guns were sold in December than almost any other month in nearly two decades after President Obama called for new gun-buying restrictions.The crowd laughed, but some safety experts consider such advice dangerous. \u201cIt requires a lot of judgment in terms of whether to fight or not,\u201d David Esquith, the director of the federal Department of Education\u2019s safety office, said in an interview. \u201cAnd this is a judgment that only an adult can make.\u201dAt the meeting in Douglasville, however, the mood had turned cathartic as people discussed self-defense scenarios. A man in a leather jacket asked how a legally armed person who shot an intruder should act once the police arrived: \u201cBecause I don\u2019t want to get shot,\u201d he said.Capt. Brad Stafford told him that he should, in that scenario, put his gun down and place his hands on his head.A man said that his daughter-in-law, a teacher, had complied with the no-weapons rule at her school. But he said that she just happened to keep a claw hammer and a screwdriver with her at all times.\u201cYou never know when she needs to install something,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that girl from the Bronx would turn you into hamburger.\u201dJulie Turkewitz contributed reporting from Denver.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Where Wearable Technology Ends Up (Hint: Not Your Wrist)", "Date": "2016-01-20", "News": "Supported byDisruptionsThe junk drawer in my home used to look just like yours, filled with loose change, batteries and birthday candles. But over the last year, a new category of junk has started to accumulate there: wearable devices.There\u2019s my old Fitbit, a fitness tracker I used for a couple of weeks, forgot to charge and never wore again. It sits next to a dusty Jawbone UP, another tracker that once told me I had walked three miles while I sat on my couch eating popcorn and watching a movie. And then there\u2019s the Apple Watch, the much-hyped device that was supposed to usher in a new era of mobile computing.Instead, these gadgets are ending up in drawers and closets as expensive reminders of how wearable gadgets are not ready for prime time \u2014 at least for the foreseeable future.Like others, I once believed that wearables were going to change the way we live. In much the way that smartphones put the Internet into our pockets, wearable devices were going to place information that much closer to our fingertips, and make us healthier and less dependent on our smartphones.And yet. ...For those products still on store shelves, it\u2019s been tough going.Still, some analysts remain bullish on wearables, though they have been forced to reassess some of the timing of their earlier forecasts. For example, the technology research firm IDC once predicted that smartwatches would become a mainstream product by 2018.\u201cWe recently revised our estimate because we don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen anymore,\u201d said Jitesh Ubrani, the senior research analyst for mobile devices at IDC. \u201cBasically, we don\u2019t see this happening until at least 2019.\u201dThe trade show was full of booths offering sensor-laden clothing, watches and goggles that failed to generate much interest. They were joined by more esoteric products, like smart bras, intelligent shirts, heated sneakers and more wristbands than a Chuck E. Cheese.So why have all these gadgets failed to gain traction? First, almost all of them require a smartphone to be fully operational, so instead of replacing our mobile phone, a wearable becomes yet another gadget that we need to lug around.There\u2019s also the fact that most of these devices are quite ugly. While male nerds may not mind their design, women don\u2019t seem as interested in wearing a fax machine on their wrist, even if it\u2019s painted rose gold or comes with a fancy leather strap.But the biggest issue of all may be price.Mr. Ubrani of IDC said that consumers can\u2019t justify buying a smartwatch that costs nearly as much as a smartphone.\u201cA lot of consumers have tried out smartwatches, and they don\u2019t see the need for them right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is mainly because they only offer notifications for your smartphone. And more importantly, you\u2019re paying the same price for a smartphone.\u201dSo for the next few years, I\u2019m skipping new wearable devices that come on the market. I have no choice.

{"Headline": "A.I.G. Opts for Streamlining, Spurning Calls for a Breakup", "Date": "2016-01-26", "News": "Supported byThe insurance giant, which became the starkest example of \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d when it had to be rescued by the government during the financial crisis, is now trying to streamline itself to be more profitable and to fend off activist investors who are calling for it to be broken in three.After pressure from those activists mounted for months, A.I.G. announced a strategic shift on Tuesday that stopped well short of an outright breakup. Instead, the company will offer part of its mortgage insurance unit in an initial public offering, sell its financial advisory business and create nine distinct operations in its commercial and consumer divisions that could pave the way for future sales or spinoffs.The company plans to spend $25 billion on stock buybacks and dividends over two years, and to cut $1.6 billion from operating costs. It shored up its loss reserves by another $3.6 billion.\u201cNow is not the time to be shortsighted and simply react to the demands of those who challenge us,\u201d Mr. Hancock said in a memo to employees on Tuesday. He later told analysts during a presentation that the SIFI designation \u201cmay be issue number 15\u201d on a long list of strategic issues that A.I.G. faces.Whether Tuesday\u2019s strategic announcements will win over the activist shareholders remains to be seen. And Mr. Hancock did not entirely slam the door shut on further divestments.\u201cThere are no sacred cows,\u201d he said.Still, the executive is taking a different approach than others like MetLife, which earlier this month announced plans to separate its United States retail operations to get them out from under the SIFI label. MetLife, which is also suing regulators over the designation, has said that the split will allow the businesses to compete more effectively with smaller companies that are not subject to the extra regulation and capital requirements that being a SIFI brings. General Electric is selling off its GE Capital unit piecemeal to escape the designation as well.Shares of A.I.G. closed up 1 percent on Tuesday.A former JPMorgan executive, Mr. Hancock joined A.I.G. in 2010, as the company was trying to recover from the financial crisis and its $185 billion government bailout. He took over as chief executive in September 2014, replacing Robert Benmosche, who died last year.To repay the government, A.I.G. sold dozens of businesses and other assets, halving its size and narrowing its focus, though activist investors said it still was not focused enough.But in that process, A.I.G. evolved into a company that had lower risk, fewer assets and less short-term borrowing compared with other SIFI companies like Prudential and MetLife, Mr. Hancock told analysts on Tuesday.That suggests he thinks that A.I.G. already holds enough capital to comply with whatever levels regulators will ultimately set. The regulations have yet to be written.\u201cWe had to deal up front with these issues,\u201d Mr. Hancock said. \u201cSo we managed to get a jump on the whole process.\u201dMr. Icahn, who said in November that he owned 42 million shares of A.I.G., did not respond to requests for comment. Still, he has made his impatience known. He could start a proxy fight to secure a board seat and make additional management changes.Mr. Icahn has increased the pressure since then.\u201cWe believe the current situation is too time-sensitive to even wait until the company\u2019s next annual meeting next spring,\u201d he wrote in November. \u201cManagement has been either purposefully misleading in their public disclosures or is negligently uninformed regarding the feasibility\u201d of a breakup plan, he said in another letter last week.For Mr. Icahn, the financial stakes of a successful outcome at A.I.G. are high. Despite successes such as Time Warner and eBay, his more recent investments, especially in energy, have faltered.He has argued that A.I.G. could extract more value for shareholders by splitting its life insurance operations entirely from its property and casualty business, which contributed 41 percent of operating revenue through the third quarter of last year. Companies focused on a single line of business, he says, generate better returns and have higher market values.The company says its annual cost of being a SIFI is $130 million versus the $1.3 billion tax benefit it gets from holding life insurance and property insurance together in the same company, making diversification, at least for now, more attractive.\u201cWe\u2019re absolutely open to additional divestitures beyond what we\u2019ve talked about even of our largest units,\u201d Mr. Hancock told analysts on Tuesday. \u201cBut you don\u2019t make a decision of that scale without thinking very hard about the impact on tax and on our financial strength.\u201dAs for the details of the plan announced on Tuesday, A.I.G. will have an I.P.O. for 19.9 percent of United Guaranty by midyear, with the eventual goal of full separation. It is selling A.I.G. Advisory Group, with 5,200 independent advisers and 800 employees, for an undisclosed amount to Lightyear Capital and the Canadian pension investment manager PSP Investments. It is also moving underperforming older assets into a new \u201clegacy\u201d business to be run by Charlie Shamieh, who has led the life, health and disability insurance business. The legacy business will have $22 billion of equity and will aim to sell or wind down the businesses in the portfolio over time.Breaking down the remaining operations into clear divisions, or \u201cmodules\u201d \u2014 Mr. Hancock referred to a similar action by Google Inc. \u2014 is supposed to make it easier for investors to analyze whether the individual businesses are performing up to snuff.\u201cManagement should be prepared for and willing to listen to investor comments about selling more of those modules,\u201d two Citigroup analysts, Todd Bault and Erik Bass, wrote in a note on Tuesday.Advertisement"}

What seems like a permanent revolution among Twitter\u2019s senior ranks hasn\u2019t done any favors for the $12 billion media business. With the stock trading below its initial public offering price and Mr. Dorsey a part-time chief executive who also runs the payments company Square, the danger is that the company becomes aimless.The departing leaders include the head of product, of which there have been at least five since 2010, including a stint by Mr. Dorsey. His reinsertion as chief executive last year was the most prominent turn of the revolving door. He had led the company when it was a start-up, but wasn\u2019t an obvious choice to return because running a troubled yet fast-growing public company would normally be a full-time job. As well as bringing Mr. Dorsey back, Twitter has replaced its finance boss, chief operating officer and head of engineering since the company filed to go public in the summer of 2013.Revenue at the microblogging company is growing fast, increasing more than 50 percent annually. Yet the company is in the red, losing $430 million in the first nine months of last year. Adding more users may solve this problem, which is why Twitter spends heavily to develop new products. But the constant churn at the top must make it hard for the company\u2019s engineers to plan what they are doing.Add Twitter\u2019s market meltdown \u2014 the company\u2019s stock now trades about a third below where it went public in 2013 \u2014 and Mr. Dorsey\u2019s creation looks vulnerable. Moreover, unlike at many tech businesses, there\u2019s no dominant or super-voting shareholder able to block takeover attempts. Google, Facebook or a more traditional media company could perhaps be tempted to buy Twitter.That might be a better outcome than a fate like Yahoo\u2019s.

{"Headline": "America\u2019s Best Days May Be Behind It", "Date": "2016-01-19", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneTake a look back at some of the most popular TV programs of the mid-1960s \u2014 \u201cThe Dick Van Dyke Show,\u201d \u201cBewitched,\u201d even \u201cThe Beverly Hillbillies\u201d \u2014 and what do you see?Like today, middle-class Americans typically had washing machines and air-conditioning, telephones and cars. The Internet and video games were not yet invented. But life, over all, did not look that different.There were TVs and radios in most homes. Millions of people worked in downtown offices and lived in suburbs, connected by multilane highways. Americans\u2019 average life expectancy at birth was 70, only eight years less than it is today.But flash back 50 years earlier. Then, less than half the population lived in cities. Though Ford Model T\u2019s were starting to roll off the assembly line, Americans typically moved around on horse-drawn buggies on dirt or cobblestone roads. Refrigerators or TVs? Most homes weren\u2019t even wired for electricity. And average life expectancy was only 53.Americans like to think they live in an era of rapid and unprecedented change, but this kind of comparison \u2014 pitting the momentous changes of the mid-20th century against the seemingly more modest progress of our present era \u2014 raises a critical question about the nation\u2019s future prosperity.What does this portend for our well-being over the next half century? Has technological progress slowed for good?The idea that America\u2019s best days are behind us sits in sharp tension with the high-tech optimism radiating from the offices of the technology start-ups and venture capital firms of Silicon Valley. But it lies at the heart of the current political unrest. And it is about to elbow its way forcefully into the national conversation.The hefty tome, minutely detailed yet dauntingly broad in scope, offers a lively portrayal of the evolution of American living standards since the Civil War. It also adds up to a dispiriting forecast for American prosperity in the decades to come. \u201cThis book,\u201d he writes in the introduction, \u201cends by doubting that the standard of living of today\u2019s youths will double that of their parents, unlike the standard of living of each previous generation of Americans back to the late 19th century.\u201dInnovation will trundle along at the same pace of the last 40 years, Professor Gordon predicts. Despite the burst of progress of the Internet era, total factor productivity \u2014 which captures innovation\u2019s contribution to growth \u2014 rose over that period at about one-third the pace of the previous five decades.That\u2019s hardly the worst part of the story. The labor force will continue to decline, as aging baby boomers leave the work force and women\u2019s labor supply plateaus. And gains in education, an important driver of productivity that expanded sharply in the 20th century, will contribute little.Moreover, the growing concentration of income means that whatever the growth rate, most of the population will barely share in its fruits. Altogether, Professor Gordon argues, the disposable income of the bottom 99 percent of the population, which has expanded about 2 percent per year since the late 19th century, will expand over the next few decades at a rate little above zero.Science has piggybacked on technology ever since Galileo used a telescope to develop a new understanding of the heavens. This new science, in turn, led to new technological innovations.What Professor Gordon fails to account for, Professor Mokyr argues, is that the information technology revolution and other recent developments produced mind-blowing tools and techniques, from gene-sequencing machines to computers that analyze mountains of data at blistering speed. This is creating vast new opportunities for innovation, from health care to materials technology and beyond.\u201cThe tools available to science have been improving at a dazzling rate,\u201d he told me. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how, but the world of technology in 30 to 40 years\u2019 time will be vastly different than it is today.\u201dNonetheless, Professor Gordon\u2019s argument is not easy to dismiss. He does not forecast that technological progress will slow to a crawl. His argument, rather, is that the explosion of innovation and prosperity from 1920 through 1970 was a one-time phenomenon. From now on, progress will continue at the more gradual pace of both the last 40 years and the period before 1920.\u201cThere is plenty of room in my forecast for evolutionary change,\u201d he told me. \u201cWhat is lacking is sharp, discrete change.\u201dProfessor Gordon\u2019s view of slowing technological opportunities meshes with other bits of evidence.\u201cPeople who invest money in the markets are saying the rate of return on capital investments is lower than it was 15 or 30 years ago,\u201d Mr. Bernanke said. \u201cGordon\u2019s forecast is not without some market reality.\u201dSkepticism is warranted, to be sure. Since the time of Thomas Malthus, eras of depressed expectations like our own have inspired predictions of doom and gloom that were proved wrong once economies turned up a few years down the road.Optimism, though, is also subject to cognitive biases. It\u2019s not just that the income of our optimistic techno-entrepreneurs is growing faster than gross domestic product. A lot of new innovation \u2014 the rockets to vacations in orbit, the Apple Watch and Google Glass \u2014 also seems custom-designed for them.\u201cIf you are sitting in Silicon Valley, rich and at the frontier of technology,\u201d said Lawrence F. Katz of Harvard, \u201cit is probably true that things are getting better.\u201dThe same can\u2019t always be said for the rest of us.Email: eporter@nytimes.com;\nTwitter: @portereduardo Advertisement"}

What were you like as a child?The nursery school teacher also said I had strong leadership skills, which I think was her way of saying I was really bossy. I\u2019m the oldest of three girls, and I was not the kindest sister in my younger years, although I\u2019ve turned things around now as an adult, and my sisters have forgiven me for all my sins of the past.I was also geeky and a bit nerdy as a kid. My mother is a devout Catholic, and I grew up going to church every Sunday, and went to Catholic elementary school. There was a time where I thought that I had to become a nun. I was relieved when I learned that was not the case.How do you think your parents have influenced your leadership style?One thing that was a steady current through my childhood was that my mother was politically conservative and, for a while, socially conservative. And my dad was very liberal. They were the two ends of the political spectrum.I remember sitting at the dinner table, and it was like watching a tennis match. They would debate back and forth. And it made me naturally inclined to look at everything from both sides, to understand the different angles.It\u2019s made me a bit more apolitical as an adult because I really want to understand the issues before I form an opinion, and it\u2019s so hard to get enough information to really understand the issues. But it has also really impacted the way I look at problems in business. I have all of these sources of data about the company, and I look at them a lot. It\u2019s almost like channel surfing for me. And I just remember the numbers. It freaks our employees out a bit.And tell me about your college years.I was way more interested in my jobs than I was in my coursework. I was a graphic designer in the student services organization, and I thought, \u201cThese are my people.\u201d I could combine my love of art with technology, and I was learning computer programs. I got a lot of exposure to leaders in the university through that work.Then after graduation in 2003, I learned about a job at Google as a marketing coordinator. I was there for only nine months, but they were like dog years. The company was exploding. I was working 17-hour days. I was running 200 projects at a time. I would break my day down into 15-minute increments and ask, \u201cWhat is the most important thing to do in these 15 minutes?\u201dAfter a brief stint at Amazon, I started consulting, and that\u2019s what led to working for LiquidPlanner, and I eventually joined them as director of marketing in 2008. Four years later, I became C.E.O. When the board approved my new role, it just hit me like a ton of bricks that this is really happening.What do you like about being C.E.O.?I like to put all the pieces together. It\u2019s like a Rubik\u2019s Cube. When you\u2019re running a start-up, you have this finite set of resources, and you have this huge goal. So you look at all the angles, and twist things this way and that as you\u2019re thinking, \u201cWhat if we did it this way?\u201dAnd every new employee who comes in is like Christmas morning. What are they going to bring to the table? What do they know that can help us? How can we help them?The job has a lot of pressure, too. The perfectionist student in me wants to hit every single number every single month. And that\u2019s been a big part of my evolution as a leader \u2014 to be O.K. if we don\u2019t execute perfectly every month, and to keep people focused on tomorrow and moving the business forward.Any surprises in the role?I\u2019ve had light-bulb moments when I realized I have to be really thoughtful about what I ask for and how I ask for it, because people are watching and listening closely, and caring in a way that they didn\u2019t when I didn\u2019t have this title. That\u2019s always been a little bit uncomfortable for me. I don\u2019t have this grand image of myself. I\u2019m just like everybody else.How do you hire?With some people, I\u2019ll ask questions like, \u201cWhen nobody is watching you, outside of work, what do you do to be great that is only for you and that no one else will ever see?\u201d I\u2019m just looking for that internal drive.I\u2019ll also ask people to tell me about times when they have been on a path to failure, and what their mental dialogue was to reset that. Because I want to understand their psychology a little bit. How do you give yourself a pep talk? What do you say to yourself? What are the games you play in your head to right things? Because you will encounter those moments when a task just seems insurmountable.I also really want to understand people\u2019s intentions, and why they do the things they do. For example, I\u2019ll ask about the thought process behind taking different jobs they\u2019ve had.What career advice do you give to new college grads?I give them my mom\u2019s advice: Don\u2019t worry about the money, don\u2019t worry about the title, don\u2019t worry about the company. Just take the job where you can learn the most.And if people are early in their career and they desperately want to change, I coach them to not change everything all at once. Change one dimension, or maybe two \u2014 like the industry or the size of the company \u2014 but give yourself some advantage going into the next job that will set you up for reaching your goal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Germany on the Brink", "Date": "2016-01-09", "News": "Supported byThe underlying controversy here is not a new one. For decades conservatives on both sides of the Atlantic have warned that Europe\u2019s generous immigration policies, often pursued in defiance of ordinary Europeans\u2019 wishes, threaten to destabilize the continent.The conservatives have made important points about the difficulty of assimilation, the threat of radicalization, and the likelihood of Paris-style and Cologne-style violence in European cities.With the current migration, though, we\u2019re in uncharted territory. The issue isn\u2019t just that immigrants are arriving in the hundreds of thousands rather than the tens of thousands. It\u2019s that a huge proportion of them are teenage and twentysomething men.As Hudson notes, these trends have immediate implications for civil order \u2014 young men are, well, young men; societies with skewed sex ratios tend to be unstable; and many of these men carry assumptions about women\u2019s roles that are diametrically opposed to the values of contemporary Europe.But if you add a million (or millions) of people, most of them young men, in one short period, you get a very different kind of shift.How transformative depends on whether these men eventually find a way to bring brides and families to Europe as well. In terms of immediate civil peace, family formation or unification offers promise, since men with wives and children are less likely to grope revelers or graffiti synagogues or seek the solidarity of radicalism.But it could also double or treble this migration\u2019s demographic impact, pushing Germany toward a possible future in which half the under-40 population would consist of Middle Eastern and North African immigrants and their children.If you believe that an aging, secularized, heretofore-mostly-homogeneous society is likely to peacefully absorb a migration of that size and scale of cultural difference, then you have a bright future as a spokesman for the current German government.You\u2019re also a fool. Such a transformation promises increasing polarization among natives and new arrivals alike. It threatens not just a spike in terrorism but a rebirth of 1930s-style political violence. The still-imaginary France Michel Houellebecq conjured up in his novel \u201cSubmission,\u201d in which nativists and Islamists brawl in the streets, would have a very good chance of being realized in the German future.This need not happen. But prudence requires doing everything possible to prevent it. That means closing Germany\u2019s borders to new arrivals for the time being. It means beginning an orderly deportation process for able-bodied young men. It means giving up the fond illusion that Germany\u2019s past sins can be absolved with a reckless humanitarianism in the present.It means that Angela Merkel must go \u2014 so that her country, and the continent it bestrides, can avoid paying too high a price for her high-minded folly.Advertisement"}

On Sunday on Fox, the F.B.I. agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) return for a six-part mini-series.The New York Times TV critics James Poniewozik and Mike Hale emailed over encrypted lines from undisclosed locations to discuss the new series and the legacy of the original.Not at first, not at all. The first episode is called \u201cMy Struggle,\u201d which aptly describes the experience of sitting through it. It lumbers. It plods. The actors chew sawdusty mouthfuls of expository dialogue. It introduces an Alex-Jones-like conspiracy-talk-show host (Joel McHale), who\u2019s meant to be played straight but comes off like parody. Above all, it\u2019s handicapped by the fact that it has to tear down much of the show\u2019s mythology and construct a new one in an hour. It\u2019s like rebuilding a sports car just to back it down the driveway.Test your knowledge of \u201cX-Files\u201d monsters-of-the-week in this interactive quiz.Thankfully, the second episode shakes the dourness and gives Mulder and Scully more room to breathe. But it\u2019s the third \u2014 a comic palate-cleanser in the \u201cmonster of the week\u201d vein \u2014 that finally recreates the show\u2019s oddball delights. As Scully says, in one of the script\u2019s many meta comments, \u201cI forgot how much fun these cases could be.\u201d She\u2019s right. Still, while \u201cThe X-Files\u201d has a great legacy \u2014 on serial TV, on sci-fi and, thematically, on television at large \u2014 I wonder if its time has passed. Has the show changed, or have we?To your question: \u201cThe X-Files\u201d was a show about a certain mode of fear and style of conspiracy, and in the 14 years since it ended our culture has been overtaken by a new, more grim, more literal sense of fear. (The last season started on Nov. 11, 2001.) In the opening episode, the extended U.F.O. history lesson feels like a wrongheaded attempt to explain what all the excitement used to be about. In the exponentially better second and third episodes, the writers mostly ignore the time lapse, except to poke fun at Mulder\u2019s incompetence with personal electronics. They\u2019re confident that the show\u2019s structure still stands up.As a fan I loved the self-referentiality of the third episode \u2014 my favorite line was probably Mulder\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m just looking for some internal logic\u201d \u2014 but as a critic I wondered how interesting the episode would be for someone who hadn\u2019t watched the show before. It was really heavy on the in-jokes. Did that bother you at all? Does it matter?Which is interesting, because there\u2019s something very prebinge about its structure \u2014 a ratio of a couple of stand-alone episodes for every mythology episode. That\u2019s very much an artifact of the TV business of the \u201990s. Before Netflix, before \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d before \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d (from Vince Gilligan of \u201cThe X-Files\u201d), complicated serial TV was considered a risk. (\u201cTwin Peaks\u201d was an exception, but also a cautionary tale.) Before DVRs and streaming made catching up easier, you might permanently lose viewers every time they missed an episode, so older TV was aimed at making every installment accessible to a brand-new audience. \u201cThe X-Files,\u201d appropriately, was a DNA-engineered hybrid. Part of the time it was a complex sci-fi saga. Other times, it was an anthology \u2014 part \u201cTwilight Zone,\u201d part buddy-cop show. It contributed to the show\u2019s surreal atmosphere, but I wonder if Mr. Carter would make the same show starting today \u2014 if an \u201cX-Files\u201d of 2016 would be \u201cLost\u201d or \u201cBlack Mirror.\u201dAnother thing I appreciated about that third episode (titled \u201cMulder and Scully Meet the Were-Monster\u201d) was that it allowed Mr. Duchovny and Ms. Anderson to be a little silly. Humor, and those actors\u2019 comic talents, were an important ingredient in the mix of the original series that gets overlooked. Mr. Duchovny, especially, is a natural comedian with a genius for self-deprecation. He still gives just the right note of innocent vanity to a line like: \u201cI\u2019m a middle-aged man, Scully. No, I am.\u201d Like you, I\u2019ve forgotten a lot, but it\u2019s my sense that in general, mythology worked against humor \u2014 the serialized episodes had a severity to them, a \u201cwe\u2019re being serious now\u201d tone.When the new episodes work, it\u2019s because Mulder and Scully work. One thing I like about the new stand-alone episodes is that they\u2019re not entirely static; they carry the weight of history between these characters. (Oh yeah, remember that they had a kid together?) Even the lighter third episode reminds us how experience has changed their perspectives. Mulder has been burned enough to be dubious, while Scully has seen enough to be open to the impossible.It\u2019s especially good to see Ms. Anderson, such a beacon of intensity in \u201cThe Fall,\u201d get to flex her dry humor again. When she pulls an obscure fact out of thin air, as Scully is wont to do, she shrugs it off in a way that both acknowledges how much time has passed and tells us the important things haven\u2019t changed. \u201cI\u2019m old school, Mulder,\u201d she says. \u201cPre-Google.\u201dMany shows have tried to follow the \u201cX-Files\u201d template to one degree or another, but they\u2019re always missing that Mulder-Scully umami. \u201cFringe\u201d tried to reconstitute it with Anna Torv and Joshua Jackson as an F.B.I. agent and a skeptical civilian. \u201cSupernatural\u201d cut women out of the equation and made the show\u2019s demon hunters two brothers whose devotion was to each other.Chris Carter was reviving a television tradition of science-fiction-inflected horror (or horror-inflected science fiction) that ran from \u201cThe Twilight Zone\u201d to \u201cNight Gallery\u201d to \u201cKolchak: The Night Stalker,\u201d but his and his writers\u2019 great contribution was the addition of flirtatiousness and genuine adult emotion to the mix. The legacy of \u201cThe X-Files\u201d may be that it made TV hospitable again to a range of genre shows after the sitcom domination of the 1980s, helping pave the way for future fantasists like J. J. Abrams and Joss Whedon. But when it was at its best, the show was equal parts suspense, horror, science fiction \u2014 and romance.Advertisement"}

And if a candidate goes over the allotted time, you will hear this.(BELL RINGS)Double.KELLY: Wow.BAIER: I think the double is the one we want. Very pleasing.(LAUGHTER)We have a crowd of about 1,600 here, and while they have agreed to respect the candidates and listen intently, we can tell you they are very excited to be here. Am I right?(APPLAUSE)KELLY: So let\u2019s get started.Senator Cruz, before we get to the issues, let\u2019s address the elephant not in the room tonight.(LAUGHTER)Donald Trump has chosen not to attend this evening\u2019s presidential debate. What message do you think that sends to the voters of Iowa?CRUZ: Well, Megyn, let me say at the outset to the men and women of Iowa, thank you for the incredible hospitality over this past year.By Monday, you will have welcomed me into all 99 counties in Iowa. You will have welcomed my dad to preach at your churches. You will have welcomed Heidi and our girls, Caroline and Catherine, into your homes.

And for six months that \u2014 your campaign, during this campaign, you praised Mr. Trump as somebody who you thought was an effective voice against the Washington cartel. You said you were glad that he was running as a Republican.But when he started to criticize you, your message changed, and you suddenly started to portray him as the voice of the Washington cartel, and suggested he would do the Democrats\u2019 bidding. Which is it?CRUZ: Well, let me be clear, if Donald engages in insults or anybody else, I don\u2019t intend to reciprocate. I have not insulted Donald personally and I don\u2019t intend to.I am glad Donald is running. I\u2019m glad he has produced enormous enthusiasm, and, every Donald Trump voter or potential voter, I hope to earn your support. I know everyone else on this stage hopes to earn your support.Now, there is a difference between personal insults and attacks \u2014 between going into the mud with ad hominems and focusing on issues and substance. CRUZ: I think issues and substance, policy and vision and record should be the meat of politics. That\u2019s fair game but that\u2019s where I\u2019m going to focus. That\u2019s how I focused from the beginning of the campaign and it is how I intend to continue going forward.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Senator Rubio, I want to explore this sort of larger issue. The campaign has in a sense turned into a battle for the soul of the Republican party: establishment versus grassroots, pragmatic versus principle. You say that you can unite all of the factions inside the GOP. How?RUBIO: Chris, let\u2019s begin by being clear what this campaign is about. It\u2019s not about Donald Trump. He\u2019s an entertaining guy. He\u2019s the greatest show on earth. This campaign is about the greatest country in the world and a president who has systematically destroyed many of the things that made America special.You see, we usually elect presidents in America that want to change the things that are wrong in America. Barack Obama wants to change America. Barack Obama wants America to be more like the rest of the world. We don\u2019t want to be like the rest of the world. We want to be the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: That is why Hillary Clinton cannot win this election. Hillary Clinton this week said Barack Obama would make a great Supreme Court justice. The guy who systematically and habitually violates the constitution on the Supreme Court? I don\u2019t think so. If I\u2019m our nominee, I will unite this party and we\u2019ll defeat Hillary Clinton and we will turn this country around once and for all, after seven years of the disaster that is Barack Obama.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Governor Bush, it\u2019s hard for anyone of your pedigree to avoid being called establishment. But isn\u2019t that part of the problem in this race, that three others on this stage are splitting the main stream Republican vote and there by possibly handing this nomination over to an anti-establishment candidate?BUSH: Bret, we\u2019re just starting. The first vote hasn\u2019t been counted. Why don\u2019t we let the process work. I trust Iowans, Granite staters (ph), people in South Carolina, people in Nevada, to start this process out. I kind of miss Donald Trump. He was a little teddy bear to me.(LAUGHTER)We always had such a loving relationship in these debates and in between and the tweets. I kind of miss him. I wish he was here. Everybody else was in the witness protection program when I went after him on behalf of what the Republican cause should be: conservative principles, believing in limited government, believing in accountability. Leading by fixing the things that are broken.Look, I am in the establishment because my dad, the greatest man alive was president of the United States and my brother, who I adore as well as fantastic brother was president. Fine, I\u2019ll take it. I guess I\u2019m part of the establishment Barbara Bush is my mom. I\u2019ll take that, too.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: But this election is not about our pedigree, this is an election about people that are really hurting. We need a leader that will fix things and have a proven record to do it. And we need someone who will take on Hillary Clinton in November. Someone who has a proven record, who has been tested, who is totally transparent. I released 34 years of tax returns...(BELL RINGS)... and 300,000 e-mails in my government record. To get the information from Hillary Clinton, you need to get a subpoena from the FBI.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Thank you governor.KELLY: Senator Christie, you began this campaign touting your record as a Republican from a blue state who knows how to get things done and reach across the aisle. However, many Republicans feel that reaching across the aisle and getting things done isn\u2019t great if you get the wrong things done. And they prefer to stand on principle rather than compromise. Why are they wrong and you\u2019re right?CHRISTIE: They\u2019re not wrong. But what\u2019s wrong is your premise in the question. You can do both. There is no reason why you can\u2019t stand for principles, go and fight for them and be able also, to have to get things done in government.You know, what people are frustrated about in Washington, D.C.., and I know the folks out there tonight are incredibly frustrated because what they see is a government that doesn\u2019t work for them. You know, for the 45-year-old construction worker out there, who is having a hard time making things meet.He\u2019s lost $4,000 in the last seven years in his income because of this administration. He doesn\u2019t want to hear the talk about politics Megyn and who is establishment and who is grassroots. And who\u2019s compromised and who is principled. What he wants is something to get done.And that\u2019s the difference between being a governor and having done that for the last six years in New Jersey and being someone who has never had to be responsible for any of those decisions. Barack Obama was never responsible for those decisions.Hillary Clinton has never been responsible for those kind of decisions where they were held accountable. I\u2019ve been held accountable for six years as the governor of New Jersey and with a Democratic legislature, I\u2019ve gotten conservative things done. That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019ll do as president of the United States.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Senator Paul, you are definitely not in the establishment category. But at the beginning of this campaign, you said you were your own man when asked about your father, former Texas Congressman and three-time presidential candidate Ron Paul.Senator Cruz\u2019s campaign is out with a video saying that Cruz is the intellectual and political heir to your father\u2019s 2012 campaign and the liberty movement. And your father now says it\u2019s realistic that Donald Trump will be your party\u2019s nominee.So did you make a mistake by not fully \u2014 more fully embracing your father politically at the beginning of this campaign?PAUL: You know, I\u2019ve always had a great deal of respect. There\u2019s probably no person I respect more in the country or in recent history than my father. I think he was probably the most honest man in politics that we\u2019ve ever seen in a generation.And so in no way have I ever said that I don\u2019t embrace my father or love my father or appreciate everything that he has done for the country. I think what\u2019s interesting about where that liberty vote goes that my father brought to the Republican Party is, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re necessarily going to go for Ted.You know, Ted didn\u2019t show up. We had an audit-the-Fed vote, which was the biggest thing my dad had been advocating for, for 30 years, Ted didn\u2019t have time to show up. He was the only Republican that didn\u2019t show up for it.And so I think really that vote is going to stay in the Paul household. I think more of it is coming and it\u2019s going to grow.The NSA is another big issue. Ted said he was for NSA reform, but then he told Marco Rubio, no, no, no, I voted for the bill because I\u2019m for the government collecting 100 percent of your cell phone records.I don\u2019t think Ted can have it both ways. They want to say they\u2019re getting some of the liberty vote. But we don\u2019t see it happening at all. We think we\u2019re going to do very well in Iowa with the liberty vote.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Senator Cruz, your response to that?CRUZ: Well, I agree with Rand that I very much respect Ron Paul and that I think anyone who is able to win in the Republican Party has to be able to bring together the disparate elements of the Reagan coalition. You\u2019ve got to be able to bring together conservatives and evangelicals and libertarians, and stitch together a winning majority.When it comes to the audit the Fed bill, as Rand knows well, I was an original sponsor of the bill, I\u2019m strongly supportive of it. It didn\u2019t have the votes to pass. And I had commitments to be at a town hall in New Hampshire.But I look forward to signing that bill into law as president and auditing the Fed and providing needed accountability at the Federal Reserve.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Senator Rubio?RUBIO: I think, you know, Rand and I have some significant issues on policy, but I respect Rand. He believes everything he stands for.(APPLAUSE)I do respect Rand.But I want to be frank about what I stand for. I believe the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest power in the world. And I believe only with a strong America will we defeat this radical group, this apocalyptic group called ISIS.That\u2019s why when I\u2019m president we are going to rebuild our intelligence capabilities. And they\u2019re going to tell us where the terrorists are. And a rebuilt U.S. military is going to destroy these terrorists.And if we capture any of these ISIS killers alive, they are going to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we\u2019re going to find out everything they know, because when I\u2019m president, unlike Barack Obama, we will keep this country safe.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Thank you, Senator.PAUL: May I respond?(CROSSTALK)BAIER: We\u2019ll come back to...PAUL: Well, I mean, I was talked about in the question.BAIER: OK. Go ahead, go ahead. PAUL: Just very quickly, I would like to respond.The bulk collection of your phone data, the invasion of your privacy did not stop one terrorist attack. I don\u2019t think you have to give up your liberty for a false sense of security.When we look at this bulk collection, the court has looked at this. Even the court declared it to be illegal. If we want to collect the records of terrorists, let\u2019s do it the old fashioned way. Let\u2019s use the Fourth Amendment. Let\u2019s put a name on a warrant, let\u2019s ask a judge for it. Let\u2019s respect the history of our country.John Adams said that we fought a War for Independence because we wanted to fight against generalized warrants. Let\u2019s don\u2019t forget that.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Governor Kasich, I want to get back to this question of where conservatives are this year. You call yourself a, quote, \u201cinside-outside guy, a reformer who knows how to get things done,\u201d but you reject the establishment label.First question is why do you reject it? And secondly, what do you say to Republican voters this year who view practical government experience as a liability and not an asset?KASICH: Well, first of all, I had a national reporter say, you know, there\u2019s three lanes. There\u2019s the establishment lane, the anti- establishment lane, and then there\u2019s the Kasich lane.And the reason is, is that I\u2019ve been a reformer all of my career, fighting to reform welfare, fighting to reform the Pentagon, also being in a position to balance the budget, because that is very, very hard to do.And then in Ohio, of course, I had to bring about big reform, again, because we were so far in the hole and now we just found out we are up over 400,000 jobs since I took over as governor.KASICH: You know, the situation is this. We cannot fix things in this country \u2014 the Social Security, the border, balancing the budget, getting wages to grow faster \u2014 unless we lead as conservatives, but we also invite people in from the other party. We have to come together as a country. And we have to stop all the divisions.And, you know, that\u2019s been my message in New Hampshire. And having been in New Hampshire and here in Iowa, but in New Hampshire, I just received the support of seven out of eight of the newspapers in that state because they see positive, they see unity, they see coming together, and they see a record of change and a record of accomplishment.And it isn\u2019t because I\u2019m all that great. It\u2019s because I\u2019ve been assembling a team of people who want to be involved in something that\u2019s a little bigger than themselves. I\u2019ll keep \u2014 I\u2019ll keep heading in that direction, believe me.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Dr. Carson, I want to pick up on that with you. Governor Kasich likes to say he knows how to land the plane. You\u2019ve landed a lot of planes in the O.R. But what about the idea of running for president with no experience in government at all?CARSON: Well, I will gladly confess that I\u2019m the only one on this stage with no political title. You\u2019re not going to hear a lot of polished political speech from me, but you will hear the truth. And I don\u2019t think you have to be a politician to tell the truth. In fact, sometimes it\u2019s not that way...(APPLAUSE)... and I\u2019ve had more two a.m. phone calls than everybody here put together, making life and death decisions, put together very complex teams to accomplish things that have never been done before. And we are in a situation right now in our country that we have never been in before. We need people who think out of the box and can solve problems; can utilize the resources around them; very smart people, to focus on the problem and solve the problem.The American people are terrified. That\u2019s why we have this abnormal situation going on right now. We don\u2019t need more of the same solutions. We need different solutions to solve the problems and to save our nation. (APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Gentlemen, we\u2019re now going to start to drill down into specific issues that are on voters\u2019 minds. I\u2019m going to start with one of the biggest ones, which is foreign terror.According to Google, ISIS was by far the most searched foreign policy topic over the last year. Senator Cruz, you talk tough about fighting terrorism. You talk about carpet bombing into oblivion. You talk about seeing if the sand will glow at night. But critics say that your record does not match up to that. You opposed giving President Obama authority to enforce his red line in Syria. Three years in a row now, you have voted against the Defense Authorization Act.How do you square your rhetoric with your record, sir?CRUZ: Well, Chris, I will apologize to nobody for the vigorousness with which I will fight terrorism, go after ISIS, hunt them down wherever they are, and utterly and completely destroy ISIS.(APPLAUSE)You know, you claim it is tough talk to discuss carpet bombing. It is not tough talk. It is a different, fundamental military strategy than what we\u2019ve seen from Barack Obama. Barack Obama right now, number one, over seven years, has dramatically degraded our military. You know, just two weeks ago was the 25th anniversary of the first Persian Gulf war. When that war began, we had 8,000 planes. Today, we have about 4,000. When that war began, we had 529 ships. Today, we have 272.You want to know what carpet bombing is? It\u2019s what we did in the first Persian Gulf war; 1,100 air attacks a day, saturation bombing that utterly destroyed the enemy. Right now, Barack Obama is launching between 15 and 30 air attacks a day. He\u2019s not arming the Kurds. We need to define the enemy. We need to rebuild the military to defeat the enemy. And we need to be focused and lift the rules of engagement so we\u2019re not sending our fighting men and women into combat with their arms tied behind their backs.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Senator Rubio, does Senator Cruz\u2019s record match his rhetoric?RUBIO: Well, again, I mean, obviously, as already has been pointed out, the only budget that Ted has ever voted for is a budget that Rand Paul sponsored that brags about cutting defense spending. And I think that\u2019s a bad idea for the following reason.ISIS is the most dangerous jihadist group in the history of mankind. ISIS is now found in affiliates in over a dozen countries. ISIS is a group that burns people alive in cages; that sells off little girls as brides. ISIS is a group that wants to trigger an apocalyptic showdown in the city of Dabiq \u2014 not the city of Dubuque; I mis-said \u2014 mis-said that wrong once (inaudible) time \u2014 the city of Dabiq in Syria. They want to trigger an apocalyptic Armageddon showdown.RUBIO: This group needs to be confronted and defeated. They are not going to go away on their own. They\u2019re not going to turn into stockbrokers overnight or open up a chain of car washes. They need to be defeated militarily, and that will take overwhelming U.S. force.Today, we are on pace to have the smallest Army since the end of World War II, the smallest Navy in 100 years, the smallest Air Force in our history. You cannot destroy ISIS with a military that\u2019s being diminished. When I\u2019m president, we are rebuilding the U.S. military because the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest military in the world.(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: Senator Cruz, you\u2019ve got 30 seconds. You were mentioned.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: Chris, in 1981, when Ronald Reagan came to the Oval Office, he encountered a military that had been debilitated just as the current military has, just like Jimmy Carter weakened our readiness, undermined our ability to defend this country, so too has Barack Obama. Just as morale in the military has plummeted in the last seven, so it had then.What Reagan did is he began with tax reform and regulatory reform, unleashing the engine of the American free enterprise system. It brought booming economic growth and that growth fueled rebuilding the military. I intend to do the exact same thing to defeat radical Islamic terrorism \u2014WALLACE: Gentlemen.CRUZ: ... and to devote the resources from the booming economy to rebuilding our Navy, rebuilding our Air Force, rebuilding our Army and ensuring we have the capacity to keep this country safe.PAUL: My budget was mentioned. My budget was mentioned.WALLACE: May I \u2014 may I just say, we are going to continue the questions about foreign terror, gentlemen, right after this break.BAIER: Welcome back. Let\u2019s get right back to the questions. Chris.WALLACE: Thank you. Governor Christie, you have compared both Senators Cruz and Rubio to Barack Obama, saying that we cannot afford another inexperienced President. You\u2019ve also said that Senator Cruz\u2019s vote to curtail the NSA surveillance program made America less safe. Is either of them ready to be Commander in Chief?CHRISTIE: Well, let me say that I do believe that the vote on NSA made the country less safe. Well, let me tell you what the country should really be worried about. I watched that town hall meeting with the Democrats the other night, and I heard Hillary Clinton asked a direct question by an Iowan, and that\u2019s what Iowans like to do. They like to ask direct questions.And, they asked about her email situation. And, here\u2019s what she said to the American people. She did it for convenience. For her convenience. She put America\u2019s secrets at risk for her convenience. She put American intelligence officers at risk for her convenience. She put American strategy at risk for her convenience.Let me tell you who\u2019s not qualified to be President of the United States, Chris. Hillary Rodham Clinton did that to our country. She is not qualified to be President of the United States.(CHEERING)The fact is what we need is someone on that stage who has been tested, who has been through it, who has made decisions, who has sit (ph) in the chair of consequence and can prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton on...(BELL RINGING)CHRISTIE: ... that stage, and that is exactly what I am ready to do.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Governor Bush...CRUZ: Chris? Chris I was mentioned in that question.BUSH: No, you weren\u2019t. Your name wasn\u2019t mentioned, Ted.CRUZ: ... Actually, I was...BUSH: ... Chris, keep it coming...WALLACE: ... I don\u2019t think that your name was mentioned...CRUZ: ... Chris, your questions that you...WALLACE: ... Sir, I think \u2014 I think the question was...CRUZ: ... What was your question...WALLACE: ... It\u2019s not my question that you get a chance to respond to, it\u2019s his answer.(LAUGHTER)WALLACE: You don\u2019t get 30 seconds to respond to me...CRUZ: ... Your question was you have disagreed...(AUDIENCE REACTION)WALLACE: ... You don\u2019t get 30 seconds to respond to me...CRUZ: ... (inaudible) opening statement.WALLACE: ... If I could go on. Sir, I know you like to argue about the rules, but we\u2019re going to conduct a debate...BUSH: ... Thank you Chris...WALLACE: ... Governor Bush...CRUZ: ... This entire question was an attack, but that\u2019s (inaudible)WALLACE: Governor Bush, here\u2019s the question \u2014 I\u2019m going to ask Governor Bush the question.You criticized several candidates in this field on this stage for what you call unrealistic ideas about how to fight terrorists, including Rubio, and Cruz on the issue of their refusing to give the President authority to enforce the redline in Syria.But, given the fact that your brother got us into two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that have still not ended.That have still not ended, what lessons have you learned from his mistakes, sir?BUSH: Well, first, I was critical of the Senators not giving the authorization for the use of military force. They should have made it more open ended for the next president. We shouldn\u2019t have the war fighters have their arms tied behind their back as President Obama wanted to do, but they had a chance to show support and it wasn\u2019t popular at the time. It became popular after the attack in Paris, and San Bernardino. Now we hear the tough talk.Prior to that, in the Reagan Library, I gave a detailed plan. Exactly what to do as it relates to ISIS. And it is from the lessons from history that we do this because if we allow this to fester, we\u2019re going to have Islamic terrorism, multi-generations of it all across this country. The caliphate of ISIS has to be destroyed, which means we need to arm directly to Kurds, imbed our troops with the Iraqi military, re engage with the Sunni tribal leaders. Get the lawyers off the damn backs of the military once and for all.(CHEERING)BUSH: Have a no fly zone in Syria and create safe zones to deal with the refugees. But, more importantly, to train a Sunni-led force in Syria to take out ISIS with our support...(BELL RINGING)BUSH: ... ground and air. That\u2019s what we need to to, and I laid that out prior to the crisis with the advice of a lot of people, including 12 Medal of Honor recipients that I\u2019m proud that they\u2019re supporting my campaign.History suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Senator Cruz, now you get a chance to respond.CRUZ: Chris, I would note that that the last four questions have been, \u201cRand, please attack Ted. Marco, please attack Ted. Chris, please attack Ted. Jeb, please attack Ted...\u201d(AUDIENCE)CRUZ: Let me just say this...WALLACE: ... It is a debate, sir.CRUZ: ... Well, no, no. A debate actually is a policy issue, but I will say this. Gosh, if you guys ask one more mean question I may have to leave the stage.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: Chris, the most important determination any voter is going to make in this election is who\u2019s best prepared to be Commander in Chief. Who has the experience, who has the knowledge, who has the judgement, who has the clarity, and vision and strength of resolve to keep this country safe. That is what this debate is all about, and I would suggest let\u2019s stay focused on those issues \u2014 rather than just attacks directed at each other.WALLACE: I think the questions were about issues. Senator Rubio, what would you like to respond sir...(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)PAUL: ... Senator Cruz, I\u2019d like to respond...RUBIO: ... First of all \u2014 Let me go first, and then you can please recognize Rand after.(LAUGHTER)RUBIO: First of all...PAUL: ... and I\u2019d like to respond.RUBIO: ... do I go \u2014 let me go first, and then you can please recognize Rand after. But...(LAUGHTER)... first of all...WALLACE: Thank you.PAUL: Thank you, Marco.RUBIO: ... first of all, I\u2019m \u2014 don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not leaving the stage no matter what you ask me.WALLACE: Good.RUBIO: And second of all...(APPLAUSE)... and I think \u2014 you know, Governor \u2014 Jeb, you \u2014 the attack that \u2014 the authorization that Barack Obama asked for was not against ISIS. It was against Assad. And John Kerry described it as attacks that would be unbelievably small.I don\u2019t think the United States should be engaged in symbolic military activity. So it was not against ISIS, it was against \u2014 it was against Assad.I think the United States military is operating under rules of engagement that are too strict...(BELL RINGS)...and that do not allow us to pursue victory. When I\u2019m president, that will change.(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: Senator Paul, go ahead. PAUL: Thank you.The issue in Syria\u2019s a very important one, and it\u2019s one we need to get right. The question is, should we be bombing both sides of the war? Some want (ph) to topple Assad. In fact, they want to bomb ISIS and Assad simultaneously.I think that\u2019s a really, really bad idea. In fact, I\u2019ve said for several years that arming the allies of ISIS will make the situation worse, That what we really need to do is defeat ISIS.But if you defeat Assad, what you will wind up with is a larger and more powerful ISIS that occupies that space. You might \u2014 you may well see an ISIS that takes over all of Syria.(BELL RINGS)KASICH: Chris...(APPLAUSE)... there was a question about foreign policy, by the way, and experience. And I \u2014 I thought, if I didn\u2019t jump in, I might not be able to tell everybody this. I think they\u2019d want to hear it.Look, I served on...WALLACE: Well...(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: ... we\u2019ll be talking about foreign policy a little bit later. We\u2019re going to talk...KELLY: We have a lot \u2014 we have a lot to cover. But we want to \u2014 we want to turn the page to domestic...(CROSSTALK)KASICH: ... but wait a minute...KELLY: No, no. No.KASICH: ...the only reason is \u2014 look...KELLY: No no no, because we want to turn the page to domestic terror, and let me tell you why: we\u2019re partnering with Google on this debate, and they\u2019re telling us...KASICH: OK.KELLY: ... that their search results have gone through the roof on \u2014 on people...KASICH: I\u2019ve always listened to you, Megyn. Go ahead.KELLY: ... you\u2019re a good man, Governor Kasich.KASICH: Yes \u2014 thank you.KELLY: People \u2014 the search results \u2014 the searches for terror issues, for safety issues in America have gone through the roof, increased over 400 percent since 2008.People are worried. They\u2019re worried about what\u2019s happening in the country and about a domestic terror attack, as all of you know. Now, when combating this threat, Senator Rubio, you\u2019ve advocated closing down mosques \u2014 we\u2019ll get back to you.Well, you have advocated closing down \u2014 closing down mosques, diners, any place where radicalization is occurring. You told me that. But the Supreme Court has made clear that hateful speech is generally protected by the First Amendment.In other words, radical Muslims have the right to be radical Muslims, unless they turn to terror. Doesn\u2019t your position run afoul of the First Amendment?RUBIO: Megyn, that\u2019s the problem. Radical Muslims and radical Islam is not just hate talk. It\u2019s hate action. They blow people up. Look what they did in San Bernardino.Look at the attack they inspired in Philadelphia, that the White House still refuses to link to terror, where a guy basically shot a police officer three times.He told the police, \u201cI did it because I was inspired by ISIS,\u201d and to this day, the White House still refuses to acknowledge it had anything to do with terror.Look, the threat we face from ISIS is unprecedented. There has never been a jihadist group like this. They have affiliates in over a dozen countries now.They are the best funded radical jihadist group in the history of the world, and they have shown a sophisticated understanding of the laws of other countries on how to insert fighters into places, and they are actively plotting to attack us here at home and around the world.We must keep America safe from this threat. And yes, when I am president of the United States, if there is some place in this country where radical jihadists are planning to attack the United States, we will go after them wherever they are, and if we capture them alive, they are going to Guantanamo.(APPLAUSE)PAUL: (inaudible).KELLY: Senator Paul, do you agree with that? We\u2019re gonna close down mosques, we\u2019re gonna close down diners where we think radical thinking\u2019s (ph) occurring? (CROSSTALK)PAUL: Yeah (ph), no, I think that\u2019s a \u2014 that\u2019s a huge mistake, to be closing down mosques. But I would say that if you want to defend the country, it begins with border security. And this is where I\u2019ve had my disagreement with Senator Rubio.When he brought forward the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d bill to give citizenship to those who came here illegally, I put forward an amendment that says we should have more scrutiny on those who are coming as students, those who are coming as immigrants, those who are coming as refugees, because we had two refugees come to my town in Bowling Green and try to attack us.Marco opposed this because they made a deal. He made a deal with Chuck Schumer that he would oppose any conservative amendments. And I think that\u2019s a mistake, and I just don\u2019t think Marco can have it both ways. You can\u2019t be in favor of defend us...(BELL RINGS)... against Islam \u2014 radical Islam \u2014 if you\u2019re not for border security.RUBIO: Might I respond?(APPLAUSE)The first thing \u2014 I don\u2019t know of anyone who\u2019s not in favor of fully vetting people that are trying to come into this country, other than perhaps Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. I think we all support that. Rand\u2019s amendment was not the right way to do it.I do believe that people who are trying to come to the United States \u2014 this country has a right to know who they are and why they are coming. And that\u2019s why I\u2019ve been clear, when I am the president of the United States of America, we don\u2019t know who you are, and we don\u2019t know why you\u2019re trying to come to the United States, you are not going to get in, because the radical threat that we now face from ISIS is extraordinary and unprecedented...(BELL RINGS)... and when I\u2019m president, we are keeping ISIS out of America.KELLY: Governor Christie, let\u2019s talk about profiling.(APPLAUSE)In December...CHRISTIE: Talk about what? I...KELLY: ... profiling. Profiling. In December, two radical Muslims killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California. Neighbors of the terrorists said that they did not report the couple to law enforcement prior to the crime, because they were afraid that they would be accused of profiling.Now, you have said that we should not profile. How do you square that with the San Bernardino case?CHRISTIE: Well, because you can do it without profiling, Megyn, when you do it on the facts. What those facts knew was that these folks had weapons. They knew that they were talking about trying to take our country and attack it.That\u2019s not profiling, that\u2019s law enforcement. And that\u2019s the difference between somebody who knows how to do this and somebody who\u2019s never done it before.KELLY: They didn\u2019t know they were going to attack the country.CHRISTIE: They knew they were talking about the issues of attacking people, Megyn. They knew that.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: That\u2019s not true. The neighbors said they saw men going in and out of the garage. They saw packages being delivered. They saw Muslims, and they did not think that was enough to call the cops. Do you?CHRISTIE: Listen, I think that what people should do is use their common sense. And the fact is, let law enforcement make those decisions. I\u2019ve told people that from the time I was U.S. attorney 13 years ago.It\u2019s not for them to make those decisions about whether or not something is legal or illegal, or profiling or not. You see something that\u2019s suspicious, you call law enforcement and let law enforcement make those decisions.That\u2019s what should be done. That can be done. That can be done without profiling people. What that is, is just common sense. They thought something was wrong.And here\u2019s the problem in this country right now. The problem is that Barack Obama has made law enforcement the enemy, Hillary Clinton has made law enforcement the enemy.They\u2019re not supporting our law enforcement officers, it\u2019s making everybody nervous to get out of their cars, if you\u2019re a law enforcement officer. It\u2019s making... (BELL RINGS)CHRISTIE: ... everybody nervous to get out of their cars if you\u2019re a law enforcement officer.(BELL RINGS)It\u2019s making people in neighborhoods nervous to go to law enforcement. As president, I will support law enforcement and we\u2019ll stop radical terrorist attacks in this country by supporting our intelligence community and law enforcement community.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: Dr. Carson, this week a female Muslim who served in the U.S. Air Force asked Hillary Clinton the question, she asked whether the United States is still the best place in which to raise her three Muslim children. Given what she perceives as a rise in Islamaphobia in this country. Do you think the GOP messaging on Muslims has stoked the flames of bias on this as the Democrats suggest, and how would you answer this veteran?CARSON: Well, I don\u2019t know about the GOP messaging, but I can tell you about my messaging. You know, need to stop allowing political correctness to dictate our policies, because it\u2019s going to kill us if we don\u2019t.(APPLAUSE)CARSON: And in the Holy Land Foundation trial in 2006 in Texas, they had a memorandum, an explanatory memorandum that talked about the fact that Americans would be easy to overcome and to commit civilization jihad because they were going to be trying to protect the rights of the very people who were trying to subvert them.But I believe in the Teddy Roosevelt philosophy. Teddy Roosevelt said, we are a nation of immigrants. As such, everybody is welcome from any race, any country, any religion, if they want to be Americans. If they want to accept our values and our laws. If not, they can stay where they are.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: Governor Kasich, stand back. You appear to back in another debate, a so-called back door to encrypted cell phone technology, which protects most smartphones that we all have from hacking. And it includes our phones and it also protects the cell phones of the terrorist.Now the tech companies and a group of MIT scientists, smart guys, right, warn that if they create a way for the FBI to have a back door into our encrypted communications, then the bad guys will exploit it too. And they say that this is going to cause more security problems than it would solve for everyday Americans. Are they wrong?KASICH: Well, look the Joint Terrorism Task Force needs resources and tools. And those are made up of the FBI, state and local law enforcement. And Megyn, it\u2019s best not to talk anymore about back doors and encryption, it will get solved, but it needs to be solved in the situation of the White House with the technology folks.MEGYN: But this is public testimony.KASICH: But I just have to tell you that it\u2019s best with some of these things not be said. Now I want to go back something. See, I was there when Reagan rebuilt the military. I was there in \u201989 when the wall came tumbling down because we were strong.And I was there when we went into the Gulf War. We didn\u2019t win that war just from the air, we won that war by assembling a group of Arab leaders who stood in the Rose Garden and stood with America. We want to destroy ISIS, it has to be in the air and on the ground. It has to be with our friends in the Arab world and our friends in Europe, the coalition that we had when we went to the first Gulf War.And then when we win that, and we will win that against ISIS as it settles down, and we should leave. Because we shouldn\u2019t be policemen of the world. But what we need to do is turn it over to the regional powers to be able to handle that.KASICH: But we have a unique time in America to connect with people all around the world that understand that there\u2019s an existential threat against all of them, the Arabs, the Jordanians, the Saudis, the Egyptians, our friends in Europe, including the Turks. So we have a unique opportunity to bring everybody together.I saw Reagan do it, I\u2019ve seen other presidents do it. And frankly, if you want to be commander in chief, you have to have the experience. At the same time we\u2019re doing all that, the Pentagon must be reformed so we get what we need for our men and women in uniform. All of that together, we\u2019re going to be just fine and America is going to continue to lead the world.KELLY: Governor, thank you.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Governor Bush, just today, a wounded warrior organization designed to help wounded veterans and their families is coming under fire for raising tens of millions of dollars, but spending almost half of that on travel and hotels and dinners and luxury, lavish conferences. So taking care of veterans is obviously a huge issue in the country that has asked so many to serve and sacrifice so much.If you were president. would you police these charity organizations that say they\u2019re helping vets?BUSH: Of course. And there\u2019s all sorts of ways that can be done at the state, local and federal level to do that. But the first duty of the next president of the United States is to fix the mess at the Department of Veterans Affairs. That\u2019s his first responsibility.(APPLAUSE)Look, we have waiting lists for veterans that are \u2014 that are leaving because of the sequester where we\u2019re gutting the military. More and more military personnel are leaving becoming veterans, and the waiting list grows. They\u2019ve given out $140 million of bonuses to Veterans Department employees, including reducing the waiting lists, without giving veterans care. People died, and only three people have been fired.I will make sure that we fire the sheer incompetence inside the Department of Veterans Affairs and then we\u2019ll give veterans a choice card so that they don\u2019t have to travel hours and hours to get care if they want to go to their private provider. You want to make the Veterans Administration do a better job, give them \u2014 give veterans choices and you\u2019ll get a much better result. And as it relates to all the other organizations, let me give you a good example.In Houston, Texas, there\u2019s an organization in place because someone acted on their heart, wanted to make sure that there\u2019s no homeless veterans in Houston. And they\u2019ve come pretty close to that without federal government assistance. We need to mobilize the entire country to treat our veterans and treat them with much more respect than they get today.BAIER: Governor Bush, thank you.(APPLAUSE)Speaking of veterans, we have a question from a veteran who is one of the top Youtube creators. Over the course of the evening, gentlemen, we will hear from some of Youtube\u2019s most followed stars. And here\u2019s one of them.QUESTION: I\u2019m Mark Watson. I\u2019m known for my (inaudible) views on Youtube, but I\u2019m also a veteran who served in the Army for eight years.As an African-American living near Ferguson, I\u2019ve seen the strain between police officers and the communities they serve firsthand. Now, there are great tools like body cameras that \u2014 to protect both officers and citizens, but we all currently have better cameras in our pockets than in our precincts. Why aren\u2019t we using the technology available to better protect our communities?BAIER: Senator Paul, that question to you.PAUL: You know, I\u2019ve supported legislation to allow body cameras. I\u2019ve been to Ferguson, I\u2019ve been trying to look for solutions to our criminal justice problem.One thing I discovered in Ferguson was that a third of the budget for the city of Ferguson was being reaped by civil fines. People were just being fined to death. Now you and I and many of the people in this audience, if we get a $100 fine, we can survive it. If you\u2019re living on the edge of poverty and you get a $100 fine or your car towed, a lot of times you lose your job.I also think the war on drugs has disproportionately affected our African-American community, and what we need to do is make sure that the war on drugs is equal protection under the law and that we don\u2019t unfairly incarcerate another generation of young African-American males.In Ferguson, for every 100 African-American women, there are only 60 African-American men. Drug use is about equal between white and black, but our prisons \u2014 three out of four people in prison are black or brown. I think something has to change. I think it\u2019s a big thing that our party needs to be part of, and I\u2019ve been a leader in Congress on trying to bring about criminal justice reform.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Senator Paul, thank you.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Welcome back, everybody. We are live in Des Moines, Iowa. And let\u2019s get right back to the questions \u2014 Bret.BAIER: Thank you, Megyn.Gentlemen, I\u2019ll ask you some questions about federal spending and the role of the federal government. Everybody always said they want to cut federal spending and usually they start by saying they\u2019ll cut waste, fraud, and abuse, but that really doesn\u2019t ever materialize. We all know that.Governor Christie, you talk a lot about entitlement reform and you say that that\u2019s where the federal government can get savings needed to balance the budget. But can you name even one thing that the federal government does now that it should not do at all?CHRISTIE: Yes. You want one?(LAUGHTER)BAIER: I want one. Yes.(LAUGHTER)CHRISTIE: How about one that I\u2019ve done in New Jersey for the last six years. That\u2019s get rid of Planned Parenthood funding from the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Anything bigger than that?CHRISTIE: Bigger than that? Let me tell you something, when you see thousands upon thousands upon thousands of children being murdered in the womb, I can\u2019t think of anything better than that.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: And, Governor, I realize everyone on this stage opposes Obamacare and you\u2019re not alone. Google Data shows that in the last month when people searched \u201cpolicy repeals,\u201d that there were a lot of them. Obamacare took the top two spots. But today there are millions of people who gained health insurance from Obamacare and they now rely on it.So the question, Senator Cruz, if you repeal Obamacare, as you say you will, will you be fine if millions of those people don\u2019t have health insurance? And what is your specific plan for covering the uninsured?CRUZ: Sure. Well, let\u2019s take it one at a time. First of all, we have seen now in six years of Obamacare that it has been a disaster. It is the biggest job-killer in this country. Millions of Americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work, have lost their health insurance, have lost their doctors, have seen their premiums skyrocket.If I\u2019m elected president, we will repeal every word of Obamacare. (APPLAUSE)CRUZ: Now, once that is done, everyone agrees we need healthcare reform. It should follow the principles of expanding competition, empowering patients, and keeping government from getting in between us and our doctors.Three specific reforms that reflect those principles. Number one, we should allow people to purchase health insurance across state lines. That will create a true 50-state national marketplace which will drive down the cost of low-cost, catastrophic health insurance.Number two, we should expand health savings accounts so people can save in a tax-advantaged way for more routine healthcare needs. And number three, we should work to de-link health insurance from employment so if you lose your job, your health insurance goes with you and it is personal, portable and affordable.And I\u2019ll tell you, Bret, I think that\u2019s a much more attractive vision for healthcare than the Washington-drive, top-down Obamacare that is causing so many millions of people to hurt.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Senator Cruz, thank you.Governor Bush, you\u2019ve advocated for statehood for Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rican economy is collapsing under unsustainable debt burden. Only about 1 million of its 4 million residents are currently employed. So should American citizens who you say are already overtaxed, bail out Puerto Rico as well?BUSH: No, they shouldn\u2019t. And I believe that Puerto Rico ought to have the right of self-determination. If I was a Puerto Rican, I\u2019d vote for statehood so that they have full citizenship. They serve in the military. They would have to pay federal taxes. They would \u2014 they would accept the responsibilities of full U.S. citizenship. But they should have the right of determine \u2014 self-determination.Before you get to that, though, Puerto Rico is going to have to deal with the structural problems they face. You know, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a fact that if you can pay for a $79 one-way ticket to Orlando, and you can escape the challenges of a declining economy and high crime rates, you move to Orlando.And a lot of people are doing that. And the spiraling out-of- control requires Puerto Rico to make structural reforms. The federal government can play a role in allowing them to do that, but they should not \u2014 the process of statehood or the status of Puerto Rico won\u2019t be solved until we get to the bigger issue of how you deal with the structural economic problems they\u2019re facing right now.BAIER: Governor Kasich, you\u2019re one of two remaining sitting governors still in the race. Your colleague, Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan is under fire \u2014 he and his administration \u2014 for the Flint, Michigan water crisis and the botched response to it. How would you have handled that?KASICH: Well, you\u2019ve got to be on top of it right away. And, you know, I don\u2019t know all the details of what Rick Snyder has done. I know there have been people who have been fired; people who are being held accountable. But the fact is, every single engine of government has to move when you see a crisis like that.And I\u2019ve had many situations in the state of Ohio where we\u2019ve had to move, whether it\u2019s storms, whether it was a horrible school shooting. There are many crises that come \u2014 a water crisis in Toledo. You\u2019ve got to be on top of it. You\u2019ve got to go the extra mile. You\u2019ve got to work with local communities and you\u2019ve got to work with the federal government.Because you realize that people depending on you. And so, you go the extra mile. But people have to be alert. They have to be alert to problems. And when you see a problem, you must act quickly to get on top of it. And people at home are saying they\u2019ve got a problem, listen to them. Because most of the time, they\u2019re absolutely correct.So the fact is that we work for the people. The people don\u2019t work for us. And we have to have an attitude when we\u2019re in government of serving-hood. That\u2019s what really matters. We serve you. You don\u2019t serve us. We listen to you and \u2014 and then we act.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Senator Rubio, on the issue of climate change, in 2008, you wanted Florida to get ahead of other states and establish a cap- and-trade system, a program for carbon emissions, which many Republicans thought at the time would hurt the Florida economy. Now, you\u2019re a skeptic of climate change science. And in fact, you warn that federal efforts to fight climate change will cost U.S. jobs and hurt the U.S. economy.So why the change?RUBIO: Well, Bret, first that\u2019s not entirely the story. At the time, the liberal governor of Florida, who claimed he was a Republican \u2014 his name was Charlie Crist \u2014 he wanted to impose cap-and-trade on Florida. And I opposed it. I was the first person out of the box that opposed him on it.And then we saw that the leading candidates for president at the time, both the Republican and the Democrats, all supported it. And what we said is, if they\u2019re going to impose this on us, we better prepare to protect the state from it. But I have never supported cap- and-trade and I never thought it was a good idea. And I was clear about that at the time.And I do not believe it\u2019s a good idea now. I do not believe that we have to destroy our economy in order to protect our environment. And especially what these programs are asking us to pass that will do nothing to help the environment, but will be devastating for our economy.When I am president of the United States of America, there will never be any cap-and-trade in the United States.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Thanks, Senator.KELLY: All right. We\u2019re going to move on. Because coming up, immigration, and something you\u2019ve never seen before.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.Stay tuned, right after this break.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Welcome back everyone. Live, in Des Moines, Iowa. Now, we move onto the topic of immigration. Senator Rubio, we\u2019ll start with you. When you ran for Senate in 2010, you made clear that you opposed legalization and citizenship for illegal immigrants. You promised repeatedly that you would oppose it as a U.S. Senator as well. Here are just a few examples. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RUBIO: Never support. Never have and never will support any effort to grant blanket legalization amnesty to folks who have entered, or stayed in this country illegally.(END VIDEO CLIP)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RUBIO: First of all, earned path to citizenship is basically code for amnesty. It\u2019s what they call it. And, the reality of it is this, it is unfair to the people that have legally entered this country to create an alternative for individuals who entered illegally, and knowingly did so.(END VIDEO CLIP)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RUBIO: You cannot grant amnesty. If the American people see us granting amnesty they will never again believe in legal immigration. They will never again support it, and that\u2019s wrong for our country, bad for our future.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Within two years of getting elected you were co-sponsoring legislation to create a path to citizenship, in your words, amnesty. Haven\u2019t you already proven that you cannot be trusted on this issue?RUBIO: No, because if you look at the quote, and it\u2019s very specific. And, it says blanket amnesty, I do not support blanket amnesty...KELLY: ... But, you went on from there...RUBIO: ... I do not support amnesty...KELLY: ... You said more than that, Senator...RUBIO: ... No, I said I do not support blanket amnesty...KELLY: ... You said earned path to citizenship is basically code for amnesty. You...RUBIO: ... It was...KELLY: ... supported earned path to citizenship...RUBIO: ... It absolutely has been, and at the time in the context of that was in 2009, and 2010, where the last effort for legalization was an effort done in the Senate. It was an effort led by several people that provided almost an instant path with very little obstacles moving forward.What I\u2019ve always said is that this issue does need to be solved. They\u2019ve been talking about this issue for 30 years, and nothing ever happens. And, I\u2019m going to tell you exactly how we\u2019re going to deal with it when I am president.Number one, we\u2019re going to keep ISIS out of America. If we don\u2019t know who you are, or why you\u2019re coming, you will not get into the United States.RUBIO: Number two, we\u2019re going to enforce our immigration laws. I am the son and grandson of immigrants. And I know that securing our borders is not anti-immigrant and we will do it.We\u2019ll hire 20,000 new border agents instead of 20,000 new IRS agents. We will finish the 700 miles of fencing and walls our nation needs. We\u2019ll have mandatory E-verify, a mandatory entry/exit tracking system and until all of that is in place and all of that is working and we can prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control, nothing else is going to happen.We are not going to round up and deport 12 million people, but we\u2019re not going to hand out citizenship cards, either. There will be a process. We will see what the American people are willing to support. But it will not be unconstitutional executive orders like the ones Barack Obama has forced on us.KELLY: Governor Bush, do you agree Senator Rubio has not reversed himself on his immigration promise?BUSH: Well, I\u2019m kind of confused because he was the sponsor of the Gang of Eight bill that did require a bunch of thresholds but ultimately allowed for citizenship over an extended period of time. I mean, that\u2019s a fact. And he asked me to support that. And I \u2014 I supported him because I think people, when you\u2019re elected, you need to do things.And he led the charge to finally fix this immigration problem that has existed now for, as Marco says, for 30 years. And then he cut and run because it wasn\u2019t popular amongst conservatives, I guess.Here\u2019s what I believe. And I wrote a book about this called Immigration Wars. You can get it at $2.99 on Amazon. It\u2019s not a bestseller. I can promise you.(LAUGHTER)There won\u2019t be any \u2014 you can get it. It\u2019s affordable for everybody. We should have a path to legal status for the 12 million people that are here illegally. It means, come out from the shadows, pay a fine, earn legal status by working, by paying taxes, learning English. Not committing crimes and earn legal status where you\u2019re not cutting in front of the line for people that are patiently waiting outside.(APPLAUSE) I think that is the \u2014 I think that\u2019s the conservative consensus pragmatic approach to how to solve this problem.RUBIO: May I respond?KELLY: Go ahead, senator.RUBIO: It\u2019s interesting that Jeb mentions the book. That\u2019s the book where you changed your position on immigration because you used to support a path to citizenship.BUSH: So did you.(LAUGHTER)RUBIO: Well, but you changed the \u2014 in the book...BUSH: Yeah. So did you, Marco.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: You wrote a book where you changed your position from a path of citizenship to a path of legalization. And the bottom line is this, we are not going to be able to do anything on this issue until we first bring illegal immigration under control. The American people have been told for 30 years they\u2019re going to enforce the border, they\u2019re going to build a wall and it never gets built and it never happens.It is very clear there will be no progress on this issue in any way, shape or form, until you prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control. And when I\u2019m president, we are going to bring it under control once and for all after 30 years of talking about it.BUSH: Marco, Marco \u2014 he brought up my name. I have supported a consensus approach to solving this problem wherever it came up. and in 2007 it almost passed when my brother was president of the United States. A bipartisan approach got close. Barack Obama actually had the poison pill to stop it then.And when you led the charge with the Gang of Eight, I supported it because you asked me to. I think it\u2019s important for people in elected office to try to forge consensus to solve problems. There\u2019s never going do be perfect bill.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: All right.BUSH: But when you didn\u2019t do that and you ask people to support, you shouldn\u2019t cut and run.RUBIO: But Megyn...BUSH: You should stick with it and that\u2019s exactly what happened. He cut and run. And that\u2019s a tragedy because now...(BELL RINGS)... it\u2019s harder and harder to actually solve this problem.KELLY: All right. This will be the last one.RUBIO: There\u2019s not going to be consensus on this issue until we enforce our immigration laws. That is abundantly clear. You\u2019re not going to be able to ram down the throat of the American people your approach. The only way we\u2019re are going to be able to move forward after two migratory crises with minor, after two unconstitutional executive orders, the only way forward on this issue is to first bring illegal immigration under control. And until that happens there\u2019s not going to be consensus on this issue.KELLY: OK. Let\u2019s move on. Senator Cruz, when Senator Rubio proposed that bill creating a path to citizenship, you proposed an amendment. It would have allowed for legalization but not citizenship. Yes, it would.Pressed last month on why you supported legalization, you claimed that you didn\u2019t. Right? Like you just did. Saw that.(LAUGHTER)You argued that this was just a poison pill amendment, basically it\u2019s something designed to kill the bill and not actually get it through. But that is not, however, how it sounded at the time. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CRUZ: I want this bill to be voted down. I don\u2019t want immigration reform to fail. I want immigration reform to pass. I believe if this amendment were to pass, the chances of this bill passing into law would increase dramatically.I believe if the amendments I introduced were adopted, that the bill would pass. And my effort in introducing them was to find a solution that reflected common ground and that fixed the problem.CRUZ: If the proponents of this bill actually demonstrate a commitment not to politics, not to campaigning all the time, but to actually fixing this problem, to finding a middle ground. That would fix the problem, and also allow, for those 11 million people who are here illegally, a legal status, with citizenship off the table.KELLY: Was that all an act? It was pretty convincing.CRUZ: You know, the amendment you\u2019re talking about is one sentence \u2014 it\u2019s 38 words. Anyone can go online at tedcruz.org and read exactly what it said. In those 38 words, it said anyone here illegally is permanently ineligible for citizenship. It didn\u2019t say a word about legalization. I introduced...KELLY: But the bill allowed both. The bill you were amending allowed citizenship and legalization.CRUZ: But \u2014 but Megyn, the bill was 1,000 pages. I introduced a series of amendments, each designed to fix problems in the bill. The fact that each amendment didn\u2019t fix every problem didn\u2019t mean that I supported the rest of the bill.And I\u2019ll tell you who supported my amendment \u2014 Jeff Sessions, the strongest opponent of amnesty in the United States Congress. And he did so because taking citizenship off the table was important, and it revealed the hypocrisy of the proponents of this bill, who were looking for votes.(APPLAUSE)... we have the tools in federal law to do this now. We can build the fence. We can triple the border patrol. We can end sanctuary cities by cutting off...(BELL RINGS)... funding to them. We can end welfare for those here illegally. And what is missing is the political will, because too many Democrats and, sadly, too many Republicans don\u2019t want to solve this problem. If I am elected president...(BELL RINGS)... we will secure the border...KELLY: OK, sir.CRUZ: ... and we will end the illegal immigration.KELLY: Senator Paul.(APPLAUSE)You know how Washington works. Do you buy that?PAUL: I was there and I saw the debate. I saw Ted Cruz say, \u201cwe\u2019ll take citizenship off the table, and then the bill will pass, and I\u2019m for the bill.\u201dThe bill would involve legalization. He can\u2019t have it both ways. But what is particularly insulting, though, is that he is the king of saying, \u201cyou\u2019re for amnesty.\u201d Everybody\u2019s for amnesty except for Ted Cruz.But it\u2019s a falseness, and that\u2019s an authenticity problem \u2014 that everybody he knows is not as perfect as him because we\u2019re all for amnesty. I was for legalization. I think, frankly, if you have border security, you can have legalization. So was Ted, but now he says it wasn\u2019t so. That\u2019s not true.KELLY: Go ahead, sir.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: You know, John Adams famously said, \u201cfacts are are stubborn things.\u201d The facts are are very, very simple. When that battle was waged, my friend Senator Rubio chose to stand with Barack Obama and Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer and support amnesty.And I stood alongside Jeff Sessions and Steve King, and we led the fight against amnesty. And if you want to know who\u2019s telling the truth, you should look and ask people like Jeff Sessions and Steve King and Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin, all of whom say, as Jeff Sessions said, responding to these false attacks just recently in Alabama \u2014 he said, \u201cif it wasn\u2019t for Ted Cruz, the Gang of Eight Rubio/Schumer bill would have passed. But because Ted stood up and helped lead the effort, millions rose up to kill it.(BELL RINGS)(APPLAUSE)KELLY: Senator Rubio, even Chuck Schumer, your co-sponsor of that bill...RUBIO: Yeah, but let me respond...KELLY: ... agrees with Ted Cruz on this. RUBIO: ... no, I understand, but let me respond. I (ph) was mentioned on this \u2014 in this answer, and so I\u2019m going to respond this way.This is the lie that Ted\u2019s campaign is built on, and Rand touched upon it \u2014 that he\u2019s the most conservative guy, and everyone else is a \u2014 you know, everyone else is a rhino.The truth is, Ted, throughout this campaign, you\u2019ve been willing to say or do anything in order to get votes. Ted, you worked for George W. Bush\u2019s campaign...(BOOING)You \u2014 you \u2014 you helped design George W. Bush\u2019s \u2014 you helped design George W. Bush\u2019s immigration policy. And then, when you got to the Senate, you did an interview with CBS News \u2014 I (ph) wasn\u2019t even part of the video \u2014 where you said, on the issue of people that are here illegally, \u201cwe can reach a compromise.\u201dAnd then in the committee, you said, \u201cI want to bring people out of the shadows.\u201d(BELL RINGS)Now you want to trump Trump on immigration. But you can\u2019t \u2014 we\u2019re not gonna beat Hillary Clinton with someone who\u2019s willing to say or do anything to win an election.KELLY: Go ahead, Senator Cruz.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: You know, I like Marco. He\u2019s very charming. He\u2019s very smooth. But the facts are simple. When he ran for election in the state of Florida, he told the people of Florida, \u201cif you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty.\u201dWhen I ran in Texas, I told the people of Texas, \u201cif you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty.\u201d We both made the identical promises. But when we came to Washington, we made a different choice.Marco made the choice to go the direction of the major donors \u2014 to support amnesty because he thought it was politically advantageous.(BELL RINGS)I honored my commitments, and as president, I will honor every commitment that I make to the men and women of this country.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: All right.CHRISTIE: Megyn? KELLY: Go ahead, Governor Christie.CHRISTIE: I want to ask the people of the audience. Like, I\u2019m standing here, I \u2014 I watched the video of Senator Cruz. I watched the video of Senator Rubio. I heard what they said. And this is why you need to send someone from outside of Washington to Washington. (APPLAUSE)CHRISTIE: I feel like...(APPLAUSE)... I feel like I need \u2014 I feel like I need a Washington to English dictionary converter, right?(LAUGHTER)I mean, I heard what they both said, I saw it on the video. And the fact is this is what makes a difference when you\u2019re a governor. You can change your mind. Ted can change his mind. Marco can change his mind. It\u2019s perfectly legal in this country to change your mind. But when you\u2019re a governor, you have to admit it. You can\u2019t hide behind parliamentary tricks. That\u2019s the difference, and that\u2019s the kind of leader we need in the White House. Stop the Washington bull and let\u2019s get things done.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: Let\u2019s go to a Youtube question. Let\u2019s get to a Youtube question. This is a question from a Youtube creator with over 2 million subscribers. Watch.QUESTION: I\u2019m Dulce Candy, a Youtube creator who immigrated to the United States from Mexico when I was a little girl. Since then, I am proud to say I served in the armed forces in Iraq, became a citizen and I am now an entrepreneur.There are many immigrants who contribute positively to the American economy, but some of the comments in the campaign make us question our place in this country. If America does not seem like a welcoming place for immigrant entrepreneurs, will the American economy suffer?KELLY: Dr. Carson, that\u2019s one \u2014 that one\u2019s for you.CARSON: Oh, great.(LAUGHTER)As I said before, we are a land of immigrants, but we have to be intelligent about the way that we form our immigration policies, and that\u2019s one of the reasons that I have called on us to declare war on the Islamic State because we need to reorient our immigration policies and our visa policies for people who are coming into this country because there are many people out there who want to destroy us.Now, I recognize that the vast majority of people coming in here probably are not those kinds of people, but that\u2019s not good enough. If you\u2019ve got 10 people coming to your house and you know one of them is a terrorist, you\u2019re probably going to keep them all out.You know, we probably have to figure out a way to make sure that we keep America safe.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: Can I \u2014 can I \u2014 I just...KELLY: Go ahead.BUSH: That beautiful young woman who\u2019s an entrepreneur who served in the military, first of all, is deserving of our respect for service in the military and the fact that she\u2019s an entrepreneur.(APPLAUSE)And we should be a welcoming nation. Our identity is not based on race or ethnicity, it\u2019s based on a set of shared values. That\u2019s American citizenship. And Dulce Candy \u2014 a pretty cool name, actually \u2014 that is now an entrepreneur over Youtube is part of that American spirit, and we should celebrate it as conservatives. That\u2019s what we believe in.You can \u2014 you can deal with the threat of terror and also recognize that this country should be aspirational across the board.RUBIO: And I think that\u2019s the false choice...(APPLAUSE)... that\u2019s the \u2014 that\u2019s the false choice in this whole debate about immigration. Of course, we\u2019re going to be a nation of immigrants. By the way, no nation on earth is more generous than America is. Every single year close to a million people emigrate to the United States legally. There\u2019s no nation on earth that comes close to that number.I think the only argument is are we a sovereign country, are we not allowed to choose who comes in, when they come in and how they come in? And that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening now.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: All right.RUBIO: I think the other problem is we have a legal immigration system that\u2019s outdated, it\u2019s primarily based on whether you have family members living here. In the 21st century, it has to be more of a merit-based system, and that is why our legal immigration system is in need of modernization. And we will always celebrate legal immigration like Dulce\u2019s great story.KELLY: All right. We\u2019re moving on.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Gentlemen, we\u2019re going to turn now to what we call electability, issues that you\u2019re either facing in the primaries or issues that you\u2019re certainly going to face in a general election. So you may not be altogether unhappy if you\u2019re not included in this round.(LAUGHTER)Senator Cruz, you pride yourself on standing up to the D.C. cartel, but as we\u2019ve seen to a certain degree tonight, there\u2019s a price for standing up to the D.C. cartel. Thirteen Republican senators have endorsed other candidates, none have endorsed you.You \u2014 twice last year, you asked for a colleague to second a motion, a routine courtesy on the Senate floor, and no senator would do it. Top GOP officials worry that if you\u2019re at the top of the ticket \u2014 some officials \u2014 that not only will you lose the White House, but it will tank the ticket all the way down the line.The question is does your style sometimes get in the way of your ability to get things done, sir?CURZ: Well, Chris, you are exactly right that I am not the candidate of career politicians in Washington. (APPLAUSE)This is a grassroots campaign and, you know, when I ran for senate in Texas, I told the people of Texas that I\u2019m not going there to go along to get along. Washington is broken.And the people I have been accountable to every single day in the Senate are the 27 million Texans who I represent and I made a promise to them that I make to you today, which is, if I am elected, every single day I will do two things: tell the truth, and do what I said I would do.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Thank you.KELLY: Governor bush, poll after poll shows you running among the worst in your party against Hillary Clinton. Even Mitt Romney said that a Bush v. Clinton head-to-head would be too easy for the Democrats.Yet still you and the super PACs supporting you continue to blanket the airwaves with cutting ads, not against Mrs. Clinton, but against your fellow Republicans, especially Senator Rubio.Do these attacks do more harm than good by targeting those candidates who appear to have the best chance of defeating Mrs. Clinton?BUSH: Well, first of all, I\u2019ve seen polls where I\u2019m beating Hillary Clinton pretty regularly.And I believe I can, because I have a proven record, a record of accomplishment, a record of cutting taxes, of shrinking the government, of reforming education, of challenging the status quo, eliminating career civil service protections, shrinking the government workforce by 11 percent, but leading the nation in job growth. That\u2019s the record of accomplishment that should be taken to Hillary Clinton, who has no record of accomplishment. So I\u2019m confident if I win this nomination, I will aggressively go against her and beat her.As it relates to the super PACs, I have no control over that. And this is beanbag compared to what the Clinton hit machine is going to do to the Republican nominee. The simple fact is, we all have a record. It all will be scrutinized. There\u2019s give and take. It\u2019s called the politics. And that\u2019s the way it is.I\u2019m running hard and I believe I\u2019ll be the Republican nominee and I\u2019ll be the one best suited to beat Hillary Clinton, who should not be president of the United States.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Senator Rubio, first before I ask you a question, any response to Governor Bush?RUBIO: Well, I believe, and I know that if Iowa helps make me the Republican nominee, I will defeat Hillary Clinton. Hillary doesn\u2019t want to run against me, but I cannot wait to run against her. And I cannot wait to earn the opportunity to do it because she cannot be the president of the United States.She wants to put Barack Obama on the Supreme Court of the United States of America. She said that here in Iowa just two days ago. That would be a disaster for this country.So I hope and pray and cannot wait until this state and others give me an opportunity to serve this party as its nominee because I will defeat Hillary Clinton.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)BAIER: Now let\u2019s talk about electability, Senator. TIME magazine once called you \u201cthe Republican savior.\u201d Rush Limbaugh and others said you likely will be president some day.But if you look at the recent average of polls in your home state of Florida, you\u2019re in third trailing Donald trump by 24 points. If the people who know you best have you there, why should the rest of the country elect you?RUBIO: Well, let me be clear about one thing, there\u2019s only one savior and it\u2019s not me. It\u2019s Jesus Christ who came down to earth and died for our sins.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: And so \u2014 and I\u2019ve always made that clear about that cover story.As far as the polls are concerned, Iowa, on Monday night you\u2019re going to go to a caucus site and you\u2019ll be the first Americans that vote in this election. You will be the first Americans that get to answer the fundamental question, what comes next for this country after seven disastrous years of Barack Obama?And let me tell you what the answer better not be. It better not be Bernie Sanders. Bernie Sanders is a socialist. I think Bernie Sanders is good candidate for president of Sweden.(LAUGHTER)We don\u2019t want to be Sweden. We want to be the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)And Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being the commander-in-chief of the United States. In fact, one of her first acts as president may very well be to pardon herself because Hillary Clinton...(LAUGHTER)Hillary Clinton stored classified information on her private server. And Hillary Clinton lied to the families of those four brave Americans who lost their life in Benghazi. And anyone who lies to the families of Americans who have died in the service of this country can never be commander-in-chief of the United States.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Thank you, Senator.WALLACE: Governor Christie, two of your former top aides go on trial in May for fraud and conspiracy in the \u201cBridge-gate\u201d case, the politically motivated closure of lanes to the George Washington Bridge.Another former aide who has already pleaded guilty and will likely testify for the government, as you know, says that you knew about this whole deal. Can the GOP take the chance of nominating you with this scandal still out there, sir?CHRISTIE: Sure, because there has been three different investigations and proven that I knew nothing. And the fact is that what I did do, what I did do from the beginning, Chris, as soon as I found out about it, I fired the people who were responsible. And that\u2019s what you expect from a leader.CHRISTIE: And, I\u2019ll tell you something else. I inherited a state in New Jersey that was downtrodden, and beaten by liberal democratic policies, high taxation, high regulation. And, this year, in 2015, New Jersey\u2019s had the best year of job growth that our state has ever had in the last 15 years. That\u2019s because we\u2019ve put conservative policies in place.And, I\u2019ll tell you one other thing, you know why the Republican party will want to take a chance on me? Because they know that Hillary Clinton will never be prosecuted by this justice department, and they\u2019re going to want to put a former federal prosecutor on the stage to prosecute her next September. And, there is no one on this stage better prepared to prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton than I am.I will be ready. I will take her on, and when I take her on I guarantee you one thing, she will never get within 10 miles of the White House. The days for the Clintons in public housing are over.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Welcome back, everybody. Let\u2019s get back to the questions. Chris?WALLACE: Gentlemen, almost 60% of Republican caucus-goers identify themselves as Evangelicals, so I\u2019d like to spend a few minutes exploring social issues.Governor Kasich, you talk a good deal about your faith. In fact, you say it played a role in your decision to expand Medicaid, and you say that when you meet Saint Peter at the Pearly Gates, he\u2019s going to ask what you did for the poor, not what you did to keep government small.Senator Cruz is on the opposite side of this issue from you, so does that mean that you\u2019re getting in and he isn\u2019t?(LAUGHTER)KASICH: No. You know, Chris, here\u2019s what happened with Medicaid in my state. We took the growth of Medicaid from over 10 percent in my second budget to 2.5 percent, without cutting off one person or cutting one benefit, because we \u2014 we innovated the government.And now mom and dad can stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home. And then we decided we could bring $14 billion of our money \u2014 I mean, Washington doesn\u2019t have any money. It was our money, and we brought them back to tend to the mentally ill. Because I don\u2019t think they ought to live in prison or live under a bridge; to treat the drug-addicted so they\u2019re not in an in-and-out-of- the-door policy out of the prisons; and to help the working poor so they don\u2019t live in emergency rooms.How has it worked? Well, we have treated the drug-addicted in our prisons and we released them in to the community, and our recidivism rate is less than 20 percent. That\u2019s basically bordering on a miracle because of our great prison director. The mentally ill? They\u2019ve been stepped on for too long in this society, and we are beginning to treat them.In terms of my faith, look, all I say is that when I study scripture, I know that people who live in the shadows need to have a chance. But I\u2019m not deciding that anybody\u2019s got to make these decisions the way that I do, on the basis of what I do. But what \u2014 I will tell you this. The time has come to stop ignoring the mentally ill in this country and begin to treat them and get them on their feet, along with, of course, with treating the drug-addicted.(APPLAUSE)Because we don\u2019t want them in and out \u2014 we don\u2019t want them in and out of the prisons. Give people a chance. We talked about criminal justice reform. We\u2019ve enacted it in our state. Look, the conservative message is economic growth and along with economic growth goes opportunity for everybody in America. Everybody ought to have a chance to be able to rise to their God-given purpose.And that is what we have done in Ohio. We\u2019re running surpluses. We\u2019re up 400,000 jobs. And guess what? The formula is working. I\u2019d suggest people take a look at it.Thank you.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Gentlemen, we had a case study on religious liberty just this last summer. A county clerk in Kentucky named Kim Davis refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples after the Supreme Court ruling, saying that it violated her religious beliefs.Governor Christie, you said that she must follow the law or be moved to another job that would be in keeping with her conscience. But some conservatives say that that violates her religious liberty.CHRISTIE: No, what I said, Chris, was that the law needs to be followed. And that someone in that office has to do their job. So if Ms. Davis wanted to step aside and get rid of her ability to be able to do that, there should be someone else in that office who it didn\u2019t violate their conscience so they could follow the law of the state of Kentucky.I never said that Ms. Davis should either lose her job or that she had to do it. But what I did say was that the person who came in for the license needed to get it. And so if there\u2019s someone in that organization, and it turns out there was, who was willing to be able to do that, that\u2019s what we should do.But just as importantly, and I agree with what John said. You know, we all have our own individual interpretations of our faith. And here\u2019s the problem with what\u2019s going on around the world. The radical Islamic jihadists, what they want to do is impose their faith upon each and every one of us \u2014 every one of us. And the reason why this war against them is so important is that very basis of religious liberty.They want everyone in this country to follow their religious beliefs the way they do. They do not want us to exercise religious liberty. That\u2019s why as commander in chief, I will take on ISIS, not only because it keeps us safe, but because it allows us to absolutely conduct our religious affairs the way we find in our heart and in our souls. As a Catholic, that\u2019s what I want to do. And no matter what your faith is, that\u2019s what I want you to be able to do.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Thank you, sir.Senator Rubio, during the last debate, you said Governor Christie had changed his position and his mind on gun control, on common core, and backing President Obama\u2019s nomination of Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court. He said you\u2019re wrong on the facts and you can\u2019t, quote, \u201cslime your way to the White House.\u201d I assume in the last two weeks, you\u2019ve done some fact-checking. Do you want to take anything back?It is not because of the tax writeoff. It is because in this nation, we are influenced by Judeo-Christian values that teach us to care for the less fortunate, to reach out to the needy, to love our neighbor. This is what\u2019s made our nation so special.And you should hope that our next president is someone that is influence by their faith. Because if your faith causes you to care for the less fortunate, it is something you want to see in your public figures. And when I\u2019m president, I can tell you this, my faith will not just influence the way I\u2019ll govern as president, it will influence the way I live my life.RUBIO: Because in the end, my goal is not simply to live on this earth for 80 years, but to live an eternity with my creator. And I will always allow my faith to influence everything I do.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Thank you, senator.Senator Paul, in May on the campaign trail you, said you didn\u2019t get into politics to fight about abortion. You said you were more concerned about the national debt. Your answer is to turn abortion back to the states the way it was before Roe v. Wade.Does that mean that if a liberal state, let\u2019s say, wants to make abortion legal, that you\u2019re okay with that and what do you say to conservative voters who believe deeply that abortion is murder?PAUL: You know, I think abortion is always wrong. I\u2019ve supported a variety of solutions, both state as well as federal. In fact, just last week, I introduced the Life at Conception act, which would say that the 14th amendment would defend an individual even in the womb.But I think on the broader question of religion and politics, you know, I think liberty, itself requires a virtue \u2014 requires a virtuous people. In fact, Washington said that democracy requires a virtuous people.Oz Guinness, the theologian, said that liberty requires restraint but the only restraint consistent with liberty is self-restraint. There\u2019s a lot packed into that statement. But the bottom line is we must have virtue, we must have a religious bearing as a nation. The government is not always going to save us and it\u2019s not always going to come from government.But if we don\u2019t know right and wrong, I think we have lost our way. I think we become unmoored and I think without the religious foundation that guides us all, I think we have a great risk of going horribly in the wrong direction.WALLLACE: Sir, just 30 seconds to answer my specific...(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Just 30 seconds to answer my specific question. Do you favor the idea that abortion should be a states\u2019 rights issue and if a liberal state wants to make it legal, that that\u2019s their choice? Yes or no?PAUL: Both. No, both the federal and a state approach. I have said that we could leave it to the states but I\u2019ve also introduced a federal solution as well. So the federal solution would be the Life at Conception act which is an act that would federalize the issue.But I\u2019ve also said for the most part, these issues would be left back to the states. So there might be an occasion if we did overturn Roe v. Wade \u2014 Roe v. Wade nationalized the issue. If you had the court reverse Roe v. Wade, it would become a state issue once again.I think it would be better the more \u2014 the less abortions we have, so the more states that we have that made abortion illegal, the better, as far as trying to save and preserve lives.WALLACE: Thank you, sir.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Gentlemen.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: I\u2019d like to ask you a few questions about foreign policy broadly.Dr. Carson, many experts believe Russian leader Vladimir Putin has greater ideas, bigger designs for the region beyond Russia\u2019s actions inside Ukraine. Fast forward to February 2017 and it is President Carson, and Russian uniformed commandos cross the Estonian border and they occupy a city in Estonia. Estonia, a member of NATO, essentially invokes Article IV, an attack on one is an attack on all. What do you do?CARSON: Look, first of all, I recognize that Vladimir Putin is an opportunist and he\u2019s a bully, and we have to face him down. And I would \u2014 first of all, face him down in that whole region, the whole Baltic region. I think we need to put in some armored brigades there. We only have one or two. We need much more than that. We need to be doing military exercises if not only Estonia but Latvia and Lithuania. They\u2019re terrified by the saber rattling. I think we ought to put in our missile defense system.I think we ought to give Ukraine offensive weapons and I think we ought to fight them on the economic basis because Putin is a one- horse country: oil and energy. And we ought to fight them on that level.We ought to be helping in terms of the technology for fracking, keeping the price low, quite frankly, because that\u2019s what\u2019s keeping him contained. So, yes, I\u2019d absolutely would go in if he attacked. I think on Article IV of NATO, we would definitely protect all of our allies.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Gentlemen, you\u2019ve all said that the Iran nuclear deal is a bad one.Senator Rubio, you were among the candidates who\u2019ve said you would tear it up on day one. But as you know, Iran has already received tens of millions of dollars \u2014 tens of billions of dollars in this deal and has quickly reestablished ties economically with Europe.The major concessions, in other words, are up front in this deal. So should you win by the time you take office, the remaining parts of the deal would be the constraints on Iran. So why blow up those constraints on day one, letting Iran off the hook?RUBIO: Well, let me first describe Iran because they\u2019re not just a normal nation state. And we have no quarrel with the Iranian people. But the Iranian leader, their supreme leader is a radical Shia cleric who has an apocalyptic vision of the future. RUBIO: He views himself not simply as the leader of Iran, but as the leader of all Muslims \u2014 all Shia Muslims on the planet. And they have a desire not simply to conquer the Middle East and to become the dominant power in that region, but ultimately to be able to hold America hostage.That is why they\u2019re building an \u2014 right now, developing long- range missiles capable of reaching the United States, and that is why there\u2019s going \u2014 they\u2019re going to use those $100 billion to expand their conventional capabilities and to one day buy or build a nuclear weapon.We will \u2014 when I am president of the United States, on my first day in office, we are canceling the deal with Iran, and nations will have to make a choice. They can do business with Iran, or they can do business with America, and I am very confident they\u2019re going to choose America before they choose the Iranian economy.BAIER: Governor Kasich, you\u2019ve said that Marco Rubio is wrong...(APPLAUSE)... that Senator Rubio is wrong with tearing it up on day one.KASICH: Look, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in ten months. And if I were president of the United States right now, I\u2019d be lining up our allies to say that, if one crossed T or one dotted I does not occur, they are \u2014 violate the agreement, we slap back on sanctions.We can slap on sanctions alone, on day one, but it\u2019s not gonna be anywhere near as effective. But the president needs to be laying the groundwork right now for the ability to slap those sanctions back on worldwide.And I\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019m worried about \u2014 I\u2019m worried about money. You read about all the companies now that are doing business \u2014 about to do business in Iran, and if we don\u2019t get this settled now, with other countries in the world, about sanctions, then Iran could violate that agreement, and we\u2019re the only ones putting the sanctions on.We need to move aggressively now. But I would say this to you, Bret. Number one, if they violate it, we need to move against them. And number two, if we find out they\u2019re developing a nuclear weapon and we know how to get to it, we\u2019re gonna go take it out. That is what we have to do. We cannot let things get farther down the road, like we did with North Korea.BAIER: But Governor Kasich, you know that the most powerful sanctions are the multilateral ones.KASICH: That\u2019s right. Yes.BAIER: And these European countries are already reestablishing these ties.KASICH: I know, Bret.BAIER: They don\u2019t want...KASICH: But Bret, here\u2019s the problem. You take a look at the \u2014 at Belgium. I talked to a diplomat from Belgium. I said, \u201chow\u2019s it going?\u201d He said, \u201cwe have the military in the streets right now. We never dreamt we\u2019d ever see it.\u201dSee, I think there is an opportunity to bring the world together. The Turks are being threatened. We know about the French. We know about the Belgians. We know about the Brits. Everybody is under fire and under attack, and we have to stand together as an alliance.So actually, the opportunity is there, because of the threat to all of these countries, to bring all of us together...(BELL RINGS)... and say there is something more important than money. It is the future of the world and the future of our children and grandchildren. That\u2019s the kind of leadership this country needs. It has not been in effect during the administration of Barack Obama.And that\u2019s only the beginning of the failures that they have committed, not only in the Middle East, but all over the world, including Russia and China.BAIER: Governor, thank you. Governor Christie...(APPLAUSE)... Libya is the newest base for ISIS. Just today, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said ISIS is consolidating their footprint there and also setting up training facilities.So if you were president, would you deploy U.S. troops to Libya to take out ISIS there?CHRISTIE: Bret, let me tell you, this is another one of those places where Hillary Clinton has so much to answer for, and why she is completely unqualified to be commander in chief.In a previous Democratic debate, Martha Raddatz, three times, asked Hillary Clinton about the failure in Libya, a policy that she took credit for, and said, \u201cwhat is your measure of responsibility, Madam Secretary, for the failure in Libya?\u201d Three times, she refused to answer the question, because she refuses to be held accountable for anything that goes wrong. If it had gone right, believe me, she would have been running around to be able to take credit for it.Here\u2019s what I\u2019d do. This is about the bigger, broader war against ISIS. We need to bring together our European and our Sunni Arab allies, and we need to develop a strategy together to take on ISIS every place that it is around the world, so that together, all of us can take ISIS out, destroy it, and then move on to come back to our country, protect our homeland security and make sure that the American people are safe.As president of the United States, that is exactly what I will do.BAIER: Thank you, Governor.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Welcome back to Des Moines. Let\u2019s resume the debate. Megyn?KELLY: Senator Paul, you have suggested that former President Bill Clinton\u2019s history with women is fair game in this campaign. How do you answer those who say you don\u2019t hold the sins of the husband against the wife?PAUL: You know, I\u2019ve never really brought this up unless asked the question, but I have responded to the question. I don\u2019t blame Hillary Clinton at all for this. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s responsible for his behavior. But I do think that her position as promoting women\u2019s rights and fairness to women in the workplace, that if what Bill Clinton did any CEO in our country did with an intern, with a 22-year- old, 21-year-old intern in their office, they would be fired. They would never be hired again.(APPLAUSE)Fired, never hired again and probably shunned in their community. And the thing is, she can\u2019t be a champion of women\u2019s rights at the same time she\u2019s got this that is always lurking out there, this type of behavior. So it is difficult.KELLY: Of her husband\u2019s?PAUL: Yeah. But I combine this also with the millions upon millions of dollars they\u2019ve taken from regimes in the Middle East who treat women like cattle.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: We have another question from one of Youtube\u2019s top creators. Here it is.QUESTION: I\u2019m Nabela Noor. I\u2019m a Muslim American born and raised in the U.S. who creates beauty and lifestyle videos on Youtube.In 2015, the number of hate crimes against Muslims in the U.S. has tripled, and on social media, where I spend a lot of time, I\u2019ve seen many attacks directed towards fellow Muslims. This culture of hatred is only driving ISIS to radicalize, recruit and incite violence.As president, what would you do to address this toxic climate and promote increased tolerance in the United States?WALLACE: Governor Bush, how do you answer Nabela?BUSH: Well first of all, I think it\u2019s important that when we\u2019re running for the highest office in the land that we recognize that we\u2019re living in dangerous times and we have to be serious about it, that our words have consequences.Donald Trump, for example \u2014 I\u2019m glad \u2014 I mentioned his name again just if anybody was missing him... (LAUGHTER)BUSH: ... Mr. Trump believed that in reaction to people\u2019s fears that we should ban all Muslims. Well, that creates an environment that\u2019s toxic in our own country. Nobela (ph) is a rising entrepreneur. She wants to pursue the American dream. She\u2019s an American citizen. She should not feel uncomfortable about her citizenship. She\u2019s not the threat. The threat is Islamic terrorism.We need to focus our energies there, not these broad, blanket, kind of statements that will make it harder for us to deal with ISIS. We need to deal with ISIS in the caliphate. We need a strategy to destroy ISIS there. You can\u2019t do that without the cooperation of the Muslim world because they\u2019re as threatened as we are.So, I think it\u2019s important for us to be careful about the language we use, which is why I\u2019ve been critical of Donald Trump. Disparaging women, disparaging hispanics, that\u2019s not a sign of strength. Making fun of disabled people...(BELL RINGING)BUSH: ... We\u2019re never going to win elections if we don\u2019t have a more broader unifying message.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Governor, thank you. Senator Cruz, change of subject. You called for an end to the renewable fuel standards which mandate that refineries blend biofuels, including ethanol into gasoline. As you well know, ethanol\u2019s a big industry in this state, $10 billion dollars a year.Last week, Terry Branstad, the popular Governor of Iowa...(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: ... Who is in the hall tonight, said that you\u2019re bankrolled by big oil, and that Iowa voters would be making a mistake supporting you. Why should those voters side with you over the six- term governor of the state, sir?CRUZ: Well, Chris, I\u2019m glad to discuss my views on ethanol and energy. I think God has blessed this country with enormous natural resources, and we should pursue all of the above. We should be developing oil, and gas, and coal, and nuclear, and wind, and solar, and ethanol, and biofuels. But, I don\u2019t believe that Washington should be picking winners and losers. And, I think there should be no mandates, and no subsidies whatsoever.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: And, indeed, my tax plan that I\u2019ve introduced, it\u2019s available on our website. It\u2019s a simple flat tax for everyone. It\u2019ll produce enormous economic growth, and it eliminates every mandate, every subsidy, so there\u2019s no subsidies for oil and gas, no subsidies for anyone.Now, it is true that there are a bunch of lobbyists, and a bunch of Democrats in this state spending millions of dollars trying to convince the people of Iowa that I somehow oppose ethanol. It\u2019s not true. I have introduced legislation that would phase out the ethanol mandate over five years, but that is in the context of having no mandates whatsoever for anyone.And, I would not that there\u2019s a much more important government regulation to ethanol, and that\u2019s the EPA\u2019s blend wall that makes it illegal to sell mid-level blends of ethanol in gasoline. I will...(BELL RINGING)CRUZ: ... Tear down the EPA\u2019s blend wall which will enable ethanol to expand its market share by up to 60%, all without mandates. All without any government mandates whatsoever through the marketplace. And, I\u2019ll note finally, Chris, there is a reason that Iowa\u2019s Congressman Steve King, perhaps the fiercest defender of farmers in this state, is sharing my campaign. Because he understands that I\u2019m committed to a fair, and level playing field for every energy source without lobbyists, and without Washington picking winners and losers.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Dr. Carson, I\u2019d like to ask you about exactly that issue. Where are you on the mandatory ethanol standard, and precisely this question. Should government be in the business of picking winners and losers, or should it be left to the market place?CARSON: Well, as anyone knows who\u2019s been listening to me, you know? I\u2019m very much against the government being involved in every aspect of our lives, you know? We last year there was an additional 81,000 pages of government regulations. If you stack that up it would be a three-story building. This is absolutely absurd. And, they\u2019ve insinuated themselves into everything.Now, as far as the renewable fuel standard is concerned, certain promises were made, certain government contracts were issued which extend all the way into the year 2022, and I believe that it\u2019s probably unfair to withdraw the rug because people have invested money. People have invested a lot of energy into that.But, you know, we are blessed with tremendous energy in this nation, and we need to be talking for new sources of energy. Seventy percent of our population lives by costly (ph). What about hydroelectric power? We can develop that, you know? We have so much natural gas now, and we can liquify it, and we can transfer it across the sea so we can make Europe dependent on us instead of Putin \u2014 put him back in his little box where he belongs.CARSON: Those are the kinds of things that we ought to be doing. And, you know, take advantage of the tremendous opportunities in energy that God has given us, not get involved in these little petty arguments.And we can get a lot of them out if we get the government out of our lives.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Doctor, thank you.BAIER: Coming up, closing statements from the candidates as our debate continues, live, from Des Moines, Iowa.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Welcome back, everybody. And now, it is time for closing statements. The candidates each get 30 seconds.And we begin with Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.PAUL: Well, thanks for having me. It\u2019s great to be back.(APPLAUSE)I\u2019m an eye surgeon from Bowling Green, Kentucky, I miss doing eye surgery, still get to do a little bit. Did a couple of cataract surgeries over Christmas holidays. Got to go to Haiti last year. I\u2019ve gotten to do some incredible things. Got to be on the floor of the Senate. And it has been amazing to me.But the thing that is most important to me and caused me to run for office is I\u2019m worried about the country and how much debt we\u2019re adding. And I am the one true fiscal conservative who will look at all spending. And that\u2019s the only way we\u2019ll ever balance our budget.Thank you.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: Ohio Governor Kasich.KASICH: You know, one of our biggest national security issues is the world looks at us some time, and we look at each other and say, why can\u2019t we solve problems? Well, I\u2019ve got news for you, we can. We can in fact create jobs and provide job security. We can create a situation where wages begin to rise. We can create a situation for our children to be able to get a decent job to pay down their college debt. We can re-assume our role in the world.But all of this has to come together when we have a positive attitude, an optimistic approach, an ability for us to set the tune as conservatives, to invite other people in to be part of that orchestra. KASICH: You see, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of the day, I\u2019m an optimist(BELL RINGS)Because I\u2019ve seen so many things get accomplished in my lifetime. And we can do it again together, all of us, to strengthen this country, work together. Thank you.(APPLAUSE) BAIER: New Jersey governor, Chris Christie.CHRISTIE: On September 11, my wife was two blocks from the World Trade Center. When those buildings came down, she was trapped in her building and I didn\u2019t hear from her over six hours.We have three children, eight, five and one. And I had to confront the possibility of being a single parent. Terrorism in this country scares everyone. And the fact is that we need a commander-in- chief who not only understands how to protect us, but feels in here what it means to face the possibility of loss.I\u2019ve faced it. I\u2019ve prosecuted terrorists. I have made the decisions that need to be made as a governor to protect us and as president of the United States, no one will keep this country safer than I will.BAIER: Thank you governor.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. Governor.BUSH: We desperately need a conservative leader as president of the United States. I have a proven record as governor of the state of Florida, as a conservative leader. And I also have detailed plans to fix the mess in Washington, D.C.As president I will restore and rebuild our military, restore the alliances and keep us safe. And as our party\u2019s nominee, I will defeat Hillary Clinton in November. I ask for your support on the caucuses come Monday night and I will make you proud as our party\u2019s nominee. Thank you very much.(APPLAUSE) WALLACE: Dr. Ben Carson.CARSON: I want to thank the people of Iowa for being so welcoming to me. Please think of our founding fathers as you listen. We the people of the United States in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare and secure the benefits of liberty to ourselves and our prosperity, do ordain and establish this constitution of the United States of America. Folks, it\u2019s not too late. Enough said.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Florida Senator Marco Rubio.RUBIO: The bible commands us to let our light shine on the world. For over 200 years, America\u2019s light has been shining on the world and the world has never been the same again. But now, that light is dimming a little, after seven years of Barack Obama. And that\u2019s why Monday night, what will happen here in Iowa is so important.I\u2019m asking you for your vote. Caucus for me on Monday night because if I am your nominee, I will unite this party and I will defeat Hillary Clinton and when I\u2019m president, America\u2019s light will shine again and the 21 century will be a new American century.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Thank you senator.KELLY: Texas Senator, Ted Cruz. Senator.CRUZ: Ninety-three hours. The media noise will soon be over and it\u2019s now for the men and women of Iowa to decide. Our country is in crisis. We\u2019re worried the future of our children and we\u2019ve have been burned over and over again.The central question in this race is trust. Who do you know will kill the terrorists, defend the constitution and repeal Obamacare? Who do you know will stop amnesty and secure the borders? Who do you know will defend life, marriage and religious liberty? Examine our records, pray on it and I will be honored if you and your family will come caucus for us on Monday night.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: Gentlemen, thank you all so much for being here tonight. We appreciate it greatly. And that does it for the seventh Republican primary debate of the 2016 presidential race. But we\u2019re not done. The Kelly file starts in a moment and guess who is going to be there? Senator Ted Cruz.WALLACE: And don\u2019t forget, after all the talk, the first voting of the 2016 campaign happens in just four days. The first Americans to vote, the Iowa caucuses are Monday and Fox News will have complete coverage.BAIER: And we have you covered from Iowa, all the way to the conventions and on to the general election. Thanks again for joining us. For all of us here in Des Moines, have a great evening.ENDAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Smell of Loss", "Date": "2016-01-02", "News": "Supported byOpinionLONDON \u2014 THE first time it happens is a dark winter\u2019s afternoon, not quite a year after her death. I\u2019m at my desk working, and there it suddenly is: sharp, glassy-green, with that faint, musky undertone that catches at the back of your throat.I recognize it instantly: the scent that hung in our hall every time she came to supper. The perfume that clung to her coat, her scarves, detectable sometimes for hours on my babies\u2019 hair after she\u2019d been carrying and kissing them.That first time, it\u2019s a shock. Her perfume is something I\u2019ve long forgotten (in her final months, mostly bedridden, she was beyond all that). But here it is \u2014 absolute and definite and quite overpowering. It lasts for three, maybe four minutes, long enough for me to get up and start searching the room for its source (my daughter, Chlo\u00eb, has a few of her cardigans \u2014 did she leave one in here?).Then, just as suddenly, it\u2019s gone.When I tell Chlo\u00eb (who says that the cardigans have long since lost their scent), she rolls her eyes. \u201cOh my God, now you\u2019re smelling dead people!\u201d We laugh \u2014 and I soon forget about it.Helen was my mother-in-law. She lived a happy, active life, but in her mid-80s her health and brain began to fail. After a couple of years of hip replacements and minor strokes, she died one warm April evening with her family all around her. As deaths go, it was probably a good one.But in the weeks and months that followed, I was surprised at how often I\u2019d find myself poleaxed by grief at the sheer fact of her absence.Helen was in her 60s when I met her, a recent widow. A willowy blonde in an elegant camel-hair coat, she was a dead ringer for Lauren Bacall (\u201cWhat nonsense!\u201d she\u2019d protest if someone said so, her eyes lighting up all the same). She was shy, but always well read, groomed and immaculate in her habits (and a tad judgmental about those who weren\u2019t).On our first meeting, waiting while her son \u2014 my new boyfriend \u2014 parked the car, she asked if I agreed that his recent attempt at a beard made him look like a used-car salesman. I burst out laughing and that comment set the tone for our whole relationship.Helen was my ally, my champion (frequently even against her son, Jonathan). It\u2019s hard not to love someone who\u2019s always on your side; I\u2019d never had that kind of approval from anyone.When our babies came along, she threw herself into grandmotherhood. Her constant availability \u2014 to help out, to comfort, to babysit \u2014 was one of her most loving gifts.The second time it happens, some weeks later, I am in the cellar, pulling wet clothes out of the washing machine. And there it suddenly is, filling the air around me. \u201cHelen?\u201d I say \u2014 and then blush.I ask Jonathan if he knows the name of the perfume she wore. He has no idea. I ask his sister. \u201cSomething by Herm\u00e8s?\u201d she offers. At a department store perfume counter, I sniff a confusing number of bottles. Only one stands out \u2014 a touch of that glassy greenness: Cal\u00e8che (and it is Herm\u00e8s). But I can\u2019t be certain.At supper, a month later, all five of us around the table, the Bolognese being served, I ask, \u201cCan anyone else smell that?\u201d\u201cSmell what?\u201d\u201cPerfume. Just like the one Granny used to wear.\u201dI watch their blank faces.\u201cYou can\u2019t smell it? Really? None of you can smell that scent?\u201dSeveral months pass before the next episodes: two in one week, both in my study. The second time, the perfume lingers for so long, perhaps 15 minutes, that I\u2019m determined to get to the bottom of the phenomenon.I pace the room, inspecting shelves, drawers, the sofa \u2014 there has to be an explanation! How can an ostensibly sane person repeatedly experience such a definite smell and fail to locate the source?But I do fail. And then, just like every other time, it\u2019s gone.A friend, Mike, comes to lunch and I end up telling him the whole crazy story. I wait for him to laugh; instead he gives me a beady look. \u201cWell, it\u2019s a ghost, isn\u2019t it?\u201dJonathan makes a noise of exasperation and Mike turns to him. \u201cWhat on earth else is it going to be?\u201dIt\u2019s true that I am interested in ghosts \u2014 they stalk much of the fiction I write. It\u2019s also true that I did once, on a winter\u2019s night long ago, see a form that startled me from sleep and which I have never been able to explain. But do I really believe in ghosts? I don\u2019t think so.What I do believe in \u2014 am perpetually fascinated by \u2014 is the gulf between what humans are capable of imagining and what may actually be there.I tell Mike that even if I did believe in ghosts, it would be extremely uncharacteristic of Helen to haunt me like this. It\u2019s not so much that she was resolutely rationalist (though she was), more that she\u2019d be embarrassed to come back in this demonstrative fashion.Later, I Google \u201csmelling perfume of dead person\u201d and find an excerpt from a book about \u201cafter-death communication\u201d by an American academic and self-styled skeptic named Sylvia Hart Wright. She claims there is convincing research on the subject and cites the example of her late husband who, after his death, appeared to make frequent contact by turning electrical appliances on and off.I email her to ask if she can account for my experiences. She writes back to say that my episodes are \u201cperfect examples of a common phenomenon.\u201d\u201cMy gut feeling,\u201d her email concludes, \u201cis that when you smell your mother-in-law\u2019s perfume, her spirit is visiting you in some fashion, trying to communicate to you her continuing closeness and support.\u201dA nice idea. I wish I could say that my own gut feeling supported it.Next, I email Jay A. Gottfried, a neuroscientist who runs the Gottfried Laboratory at Northwestern University, which investigates the links between brain activity and sensory perception.Professor Gottfried tells me that what I describe is known in his business as \u201cphantosmia\u201d or \u201cphantom smells.\u201d The sense of smell, he says, is our most ancient, primal sense and has \u201cintimate and direct control over emotional and behavioral states.\u201d\u201cThis is especially true for personal, meaningful memories that tend to get stamped into our brains very robustly,\u201d he explains. \u201cThus it is possible that a seemingly random trigger or thought \u2014 perhaps even outside your conscious awareness \u2014 has triggered some aspect of your mother-in-law memory.\u201d In some ways, he says, \u201cit is true that your mother-in-law is \u2018visiting\u2019 you, to the extent that your memory of her is strong, and that the vividness of her perfume makes it seem like she is there.\u201dI read that last sentence several times over. It seems reasonable. But could it explain so many episodes? And what about the persistence of the perfume, lingering often for minutes at a time: Can a triggered memory \u2014 a random sensory \u201cthread,\u201d in his words, snagged from the \u201cpatchwork\u201d of the unconscious \u2014 do that?I put all of this to him in a carefully concise email, and then add \u2014 because I can\u2019t resist it \u2014 \u201cI would just love to know: Have you ever, as a scientist, experienced something you feel you can\u2019t explain?\u201dHe doesn\u2019t reply.I decide to try another branch of science.FLORIAN Ruths is a consultant psychiatrist at London\u2019s Maudsley Hospital. I know Dr. Ruths from attending a course he taught a few years ago. I am slightly embarrassed to approach him with such an eccentric-seeming inquiry, but Dr. Ruths\u2019s reply is affable and serious.\u201cA sensory experience without an appropriate stimulus,\u201d he explains, \u201cis called a hallucination,\u201d and these are \u201cnot unusual in grief reactions.\u201d In less clinical terms, he tells me I \u201chave been given a wonderful sensory memory cue that brings back your beloved mother-in-law in such an immediate and emotionally charged manner.\u201d Maybe, he writes, \u201cit is a very wise trick of your brain of maintaining such a fond memory of her, and an emotional connection to her.\u201dThe idea of a \u201cwise trick\u201d of the brain is a seductive one. But the phrase \u201cgrief reactions\u201d bothers me. I did grieve when Helen died, very much so, and for several months. But after five years?If this \u201cgrief\u201d now takes any shape, it\u2019s a simple longing to see her again. How wonderful it would be to call her, hear her pick up the phone, shyly pleased, and to go over and sit on her terrace, drink a glass of sauvignon blanc and watch the boats slide past on the Thames, as we used to.I recognize this for what it is: a natural nostalgia for the days when our children were small, when life seemed so uncomplicated, when so much still lay ahead.But if this is just about my own, unrequited longing, then \u2014 Mike might ask \u2014 who exactly is the ghost? Could this be a case of the living haunting the dead, rather than vice versa?I\u2019m not a churchgoer or even strictly a believer, but realizing that I\u2019ve allowed no possibility of a religious context for these experiences, I email my friend Giles Goddard, who is an Anglican vicar. He tells me he\u2019s certain that \u201cstrange and inexplicable things\u201d are regularly \u201cperceived by the subconscious often with no obvious cause.\u201d Like Dr. Ruths, he suggests it\u2019s a normal part of grieving. He sends me a verse by Gerard Manley Hopkins:All things counter, original, spare, strange;Whatever is fickle, freckled (who knows how?)With swift, slow; sweet, sour; adazzle, dim;He fathers-forth whose beauty is past change:Praise him.Original, spare and strange, I like that. But I still find it hard to believe that this is a response to grief. Why would it suddenly come back at me like this?\u201cMaybe grief is the wrong word, then,\u201d he counters. \u201cMaybe loss?\u201dLoss. Isn\u2019t that the hardest lesson of human existence? The finality of losing someone you love, of having them fall right out of your life forever: the cold and terrible permanence of it.Intellectually, I comprehend that Helen is dead. But even after all this time, I\u2019m still not sure I believe it.It\u2019s been weeks since I smelled the scent. Whenever I haven\u2019t smelled it for a while, I begin to think it won\u2019t come again. And I don\u2019t know what I feel about that.The other day, killing time on a rainy autumn afternoon on Oxford Street, I walked into a department store and, on a whim, went to the Est\u00e9e Lauder counter. The sales assistant asked if I\u2019d like to try the new perfume. I smiled and shook my head, picking up one bottle after another \u2014 with names like Beautiful, Youth-Dew, Pleasures \u2014 and sniffing at them.I sprayed White Linen onto a card. It wasn\u2019t far off: clean and citrusy.\u201cIs it a gift for someone?\u201d the girl asked.I hesitated. \u201cI\u2019m trying to find the one my mother-in-law wears.\u201dSensing a sale, her eyes brightened.\u201cYou don\u2019t remember?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t ask her?\u201d\u201cNot really.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a surprise, then?\u201dI smiled. \u201cKind of.\u201d\u201cDo you think that\u2019s the one?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201dJulie Myerson is the author of 10 novels, including the forthcoming \u201cThe Stopped Heart.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Alexa excelled at music, and Cortana was mediocre across the board. Facebook was left out of the grading system because the company denied access to M, though I did hang out with her for two hours on a friend\u2019s account. More on that later.Apple said that Siri had \u201cbecome faster and smarter\u201d and spoke more languages than other assistants. Microsoft said it was \u201cjust scratching the surface\u201d on how Cortana could help people. Google said that it wanted smartphones to do more of the heavy lifting, and that users could do a host of things just by speaking to Google. Amazon did not respond to requests for comment.On the productivity front, Siri, summoned by pressing the home button on the iPhone or by saying, \u201cHey, Siri,\u201d was best able to schedule a meeting with a friend in Hawaii, check what was on my calendar for tomorrow, send an email and read my most recent email aloud. Others could complete only some of those tasks \u2014 Google could not read my last email out loud, and Alexa could not compose an email or create a calendar event.Siri also fared well in music-related tasks, but was bested by Alexa. Both assistants could play the song \u201cHey\u201d by the Pixies, put on the latest episode of the \u201cRadiolab\u201d podcast and play music in the instrumentals genre. But Alexa, summoned simply by saying \u201cAlexa,\u201d could play a specific music station on Pandora, whereas Siri could only open the Pandora app.Google, which builds its voice-controlled assistant into the Google mobile app, achieved the highest marks for completing travel and commuting-related tasks. It responded perfectly to the question \u201cWhat is the traffic like to 221 Main Street?\u201d by showing me how long it would take to drive there.When I said, \u201cTake me to the Dogpatch Boulders gym,\u201d it showed me a map and gave voice directions. When I said, \u201cFind me plane tickets to New York next week,\u201d it offered an impressive response: Flights from San Francisco to New York next week start at $435, and the shortest flight is five hours and 10 minutes long.On travel and commuting, Cortana could offer solutions for the questions about traffic and directions, but not the one about flights. Siri earned a C-minus in the category: She could not give traffic estimates, and in response to the question about flights to New York, she spat out an unhelpful list of web search results related to traveling to New York. And instead of taking me to a bouldering gym to hone my physique, she took me to a brewery.Alexa got a D \u2014 she could offer traffic estimates for only one fixed location that was set up inside the app, like your office, and she added the task of finding a flight to New York to my to-do list. (I gave Alexa a pass on failing to map me to the gym. It seemed too much to ask from a home audio speaker.)For food-related tasks, Google and Apple were even. Each of the assistants was able to find a list of nearby Indian restaurants. Only Google\u2019s voice assistant could order delivery food, but with an unintuitive process that required naming a specific restaurant that delivers food through one of the apps that Google has teamed up with. Siri was the only one capable of booking a restaurant table.In my limited time with M, I asked her to handle some of the most mundane tasks: Call the water company to ask about my utility bill, find out what meats are on sale at the local Whole Foods store and research when would be the cheapest time for my editor to fly to Hong Kong (not that I was trying to get rid of my editor).M pondered for a few minutes before answering each question, which made me suspect that a person handled most of the tasks. So I asked M to schedule a photo shoot with a studio owned by a friend of mine. Within minutes, the photo studio\u2019s phone rang, and my friend picked up.\u201cHi, I\u2019m calling on behalf of my boss,\u201d said M, who sounded like a young woman. \u201cHe wanted to find out if you guys have the ability for a photo shoot at 2 p.m. tomorrow.\u201dM left a contact phone number with a 650 area code, which includes Menlo Park, Calif., where Facebook has its headquarters.\u201cI didn\u2019t catch your name,\u201d my friend at the photo studio said.\u201cFirst name is M,\u201d the not-so-virtual assistant replied. \u201cLast name is Messenger.\u201d\u201cIs that Greek?\u201d my friend at the photo studio asked. M laughed nervously.In other words, M probably is more capable than all the virtual assistants, but largely because humans are on the other end of the puppet strings handling tasks that artificial intelligence cannot. That makes me doubt that many consumers will get to meet M, at least in its current state, in which it is free.\u201cM is still in its very, very early stages,\u201d Facebook said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re not yet focused on scaling M to a large number of people.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Royal Oak Watch Became a Cult Classic", "Date": "2016-01-04", "News": "Supported byOn TimeMany iconic companies have tried to revolutionize their industries through groundbreaking design, only to end up taking a very public face-plant: Ford, with the Edsel; Apple, with the Newton; Google, with Google Glass.And we know what happened with the DeLorean. (Yes, Marty McFly took one back to the future; the company also failed, just two years after the first cars were produced.)That is why the success of the Royal Oak is so striking. Four decades later, the love-it-or-hate-it Royal Oak has become the ultimate cult watch, with vintage pieces commanding high prices at auction, new releases popping up on television shows and endless high-end variants becoming must-haves for the celebrity class.With its octagonal bezel, exposed mounting screws and razor-sharp lines, the Royal Oak, as many of its devotees will attest, can be an acquired taste.\u201cWhen I first saw the Royal Oak, I thought it was ugly, too boxy, and awkward looking,\u201d said Kevin Rose, the chief executive of Hodinkee, the watch site. \u201cThen, after you spend enough time with it, you realize the funky-chunky-like design is really striking. It doesn\u2019t look like every other watch, and that\u2019s what makes it stand out.\u201dThe Royal Oak\u2019s back story is oft told among watch nerds, since the watch was borne of an existential crisis in the industry.By the early 1970s, cheap, rugged quartz watches from Asia were starting to flood the market and change the way watches were worn, because people no longer had to take them off to go swimming or play sports. Many makers of delicate Swiss mechanical watches grappled with dwindling sales.To deal with the challenge, Audemars Piguet, founded in 1875, commissioned the watch designer G\u00e9rald Genta to create the unheard-of: a luxury watch made of steel \u2014 stainless steel, not gold or platinum \u2014 with maximum durability and water resistance.The space-age industrial design, which Mr. Genta sketched in a day, was a byproduct of its era, according to Michael Friedman, the Audemars Piguet historian.\u201cIn design, there\u2019s an absolute explosion of creativity \u2014 in motorcars, architecture, furniture \u2014 in the late \u201960s and early \u201970s,\u201d Mr. Friedman said. \u201cIt\u2019s a heightened period of experimentation.\u201dTo underscore the Royal Oak\u2019s sporty personality, Mr. Genta took inspiration from a deep-sea-diving helmet, which resulted in the case shape and exposed screws.The finished product was a piece that pioneered a new category: the \u201cluxury sport\u201d watch. But success came slowly. It took three years to sell the first 1,000 Royal Oaks, because of its head-scratching design and high cost (about 10 times what a Rolex Submariner cost, although in those days, the Sub was still considered a sports watch, not a luxury item).Audemars Piguet stuck with the design, and it became a centerpiece of the brand.Prices now range from $17,800 for the basic Self-Winding Royal Oak in stainless steel to $95,700 for the Perpetual Calendar in rose gold (the company will release a yellow gold version this month).The watch has become a talisman of cool onscreen, popping up in cameos on shows like \u201cMr. Robot,\u201d \u201cBlack-ish\u201d and, quite conspicuously, on several characters in \u201cEntourage.\u201d (None of this was paid product placement, Mr. Friedman said.)Karl Lagerfeld, John Legend and Usher have all flashed Royal Oaks, and the watch is a staple in fashion spreads; the Cleveland Cavaliers\u2019 J. R. Smith wears one in the January issue of GQ. Its sportier (and blingier) offspring, the Royal Oak Offshore diver watch, introduced in 1993, has become a go-to watch for eight-figure athletes like LeBron James and Tom Brady.Vintage pieces from the \u201970s often sell for $30,000 to $50,000 at auction, Mr. Friedman said; exceptional pieces go much higher.\u201cThe aspirational generation is now to the point where these are viable objects to collect,\u201d Mr. Friedman said. \u201cTo the previous generation, they felt too contemporary.\u201dThat\u2019s one way to put it. Or you could just recall a line from the film \u201cChinatown\u201d: \u201cPoliticians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough.\u201dSo too, apparently, do avant-garde watches.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.M.\u2019s Investment in Lyft Hedges Against a Future With Fewer Car Owners", "Date": "2016-01-04", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsThe challenges these shifts pose to the business of making vehicles may seem still in the distance. Car sales in the United States hit a record 17.5 million in 2015 and could keep rising. And analysts predict G.M.\u2019s profit will reach $8.3 billion this year, according to Thomson Reuters data. Yet the company\u2019s stock trades at just six times earnings. Rival Ford manages an only slightly better seven times.Several factors are to blame: fears of overheating sales, fueled in part by subprime lending; a sluggish turnaround in Europe; problems in Latin America and Russia; and a slowdown in China.But there\u2019s also a longer-term worry about the rise of self-driving cars, shared ownership and ride-hailing. People may buy fewer cars in the future and the likes of Tesla, Google, Apple and tech-focused car-parts suppliers could become more important, and more profitable, at the expense of traditional manufacturers.Branching out into Lyft gives G.M. a better chance of navigating these trends. For example, the two companies plan to set up hubs offering people who want to drive for Lyft the chance to rent cars by the day, week or month. That\u2019s a flexible approach that aligns with part-time and multijob employment trends. And it gives G.M. an extra market for its vehicles.Over the longer run, the two also intend to pair Lyft\u2019s ride-matching and payments systems with G.M.\u2019s progress in making autonomous and connected cars. The company already has its own assisted-driving technology with OnStar, as well as arrangements with suppliers like the camera and radar maker Mobileye.Lyft is not the market leader. Its latest $5.5 billion valuation makes it just one-tenth the size of Uber. But that also makes G.M.\u2019s hefty stake and board seat less expensive at Lyft. It\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s a partial insurance policy against what could become existential threats.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Bridge That Stubborn Pay Gap", "Date": "2016-01-15", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewWhen the comedian Ricky Gervais joked that he was paid the same to host the Golden Globes as the actresses Tina Fey and Amy Poehler \u2014 combined \u2014 his barbed humor most likely resonated in many workplaces.So what might work to close the gap? Social scientists and policy makers have some ideas, as do companies that have been trying to combat the problem in their work forces.When employers publish people\u2019s salaries, the pay gap shrinks.Women might have been spurred to negotiate after seeing that their salaries were lower, he theorized, or cities might have made salaries more equitable to avoid lawsuits.Men are paid more partly because they\u2019re much more likely to ask for it.Because starting salaries determine raises and future salaries, women who do not bargain lose as much as $750,000 for middle-income jobs and $2 million for high-income jobs over their careers, Ms. Babcock found.Another answer is to ban pay negotiation completely. That is what Ellen Pao did when she was chief executive of Reddit. The company established pay ranges based on roles and experience and gave applicants nonnegotiable offers.If women can lose millions over their careers because they get job offers based on pay that is already low, one way to stop the pattern is to ignore their past salaries.\u201cDon\u2019t ask about salary history for new hires, and it really reduces the impact of previous discrimination,\u201d Ms. Babcock said. \u201cI think that is the most effective thing organizations can do.\u201dResearch has found that salaries at men and women\u2019s first jobs out of school are fairly similar.

{"Headline": "The Man Who Fell From Fame", "Date": "2016-01-16", "News": "Supported byOpinionBRETT SMILEY was no David Bowie.In fact, the album the 18-year-old Mr. Smiley made with the Rolling Stones producer Andrew Loog Oldham in 1974, \u201cBreathlessly Brett,\u201d didn\u2019t even see the light of day until 40 years had passed.But he was someone you should know. And in what seemed like some sort of cosmic coincidence, he died on Jan. 8, just two days before his immeasurably more successful contemporary.The failure of Mr. Smiley \u2014 or Brett, as I came to know him \u2014 to take his own place in the pantheon of 1970s glam legends wasn\u2019t because of a lack of effort. He was young, American, gorgeous and wrote compelling songs delivered in a breathy, achingly vulnerable voice. Some $100,000 had been invested in starting his career. Disco magazine declared him \u201cthe Most Beautiful Boy in the World.\u201d He was poised, on the precipice, ready for his close-up.But \u201cBreathlessly Brett\u201d was shelved. \u201cI just refused to let them release the album,\u201d Mr. Oldham said recently in an email. \u201cI knew it would be a disaster, and we\u2019d already had one \u2014 the 45 r.p.m. release of \u2018Space Ace,\u2019 \u201d a song from the record.The astronaut-themed \u201cSpace Ace,\u201d with its military-style snare drum rolls, \u201claunchpad\u201d sound effects and lush strings might have been titled \u201cNot Quite Space Oddity.\u201d The up-tempo, catchy B-side, \u201cVa Va Va Voom,\u201d would have made a much better debut. Either way, Brett\u2019s glam career crash-landed, and Mr. Bowie \u2014 and the rest of the world \u2014 moved on.In 1977, Brett landed a part in \u201cCinderella,\u201d a low-budget soft-porn flick. Appearing in a movie wasn\u2019t such a big stretch; he had understudied the lead role in \u201cOliver\u201d on Broadway for a little over a month in 1965. But it was the last major gasp from Brett, who like so many in the hedonistic \u201970s and \u201980s was wooed by assorted mind-altering substances. And off he went.By the time I met Brett in Central Park in 1988 while playing Frisbee, his time had passed. To me he was a skinny, friendly, vaguely beat-up-looking man who, like me, carried a guitar everywhere he went. We talked, we jammed, he played me one of his new songs \u2014 \u201cFrom the Head to the Heart\u201d \u2014 and he told me to throw out one line of a new song I had just written called \u201cQuittin\u2019 Time.\u201d It was good advice.I just liked the guy; he wasn\u2019t a dude or a bro, but neither was he overly touchy-feely. I was aching at the time for guidance, particularly with music, and Brett gave it to me without being asked. There was something lovable about him. Such is the nature of born stars, whether they become famous or not; you just want to be around them.When Brett suddenly disappeared and I eventually made inquiries, I was told he\u2019d succumbed again to drugs and had fled to California. I soon left New York to live in an Indian ashram. The past rapidly seemed a millennium away, and the \u201980s were cemented in pop culture almost as soon as they were over.I remembered Brett all through the next three decades, though \u2014 his face, his manner and especially the fact that he never complained about his faded career or his drug addiction; he didn\u2019t seem to feel sorry for himself.Shaken to the core in the wake of David Bowie\u2019s death last week, I thought of glam and decided, after all these years, to Google Brett Smiley.I wasn\u2019t surprised, knowing his history, to see the headline \u201cBrett Smiley Dies at 60,\u201d but was gobsmacked to see he\u2019d died in his Brooklyn apartment just 48 hours before Mr. Bowie. He\u2019d been found, the obituaries said, by family members and a friend who had been unable to contact him by phone.And thus I spent the better part of the day getting to know the Brett I had never known and falling in love with the tiny, beautiful creature on the cover of \u201cBreathlessly Brett\u201d as one might have in 1974 \u2014 in the den with friends gathered around a turntable or in one\u2019s bedroom. There was also Andrew Loog Oldham and a nervous Brett Smiley debuting on British TV with \u201cSpace Ace,\u201d which Brett had expected to mime but had to perform live. His songs have played nonstop on my iPod since I downloaded them two days ago. It\u2019s all Brett, all the time.David Bowie, by contrast, does not need me to mourn him. I saw the 1976 film \u201cThe Man Who Fell to Earth\u201d when it came out (though I didn\u2019t understand it). I pulled my car over to listen to \u201cAshes to Ashes\u201d in 1980 the first time it came over the radio because the snapping bass guitar opening the song was so compelling; I didn\u2019t even know it was Mr. Bowie\u2019s song until he started singing. I watched him at Live Aid during a break from the restaurant I was working at near Washington Square Park in 1985, and I\u2019ve sung the words \u201cThis is ground control to Major Tom\u201d in public about 500 times since I was 15. I\u2019ve given him more than 40 years of my life, and the world will no doubt see to his legacy without my help.But maybe Brett Smiley does need me to mourn him. I asked Mr. Oldham for his thoughts, and they were kind. \u201cHe was an irresistible spirit, a warrior, superb writer and chronicler of his and our times,\u201d Mr. Oldham said. \u201cA good person to have as a friend, a lovable rogue. He will be missed.\u201dBrett wasn\u2019t Ziggy Stardust, the Thin White Duke or Major Tom, he didn\u2019t end up getting to record and hang out with John Lennon and Mick Jagger and he didn\u2019t make millions of dollars \u2014 not even close. But he was the Space Ace, as well as a talented, slightly mysterious guy who was nice to me when he had no reason to be. Brett Smiley didn\u2019t change the world, but he\u2019s left it now. He lived a life, and it mattered.Josh Max is a writer who lives in New York City.Advertisement"}

But according to a report issued Wednesday by the World Bank, the vast changes wrought by technology have not expanded economic opportunities or improved access to basic public services in ways that many had expected. Rather, the report warned darkly, Internet innovations stand to widen inequalities and even hasten the hollowing out of middle-class employment.\u201cDigital technologies are spreading rapidly, but digital dividends \u2014 growth, jobs and services \u2014 have lagged behind,\u201d the bank said in a news release announcing the report.Those who are already well-off and well-educated have been able to take advantage of the Internet economy, the report concluded pointedly, and despite the expansion of Internet access, 60 percent of humanity remains offline.China has the largest number of Internet users, followed by the United States and India, according to the report.\u201cCountries that are investing in both digital technology and its analog complements will reap significant dividends, while others are likely to fall behind\u201d the report added. \u201cTechnology without a strong foundation risks creating divergent economic fortunes, higher inequality and an intrusive state.\u201dHow a society takes advantage of information technology depends on what kind of a society it is, the report concluded.Women are discouraged from going online in some countries, the report found, and across the countries of South Asia, they were far less likely to own a mobile phone. Those who are illiterate \u2014 still 20 percent of the world\u2019s population \u2014 cannot take advantage of the Internet at all; and in the developing world, the technology industry employs barely 1 percent of the work force. In rich countries, technology employs 3 to 5 percent of the work force, still a small fraction of total employment.According to the bank\u2019s survey, more than half of all countries had privacy laws on the books, but only 51 of them were in the developing world.The bank, which says it has itself invested $12.6 billion in information technology projects, calls on countries to make the Internet \u201cuniversal, affordable, open and safe.\u201d Yet it also takes pains to say that expanding access will not be enough for citizens to take advantage of the benefits. It also recommends enabling companies to compete, strengthening the skills of workers so they can obtain the new jobs and making government institutions accountable.\u201cThe triple complements \u2014 a favorable business climate, strong human capital and good governance \u2014 will sound familiar \u2014 and they should because they are the foundation of economic development,\u201d the report concluded.Advertisement"}

Long overdue, I say. Meanwhile, in other surprising developments, tenant farmers prove very nearly interchangeable; aristos turn out to be rather bad at child-minding; and an underbutler shows that he is, in his down time, a superbowler.About that butler: Was I alone in pitying poor vampiric Barrow? Every friendly-or-otherwise overture he makes to Andy is rebuffed. (\u201cI can, uh, show you the woods, if you like. No? How about I help you rewind the clocks? You sure? O.K. then, what say we check out Lady Mary\u2019s pigs?\u201d) He\u2019s getting no love from his supervisor. (\u201cWhen do you need me, Mr. Carson?\u201d \u201cWhen indeed?\u201d) And his efforts at proactive job-hunting are rewarded with veiled insults and gay-baiting: \u201cYou\u2019re a delicate-looking fellow, aren\u2019t you?\u201dSo when Marigold went missing at the local fat stock show (normally a \u201cpretty low key\u201d affair, to hear Earl Grantham tell it), I fully expected Barrow would find a way to drag her golden locks to safety.Instead, it\u2019s left to the hog farmer, Tim Drewe, to figure out that his missus \u2014 the girl\u2019s onetime adoptive mum \u2014 has run off with the child. He rushes back to the farm and finds Marigold cradled in Mrs. Drewe\u2019s lap. I confess that my heart did a little lurch, wondering if the child was dead, but then I remembered that, even alive, Marigold is not exactly a live wire.Sure enough, Mrs. Drewe has only rescued the girl because \u201cThey were paying her no attention, none at all\u201d and \u201cNo one was looking after her, not one of them,\u201d and yes, Mrs. Drewe, you\u2019re right, and no, Mrs. Drewe, it\u2019s not the thing to steal kids who aren\u2019t exactly legally yours.This all culminates in one of those reifications of the class system that Baron Fellowes specializes in.\u201cI\u2019ll start looking for another tenancy in the morning,\u201d announces Drewe.\u201cGod bless you, Drewe,\u201d says Earl G. \u201cGod bless you and your family.\u201d\u201cThe same to you, my lord. The very same to you.\u201dThat\u2019s how you fold your cards when you\u2019re a Fellowes-shire farmer. No fuss, no rancor. None of that Daisy-ish railing against \u201cthe system.\u201d Shake hands and walk away, even if you have been there since before Waterloo.At any rate, dear sweet (boring) Mr. Bates appears to have an ideal site for relocation, but dear evil Barrow is left swinging on the vine, just when he normally hauls himself to safety, and this isn\u2019t the only instance of thwarted narrative.Take the Edith plotline. (Did you think I was going to add \u201cplease\u201d?) Baron F makes a point of reminding us that Mary is still in the dark about Edith\u2019s love child, and he goes to great lengths to put the two sisters in London at the same time and even sends them home on the same train. Surely, one thinks, he\u2019s laying the groundwork for a teary Edith confession, but nothing of the sort happens, and Mary is no wiser at episode\u2019s end than at the beginning. (She is, however, wondering who will drive her home.)And now consider the arrested plot development surrounding that middle-aged lovebird Carson. The Crawleys want him to celebrate his nuptials somewhere abovestairs. \u201cYou\u2019ve worked at this house, man and boy, for half a century,\u201d says Mary. \u201cIf you\u2019ve no right to be married here, who does?\u201d\u201cDownton Abbey\u201d ends its six-season run on Sunday. How well do you know the characters and their tortured pasts?Only Mrs. Hughes sees things differently. \u201cIt\u2019s where we work, but it\u2019s not who we are,\u201d she says.\u201cI want my own wedding to be done in my own way.\u201dWhen Carson grumbles that it\u2019s his wedding, too, the future Mrs. C snaps: \u201cWe\u2019ll be doing it your way for the next 30 years, I know that well enough, but the wedding day is mine.\u201dMary is having none of that. \u201cYou leave Mrs. Hughes to me,\u201d she says, confidently. And what a delightful chill ran down my back at the thought of those two formidable ladies duking it out \u2026 except they don\u2019t.Perhaps that\u2019s being saved for a future episode. Or perhaps Mary is too distracted by the fertility struggles of Anna, who learns that she\u2019s suffering from cervical incompetence. (If there\u2019s ever a medical term that needed a do-over.) One quite large stitch, we\u2019re told, should do the trick, and I confess I am rooting for a Bates kid only because I want to see Joanne Froggatt get through an entire episode of \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d without leaking around the eyes. I don\u2019t deny that she drips as simply and eloquently as Julianne Moore \u2014 yes, I\u2019m going for the gold standard \u2014 but I simply can\u2019t stomach one more scene in which Anna accuses her husband of desperately wanting biological children, and he says (in effect) \u201cNo, I\u2019m happy as I am,\u201d and she says (in effect) \u201cSee? You\u2019re unhappy!\u201dThere\u2019s no winning for poor Mr. Bates, and it makes me long for the dark brooding character of Season 1 whose every limping step trailed mystery. Five years in, the mysteries have all been cleared away, and Bates is the guy who gets to say, \u201cThere there. It\u2019ll be all right.\u201dDepartment of other stuff:\u2022 Why in the name of all that\u2019s woolly would Tim Drewe bring his wife to the fat stock show? Was that his idea of managing the situation?\u2022 Why am I unable to say \u201cfat stock show\u201d without giggling?\u2022 It\u2019s always nice to have that minx Lady Rosamund on hand. And always exciting when a child on \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d gets to speak. Well done, Georgie!\u2022 The next time he argues with Edith, Mr. Skinner should explain that \u201cin a bull ring with Attila the Hun\u201d is a mixed metaphor.\u2022 That Fearful Dutch Thingamajig is the name of my next rock band.\u2022 In response to last week\u2019s recap, several learned Abbots (as if there were any other kind) have reminded me that senior female domestics regularly took the title of \u201cMrs.\u201d regardless of whether they were married.

That has not been confirmed either by the tax authorities or by Google.Lack of transparency over how the amount was calculated has prompted additional complaints and led to fresh calls for companies to publish their tax returns to allow the public to judge for themselves. Mr. Corbyn noted that, unlike Google, ordinary taxpayers \u201cdo not get the option of 25 meetings with 17 ministers to decide what their rate of tax is.\u201dMr. Cameron countered that part of the tax recovered was based on revenue Google had generated in years which the Labour Party was in power under prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.If Mr. Corbyn is angry, Mr. Cameron said, \u201cmaybe he should start by calling Tony Blair.\u201d He continued: \u201cYou can get him at JPMorgan. Call Gordon Brown. Apparently, you can get him at a Californian bond dealer called Pimco.\u201dWith public spending restrained following the financial crisis of 2008, and amid a growing debate over wealth inequality, the amount of taxes paid by corporations like Google, Facebook and Amazon remains a highly sensitive issue. The ability of big multinational corporations to limit their tax liabilities has stirred resentment in many countries.\u201cIt has never seemed fair that some of these companies \u2014 no matter how wonderful the service they provide \u2014 should be paying so much less in tax than the high street tearooms and bookshops they have pulverized,\u201d Mr. Johnson wrote.The British news media have contrasted their government\u2019s approach to that of France and Italy, which, they have reported, are seeking to extract more in taxes from Google.In a statement, Google said that it would \u201cnow pay tax based on revenue from U.K.-based advertisers, which reflects the size and scope of our U.K. business.\u201d It added, \u201cThe way multinational companies are taxed has been debated for many years, and the international tax system is changing as a result.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The hats on all of her characters sit slightly askew.Ms. McKenzie has strewn her text with tiny photographs \u2014 precious at first, they eventually tell their own story \u2014 and she\u2019s tacked on a long caboose of appendices, including one written in Norwegian. (I had to type it into Google Translate to figure out what it said.)Have I mentioned that one of her characters is a squirrel? The heroine of this story, Veblen Amundsen-Hovda, chats with it regularly. Here she is, first trying to explain their incipient relationship to her fianc\u00e9, Dr. Paul Vreeland:\u201cThis morning it came to the window \u2014 I think it wants to befriend me.\u201d\u201cYou can make other friends. This squirrel isn\u2019t a character in a storybook. Real animals don\u2019t wear shawls and top hats and write poetry. They rape each other and eat their own young.\u201d\u201cPaul, that\u2019s an excessively negative view of wildlife.\u201dPoor Paul doesn\u2019t know the half of it. She will eventually take this little guy on a road trip.The quirks of Veblen\u2019s \u201cfreelance self,\u201d as Ms. McKenzie puts it, would not be a problem if Veblen were on her own. But she is about to be married. Veblen\u2019s best friend, a Jungian analyst in training named Albertine, is not convinced that her fianc\u00e9 will tolerate them. \u201cMarriage is a continuous inevitable confrontation that can be resolved only through death,\u201d she tells her.\u201cDoes it have to be that way?\u201d Veblen asks. \u201cI\u2019ve already had a continuous confrontation that can be resolved only through death with my mother.\u201dAnd how. Veblen\u2019s mother, Melanie, is a red giant of a narcissist, expanding even as she fades, and her hypochondria is on another cosmic scale entirely. \u201cIs it indurated?\u201d she asks her daughter, showing her a lump on the back of her neck. \u201cIs the texture peau d\u2019orange?\u201dAs for Veblen\u2019s father, he is in a psychiatric institution.What readers begin to understand as her story unwinds is that each of Veblen\u2019s tics and odd passions\u2014 including the one for squirrels (especially for squirrels) \u2014 has a back story. They are not what make her crazy. They are what make her sane. They were, and continue to be, a response to a catastrophic childhood.Veblen\u2019s fianc\u00e9, Paul, may seem different at first blush. He\u2019s vectored, purposeful, intrigued by the possibilities of wealth: He works for Hutmacher Pharmaceuticals, testing his own specially designed tool to treat brain injuries in soldiers, a kind of hole puncher for the skull.(I will not say how this invention turns out. I will merely say that the subplot involving its fate, filled with indifferent military personnel and rapacious pharmaceutical overlords, resolves itself in an extremely gratifying fashion.)Yet Paul, too, was aggressively overlooked as a child. His parents raised him on a hippie commune in Humboldt County, Calif., \u201creplete with prowling D.E.A. agents and infrared photo sweeps from the altitude of gnattish helicopters.\u201d They were far more concerned with getting high than raising a child, and when Paul\u2019s younger brother was born, disabled and helplessly dependent, they devoted all their attention to him.Ms. McKenzie\u2019s book is filled Veblen\u2019s disquisitions about the anti-materialism of the man who inspired her name. But the thinker that came to mind as I was reading was the psychologist Alice Miller, author of \u201cThe Drama of the Gifted Child,\u201d who theorized that children, if neglected enough, begin to sense the neediness of their parents, and try to parent them instead.This did not happen to Paul. He had the good sense to rebel. But it did happen to Veblen. She\u2019s a human empath, far too sensitive and well trained in the art of appeasement to feel fury toward her own parents.You can see how this might be hard on a couple.\u201cAre you committed to having a really strange life?\u201d Paul asks Veblen in a fit of pique. And then he starts in on her mother. \u201cSomehow I got the sense she\u2019s jealous of you,\u201d he says, \u201cand that maybe you feel like you have to have a strange life so that you don\u2019t surpass her.\u201dFor all its charm, bounce, radiant eccentrics and diverting episodes involving drug companies and squirrels, that is what \u201cThe Portable Veblen\u201d is about: shaking the demented ghosts of our youth so that we can bind with clean spirits to someone in our adulthood.Or, as Veblen puts it: \u201cA wedding is the time and place to recognize the full clutch of the past in the negotiation of a shared future. Try devoting a few pages to that, Brides magazine!\u201dI won\u2019t give away how the book ends.

In a world where these two adversaries are trying to outmaneuver each other to be the regional superpower, a name can be powerful.Persian Gulf has been used throughout history, in maps, documents and diplomacy, from the ancient Persians, whose empire dominated the region, to the Greeks and the British.\u201cIt is commonly understood to be a friendly gesture of solidarity and support for our host nation of Bahrain and our other Gulf Cooperation Council partners in the region to use the term they prefer,\u201d Commander Stephens wrote in an email.Analysts say the name can be a source of friction even in diplomatic encounters.Mr. Wehrey recalled meetings that degenerated into shouting matches over the name. At the heart of the matter, he said, was \u201ca geostrategic dispute about ownership of the gulf.\u201dThe terminology shifted along with geopolitics, he said. While the close American-Saudi relationship dates to World War II, ties deepened between the United States and other Gulf Arab states after the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran, and even more so with the 1991 war in Iraq. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if Iranians feel that their history as a civilization is being challenged,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it has such an emotional reaction.\u201dThe Associated Press stylebook uses the term Persian Gulf. The New York Times stylebook does not have an entry on it, but the organization generally uses Persian Gulf.Google Maps shows both terms, with Arabian Gulf in parentheses.

{"Headline": "Why the Post Office Makes America Great", "Date": "2016-01-01", "News": "Supported byI WAS transported recently to a place that is as enchanting to me as any winter wonderland: my local post office.In line, I thought fondly of the year I came to this country from Turkey as an adult and discovered the magic of reliable mail service. Dependable infrastructure is magical not simply because it works, but also because it allows innovation to thrive, including much of the Internet-based economy that has grown in the past decade. You can\u2019t have Amazon or eBay without a reliable way to get things to people\u2019s homes.Of course, infrastructure is also boring, so we get used to it and forget what a gift it truly is. I never do, maybe because I discovered it so late.My first year in the United States was full of surprises. I remember trying to figure out if the 24-ounce glass of ice water the waitress placed in front of me was a pitcher, to be shared by the whole table. But where was the spout? I had expected some of what I encountered \u2014 I had seen enough movies, and came to this country expecting big cars and big houses and wide open spaces. I got used to gigantic glasses.But I didn\u2019t expect the post office.The first time I needed to mail something, I trekked over to my campus\u2019s post office, looking for the line to get my envelope weighed. The staff was used to befuddled international students like me, I suppose, and one clerk took my envelope without fuss, said \u201cfirst class letter,\u201d and took my change.Then I discovered some vending machines outside the office. People came and bought stamps. \u201cSo many people must be into stamp collecting,\u201d I thought to myself. Was that another weird American quirk? Otherwise, why would people waste money buying stamps in advance, without having their letters weighed?Something I take for granted now just didn\u2019t occur to me: There were standardized rates, and you could just slap a stamp on your letter, drop it in a mailbox, and it would go to its destination.I then encountered a visa service that asked me to mail in my passport. My precious, precious passport. With a self-addressed, stamped envelope for its return. I laughed at the audacity of the request. Despite being a broke student, I booked a plane trip. I couldn\u2019t envision putting my passport in the mail. I\u2019ve since learned that this is a common practice, and I\u2019ve even done it once or twice myself. But it still does not come easy to me.I noticed that Americans were a particularly patriotic bunch: So many of them had red flags on their mailboxes. Sometimes they would put those flags up. I presumed it was to celebrate national holidays I did not yet know about. But why did some people have their flags up while others did not? And why weren\u2019t they American flags anyway? As in Istanbul, where I grew up, I assumed patriotism had different interpretations and expressions.Yes, I was told, in the United States, mail gets picked up from your house, six days a week, free of charge.I told my friends in Turkey about all this. They shook their heads in disbelief, wondering how easily I had been recruited as a C.I.A. agent, saying implausibly flattering things about my new country. The United States in the world\u2019s imagination is a place of risk taking and ruthless competition, not one of reliable public services.I bit my tongue and did not tell my already suspicious friends that the country was also dotted with libraries that provided books to all patrons free of charge. They wouldn\u2019t believe me anyway since I hadn\u2019t believed it myself. My first time in a library in the United States was very brief: I walked in, looked around, and ran right back out in a panic, certain that I had accidentally used the wrong entrance. Surely, these open stacks full of books were reserved for staff only. I was used to libraries being rare, and their few books inaccessible. To this day, my heart races a bit in a library.Over the years, I\u2019ve come to appreciate the link between infrastructure, innovation \u2014 and even ruthless competition. Much of our modern economy thrives here because you can order things online and expect them to be delivered. There are major private delivery services, too, but the United States Postal Service is often better equipped to make it to certain destinations. In fact, Internet sellers, and even private carriers, often use the U.S.P.S. as their delivery mechanism to addresses outside densely populated cities.Infrastructure is often the least-appreciated part of what makes a country strong, and what makes innovation take flight. From my spot in line at the post office, I see a country that does both well; not a country that emphasizes one at the expense of the other.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Is It So Difficult for Syrian Refugees to Get Into the U.S.?", "Date": "2016-01-20", "News": "FeatureOf the 4.5 million people who have fled the Syrian war, only 2,647 have been taken in by the United States.Supported by\u2018\u2018We didn\u2019t expect it to be so expensive,\u2019\u2019 he said of life in Aurora, an industrial river town 41 miles from Chicago, where the al-Haj Alis arrived in March. \u2018\u2018What can we do?\u2019\u2019 The federal government and the nine nongovernmental agencies that help to relocate refugees in the United States select cities like Aurora because housing and jobs are readily available and the cost of living is relatively low. The al-Haj Alis also receive help with the rent from a local organization, the Syrian Community Network. Still, it isn\u2019t enough. Mahmoud and his wife, Azizeh, had been counting on their son Waseem, who is 27 and trained as a psychologist, to help support the family. His wife, Noorhan, and their two young sons were supposed to be in Aurora, too. But, at the last minute, something went wrong with their application to resettle in America. Now they were stuck in Jordan.Mahmoud flipped through the spiral notebook in which he calculates monthly expenses: Internet, $52; garbage collection, $40; rent, $1,125; repayments on the United States government loan for the plane tickets from Amman to America, $172. Mahmoud went into his and Azizeh\u2019s bedroom and found the bill for the family\u2019s airfare: $6,130. \u2018\u2018Since I used to own a business, I like to record everything,\u2019\u2019 he said.Most nights, Mahmoud works at the warehouse until 11 before returning home with Sham. The al-Haj Alis\u2019 sons Ahmad and Mohamed arrive home around then, too, from six-hour after-school shifts at a local supermarket. Although they\u2019re twins, the boys, 17, dress and act as if they weren\u2019t. Mohamed, curls stiffened with gel, favors a tie. Ahmad, an artist, is often bed-headed and prefers sweatsuits. Every day he tucks a Syrian flag into his waistband before heading to West Aurora High School, despite the occasional trouble the flag invites. At the supermarket, he mans the cash register; he likes to interact with customers, in part to show off the Syrian identity to which he clings. Mohamed, who is shyer and speaks far less about Syria, prefers to herd the stray carts in the parking lot.The al-Haj Ali twins were only 13 at the time. They had nothing to do with the protests. Nor did anyone else in the immediate family. Although they listened to news reports of the Assad government\u2019s ferocious attacks on civilians, they saw little indication, at first, of the violence around them. There was the odd black helicopter in the sky. And once, when Waseem was taking Azizeh to driving school, they watched a group of protesters carrying olive branches stream out of Daraa. Only later did they realize these were people fleeing a massacre by Assad\u2019s forces.The war scattered the al-Haj Alis across the globe. Mahmoud, his wife, the twins and Sham made it to Aurora after a 30-month stay in Amman, Jordan. Two elder daughters, Rasha and Ruba, are in the Netherlands. Rasha arrived with her husband two years ago, and this fall Ruba followed. She and her three boys fled first to Morocco, then to Spain by boat, making their way on foot to an asylum center in the Nether\u00adlands, sharing a single room with two other families. (Ruba would like to bring her sons to America, but now that they are in a safe country, there is little chance of resettlement in the United States.) A third daughter, Rana, recently gave birth in Egypt; her 1-month-old is officially stateless. Another, Fatimah, is in Jordan. Yet the child of greatest concern to the family is their adult son, Waseem.Azizeh wondered if she had brought her sons from Syria only to put them at risk in America, and if Waseem would ever join them now.\u2018\u2018It\u2019s extremely difficult to get into the United States as a refugee \u2014 the odds of winning the Powerball are probably better,\u2019\u2019 says David Miliband, head of the International Rescue Committee, which helps place refugees from 40 countries in American cities. And Syrians are subject to an extra degree of vetting. Although all refugees are screened by the National Counterterrorism Center, the F.B.I., the Defense Department, the State Department and United States Customs and Border Protection, among other intelligence agencies, Syrians must complete what is known as the Enhanced Syrian Review. This is an added screening by caseworkers at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in Washington, which assesses each Syrian case and selects some for processing through the Fraud Detection and National Security Directorate office. This extra step was put in place because of the difficulty of assessing the allegiances of the various rebel groups in Syria\u2019s continuing war \u2014 what Barbara Strack, chief of the Refugee Affairs Division at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, describes as \u2018\u2018the myriad actors and dynamic nature of the conflict.\u2019\u2019Until recently, Syria\u2019s refugees were not a pressing domestic political concern. To many Americans, the war in Syria seemed remote, a problem for Syria\u2019s neighbors. Of greater import were the 11 million immigrants who had entered the United States illegally. Then last summer, images of the Syrian toddler Alan Kurdi lying dead on the Turkish shore mobilized American sympathies in favor of refugees, and the Obama administration found itself faulted for admitting so few. Quietly, President Obama directed Denis McDonough, the White House chief of staff, to work with the State Department to find out why vetting for Syrian refugees required 18 to 24 months.McDonough, known for urging Obama to be cautious in engaging militarily in Syria, took the issue of refugees personally. As a Catholic growing up in Stillwater, Minn., the 10th of 11 children, he worked with his church to help arriving Vietnamese refugees. Now, carrying a stack of charts and graphs, he met with refugee advocates and members of Congress to learn about the pitfalls and procedural bottlenecks within the resettlement program and to study potential means of bringing Syrians more quickly to the United States without compromising on security. In closed-door National Security Council meetings last year, he advised State Department officials to lift bureaucratic hurdles. As a result, the United States has opened up refugee-processing centers in new locations that refugees can actually reach, including one in Erbil, in northern Iraq. By streamlining the process of resettling Syrian refugees, the Obama administration also hoped to demonstrate support for its European allies. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s important to the president\u2019s view to show our allies overseas, who are taking a considerable influx of Syrians, that we support them and we\u2019re doing our part,\u2019\u2019 McDonough told me recently.Paris threatened to change everything. The Syrian passport found near the body of one mili\u00adtant turned out to be a fake, but at least two of the attackers had exploited the refugee routes from the Middle East to Europe. Overnight, the global good will toward refugees that had been building all but vanished. Suddenly, the images of hundreds of thousands of refugees heading north inspired not empathy but alarm. According to the Soufan Group, a New York-based company that provides security-intelligence services, between 27,000 and 31,000 foreign fighters have gone to Iraq or Syria since the start of Syria\u2019s civil war, the vast majority to fight alongside ISIS. At least 10 percent have headed back home. What once seemed like a trickle of vulnerable civilians now looked, to some, like a potentially dangerous flood.In November, Republicans and some Democrats rallied behind House Bill 4038, the American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act, introduced by Representative Michael T. McCaul of Texas to slow the arrival of Syrian and Iraqi refugees in the United States. Days before the House vote, McDonough and Jeh Johnson, secretary of homeland security, briefed members of Congress on the Syrian-refugee-resettlement program and its screening process, in an attempt to reassure them that such a measure was unnecessary. The House nonetheless voted in favor of the bill, and as 2015 drew to a close, the Syrian refugee issue was at risk of becoming part of the year-end omnibus bill amid discussions of a government shutdown.In the face of mounting political opposition, the president, in a choreographed Trudeau-esque gesture at the National Archives in Washington, welcomed 31 people from 25 countries at their citizenship ceremony. In private, McDonough rang up supporters and opponents alike. \u2018\u2018Every phone call I\u2019ve had with my friends on Capitol Hill, Republican and Democrat, and with governors around the country, I\u2019ve underscored that we recognize the fear,\u2019\u2019 McDonough told me. He spoke of the need to \u2018\u2018send a message\u2019\u2019 to \u2018\u2018the Assad regime and to ISIL that the United States will continue to play the role that it has, that the world has become accustomed to it playing \u2014 mainly the role of alleviating suffering at the source and of being a refuge for the most vulnerable people.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018It\u2019s not a zero-sum choice,\u2019\u2019 Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. Blinken, who served as Obama\u2019s national security adviser before returning to the State Department, where he began his career, has been asked by the White House to handle the thorny refugee issue. \u2018\u2018We\u2019re working 36 hours a day to solve the war in Syria,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018but meanwhile, what do you do about the huge immediate challenge of more than four million people displaced from their country?\u2019\u2019For millions of Syrians, Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan have become vast waiting rooms. \u2018\u2018The two biggest drivers of onward migration are lack of access to education and lack of access to work,\u2019\u2019 Blinken told me recently, at the United States Embassy in Amman. The United States frequently trumpets the fact that of the countries donating to the United Nations in support of Syrian refugees, it gives the most aid, much of it going to front-line countries. But this is in part a self-serving strategy. The United States supports Syria\u2019s neighbors so that they can withstand the pressures of millions of additional people. Refugees place a large burden on natural resources and social services. As a result, relations between Syrians and their hosts are souring. (Jordanians, groaning under the burden of 633,000 refugees, joke darkly that they live \u2018\u2018between Iraq and a hard place.\u2019\u2019) Part of American strategy in the region has been to ease tensions between Syrians and their hosts. The United States provides services (schools and hospitals) for the refugees as well as for the citizens of host countries. They also allocate money for development to keep the host country happy. In Jordan, Blinken had just attended a falafel lunch with Jordanian venture capitalists who started a fund, with United States government support, to incubate technology start-ups.Resettlement in the United States, however, remains a political challenge. \u2018\u2018This is where ISIL neatly joins the problem,\u2019\u2019 Blinken said. \u2018\u2018Very few of the refugees we admit are young males without families \u2014 we focus on women, children, the sick and those vulnerable to violence. But you now have this new concern that these refugee populations will somehow be infiltrated by terrorists.\u2019\u2019 In the aftermath of the Paris attacks, European countries hardened their stance on refugees, making illegal migration more difficult by closing borders. (For the first time in 50 years, for instance, those crossing between Denmark and Sweden have to show photo ID.) Turkey is under pressure to do the same. Recently, after receiving promises of $3.25 billion in aid from the E.U., Turkey reportedly arrested 1,300 asylum seekers trying to cross the sea to Greece.The refugees already in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan are more likely to be stuck there, which means that a humanitarian crisis is becoming an economic-development problem. Syrians, many of whom lived sophisticated lives, are often unable to access even the most basic services. \u2018\u2018These are people who had microwaves and cars, and now they\u2019re in tin boxes in the desert,\u2019\u2019 says Jonathan Campbell of the World Food Program. The key factor in their migration is hopelessness. This past fall, the W.F.P. sent text messages to 230,000 Syrians living in Jordan to tell them that their food benefits were going to be substantially reduced because of lack of funding and donor fatigue. (They were later restored.) Although the United States made a large pledge, other countries, facing financial crises at home, did not. As a result, 64 percent of the refugees told the W.F.P. they were going to be forced to leave the country. One family out of every four took a child out of school to work. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s not a pull factor that makes them move, it\u2019s a push factor,\u2019\u2019 says Myriam Baele, head of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees\u2019 refugee-resettlement unit in Jordan. \u2018\u2018If there isn\u2019t a means to survive here, they will go,\u2019\u2019 she went on. \u2018\u2018Either to Europe or back to Syria, where they will die.\u2019\u2019Early last spring in Amman, when the al-Haj Alis were all still together, Waseem, Noorhan and their sons, who are 4 and 2, cleared the Enhanced Syrian Review and completed four days of cul\u00adtural-orientation classes \u2014 which include everything from pictures of what to pack (warm clothing and money) and what not to (weapons and illegal drugs) to the importance Americans place on such concepts as punctuality and pri\u00advacy. These courses are offered only to those who are in the process of resettling in the United States. Noorhan, who had been studying in Syria to become a teacher and whose dark eyes glitter with an easy intelligence, paid special attention to the weather. \u2018\u2018Arizona is like the gulf,\u2019\u2019 she recalled learning. \u2018\u2018Hot, dry and full of snakes.\u2019\u2019Ten days before Waseem and his family were scheduled to leave, they had completed everything but their medical exams. Then they received a call from the Americans: They couldn\u2019t go just yet. Something had come up in their security clearance, Waseem recalled being told. In retrospect, Waseem\u2019s parents wonder if they should have waited for him. The plan had always been for Waseem to support the family: Azizeh had three ruptured disks and needed back surgery; Mahmoud had an old leg injury. But if the al-Haj Alis had delayed and lost their place in line, they might never have gotten to America. Waseem now feels guilty that he encouraged them to go ahead. He wasn\u2019t sure his parents could make it without him. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m trying to be patient for my parents,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018If it weren\u2019t for them, I would\u2019ve already left.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018If we don\u2019t get a call from the Americans before smuggling season begins in the spring, we\u2019ll leave for Europe,\u2019\u2019 he went on. The last thing he and his wife wanted to do was take two toddlers over the sea. Like everyone else, they had seen the photos of Alan on the beach. Their children couldn\u2019t swim, and neither could Noorhan. But what choice did they have?\u2018\u2018We think only about traveling,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018All we want is to go the United States.\u2019\u2019 Day after day, he checked the news on Facebook and chatted with his mother in Aurora. \u2018\u2018We hope to live in a simple house, with a car outside, and just to watch our kids grow up,\u2019\u2019 Noorhan said. \u2018\u2018That\u2019s it. We don\u2019t want a palace or some luxury life.\u2019\u2019When the rest of his family left in March, Waseem thought he would have to wait for about a month at the most. One month was now eight. As it grew colder, he stopped walking along the highway looking for illegal construction jobs. The market for day laborers was drying up. He didn\u2019t dare ask for work in the strip of neon-lit shawarma stands downtown, even though many were staffed by fellow refu\u00adgees. If he was caught working, Waseem could be imprisoned, transferred to the refugee camps, where only the poorest of the poor live, or sent back to Syria. Still, he had to find a way to pay the $247 rent on the apartment he once shared with his parents. He and Noorhan relied increasingly on whatever Mahmoud could send back from America. Instead of helping to support his parents, he was taking from them. \u2018\u2018My father used to be a wealthy man,\u2019\u2019 Waseem said, recalling Mahmoud\u2019s locksmith business in Abu Dhabi. Once the war began, Mahmoud sold the business for $120,000. For nearly five years, that money supported more than a dozen family members in five different countries. Now the money was gone.Among Syrian refugees, \u2018\u2018on hold\u2019\u2019 is the most dreaded category. It is extremely difficult to get clear answers about why the hold has been applied or when it will be lifted. To try to learn more, Waseem designated The New York Times as a third party with the legal right to inquire about his case. In response to an email from The Times in November, the International Organization for Migration would say only that Waseem\u2019s case \u2018\u2018is currently on hold pending further review by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\u2019\u2019Officials cannot comment on individual cases, but when briefed on the case as a hypothetical, immigration officers and resettlement experts offered several possible explanations: It could be as simple as an applicant\u2019s security clearance having expired while a family member waited to be vetted. Or maybe Waseem\u2019s name sounds like a name on a terrorist watch-list. Or maybe, at the very last minute, \u2018\u2018recurrent vetting\u2019\u2019 raised a red flag. Recurrent vetting, which began in 2015, checks names through a series of databases right up to when the flight lands in the United States. As a senior intelligence officer with the National Counterterrorism Center described it: \u2018\u2018If you have an 800 credit score and you\u2019re good for a new Visa card, and two weeks from now they find out that, hey, two years ago, you changed your name to cover up a prior bankruptcy, then they can take away that card.\u2019\u2019Or maybe it was Azizeh\u2019s brother. As a former military member of the Assad regime, he might still count as a black mark. Even though he defected early on, he could, by some bureaucratic oversight, still be designated a security risk to the United States. When reached in Qatar this fall, via Skype, he expressed relief that all of his family had made it out of Syria alive. He, too, was searching for a new country. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m not looking for beauty or history,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m looking for a country with human rights and freedom.\u2019\u2019 Other family members described specific questions regarding Azizeh\u2019s brother posed to them by American immigration officers in Jordan. For example, did they serve him coffee or tea when he was in their homes? This was most likely a question to determine whether the family had provided material support \u2014 which could include a cup of coffee, a glass of water, a ride \u2014 to someone designated to be an enemy of the United States.Resettling refugees isn\u2019t a perfect process. \u2018\u2018No immigration program is completely without risk,\u2019\u2019 a senior intelligence officer says. Yet over more than a decade, the United States agencies involved in the program have learned to communicate more effectively. \u2018\u2018We got a lot smarter and developed additional relationships with the intelligence community beginning with the large-scale Iraqi processing in 2007,\u2019\u2019 Strack, of U.S.C.I.S., says. She adds, \u2018\u2018We are the opposite of stove-piped \u2014 we\u2019re incredibly networked.\u2019\u2019One common misconception about how a Syrian refugee comes to America is that she simply approaches the United States Embassy in Jordan or Turkey or wherever she first lands. This is not how resettlement works. To be legally designated a refugee, she must first apply to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. U.N.H.C.R. takes a photograph and scans her iris. Verification can take anywhere from a couple of months to a few years before she\u2019s interviewed in person. Although these interviews aren\u2019t considered security vetting, caseworkers are trained to eliminate those who may be lying, as well as those who have persecuted others or may be war criminals.In addition to collecting biometric data like iris scans and photographs, U.N.H.C.R. case officers are trained in basic facial recognition and have 2-D screening capabilities to detect fake passports. The goal is to make sure people meet the criteria of the refugee convention, established after World War II. They\u2019re also experts in country-of-origin information. \u2018\u2018Listen, I know where your school is, I know the colors of its walls,\u2019\u2019 one U.N.H.C.R. officer says. \u2018\u2018We detect lies based on what\u2019s happened in the country of origin. It\u2019s not just hour-by-hour events; it\u2019s ethnicity, region, family. We know the custom \u2014 we know what their dresses look like.\u2019\u2019U.N.H.C.R. then advocates for the most vulnerable 10 percent; the other 90 percent will have to make a new life as best they can. Of the 20 million refugees worldwide, less than 1 percent will be officially resettled, and of those, the United States takes about half. Resettlement is only one of three options. The others are returning home (which, for most Syrians, is impossible) or remaining in the host country (which, given the pressures Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon are under, is becoming increasingly difficult). Those either barred or \u2018\u2018deprioritized\u2019\u2019 include individuals with certain military ties, as well as families with missing members. This is to guard against the possibility that the missing member may be fighting alongside an anti-American group like ISIS and later try to rejoin his family.Syrians, like other refugees, don\u2019t choose the country they end up in. U.N.H.C.R. selects the best option based on various criteria specified by host countries, like those from the most vulnerable groups or victims of torture. But there are limits to the requests countries can make. \u2018\u2018We\u2019re not a labor department,\u2019\u2019 a senior U.N.H.C.R. official said. \u2018\u2018If countries come to us asking for a particular religion, we don\u2019t encourage that.\u2019\u2019All of this takes place before U.N.H.C.R. refers the case to any one country. Once U.N.H.C.R. provides a complete file to the United States, then the applicant\u2019s entire family visits the State Department\u2019s Resettlement Support Center for a prescreening interview. At this point, each individual is run through several databases, including ones at the Department of Homeland Security, the National Counterterrorism Center, the F.B.I. and the Department of Defense, and entered into the Worldwide Refugee Admissions Processing System, which warehouses the data and facilitates interagency screening checks. A pilot program will soon include iris scans, which are currently used by U.N.H.C.R. only for identification, not security purposes.This fall, in several closed-door classified briefings before Congress and in public hearings, Anne C. Richard, the assistant secretary of state for population, refugees and migration, defended the rigorous vetting process. Of the more than 784,000 refugees who have been admitted to the United States in the last 14 years, five have been arrested on terrorism-related charges: One was an Uzbek man arrested in Idaho; the other four were refugees from Iraq. Such mistakes have provided fodder for those who worry that the country is exposing itself to needless risk. \u2018\u2018ISIS has vowed to send its operatives into the West posing as refugees,\u2019\u2019 says McCaul, chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. \u2018\u2018The threat is real.\u2019\u2019 Advocates say that the threat of a refugee being a terrorist is statistically negligible. \u2018\u2018We don\u2019t leave holes, and we don\u2019t take chances,\u2019\u2019 Richard told me. \u2018\u2018If there\u2019s any doubt about someone, they don\u2019t come.\u2019\u2019 Indeed, as Le\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez, director of U.S.C.I.S., recently testified in Congress, the United States has barred 30 individuals from entering \u2018\u2018based on their showing up in the databases.\u2019\u2019 (When queried, a senior intelligence official would say only that there were individuals of \u2018\u2018national security concern.\u2019\u2019) Emily Gray, the executive director in Aurora of World Relief, a branch of the agency assigned by the United States government to help resettle the al-Haj Ali family, says, \u2018\u2018You\u2019d have to be a really stupid terrorist to come this way.\u2019\u2019After the U.S.C.I.S. officers in Washington conduct the enhanced review, the entire family is scheduled for another interview with a member of the Refugee Affairs Division, a team of 10 to 14 immigration officers from U.S.C.I.S. who spend six weeks on \u2018\u2018circuit rides\u2019\u2019 \u2014 traveling up to four times a year to Turkey, Egypt, Jordan and other locations in the region, interviewing refugees being considered for resettlement in the United States.\u2018\u2018Just having an interview doesn\u2019t sound so secure, but this is one heck of an interview,\u2019\u2019 Richard says. \u2018\u2018First off, refugees are people fleeing tyrannical governments, so they may not trust people in positions of authority. They may be used to lying. They have to be prepared to have this interview, and if they\u2019re caught lying, then they\u2019re not going to make it, no matter how worthy.\u2019\u2019 At the end of this process, there are four possible outcomes: immediate acceptance, which is rare and can still involve waiting another 18 months, especially if there is a new marriage or birth; acceptance pending verification; denial; and the limbo into which Waseem al-Haj Ali and his family have now fallen, \u2018\u2018on hold.\u2019\u2019From Jordan, one afternoon late this fall, Waseem called his mother in Chicago. \u2018\u2018How are you?\u2019\u2019 he asked. He hadn\u2019t anticipated her reply. She was fine, thank God, she said, but there was something wrong at the twins\u2019 school. The night before, she received a call from the school saying there would be police there the next day and it was fine if the boys stayed home. She wasn\u2019t sure what that meant or if other Syrians had received the same call. Azizeh sent the boys anyway. They survived airstrikes and house-to-house raids by Assad\u2019s security forces; they could face American high school. \u2018\u2018Oh,\u2019\u2019 Waseem said, and hung up. He and Noorhan were taken aback. What if, after all they had endured, his parents or Sham or the twins were hurt in America? Waseem was the one who was supposed to protect them, and all he could do was sit on the couch in Amman and accept handouts from his father.\u2018\u2018The worst thing is this game of waiting,\u2019\u2019 Issam Smeir, a psychologist in Aurora with World Relief who has counseled the al-Haj Alis, says. \u2018\u2018It kills your soul.\u2019\u2019The issue was immigration, not Islam, Murphy said. The school district models diversity remarkably; the twins were enrolled alongside Iraqis, Nepalis, Bangladeshis and immigrants from 57 countries in a curriculum for students learning English. Ahmad and Mohamed grumbled about it; these kids were uncool, and they only saw regular Americans during gym class.Outside school, the opposition to Syrian refugees wore on: In nearby Indiana, a Syrian family had to be rerouted to Connecticut because of the governor\u2019s opposition. In an attempt to block the arrival of another Syrian family, Texas sued the International Rescue Committee, the resettlement agency working with that family, as well as the federal government.In Congress, as the year drew to a close, House Bill 4038, which would have barred Syr\u00adian refugees, at least for a time, never came to the floor of the Senate, nor was it part of the omnibus \u2014 a pair of victories for McDonough and the White House. Instead, the mass shooting in San Bernardino refocused national security concerns on the visa-waiver program, which the administration had long seen as a problem.In January 2016, even as rising tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia, key players in the war in Syria, imperiled upcoming cease-fire negotiations at the U.N. The Senate stood poised to consider new legislation that would halt the arrival of Syrian refugees. \u2018\u2018We cannot stand by while jihadists try to exploit humanitarian programs to reach our shores undetected,\u2019\u2019 Michael McCaul, who sponsored 4038, said, citing serious screening gaps. Senator Mark Kirk, a Republican from Illinois, who recently introduced a similar bill in the Senate, also supports such legislation. \u2018\u2018Reputable media outlets are uncovering examples of how terrorists infiltrate the Iraq and Syria refugee programs in an effort to commit acts of violence against the American people and our allies,\u2019\u2019 Kirk said. \u2018\u2018Common sense requires thoughtful measures to keep Americans safe.\u2019\u2019She also worried about herself and Sham. The long coats and hijabs they wore when they went out might attract the wrong kind of attention. Sham had come to America at the worst age possible. At 19, she wasn\u2019t eligible to attend high school, and her English was too poor to pursue her dreams of becoming a lawyer. \u2018\u2018That\u2019s too expensive,\u2019\u2019 Sham said. \u2018\u2018It would take too many years.\u2019\u2019To secure a future for her, her parents had accepted the marriage proposal of an Iraqi used-car salesman named Layth Alali, Azizeh told me. Fifteen years older than Sham, Alali came to the country on a much-coveted Special Immigrant Visa in 2010, as part of the group of Iraqis who had worked with the United States military. (In Baghdad, he was the head of a checkpoint set up by the Americans.) The whole thing was rushed; he had asked just two weeks earlier, and the engagement ceremony was taking place immediately.After picking Sham and Azizeh up in a BMW S.U.V., Alali drove them to a prom-dress shop in Aurora, and they had less than an hour to find a dress. Sham picked out a spangled strapless confection, but Azizeh worried it exposed too much flesh. \u2018\u2018Problem, problem, problem,\u2019\u2019 she said, pointing to her daughter\u2019s bare neck, arms and shoulders. In the end, she snapped a picture and sent it via WhatsApp to her daughter-in-law, Noorhan, who was, as usual, sitting idle in the apartment in Jordan. A few seconds later, Noorhan sent back a smiley-face emoji with hearts for eyes. The dress, however flawed, was a yes.In a life marked by disappointment and compromise, Azizeh remarked, what did the dress really matter? As a married woman, Sham would be more secure, and so would her family. At least, Azizeh said, Sham would no longer have to work in the office-supply warehouse.The family had other concerns. The boys needed hundreds of dollars of dental work that Medicaid didn\u2019t cover. The al-Haj Alis were struggling to make the rent, and winter was coming, which meant a new bill for heating. Azizeh was trying to figure out what kind of program might help pay the gas bill. As the temperature dropped and it grew dark at 4:30 in the afternoon, Ahmad and Mohamed seemed to be slowing down; Azizeh had to prod them off the couch to get them to work at the market.School was still a challenge. After nearly a year, neither spoke enough English to hold a conversation. Unlike their fellow refugees, who learned English by watching television and American movies, the boys preferred to spend their downtime watching Arabic-language news about Syria or YouTube videos from home.For a long time, when they looked on Google Earth, they could see the debris of their family\u2019s homes, which had been either burned or bombed. Now a mysterious white film obscured satellite images of the town. Was it a glitch, or a security measure on the part of the Assad regime to protect this strategic town, which now serves as a military base?If Ahmad and Mohamed had stayed in Syria, they might be dead by now \u2014 either killed by the Assad government\u2019s barrel bombs or fallen among the young men who have joined up with the Free Syrian Army. When one of their friends or cousins fighting with the F.S.A. is killed, the boys study the photographs of his death, often posted on Facebook in tribute, with a mixture of envy and guilt.Issam Smeir, the World Relief counselor, met with the al-Haj Ali family to help them handle the psychological stress of Waseem\u2019s unexpected absence. He was watching for signs of depression in the boys. \u2018\u2018Depression in kids doesn\u2019t look like sadness,\u2019\u2019 Smeir said. \u2018\u2018It looks like restlessness and anger.\u2019\u2019 The biggest argument that Ahmad has had at school involved fellow Syrians who support the Assad regime. The two sides got into a fight over which flag was the true Syrian flag \u2014 the one belonging to the Assad regime, or the revolutionary flag that Ahmad tucks into his waistband.Three days later, a text came in from Noorhan. More American politicians were opposing Syrians, and what she and Waseem had been reading on Facebook made them think the United States was shutting its borders tighter than ever. It looked as if they were going to have to take their boys over the sea. \u2018\u2018After all the news,\u2019\u2019 she wrote, \u2018\u2018we have no hope to travel to America.\u2019\u2019An article on Jan. 24 about Syrian refugees and United States policy referred incorrectly to the type of visa with which one of the San Bernardino attackers legally entered the United States. It was a K-1 fianc\u00e9e visa; the attacker did not enter through the visa-waiver program.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pickups and S.U.V.s Lead Way to a Record Year for Automakers", "Date": "2016-01-05", "News": "Supported bySix years after plunging sales during the recession forced automakers into bankruptcies and painful restructuring, the industry has roared back to achieve new heights.Automakers said on Tuesday that strong demand for pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles in December had helped the industry set an annual record of 17.5 million vehicles sold in the United States in 2015.The results topped the previous high of 17.4 million vehicles set in 2000, and raised expectations for further increases in the coming months.Most major manufacturers reported solid gains last month because of low gas prices, easy credit and the fact that the month had two more selling days than the previous December.One notable exception was the German automaker Volkswagen, which posted a decline partly because of an emissions-cheating scandal that has curtailed the availability of certain diesel-powered vehicles under investigation in the United States and elsewhere.In December, manufacturers sold 1.64 million vehicles, which represented a 9 percent increase over the previous year. For all of 2015, industry sales increased by about 6 percent.Analysts said the seasonally adjusted sales rate for December had slipped from the torrid pace set in the previous three months. But that hardly diminished enthusiasm in the industry for another possible record-setting year ahead.General Motors, the nation\u2019s largest automaker, reported sales of 290,000 vehicles in December, which was a 5.7 percent increase over the same period a year earlier.G.M.\u2019s chief economist, G. Mustafa Mohatarem, said favorable economic conditions should propel further gains in the year ahead.\u201cThe single most important pieces are the ongoing gains in employment and the growth in personal income,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you add in lower energy prices, it\u2019s easy to see why consumer spending is strong.\u201dFord Motor, the second-biggest auto company in the United States, said it sold 237,000 vehicles in December, which was an 8.3 percent increase over the same month a year earlier.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles reported that its December sales jumped 12.6 percent to 217,000 vehicles. The company\u2019s Jeep division was a stellar performer, with an increase in sales of more than 40 percent.All three of the major Japanese auto companies had strong months as well.Toyota Motor said it sold 238,000 vehicles in December, which was a 10.8 percent improvement from the same month a year earlier.Honda Motor reported a sales increase of about 10 percent, and Nissan Motor said its sales had soared nearly 19 percent. Both companies have done extremely well with new, small S.U.V.s \u2014 commonly called crossovers \u2014 that appeal to younger buyers.The year ended poorly for Volkswagen, which reported an overall sales decline of 3.4 percent for December. Sales of the company\u2019s core Volkswagen brand vehicles \u2014 which are at the center of the emissions crisis \u2014 slid more than 9 percent in December compared with a year earlier.The bright spot for Volkswagen continued to be its Audi luxury brand, which reported a 6 percent improvement in sales.Analysts and consumers will be getting a preview over the next two weeks of some of the new models that automakers will offer in 2016.One industry analyst predicted that advances in technology would accelerate this year, as traditional auto companies compete with tech companies like Google to develop self-driving vehicles.\u201cWith respect to technological change, we believe the answer is far sooner, faster and more powerfully than one might expect,\u201d Adam Jonas, a Morgan Stanley analyst, wrote in a research note on Tuesday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Boy\u2019s Response to Blasphemy Charge Unnerves Many in Pakistan", "Date": "2016-01-18", "News": "Supported byLAHORE, Pakistan \u2014 Late one night, the imam Shabir Ahmad looked up from prayers at his mosque to see a 15-year-old boy approaching with a plate in his outstretched left hand. On it was the boy\u2019s freshly severed right hand.Mr. Ahmad did not hesitate. He fled the mosque and left the village, in eastern Punjab Province.The boy, Anwar Ali, the son of a poor laborer, had been attending an evening prayer gathering at the mosque in the village, Khanqah, when Mr. Ahmad asked for a show of hands of those who did not love the Prophet Muhammad. Thinking the cleric had asked for those who did love the prophet, Anwar\u2019s hand shot up, according to witnesses and the boy\u2019s family.He realized his mistake when he saw that his was the only hand up, and he quickly put it down. But by then Mr. Ahmad was screaming \u201cBlasphemer!\u201d at him, along with many others in the crowd. \u201cDon\u2019t you love your prophet?\u201d they called, as the boy fled in disgrace.Anwar went home, found a sharp scythe and chopped off his right hand that same night. When he showed it to the cleric, he made clear it was an offering to absolve his perceived sin.The police quickly caught the mullah and locked him up, but local religious leaders protested, and the authorities backed down and released him. After the international news media began picking up on the story over the weekend, the authorities rearrested Mr. Ahmad on Sunday, holding him on terrorism and other charges.\u201cThere is no physical evidence against the cleric of involvement, but he has been charged for inciting and arousing the emotions of people to such a level that the boy did this act,\u201d the district police chief, Faisal Rana, said.The boy\u2019s family, however, argues that the cleric did nothing wrong and should not be punished.\u201cWe are lucky that we have this son who loves Prophet Muhammad that much,\u201d Muhammad Ghafoor, Anwar\u2019s father, said in a telephone interview. \u201cWe will be rewarded by God for this in the eternal world.\u201dAnwar, too, declined to make any charge against the mullah. \u201cWhat I did was for love of the Prophet Muhammad,\u201d he said.Blasphemy is a toxic subject in Pakistan, where a confusing body of laws has enshrined it as a potentially capital offense but also makes it nearly impossible for the accused to defend themselves in court. Even publicly repeating details of the accusation is tantamount to blasphemy in its own right.Such cases almost never make it to court, however. The merest accusation that blasphemy has occurred has the power to arouse lynching or mob violence.\u201cWe have become a society so intoxicated by negative things in the name of religion that parents feel proud of sending their children to jihad and to die in the name of such activities,\u201d said I.A. Rehman, the secretary general of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. \u201cThe government needs to do more to educate people and to speak out against extremism.\u201dAnwar Ali did not even go to a hospital after his amputation, but had his right arm\u2019s stump bandaged at a village clinic and went home. Family members buried his hand in the village graveyard.Waqar Gillani reported from Lahore, and Rod Nordland from Kabul, Afghanistan.Advertisement"}

A bill under consideration in Congress \u201cis a way for people who aren\u2019t getting what they want out of the process or getting it fast enough to get their views injected.\u201dThe goals of the drone hobbyists, companies and safety advocates differ in some ways. Hobby groups are trying to peel back recreational registration rules, while airline pilots are pushing for more mandates that drone makers like DJI and GoPro put safety technology on machines. Amazon and Google, which want to use drones for delivery, are asking permission to test their technology. They agree, though, that the F.A.A. is due for fresh guidance on its approach to drone rules.On Capitol Hill, where much of the attention has turned in recent weeks, lobbyists are focusing on a reauthorization bill for the F.A.A. The bill gives the agency guidance on regulations and funding for projects like commercial drone testing sites. It can also include more specific instructions, like for the agency to strengthen \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or loosen \u00e2\u0080\u0094 safety and privacy rules for the use of drones.Lawmakers are close to finishing a draft on the bill, which several congressional aides said would include mandates on drones. A draft could be completed by early February, the aides said. It is unclear if the lobbying efforts will have much effect on lawmakers; aides said various lobbyists who have asked for meetings are asking for a broad set of provisions.Yet, Amazon and Google clearly see the reauthorization bill as an opportunity to advance their goal of using drones to deliver packages from warehouses to doorsteps. Drone deliveries are now restricted, and proposed rules by the F.A.A. would keep those drones grounded for the foreseeable future. The companies are pushing lawmakers to allow for experimental testing of drone delivery in sparsely populated areas and more research and development of delivery plans, according to Michael E. Drobac, a leader of Akin Gump\u2019s unmanned aerial vehicle lobbying practice, which represents Amazon.\u201cWe expect regulations to come in stages,\u201d Mr. Drobac said. \u201cAny delivery company will look for mechanisms now for delivery in less densely populated areas.\u201dAmazon and Google have also pushed lawmakers to apply pressure on the F.A.A. to move faster with their first-time rules for commercial drones, Mr. Drobac said. The rules are not expected to allow delivery at first, but lobbyists say it could be an important first step forward in their plans.\u00e2\u0080\u009cCompanies want to be able to benefit from drones by flying beyond visual line of sight, or near congested areas or over people, in a way that is safe,\u201d said Lisa Ellman, a lawyer at Hogan Lovells, which represents commercial drone hardware and software makers. \u201cThe F.A.A. is taking steps in that direction, but slowly.\u201dGoPro, DJI and other makers of recreational drones, meanwhile, are lobbying against more rules. In December, the F.A.A. introduced its mandatory registration system for recreational drone users, and some lawmakers and safety advocates said the agency needs to go further to prevent collisions in the air and to keep users accountable. DJI and GoPro executives sat on the F.A.A.\u2019s task force that came up with recommendations for the registration system that began in December.The Air Line Pilots Association has been urging lawmakers to require point-of-sale registration at retail stores or online. And it is lobbying for provisions in the reauthorization bill that would require \u201csense and avoidance\u201d technology that would automatically steer a drone away from a nearby object.\u201cThe proliferation of these vehicles has reached a point where there needs to be a more aggressive approach to safety,\u201d said Tim Canoll, president of the Air Line Pilots Association.Some of those concerns were echoed last week by Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, the highest-ranking Democrat on the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, the group that will oversee the drafting of the F.A.A.\u2019s reauthorization bill. He wrote letters to the F.A.A., Department of Homeland Security, NASA, and Pentagon calling on them to coordinate on drone safety and security.Every time a drone is spotted \u201cnear an airport runway, or used to smuggle contraband over a prison wall, reminds us that this technology poses another kind of threat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Nelson wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI ask that your agencies increase collaboration to mitigate the risk.\u00e2\u0080\u009dFollowAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Good Governance Stock Index Lacks Expert Judgment", "Date": "2016-01-29", "News": "Supported byAnother ViewLast week in Davos, Switzerland, a group of giant pension funds unveiled a new stock index, the Standard & Poor\u2019s Long-Term Value Creation Global Index.In the image of the World Economic Forum whence it came, the index aspires to collect the best-run global companies, by evaluating their governance, financial quality and sustainability initiatives. Most Standard & Poor\u2019s indexes are defined by mere region and asset class. What is the purpose of a stock index composed of supposed global elites?\u201cWe are trying to use the index to change corporate behavior,\u201d said Mark Wiseman of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, a member of the group that established the index.So how will the Standard & Poor\u2019s Long-Term Value Creation Global Index work? Its marketing materials point out that despite the qualitative nature of the criteria \u2014 long-term strategy, innovation, sustainability \u2014 do not worry, \u201cexpert judgment is limited.\u201d Instead of experts using their brains, the \u201cindex\u201d will rely on a messy stew of checklists and quantitative models. The \u201cquality score,\u201d for instance, seeks to tell us how good a business is based on a formula with three inputs: return on equity, financial leverage and a rudimentary balance sheet metric. This is, of course, madness.Here we have an opaque, quantitative investment strategy masquerading as an S.&P. index based on qualitative factors. And what are the largest holdings of this \u201cindex\u201d of long-term value creators? What are the elite companies that Mr. Wiseman hopes will be the envy of their peers? Perhaps visionaries like Google, Amazon or Berkshire Hathaway? Nope. The top 10 holdings include two cigarette makers, McDonald\u2019s, and, why not, McGraw Hill Financial, which happens to own Standard & Poor\u2019s.What\u2019s especially frustrating about this ill-advised plan is that the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and its cohorts should know better. Public pension plans have learned a lot of tough lessons about the cost of bad public company governance. For much of the 1970s and 1980s, passive institutional investors struggled with their responsibilities as large public company shareholders. After they were exploited for years by both corporate raiders and entrenched management teams, General Motors\u2019 1986 buyout of Ross Perot\u2019s stake in the automaker drove them over the edge. The head of the State of Wisconsin Investment Board proclaimed, \u201cIf shareholders continue to be passive, they will continue to be shorn like sheep.\u201dBy the end of the 1980s, many large institutional investors were doing their homework. They ran proxy fights, submitted scores of shareholder resolutions and formed opinions on sophisticated corporate governance issues. This paved the way for the kind of shareholder activism that dominates markets today. The current explosion in hedge fund shareholder activism, which has pressured corporations like Microsoft, Apple, DuPont and General Electric, has been fed by the (often tacit) support of large institutional investors behind the scenes.And now, rather than directly challenging offenders as a shareholder activist might, the pension funds want to ride the growing wave of indexation to create an exclusive collection of best-in-class companies. They hope to lure retail investors into this \u201cindex,\u201d which they believe can provide excellent investment returns while encouraging corporate management teams to focus on long-term value creation. The problem is, you can\u2019t identify great, long-term oriented companies with quantitative models and checklists.The proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services provides a cautionary tale about relying on checklists to evaluate corporate boards. Robert A.G. Monks and Nell Minow, two renowned scholars of corporate governance, founded I.S.S. in 1985 with the best intentions. Mr. Monks and Ms. Minow used their own expert judgment to advise public company shareholders on how to vote their proxies. Since they sold the business in 1992, it has changed hands several times and grown rapidly. Regulations that require investment firms to have robust proxy voting policies have had the peculiar effect of pushing more of them to outsource the responsibility to I.S.S.As the proxy adviser\u2019s growth forced it to resort to standardized, checklist-style evaluations, some of its recommendations became shockingly imprudent. In 2004, I.S.S. advised Coca-Cola shareholders to withhold votes from Warren E. Buffett because of conflicts of interest related to his ownership of Dairy Queen. Apparently, there was no question on I.S.S.\u2019s checklist that asked, \u201cIs the candidate the greatest capital allocator to ever live?\u201dMr. Wiseman, the Canadian pension board and their pension fund partners should know that wise, long-term corporate governance requires the kind of sound business judgment you cannot evaluate by employing a hundred-page checklist. Markets will only reward companies that govern themselves for the long term when large institutional owners use their expert judgment to vote bad boards out of office.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Atelier Versace and Dior: The New Abnormal Normal?", "Date": "2016-01-25", "News": "Supported byFashion ReviewDoes this mean they are out of touch? It was hard not to think that in the wake of a conversation about global technological disruption, the clothes on show (and indeed, the whole couture enterprise itself) could end up looking alarmingly disconnected. One day you have the economist Nouriel Roubini discussing what he has labeled \u201cthe new abnormal\u201d state of world markets; a few days later, Giorgio Armani is unveiling a subset of his main Armani ready-to-wear collection entitled \u201cThe New Normal.\u201d It\u2019s a little disconcerting.44 PhotosYet designers are not nearly as oblivious to this situation, and the need to make couture relevant, as you might assume. If not all their solutions are convincing, at least, as the run of shows began, they were wrestling with the problem.For Donatella Versace, for example, the answer lay in the realm not of Silicon Valley, but silicon gel, as well as a variety of other symbols and fabrications that had to do with sports, and the power and energy encased in the human form, as opposed to a motherboard. Her argument posited the body as the ultimate smart machine.Sharp smoking jackets cinched asymmetrically by luggage straps were paired with stretchy stirrup pants; sheer crystal-mesh bodysuits and T-shirts were layered under cowl-backed minidresses; and the usual bounty of cleavage-baring necklines were transformed into racer tanks and draped and dropped to show a flash of hip here, a slash of side there. Webs of \u201cwater jet-cut\u201d velvet backed by leather formed bomber jackets and stiff skirts, and it was all held together, mostly, by crystal bungee cords. The only prints came in the form of ergonomic lines racing over the body.Imagine Barbarella going on a jog around the Google campus, and you\u2019ll get the idea. It wasn\u2019t always flattering, and the tension between haute heritage and high functionality was not entirely \u2014 well, worked out, but it was full of effort.\u201cToday enjoying a great meal with friends may strangely become an act of resilience\u201d went the show notes, in an oblique reference to the Paris attacks of last November, and out came a series of easy little skirt suits, the jackets embroidered with ornate teakettles or Wedgwood porcelain; bias-cut evening gowns in silk crepe printed with cherries and root vegetables, the shoulder straps twisted in the classical mode; and a navy blue jacquard covered in silver spoons (and assorted other cutlery).42 PhotosIt sounds clowny, but in fact the sartorial jokes and surreal references were less heavy-handed then they have been in the past, especially when it came to neat jackets in a patchwork geometry of 19th-century dish towels over Op Art awning-striped taffeta gowns, which elevated the ordinary to the interesting.Rather, it is being led by Lucie Meier and Serge Ruffieux, the heads of studio under the former artistic director Raf Simons, who are filling his shoes on an interim basis. It is their job to advance the vision he left behind without being too wildly assertive about their own ideas, so as to allow the next artistic director, whoever he or she may be (and the rumors are rife), to take the brand in a new direction.In practice this meant new versions of the Bar jacket, the Dior classic that Mr. Simons revived, but oversize and mannish (and a bit clunky) or shrunken, with a frilled peplum and fluted sleeves (much better). It meant curving Bar coats and dresses cut away from the body with one shoulder tacked down as if it had slipped off, layered over thin jeweled tulle T-shirts.49 PhotosIt meant high-waisted pencil skirts, a stiff ruffle climbing over the waist and jutting out weirdly at the hips, three-dimensional lily of the valley and insect beading that referred to Mr. Dior\u2019s favorite charms, but in a tougher, more dangerous way; and odd proportions that were potentially provocative to consider, but not particularly pretty to wear (corset minidresses with long sheer skirts attached). It meant the collection as a whole looked neither here nor there.It was neither the new abnormal nor the new normal but maybe the new abnormal normal. It\u2019s not a revolution, but in fashion, given the current state of designer churn, it may actually turn out to be a thing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fake Online Locksmiths May Be Out to Pick Your Pocket, Too", "Date": "2016-01-30", "News": "Supported byMaybe this has happened to you.Locked out of your car or home, you pull out your phone and type \u201clocksmith\u201d into Google. Up pops a list of names, the most promising of which appear beneath the paid ads, in space reserved for local service companies.You might assume that the search engine\u2019s algorithm has instantly sifted through the possibilities and presented those that are near you and that have earned good customer reviews. Some listings will certainly fit that description. But odds are good that your results include locksmiths that are not locksmiths at all.They are call centers \u2014 often out of state, sometimes in a different country \u2014 that use a high-tech ruse to trick Google into presenting them as physical stores in your neighborhood. These operations, known as lead generators, or lead gens for short, keep a group of poorly trained subcontractors on call. After your details are forwarded, usually via text, one of those subcontractors jumps in a car and heads to your vehicle or home. That is when the trouble starts.The goal of lead gens is to wrest as much money as possible from every customer, according to lawsuits. The typical approach is for a phone representative to offer an estimate in the range of $35 to $90. On site, the subcontractor demands three or four times that sum, often claiming that the work was more complicated than expected. Most consumers simply blanch and pay up, in part because they are eager to get into their homes or cars.\u201cIt was very late, and it was very cold,\u201d said Anna Pietro, recalling an evening last January when she called Allen Emergency, the nearest locksmith to her home in a Dallas suburb, according to a Google Maps search on her iPhone. \u201cThis guy shows up and says he needs to drill my door lock, which will cost $350, about seven times the estimate I\u2019d been given on the phone. And he demanded cash.\u201dThe phone number at Allen Emergency is now disconnected.Lead gens have their deepest roots in locksmithing, but the model has migrated to an array of services, including garage door repair, carpet cleaning, moving and home security. Basically, they surface in any business where consumers need someone in the vicinity to swing by and clean, fix, relocate or install something.\u201cI\u2019m not exaggerating when I say these guys have people in every large and midsize city in the United States,\u201d said John Ware, an assistant United States attorney in St. Louis, speaking of lead-gen locksmiths.A Google spokesman said that the company worked hard to check bad actors and quickly removed listings that violate its policies.But the company is still too easily tricked into listing lead gens, high up, even after years of redesigns and algorithm adjustments, critics say. Local service results have improved of late, but too many consumers are still getting ripped off because Google, the world\u2019s biggest search engine, is perennially a step behind a group of sophisticated swindlers, according to experts in the field.The flaws in the Google machine are well known to Avi, an Israeli-born locksmith, who asked that his last name be omitted from this story, citing threats by competitors. (\u201cOne told me there is a bounty on my head,\u201d he said.) Avi has been at war with lead-gen operators for eight years. It\u2019s like guerrilla combat, because the companies are forever expanding and always innovating, he said.The company\u2019s website at the time listed six physical locations, including a pinkish, two-story building at 10275 West Santa Fe Drive, Sun City, Ariz. When Avi looked up that address in Google Maps, he saw in the bottom left-hand corner a street-view image of the same pinkish building at the end of a retail strip.There seemed no reason to doubt that a pinkish building stood at 10275 West Santa Fe Drive.Avi was skeptical. \u201cThat\u2019s about a five-minute drive from here,\u201d he said.We jumped in his car. It wasn\u2019t long before the voice in his GPS announced, \u201cYou have arrived.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the address,\u201d he said. He was pointing to a low white-brick wall that ran beside a highway. There was no pinkish building and no stores. Other than a large, featureless warehouse on the other side of the street, there was little in sight.\u201cThis is what I\u2019m dealing with,\u201d Avi said. \u201cGhosts.\u201d(Yes, Google makes money every time a person clicks on an AdWords ad, and yes, in the case of locksmiths, the cost can be $30 for every click \u2014 even more in some cities. If you\u2019ve ever wondered how Google gives away services and is still among the most profitable companies in the world, wonder no more. People clicking AdWords generated $60 billion last year.)In a search for locksmiths in Mountain View, Calif., home to Google\u2019s headquarters, the first AdWords listing was 24hourlocksmithsanjose.net, which offered $19 service. Research into the company\u2019s domain name revealed that it is owned by Yossi Assraf of Locksmith Advertising, in Portland, Ore.Those have all the trappings of a lead gen. And, 247 Locksmith Advertising has an F rating from the Better Business Bureau, along with a list of nearly identical complaints.\u201cOver all the cost was $200!!\u201d wrote one unhappy customer, who had been expecting to pay $19. \u201cThis was a complete bait and switch!\u201dMessages left for Yossi Assraf were not returned.Recently, I sent Google the ad for 24hourlocksmithsanjose, as well as a screen shot of the fake Locksmith Force building and the names of about 20 other locksmiths that appeared to be lead gens. The company asked for a few days to look into the matter.National data that could capture the scale of the lead-gen problem does not exist, largely because most of the complaints occur at the state level, by way of attorneys general, Better Business Bureaus and Yelp. Also, the sums involved are usually modest, so many people have no idea they have been swindled, or they know but don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth anyone\u2019s while to contact the authorities.\u201cTalk to anyone in the business and they\u2019ll tell you that revenue is down 30 to 40 percent,\u201d said Mark Baldino, who owns a handful of locksmith stores in the Washington area. \u201cThere are 10 fake locations around me, and consumers have no idea which of us is real and which is going to rip them off.\u201dThe difference between people like Mr. Baldino and locksmiths sent by lead gens is not just a physical storefront; excellent locksmiths work out of cars and vans, too. Lead-gen locksmiths are essentially short-term hires, and their priority is not repeat customers. It\u2019s quick cash.Many of the locksmith lead gens are run by Israelis, and Avi learned their modus operandi by working for them. When he landed at La Guardia Airport in 2008, he wanted to work with computers, the field he had trained for in Israel. But it was the height of the recession, and he did not have many options.\u201cAt the time, if you were an Israeli, it was either carpet cleaning or locksmithing,\u201d he said. \u201cI tried carpet cleaning for a week and hurt my back so badly, I said this is not for me.\u201dA company in New Jersey, owned by an Israeli, hired him, gave him a week of training and told him he could keep 40 percent of every job. His instructions were to size up each customer and ask for as much money as possible. He quit, found an honest shop, eventually earned enough to open his own company and relocated to Phoenix.Many of the recruits later establish their own lead-gen operations, which then recruit more talent. This has increased competition and made deceiving Google an ever more esoteric pursuit. That was evident during a conversation with Roy Alverado, the owner of Locksmith Force, the company that created the fake pink building in Sun City. He insisted that he ran an authentic local business, with trained and courteous locksmiths.As for that fake building: \u201cWe wanted to have a store in that area, but the rents were too high,\u201d he said. He told a web design firm to create a building using Photoshop. Actually, all but one of the buildings are Photoshop creations, since Locksmith Force\u2019s sole physical location is in Phoenix, Mr. Alverado said. The more buildings on the site, he candidly stated, the more people would believe they were calling someone who could show up at a car or house quickly.Mr. Alverado said those fake buildings were necessary because getting to the first page in Google results now took ingenuity and cunning.\u201cYou have no idea,\u201d he said, sounding a little weary when asked about competition. Israelis were his toughest rivals, he said, and they had instilled a kind of awe in him. \u201cI can tell you point-blank, they are freaking smart,\u201d he said. \u201cI really admire them.\u201dA few months ago, he decided that he needed some help with search engine optimization. A company called Over the Top SEO showed up on the first page of an \u201cSEO company\u201d search, so he figured it was very good. Then he saw that the company was based in Israel. Mr. Alverado was sold. If he couldn\u2019t beat the Israelis, he would hire them.\u201cWe\u2019re already seeing great results,\u201d he said.Even with the rise of Facebook and improvements to Apple Maps, Google is still the essential source of revenue for local businesses \u2014 85 percent of all local search traffic reaches local businesses through Google, according to Mike Blumenthal, who writes a definitive blog on the topic.To understand how lead gens game Google\u2019s algorithm, you need to know a bit about how a company\u2019s address winds up in Google\u2019s results, and how those results can be fraudulently altered. Few know the particulars better than Bryan Seely, who worked for a lead-gen outfit in the automotive glass repair field, based in Southern California, from 2008 to 2010. During that time, he produced about 3,000 fake auto glass repair listings across the country. Eventually appalled by his handiwork, he became what he calls a reformed hacker and explained his techniques in a self-published book, \u201cCyber Fraud: The Web of Lies.\u201d\u201cMy hope was that the book would cause Google to patch up these holes,\u201d he said on the phone recently. \u201cIt didn\u2019t work.\u201dBoth Google My Business and Map Maker are a bit like Wikipedia, insofar as they are largely built and maintained by millions of contributors. Keeping the system open, with verification, gives countless businesses an invaluable online presence. Google officials say that the system is so good that many local companies do not bother building their own websites. Anyone who has ever navigated using Google Maps knows the service is a technological wonder.But the very quality that makes Google\u2019s systems accessible to companies that want to be listed makes them vulnerable to pernicious meddling.\u201cThis is what you get when you rely on crowdsourcing for all your \u2018up to date\u2019 and \u2018relevant\u2019 local business content,\u201d Mr. Seely said. \u201cYou get people who contribute meaningful content, and you get people who abuse the system.\u201dThe most obvious symptom of abuse is a wild proliferation of lead-gen listings. Charles Eastwood, a locksmith in Phoenix, subpoenaed Acxiom, a data brokerage firm, as part of a lawsuit he filed against a group of purported lead gens in 2010. He wanted to know how many locksmiths were listed in Arizona.\u201cThere were 9,600 of them in the list I got from Acxiom,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s about 9,000 more than anyone believes actually work in the state.\u201dTo fight lead gens, Google deploys a little-known army of volunteers, called Mappers, many of whom are engaged in a contest that takes wit and stamina. These are people around the world who propose and approve edits to Google Maps, with an assist from Google employees, all in the interest of refining the product and fighting spam \u2014 a term that in this context means anything fake and misleading.It may seem bizarre that people would work gratis for one of the world\u2019s richest companies. But many Mappers turn the job into a calling. For Dan Austin, who lives in Olympia, Wash., it was more like an addiction.A former truck driver for DHL, he became a Mapper after he was laid off from his job and started fixing mistakes he had noticed on Maps while on the road. By the fall of 2011, Mr. Austin had discovered locksmith spam and was soon spending 10 hours a day, seven days a week, deleting it from Maps.\u201cIt was like a video game except it had a moral element to it,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, I\u2019d have wiped out 1,000 locations and I would think, that\u2019s 1,000 phone calls that didn\u2019t get made, 1,000 consumers who didn\u2019t get scammed. I felt like Superman.\u201dMr. Austin became a Regional Lead, the highest rank in Google\u2019s Boy Scout-like badge system of incentives, a job \u2014 still unpaid \u2014 that required him to sign a nondisclosure agreement.He was quickly locked in a struggle that seemed inspired by Cold War spycraft. Some lead-gen owners became Mappers themselves, hoping to stealthily protect their listings. They were essentially moles. One of them, who called himself Baton Sason, contacted Mr. Austin through a private detective.\u201cAt first, he thought I was another spammer,\u201d Mr. Austin recalled. When Mr. Sason realized that Mr. Austin was truly on Google\u2019s side, he tried to win amnesty for his sites in exchange for help informing on his competitors. Mr. Austin played along for a few months, then deleted Mr. Sason\u2019s sites too.Initially, Mr. Austin regarded Google as a benign Goliath that cared about consumers and small businesses. But about 18 months after his campaign began, pessimism crept in. He realized, he said, that spammers were changing tactics much faster than Google was adopting countermeasures.\u201cFor me, it was always like I was looking at a five-alarm fire,\u201d he said. \u201cTo them, it was smoldering.\u201dBy the fall of 2012, Mr. Austin was disillusioned. He decided that the subtle approach to getting attention wasn\u2019t working. So he did something obnoxious. In the middle of the Google Map of Los Angeles, he placed a marijuana grow house. Not a dispensary, which is legal. A grow house, which is a place where plants are harvested. Those are illegal. Then he highlighted the stunt on a Map Maker forum.The plan was to demonstrate that it was too easy to hoodwink Google. The plan failed. Google fired him from his unpaid job. (A Google spokesman declined to comment.)Today, Mr. Austin has the faintly bitter tone of a man who has left a cult, but he is cleareyed about why Google never seemed to respond quickly enough to spammers. It wasn\u2019t a priority, he said. The company is dominated by software coders, and they want to solve the most interesting problems, or create the coolest products.\u201cFighting spam is boring,\u201d Mr. Austin said. \u201cThe employees who cared didn\u2019t have the political clout in the company. I\u2019d hear Googlers say, \u2018Maps is a mess. It\u2019s known at the highest levels, but we don\u2019t talk about it publicly.\u2019\u201dLittle, it seems, went right after that. One defendant fled the country, according to prosecutors. In 2013, a federal magistrate judge recommended dismissing the case because the government had deported four witnesses, all of them former Dependable employees who might have helped the defendants. The judge also suggested that the case would be difficult for the prosecution to win because Dependable phone representatives usually added the phrase \u201cand up\u201d when quoting prices.One of the prosecutors, Mr. Ware, the assistant United States attorney in St. Louis, respectfully disagreed with those findings.\u201cNinety percent of people were charged more than the estimate,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had locksmiths tell us that they would take whatever they could get from customers.\u201dOne lesson of the Dependable case, which took years from inception to dismissal, is that the criminal courts are a terrible way to fight purported lead-gen locksmiths. Civil cases have fared no better. Mr. Baldino, the locksmith in Washington area, lost a case against Google and other directories in which he said the companies commingled legitimate and illegitimate players in listings. Last February, a Virginia state court found that Google had immunity under the Communications Decency Act, which extends to all information that does not originate with Google \u2014 \u201ceven when given notice that it has published false information,\u201d the court concluded.Only Google, it seems, can fix Google. The company is trying, its representatives say, by, among other things, removing fake information quickly and providing a \u201cReport a Problem\u201d tool on the maps. After looking over the fake Locksmith Force building, a bunch of other lead-gen advertisers in Phoenix and that Mountain View operation with more than 800 websites, Google took action.Not only has the fake Locksmith Force building vanished from Google Maps, but the company no longer turns up in a \u201clocksmith Phoenix\u201d search. At least not in the first 20 pages. Nearly all the other spammy locksmiths pointed out to Google have disappeared from results, too.\u201cWe\u2019re in a constant arms race with local business spammers who, unfortunately, use all sorts of tricks to try to game our system and who\u2019ve been a thorn in the Internet\u2019s side for over a decade,\u201d a Google spokesman wrote in an email. \u201cAs spammers change their techniques, we\u2019re continually working on new, better ways to keep them off Google Search and Maps. There\u2019s work to do, and we want to keep doing better.\u201dThere was no mention of a stronger verification system or a beefed-up spam team at Google. Without such systemic solutions, Google\u2019s critics say, the change to local results will not rise even to the level of superficial.Apprised that Locksmith Force had been relegated to the Internet\u2019s version of oblivion, Avi was in no mood to celebrate.\u201cOne down,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cFifty thousand to go.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Coach\u2019s Fire Returns With a Fresh Attitude ", "Date": "2016-01-02", "News": "Supported byHELSINKI, Finland \u2014 After his 18-season N.H.L. coaching career ended tumultuously, Ron Wilson needed time to decompress and fall back in love with hockey before he would even consider coaching again. Now, almost four years after the Toronto Maple Leafs fired him, Wilson is back behind the bench, and this time he\u2019s having fun. Wilson, 60, is coaching Team USA at the International Ice Hockey Federation\u2019s world junior championship, which concludes here Tuesday. He is the first former N.H.L. head coach to lead the Americans in this under-20 tournament. The team is 4-1 after defeating the Czech Republic, 7-0, on Saturday and will face Russia in a semifinal on Monday.Wilson\u2019s background also includes coaching the American senior national team to a bronze medal in the 1996 men\u2019s world championship and to the title in the 1996 World Cup of Hockey. He coached the Olympic teams in 1998 and 2010, taking the silver with the latter group, and led the Washington Capitals, one of four N.H.L. teams he has coached, into the Stanley Cup finals in 1998.Jim Johannson, assistant executive director of USA Hockey and the general manager of the national junior team, knew coaching at this tournament was missing from Wilson\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and wanted him to consider taking over the team. But he also realized that Wilson had to come to a decision himself.\u201cI reached out to see if he had an interest to get back into coaching because, if he did, I wanted to have a conversation about it,\u201d Johannson said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t interested at first, but we stayed in touch, and when he finally called to ask about the job, you could hear the genuine interest in his voice. You knew he was ready.\u201dWilson, who took over as coach last June, said he had started to miss the game and was intrigued by the challenge of coaching younger players.\u201cThis is really the only age group I hadn\u2019t coached,\u201d he said.Wilson had 1,401 N.H.L. victories, but after so many years out of the game, he was something of a mystery to his 18- and 19-year-old players. \u201cI Googled him; I feel like most guys did,\u201d said Zach Werenski, the Team USA captain.Auston Matthews, who is projected to be the first selection in June\u2019s N.H.L. draft, said he had heard of Wilson but knew little more than that he had coached in the N.H.L. \u201ca really long time.\u201d\u201cNow that I\u2019ve gotten to spend some time with him, he\u2019s a really interesting guy, really laid back and funny too,\u201d Matthews said.Fun, it seems, is a recurring theme when players talk about Wilson.\u201cHe just really likes to joke around,\u201d said Matthew Tkachuk, whose father, Keith, had a 19-year N.H.L. career and was on the World Cup team that Wilson coached in 1996. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely got a lighter side to him that most people don\u2019t get to see.\u201dAnders Bjork, a forward, said: \u201cHe\u2019s done so much and been so successful, but then you get to know him and he\u2019s just a normal guy who likes to joke around and have fun. \u201cIt\u2019s not at all what you\u2019d think he\u2019d be, seeing him all serious on the bench. He\u2019s always making us laugh.\u201dFour years ago, \u201cfunny\u201d would not have been an adjective used to describe Wilson. Toiling under an intense news media microscope in Toronto, Wilson received a contract extension in December 2011 after the Leafs\u2019 promising start to the season. But they plummeted in the standings almost immediately after. With the Leafs\u2019 seventh consecutive season without a playoff berth suddenly imminent, Wilson was fired in March 2012.\u201cThe two years away from the game, finally I got exorcised of all the demons I had chasing me in Toronto,\u201d Wilson said, adding, in a reference to the media scrutiny: \u201cI didn\u2019t have to worry about those guys anymore. It took me a while to get over the Toronto experience. That\u2019s all it was.\u201dWilson said he wanted to make sure that his players fed off his own newfound love for the game.\u201cI want to let them see a little bit of my personality,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cI\u2019m not showing them all my cards, but I do like to keep things light when we\u2019re away from the rink.\u201d One of those lighter moments came the day after the Americans defeated Canada, 4-2, in their first game of the preliminary round. Colin White, Louie Belpedio, Werenski and Matthews each scored. Everyone but Matthews did the dab \u2014 a celebratory move popularized by professional athletes like Cam Newton and LeBron James that resembles sneezing into your elbow. \u201cI had to ask, \u2018What the heck are they doing?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Wilson said. \u201cAt first, they told me they were sneezing, and then they told me it was the dab, and that\u2019s a new one to me.\u201cI had no idea what they were doing. I thought maybe they were kissing their bicep, but no they\u2019re dabbing and that\u2019s fine. I want our kids to have fun. They can dab all they want.\u201dWhether it\u2019s ribbing players during practice, bumping them while they\u2019re trying to give an interview, firing off one-liners in the locker room or learning what it means to dab, Wilson is making sure there is as much focus on having fun as there is on winning a fourth gold medal for Team USA in the tournament\u2019s 40 years. Now that he\u2019s got the love of the game back, he doesn\u2019t want to let it go. \u201cWe want to win, but why can\u2019t we have some fun while doing it?\u201d Wilson said.Advertisement"}

Even if it hadn\u2019t been, I was snowed in. At the same time, nearly a dozen tornadoes slammed the Dallas area in Texas, the deadliest to sweep through since 1927, according to the National Weather Service. Meanwhile, in the Midwest, there was deadly flooding in Missouri and Illinois.Severe weather events such as floods, storms and heat waves appear to be happening with greater frequency. There have been an average of 335 weather-related disasters each year between 2005 and 2014, up 14 percent from the previous decade, and nearly double the level of the decade before that, according to a November report issued by the United Nations.Travel in an age of uncertain climate means that at some point, your plans are likely to be upended by weather. Still, with a bit of preparation and the right attitude, it doesn\u2019t have to proverbially rain on your vacation. Below are some tips on how to be ready for whatever comes your way.When that happens, airlines usually just rebook you on the next flight with available seats, or give you a refund for the unused portion of your flight. For the fine print about cancellations and delays, Google your airline\u2019s name and \u201ccontract of carriage.\u201dAir passenger rights are stronger in the European Union, where you\u2019re generally entitled to more amenities when things go wrong, but there\u2019s no compensation for cancellations for bad weather.So, yes, there were icicles on the palm fronds in New Mexico. Flights were canceled. I had a lot of work to do. But I was safe. I had a laptop. And to paraphrase a friend, you never know what will work out for the best.

I took several pictures of him with my small Canon digital point-and-shoot, and he made his portrait of me with the vintage Speed Graphic, with an attachment that instantly produces a 3 by 4-inch picture. He gave me the print in a festive-looking folder and I promised to put my portraits of him on his Facebook page, which I later did.I later reflected on how the medium of photography had shaped both of our lives, but how it had taken us in such different directions.

{"Headline": "In Iowa, Jobs Are Plentiful but Workers Are Not", "Date": "2016-01-28", "News": "Supported byAMES, Iowa \u2014 Unlike the indoor basketball court, foosball tables or fireside lounge at Workiva\u2019s sprawling campus here, the oversize green prize wheel centered among a hive of work stations is not meant for break times.Only employees who refer new hires get a chance to spin it and win up to $2,500.\u201cThirty percent of our recruiting comes from that wheel,\u201d said Matthew M. Rizai, chief executive of Workiva, a cloud-based software firm. The hunt for workers is unrelenting, he said. \u201cWe always have openings.\u201dAt 3.4 percent, Iowa\u2019s unemployment rate is among the lowest in the country. With major metropolitan areas \u2014 crowded with hard-hat construction sites \u2014 painting an alluring picture of steady economic progress, business leaders here retain a sunny optimism that is rarely heard from the presidential candidates.But now that Iowa has achieved a tightening labor market that is the envy of most other states, many companies are confronted with a different set of challenges pushing them to rethink everything from recruiting to economic development.Some immigrants, particularly those without sought-after credentials in technology or science, say they have had trouble finding a job. Salih Salih, 34, who came to the United States as a refugee from Eritrea 10 years ago, said he believed his accent had been a handicap for him and many other people. \u201cThey\u2019re measuring their ability by how they speak English,\u201d said Mr. Salih, who has experience in maintenance and as an electrician.Mr. Salih has found temporary work through People360, an employment agency in Des Moines, but has struggled to find a permanent position despite a college degree and stellar evaluations.Immigrants can encounter difficulties, said Mr. Nelson, the Kemin chief executive, but he added that the acute labor shortage was nudging some skeptics in the business community to be more welcoming. \u201cThe only thing that\u2019s going to relieve us is getting immigrants into the state,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving babies is still a 20-year process.\u201dWith a growing number of retirees and stiff competition for young workers from surrounding Midwestern cities, getting people to resettle in Iowa is necessary for growth, said David A. Swenson, an economist at Iowa State. The state\u2019s important meatpacking, animal feed and dairy industries \u201chave been able to maintain profitability because of immigrant labor.\u201dBut even a relatively modest change in Iowa\u2019s demographics has helped foster a political backlash.Indeed, the state has a hard time attracting outsiders. For some employers, the recruitment strategy includes luring home people with an Iowa connection.\u201cAs a local business, we want people who are tied into the area,\u201d said David Kenworthy, chief executive of Storey Kenworthy, an office supply and furniture company. \u201cWe like to have people returning to Iowa, raise their family and put in roots.\u201dMark Core, an executive vice president at Vermeer, said that his customers say \u201cthe No. 1 thing holding back growth is labor \u2014 every time.\u201dSmall-town Iowans have a huge role in picking the next president. Their deep commitment to the process paints a distinct portrait of democracy.The shortage has a ripple effect. \u201cIt hurts a lot thinking we could add even more people if our end users could find more people to operate our machinery,\u201d Mr. Core said.How the lives of six residents intersected with the campaigns in the last week.Potential newcomers are given a detailed assessment of a particular area\u2019s labor market: how many people are unemployed or willing to switch jobs; how far they would commute; and a sampling of wages.When a company\u2019s representatives (Ms. Durham would prefer not to name names) recently came looking to pay below the $10 median wage that many Iowans now consider the minimum acceptable, Ms. Durham told them, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to find people at that wage.\u201dMany employers say they have raised wages to attract workers, particularly skilled ones, but the insistent complaints about labor shortages have put less pressure on wages in Iowa than expected, economists say.\u201cWage and salary earnings are very much less than the overall national average,\u201d said Mr. Swenson, of Iowa State, citing sectors that include finance, insurance and professional services. \u201cIf the labor supply is tight and you\u2019re not bidding up prices, you\u2019re just making noise.\u201dSome employers have an eye on the rearview mirror, where the last recession still looms large. Though Storey Kenworthy had a record year in 2015, Mr. Kenworthy, its chief, remembers seeing revenue drop more than a third in 2008 and being forced to cut staff. Since then, \u201cwe tried to look at things a little differently,\u201d he said, citing fixed costs like labor. A result is a trend around the country: more emphasis on nonwage benefits and bonuses that can be trimmed back if business dips. Since 2011, wages at the firm have risen to 2.5 from 2 percent annually, Mr. Kenworthy said, with employees now bringing home $48,000 on average. Yearly bonuses and profit sharing add 10 percent more.David Leto, executive vice president of the Palmer Group, an employment agency in Des Moines, said wages had steadily increased but \u201cemployees know not to ask for the moon here.\u201dEmployers are also conscious of keeping parity among existing workers and new hires, he said.He echoed a theme voiced by many Iowa employers: Here, someone can \u201clive big\u201d \u2014 find good schools for children and live in a comfortable house at a fraction of the cost on the coasts.\u201cNot everyone,\u201d Mr. Rizai said, \u201cwants to go to Silicon Valley.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "No Need to Fret, Apple Is Doing Fine", "Date": "2016-01-27", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtLet\u2019s get this out of the way first: Despite what you may have heard, the iPhone is not dying. Neither, by extension, is Apple.But if Apple is now hitting a plateau, it\u2019s important to remember that it\u2019s one of the loftiest plateaus in the history of business. The $18.4 billion profit that Apple reported on Tuesday is the most ever earned by any company in a single quarter.So this column will try to do something tricky: explore what\u2019s ailing Apple without going off the deep end. Here\u2019s my ice-cold take: Apple is doing quite O.K.Could it be doing some things better? Sure. Are any of its problems urgent? Not particularly, and from what one can tell, it\u2019s working to address many of its shortcomings. Does it face existential threats? Yes, but no more than any other tech giant. Will it remain an outsize presence in the tech industry for years to come, generating profits on a scale that no other corporation can match? Almost certainly.I\u2019ll get to those long-run worries in a bit, but let\u2019s start with the present. At the moment, Apple\u2019s biggest problem is its own success. The iPhone turns nine this year. The iPad turns six. These devices have made Apple the world\u2019s most valuable company (until Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, overtakes it, which might happen soon).Yet the very dominance of Apple\u2019s aging mobile empire inspires doubts about its future. The bigger the iPhone gets, the harder Apple has to work to beat its previous milestones, and the more vulnerable it appears to some fatal technological surprise.But there\u2019s something worth keeping in mind about each of these criticisms. They\u2019re the gripes of a technophile, and they don\u2019t necessarily reflect mainstream consumer perceptions about Apple\u2019s products.But if continued growth sounds like wishful thinking, there\u2019s another path for Apple to prosper even if iPhone sales do hit a wall: Suck more money out of each phone. In a note to clients last fall, analysts at Goldman Sachs suggested that through a widening number of subscription services baked into the iPhone, Apple could begin to reap a huge monthly fee from its users, which it said constituted \u201cthe most lucrative installed base in the world.\u201dIt\u2019s an argument Apple executives are starting to vocalize loudly. On Tuesday\u2019s earnings call, Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said the popularity of the iPhone provided the company a \u201clong-lasting foundation.\u201dApple\u2019s ecosystem is so sticky that people tend to flock to its services even if there are better products out there. Even if I\u2019m not a fan, 10 million people have subscribed to Apple Music in its first six months.Given all these options for minting bullion from the iPhone, the most alarming worries for Apple aren\u2019t about the present. They are about the future beyond the horizon, and they are necessarily speculative.The basic question is this: In the future, will physical devices matter less than they do now? If computers are more like the machines in the movie \u201cHer\u201d \u2014 ethereal, ambient computers that exist in the cloud, that respond to our voices and our bodies, anticipating our desires \u2014 what will happen to Apple then? This is a company whose entire existence hinges on the cultural appreciation of physical things. Can it prosper in an age of ambient computing?These are interesting questions to pose. I had a long conversation with Mr. Thompson about these ideas, and Apple\u2019s apparent weaknesses \u2014 how it\u2019s not as good at artificial intelligence and voice recognition as Google, how it lacks the cloud infrastructure that Amazon has built, and how, most important, its entire corporate culture is geared toward making actual stuff, which could limit its capacity to create fantastic online services.But ultimately the discussion felt academic. It seems obvious that as the tech world changes around it, Apple, over the next decade, will need to reinvent itself. But so will everyone else. That is just what you do in this industry.An earlier version of a credit for an illustration with this article misspelled the illustrator\u2019s surname.
