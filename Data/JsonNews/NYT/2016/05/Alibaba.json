You don\u2019t see people coming to China and saying, \u201cOh isn\u2019t that neat \u2014 let\u2019s bring that back to the U.S., or Japan, or wherever.\u201dIn the long run, this obsession with government control is a big problem for innovation.As for the exchange rate, the central bank wants a flexible rate that will help it set monetary policy in a more normal way, but the political leaders don\u2019t want the volatility that comes with that. You\u2019ve had a direct collision between the technocrats who honestly were trying to get a more market-oriented mechanism and those saying the key is for the exchange rate to be stable, because if it\u2019s not stable, then people will think that China isn\u2019t stable and that will be bad.Another way to look at it is that after three decades of economic growth that was mainly about building stuff \u2014 infrastructure, housing, heavy industry \u2014 China is now entering the phase where economic growth has to come mainly from squeezing efficiency out of the assets you\u2019ve already installed. That is always a tough transition and we should expect it to be rocky.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.The key thing is that all of economic history tells us that while state firms can be good at building stuff, when it comes to squeezing out efficiencies you need private companies. In China today, private industrial companies have a return on assets of 9 percent, compared to just 3 percent for state companies. Plus, state companies take on twice as much debt as private companies. So they are twice as indebted, but have a third of the performance. That\u2019s a huge gap, but the government keeps channeling too much money to this inefficient part of the economy.I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll put my chips on that, but the next party congress is when we\u2019ll know for sure whether Xi is a committed economic reformer, or someone who\u2019s mainly just interested in political control.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Paramount Plays Leading Role in Battle Over Viacom", "Date": "2016-05-24", "News": "Supported byParamount is now back at the center of a brutal fight: The fate of the studio has emerged as one of the central factors in the battle for control of Mr. Redstone\u2019s $40 billion entertainment empire.A Paramount deal \u2014 against Mr. Redstone\u2019s stated wishes \u2014 could set off a reaction leading to a major shake-up of Viacom\u2019s board and, subsequently, the removal of Philippe P. Dauman, its chief executive. Mr. Redstone has that power through his control of about 80 percent of the voting shares in Viacom and CBS held by National Amusements, the private theater chain company started by his father.Mr. Redstone has already considered the next steps he should take as Viacom\u2019s controlling shareholder and a company director, according to a letter dated May 16 and sent via email to Viacom directors by a lawyer for Mr. Redstone, Michael C. Tu, a partner in securities litigation at Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe. The letter was reviewed by The New York Times.In the letter, Mr. Tu wrote: \u201cWe request that before any further steps are taken concerning Paramount, that his legal and financial advisers receive a comprehensive briefing about the process to date.\u201dMr. Redstone also requested a detailed briefing on management\u2019s turnaround strategy for Viacom.The communication underscores what his representatives say are Mr. Redstone\u2019s concerns about the broader woes facing Viacom, which also owns MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon cable networks. The company has delivered repeated weak results, and its stock price has plummeted about 38 percent in the last year.\u201cMr. Redstone remains keenly interested in the business of Viacom, and as its controlling stockholder, and as a director, he is currently considering his next steps,\u2019\u2019 the letter stated.Removing Mr. Dauman would represent yet another startling turn of events in an already tangled corporate and family drama in which two of Mr. Redstone\u2019s longtime confidants, including Mr. Dauman, were ousted from their positions of power in his empire and his long-estranged daughter emerged victorious in her quest to control the future of her father\u2019s companies.It might be easier to trace the genealogy of an alley cat than of the typical Hollywood studio: Over the last century or so, most have accumulated a tangled list of owners and corporate forebears \u2014 and none more so than Paramount Pictures.Much is in dispute about the days after the May 16 letter was sent. Mike Lawrence, a spokesman for Mr. Redstone, said that Viacom\u2019s leadership did not respond to the letter. Viacom directors, in turn, stated that they had not received a communication from Mr. Redstone and that they had been denied access to him. They added that Mr. Tu, who was not known to be associated with Mr. Redstone, did not confirm to them whether or not he had met with Mr. Redstone. (In an email, Mr. Tu said that he had, in fact, met with his client.)On May 17 and 18, Viacom\u2019s board held 12 hours of strategy sessions, during which executives addressed issues including Paramount, according to Carl Folta, a Viacom spokesman. Mr. Redstone and Ms. Redstone listened to the meeting by phone but did not raise any issues, Mr. Folta said.On Friday, four days after the letter was sent, Mr. Redstone suddenly dismissed Mr. Dauman from the board of National Amusements and the trust that will control his companies after he dies or is declared incompetent. George Abrams, a 50-year representative of Mr. Redstone and longtime Viacom director, also was removed from the board and the trust. They promptly filed suit; Mr. Dauman called the dismissals an \u201cunlawful corporate takeover.\u201dOn the Paramount sale, Mr. Redstone is open to receiving information that would change his mind, but has yet to receive any. \u201cUnless Viacom\u2019s board presents a concrete plan that convinces him otherwise, Mr. Redstone continues to believe that it is in the best interest of Viacom\u2019\u2019 that Paramount not be sold, Mr. Lawrence said in a statement on Sunday.Taking Paramount off the market would disappoint some of Viacom\u2019s biggest investors. Mario Gabelli, whose investment firm, Gamco, is the second-largest voting shareholder in Viacom and CBS behind Mr. Redstone, has called a Paramount sale a logical step for Viacom. On Tuesday, Mr. Gabelli said he was giving Mr. Dauman the \u201cbenefit of the doubt\u201d to turn the company around.\u201cHe has six to nine months to demonstrate something,\u201d Mr. Gabelli said. \u201cWhy would you want to have Philippe go?\u201dAccording to one Hollywood financier, who requested anonymity, Viacom\u2019s representatives in the last month were pushing away would-be bidders who might view Paramount primarily as a financial investment. Instead, the company was talking with prospective \u201cstrategic\u201d partners \u2014 companies that might bring value through an alliance with their own media outlets or home markets. The strongest potential bidders at that point appeared to be based in Asia. But close observers of the process said they could see no sign that a deal was close.Several would-be partners for Paramount have taken themselves out of the running. Lions Gate Entertainment, for instance, made it clear that it would be interested in talking to Viacom only if buying the whole studio was an option; when Mr. Dauman insisted that only a slice was for sale, Lions Gate said no thanks.In the face of the Viacom chaos, Paramount executives have tried to put their heads down and focus on an urgently needed box-office turnaround. Friday evening, for instance, as news of Viacom\u2019s latest legal battles broke, Paramount executives were busy staging a significant promotional event on their lot for \u201cStar Trek Beyond,\u201d which arrives on July 22. In the event, attended by cast members like Chris Pine, Paramount announced that it would hold an ambitious outdoor Imax premiere for the film at the Comic-Con International convention in San Diego.Brooks Barnes and Michael Cieply contributed reporting from Los Angeles.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alibaba Sales Up 39% on Increased Consumer Spending in China", "Date": "2016-05-05", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 The Alibaba Group, which owns China\u2019s biggest online marketplaces, is squeezing more money out of slowing growth.The Chinese e-commerce giant, which lists shares on the New York Stock Exchange, reported on Thursday a surge in profit and revenue in the first three months of the year compared with the same period last year. The company made more money by charging retailers to use its platforms, which connect vendors small and large with China\u2019s growing ranks of connected consumers.But the figures, covering the fourth quarter of the company\u2019s fiscal year, also showed stalling growth in the volume of sales over its platforms. Gross merchandise volume, a closely watched measure of the transactions on the company\u2019s websites, grew 24 percent compared with the same period a year earlier, about the same pace in the prior quarter.\u201cChinese consumers, with their healthy balance sheets and ability to spend, will propel China\u2019s shift from an export- and investment-led economy to a consumption-driven economy,\u201d Mr. Tsai said.For American investors, Alibaba has become a proxy for the Chinese economy. Though a sizable portion of China\u2019s retail sales take place on Alibaba\u2019s marketplace websites \u2014 Chinese consumers spent almost $500 billion on Alibaba last year \u2014 the company\u2019s sales growth outperformed the rise in transactions on its site.The results also showed the growing toll that Alibaba\u2019s forays into hypercompetitive areas outside its core business are taking on its finances. It said that its Koubei business, which allows Chinese consumers to order food and other items and services on their smartphones, had generated $135 million in losses for its parent company in the quarter.In his post, Mr. Tsai pointed to the patience involved in creating the company\u2019s Taobao marketplace, now the major sales driver of the company. He said the company would take a similar long-term view and continue spending on new businesses it thinks can help it grow.Still, Alibaba has made progress making more money from its main business.Unlike Amazon.com in the United States, which keeps its own inventory and sells directly to customers, Alibaba serves as a middleman and makes money from getting vendors on its services to buy advertising and other services. Although the amount spent on Alibaba\u2019s marketplaces has grown about 20 percent this quarter and last, its revenue from ads and commissions on those sites has grown 30 percent or more. In the longer term, investors expect those numbers to align more closely, meaning slower sales growth.Still, Chi Tsang, an HSBC analyst in Hong Kong, pointed to its continued strong cash position and dominance in online shopping as advantages. \u201cPeople don\u2019t think about how much cash this company generates,\u201d he said.Alibaba said on Thursday that sales rose 39 percent in the fourth quarter, to $3.75 billion. Gross merchandise volume rose 24 percent, to $115 billion. Its profit rose more than 80 percent, to $832 million. Minus one-time items, the company posted a profit of 3.02 renminbi, or 46 cents, a share, lower than the 3.60 renminbi a share that analysts had expected.Advertisement"}

The rates are published daily for various interest rate derivatives contracts, which banks trade with other financial institutions and sell to clients looking to either hedge against a swing in interest rates or to speculate on the markets. In a separate benchmark fixing case, Citigroup agreed to resolve claims that it had tried to manipulate the Yen London Interbank Offered Rate and the Euroyen Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate. Citigroup\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role in trying to manipulate overseas benchmark rates tied to the pricing of interest rates and the use of derivatives products tied to those benchmarks has been no secret.In 2011, the Tokyo Financial Services Agency sanctioned Citigroup for its actions and temporarily suspended a derivatives product. In February, Citigroup agreed to pay $23 million to settle a lawsuit brought by several hedge funds and a public pension plan over claims that the bank had conspired to manipulate the yen Libor rate.Bitcoin experts and law enforcement officials have spent more than two years trying to establish how hundreds of thousands of Bitcoins disappeared from the Mt. Gox exchange and there have been few solid answers. The trustee said on Wednesday at a meeting with creditors that $414 million of the claims appeared to be legitimate and have been approved. They will get some portion of the $91 million. It is not yet clear how much because of outstanding lawsuits and investigations. Bitcoin investors have complained about how long it has taken to work through the claims. The legal and accounting costs have added up to about $55 million so far. Mr. Karpeles was arrested by the Japanese authorities last August on suspicion of illegally adding money to an account under his control, though not on charges directly related to the missing Bitcoins. Japanese government officials have still given few indications of what they think happened to the missing money. end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story Advertisement"}

The attacks raised alarm bells because the thieves gained access to Swift, which is considered the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most secure payment messaging system. It is used by 11,000 banks and companies to move money between countries, making it a tempting target. Swift itself had warned of a coordinated assault on banks, although it stressed that it was the banks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 connections to its networks, rather than the network itself, that were breached. Oracle contended that Google used copyrighted material in the software code for the Android mobile phone operating system. Oracle asked for $9 billion from Google.

The decision directly conflicts with an earlier decision by an appeals court in Louisiana and the split could prompt the Supreme Court to wade back into the fray. In a pair of decisions in 2011 and 2013, the Supreme Court blessed the use of arbitration in a case pushed by a group of credit card companies. The credit card companies turned to a 1925 federal law that formalized arbitration as a means for companies to hash out their disputes with one another.Courts across the country have largely upheld arbitration clauses, deferring to the Supreme Court, which ruled that the Federal Arbitration Act beat even federal laws.Mr. Denton assured Mr. Thiel that Gawker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s journalists would be reporting on his involvement in lawsuits against the company.  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story Advertisement"}

The case was supercomplicated but many programmers worried that a win for Oracle would cast a shadow over the legality of using open-source code, which is at the center of a lot of the technology that modern computing relies on. A jury sided with Google.Do you understand any of this? I\u2019m guessing no. The upshot for you is, thanks to this win, your phone won\u2019t get superexpensive and will probably still keep getting better. And that\u2019s probably pretty much all you care about.Let\u2019s talk about the big news of the week, or month, in tech and media land: #Thielgate.The story is sort of unbelievable, in and of itself, but also hits a sweet spot within all the crazy things that editors love: tech, billionaires, tech billionaires and, of course, media.The basic argument of those on the tech side was that Gawker was singularly bad. They said that Gawker abused its journalistic platform, it routinely invaded people\u2019s private lives, including outing their sexual orientation, and in other ways made life very difficult for wealthy coastal techies.I\u2019ve certainly not been a fan of everything Gawker has done. But I\u2019m struck by the inability of techies to consider both the proportionality of this punishment and the chilling effects this case could induce on the media generally. First, to me, it doesn\u2019t make sense that a small excerpt from a sex tape should result in a company-ending decision. And I don\u2019t see how techies could support that.All of these examples are potentially far more damaging to the world than a leaked sex tape. But none of these companies were fined anywhere near hundreds of millions of dollars for their recklessness. Do tech venture capitalists really want to support a system in which moving fast and breaking things results in company-ending lawsuits?I\u2019m not sure I quite believe that. But it\u2019s fair to say that Gawker had its day in court \u2014 with a lot of caveats over jurisdiction and judge and jury, Gawker supporters would say \u2014 and that the company lost the case. This should be a deterrent to \u201cbad\u201d journalism.That\u2019s a rosy view, but again, I don\u2019t quite buy it wholesale. Do I agree with every story Gawker chooses to publish? No. Do I think they do good journalism? Absolutely. Do I think people with money will use a tactic such as Thiel\u2019s for only its \u201cproper\u201d and intended purpose of eliminating the wrong in the world? No way, Jos\u00e9.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s $1 Billion Investment May Ease Ties With China", "Date": "2016-05-13", "News": "Supported byBut Apple\u2019s surprising interest in the company, called Didi Chuxing, and its out-of-character willingness to publicize the news Thursday evening could go a long way toward showing the Chinese government it is interested in supporting local business.More than any other major American technology company, Apple has had huge success in China. In the last fiscal year, Chinese consumers spent $59 billion on Apple products.With that success has come huge risk. In recent years, Beijing has grown more aggressive in pushing an agenda aimed at expanding local tech companies, forcing multinationals to play by its rules if they want access to China\u2019s markets.\u201cApple must be increasingly sensitive to the need to improve its government relations and to stake out a more entrenched position in the China market,\u201d said Mark Natkin, managing director of the China technology research firm Marbridge Consulting. \u201cSo making a sizable investment in a leading Chinese I.T. company will buy it a lot of good will.\u201dHe added that Apple would probably have to follow up the investment with other partnerships and spending in China if it wanted to stay in Beijing\u2019s good graces.In Apple\u2019s case, the new investment also helps it show Beijing how its operating system and iPhones are closely linked with the rise of app development within China; Didi\u2019s app, for example, is the most downloaded ride-hailing software in China.\u201cDidi exemplifies the innovation taking place in the iOS developer community in China,\u201d Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said in a news release.Many investors hoped that strong growth in China would offset some of the iPhone\u2019s deceleration. Revenue growth in the greater China region, which includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, hovered around 70 percent or more all last year. But last month the company said that quarterly sales in greater China had fallen 26 percent compared with the previous year.For Didi, the deal is a way to beef up its systems. The Chinese company serves close to 300 million users across more than 400 Chinese cities \u2014 more users than Uber \u2014 but lags technologically, analysts say.For more than a year, Apple and Didi \u2014 which share several partners, including Japan\u2019s SoftBank and Coatue \u2014 had been in contact. Apple was one of a handful of technology companies that, over the last year, Didi had talked with to better familiarize itself with the West, according to a person briefed on the deal.In April, Mr. Cook sat down for the first time with the leaders of Didi to discuss working together.In the midst of Didi\u2019s last major round of raising funds, the relationship quickly deepened, the person said. The two companies managed to close the deal with \u201clightning speed,\u201d Didi\u2019s president, Jean Liu, said in a conference call discussing the deal late Thursday.The two will work together on technology, marketing and products, Ms. Liu added.Mr. Cook has repeatedly said that Apple is looking for investment opportunities for its huge cash hoard. Apple has invested small sums in app developers before, and the company views China\u2019s app developer community as a prime source of future growth.\u201cWhat this means to me is that Apple is firmly committed to the Chinese market,\u201d said Brian Blau, an analyst with the Gartner research firm. \u201cThey are going to look at lots of opportunities.\u201dApple\u2019s move also draws it further into a Chinese market crisscrossed with competitive alliances. With the investment, Apple is now aligned with China\u2019s two largest Internet companies, Tencent and Alibaba, as a major shareholder in Didi. And Didi gained Apple as a big-name ally in its battle with Uber in China.Google\u2019s chief legal officer and head of corporate development, David Drummond, is on the board of Uber. And in 2013 Google\u2019s venture capital arm, GV, invested $258 million in Uber.But the partnership between Uber and Google has grown more distant over the past few years as both sides have independently pursued self-driving car projects. Uber has also made moves to wean itself from Google\u2019s map technology, including an acquisition of the mapping start-up deCarta.Investing in ride-hailing services gives Apple a doorway into the world\u2019s largest auto market and smartphone market by cars and phones sold, and an opportunity to better integrate its devices with cars in China. China\u2019s Internet companies are already hard at work developing driverless car technology and entertainment systems for cars, many of which are based on Google\u2019s Android software.\u201cMaybe they could be a technology supplier to Didi,\u201d Mr. Blau said. \u201cMaybe they could learn from Didi.\u201dThe auto market might be one new way that Apple can keep itself relevant to Chinese leaders who often view foreign tech firms in terms of how much utility they have in China as teachers of local companies, Mr. Natkin of Marbridge Consulting said.\u201cAs that utility wanes, the room to maneuver dwindles and the welcome mat starts to get drawn under the door,\u201d he said.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the day Apple\u2019s investment in Didi was announced. The investment was announced Thursday in the United States, not Thursday morning in China.Paul Mozur reported from Hong Kong and Mike Isaac from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "Alibaba Faces U.S. Accounting Inquiry", "Date": "2016-05-25", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 The Alibaba Group, the e-commerce giant, said Wednesday that it was under investigation by United States securities regulators over its accounting practices, a potential setback for a company long seen as a symbol of China\u2019s growing technological might.The investigation \u2014 disclosed in a stock filing \u2014 appears to focus on how Alibaba deals with a web of companies in which it owns stakes or has some say in the operations. The company said the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating how Alibaba accounts for affiliated companies, including a logistics venture, and how it treats related-party transactions.Alibaba said that it was voluntarily cooperating with the commission, and that the investigation was not an indication it had violated any law.But as Mr. Ma\u2019s profile has risen, Alibaba has grappled with challenges, including allegations from the owners of famous brands that it takes a lax stance on counterfeit goods on its sales platforms \u2014 a charge it denies.Its shares have also seesawed over investor concerns about China\u2019s slowing economic growth and Alibaba\u2019s enormous shopping spree to try to cater to the growing legions of Chinese consumers who order everything from taxis to in-home massages on their smartphones. The company has spent billions of dollars on services as varied as logistics, food delivery and film production.It is unclear whether the investigation will have an impact on Alibaba. Asked for comment, an Alibaba spokeswoman reiterated the company\u2019s statement to the commission.Alibaba\u2019s share price has stabilized in recent months.In the most recent quarter, the company had strong revenue growth despite the broader worries about China\u2019s slowdown.Alibaba is at the center of a complicated web of companies in China that broadly touch the lives of Chinese consumers.Mr. Ma also controls the parent company of an electronic payment service called Alipay. Alipay is a giant in its own right, with a financial smartphone app widely found on Chinese handsets and with offerings including money-market-like investments and easy money transfers. Chinese consumers often use Alipay to buy merchandise from Alibaba\u2019s platforms.Alipay\u2019s parent company says that, to date, it has lent more than $100 billion, mostly to small businesses. Those businesses could spend that money on marketing on Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce sites, which would in turn become Alibaba revenue.According to data from Dealogic, Alibaba has also spent $25.5 billion since its listing in September 2014 to broaden its services to compete with Tencent and Baidu, fellow Chinese Internet giants that are scrambling to make money from a shift to mobile devices. Its key investments and acquisitions include its purchase of Youku Tudou, once a YouTube-like service that now streams movies and TV shows, and an investment in Koubei, a food-ordering app in which Alipay\u2019s parent company is also an investor.One focus of the S.E.C. investigation appears to be Alibaba\u2019s investment in logistics, which itself signaled a shift in its business approach. In its filing, Alibaba said it had provided information to the commission about its logistics arm, Cainiao.Alibaba has long eschewed building a logistics network to keep down costs. That approach has increased profit margins but made it more vulnerable to competitors with better control over delivery channels, which are underdeveloped in China.Mr. Ma was named as chairman when Cainiao was created, Alibaba holds a 47 percent stake in the company, and a number of companies Alibaba has invested in have since worked with Cainiao. Still, Alibaba does not consolidate Cainiao\u2019s results with its own.That relationship has been questioned by some short-sellers and researchers. In a 40-page report released to its clients in October, Pacific Square Research, a market analysis firm, argued that Alibaba did not disclose enough information about its large number of investments. It said that at times Alibaba used that web of investments to control companies like Cainiao without taking their losses onto its balance sheet.The Alibaba spokeswoman said that the company had provided disclosures about Cainiao\u2019s financials in its most recent annual report.

For example, it said that Alibaba had failed to disclose the amount it had spent in advertising on Weibo, the Chinese social-media service, even though at that time Alibaba had made a $1 billion investment in Weibo. By comparison, Weibo, also a listed company, disclosed the amount it had received from Alibaba.In its most recent filing, Alibaba disclosed that it had spent about $230 million on Weibo marketing in the past three years.\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen anything quite as difficult to untangle as this in our respective careers,\u201d Herb Greenberg, a managing partner of Pacific Square, wrote in an email. \u201cIn our view, Alibaba is like a big ball of wet knotted yarn.\u201dAsked about Pacific Square\u2019s assertions, the Alibaba spokeswoman said the company did not comment on market speculation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Personal Data of Prominent Chinese Posted on Twitter", "Date": "2016-05-12", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 For a few brief hours this week, China had its own answer to WikiLeaks: a mysterious Twitter account that posted the personal information of dozens of the country\u2019s most prominent people, including billionaires and even the architect of the country\u2019s Internet controls.The account @shenfenzheng \u2014 which means \u201cpersonal identification\u201d in Chinese \u2014 was suspended by Twitter on Thursday afternoon, making its posts no longer available. Before it was suspended, the account was used to post photographs and screenshots containing personal information including addresses, national identification numbers, educational attainment and marital status of well-known Chinese.Among them were the two richest people in mainland China, Jack Ma, the chairman of the Internet giant Alibaba Group, and Wang Jianlin, the chairman of Dalian Wanda Group, a real estate company.\u201cSurprised by these tidbits of information?\u201d @shenfenzheng posted before the account was suspended. \u201cI hope this can get fellow countrymen thinking. Personal privacy is worth nothing in China.\u201dThe goal of @shenfenzheng appears to be to draw attention to the illegal selling of personal information in China, a widespread practice. Private investigators can buy troves of personal data to obtain information on companies or individuals. Others abuse the online national police files for more prosaic reasons, like planning class reunions.In the United States, nine-digit Social Security numbers say little about a person, other than perhaps the region where they lived when they applied for a card.Reporters who investigate the business interests of China\u2019s politically powerful families \u2014 and the billionaires who court them \u2014 use identification numbers to \u201cbulletproof\u201d their articles, giving them a vital level of certainty difficult to obtain in a country where more than 90 million people share the same last name, Wang.The New York Times was able to verify the accuracy of the identification numbers of several of the people exposed by the @shenfenzheng account, including Mr. Wang; his wife, Lin Ning; his son, Wang Sicong; and Mr. Ma of Alibaba.Twitter did not respond to a request for comment.Kiki Zhao contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

Snapchat, based in Los Angeles, said in the filing that it began raising the latest round on Feb. 17, 2015.Snapchat has proved wildly popular, especially for those ages 13 to 34, a group that is coveted by advertisers and brands that want to become a part of the next generation\u2019s daily habits.Snapchat was founded in 2011 to let people send messages that would disappear in a matter of seconds. Last year, the company pushed deeper into media when it began Discover, a product that lets users read stories and watch video from media companies like Vice, ESPN, BuzzFeed and Comedy Central. Discover has given Snapchat a way to make money off from its more than 100 million daily active users.Snapchat splits advertising revenue with the media companies that post material to the service.

{"Headline": "5 More Bankers Leave Credit Suisse as Exodus Accelerates", "Date": "2016-05-18", "News": "Supported byThe revolving door at Credit Suisse has been turning faster, as a number of senior bankers have left in the last few days.On Tuesday, five technology bankers, most with decades at Credit Suisse, defected to Jefferies, according to six people briefed on the moves, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Another consumer banker quit last week to work at Royal Bank of Canada, three of these people said.Departures have accumulated over the last several weeks. A few more bankers who cover health care resigned this month to join Centerview Partners, while another banker who handles private equity relationships went to Goldman Sachs.He recently unveiled a plan to realign the investment bank, and its traders and deal makers, to serve the needs of private banking and wealth management. In other words, bankers were concerned there would be less focus on efforts like trading, mergers and acquisitions, and initial public offerings, and more emphasis on low-risk activities that cater to wealthy clients.European banks, in general, have had more difficulty retaining vital employees lately. Other firms, such as Deutsche Bank, also have lost several prominent bankers recently. They are more restricted in how much they can divide bonuses in cash versus stock, making it easier for the American competition to poach bankers. Shares at Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank have been cut in half over the last year, shrinking the potential stock value of their compensation.Jefferies, based in New York, is a subsidiary of Leucadia National Corporation. It and smaller advisory firms have been able to capitalize on the turmoil because they are not required by regulators to defer compensation and have the firepower to offer big pay packages and build up investment banking groups. Still, Jefferies lost its four technology bankers to UBS last year.The recent moves were significant because many of the people who left had been at Credit Suisse many years.William Brady, who was at Credit Suisse since he was brought over by Frank Quattrone in the late \u201990s, was among those who left for Jefferies. Cully Davis, who was a leader of the firm\u2019s equity capital markets group in the Americas and helped manage several prominent initial public offerings including Alibaba and Google, also departed. Cameron Lester, who had just returned to Credit Suisse as head of Internet investment banking a year ago after a stint in venture capital, also resigned.Those three will take two other managing directors with them to Jefferies: Steve West, who focused on software, and John Metz, who led enterprise technology.Credit Suisse has already designated bankers to step up to the roles that were vacated and will hire others in the technology group, one of the people said. David Wah, the global co-head of Credit Suisse\u2019s technology, media and telecom group, remains at the bank, as does the head of technology, media, telecom and health care equity capital markets, John Kolz.Additionally, Credit Suisse has continued to hire investment bankers from other firms. Ray Raimondi plans to join in August from Barclays as head of industrials mergers and acquisitions. Haidee Lee left BMO Capital Markets to lead Credit Suisse\u2019s sell-side mergers and acquisitions group, where she will help smaller companies find buyers.Representatives from Credit Suisse and Jefferies declined to comment on the moves.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Worrisome Pileup of $100 Million Homes", "Date": "2016-05-28", "News": "Supported byInside WealthOne of the latest symbols of the overinflated luxury housing market is a pink mansion perched above the Mediterranean on the French Riviera.The 13,000-square-foot property, built and owned by the fashion magnate Pierre Cardin, is composed of giant terra cotta orbs arranged in a sprawling hive. The home\u2019s name befits its price. \u201cLe Palais Bulles,\u201d or \u201cthe Bubble Palace,\u201d is being offered for sale at approximately $450 million.If you add in high-priced \u201cwhisper listings\u201d that are offered privately, brokers say the actual number of nine-figure listings worldwide could easily top 40 or 50.\u201cIt\u2019s a bumper crop,\u201d said Dan Conn, chief executive of Christie\u2019s International Real Estate. \u201cIt\u2019s just a new world in terms of what people are building and offering for sale.\u201dThe rise in nine-figure real estate listings comes just as sales of luxury real estate have cooled. Many say the sudden surge in hyperprice homes \u2014 often built and sold by speculative investors \u2014 is the ultimate bubble signal.Last year, only two homes in the world sold for over $100 million, according to Christie\u2019s. One was a 9,455-square-foot house in Hong Kong purchased for $193 million by Jack Ma, the chief of Alibaba. The other was a townhouse in London that sold for $132 million. This year, a ranch in Texas went on the market for $700 million and a home in Dallas listed for $100 million. Both sold, but the actual sale prices have not been disclosed.The last time a sudden pop in $100 million-plus listings occurred was in 2007 and 2008, just before the housing crash. In 2008, at least four homes in the world listed for nine figures. Only one ended up selling for close to that. A mansion in Palm Beach owned by Donald Trump and listed for $100 million sold for $95 million. (Mr. Trump says it sold for $100 million.) A 103-room mansion in Surrey, England, called Updown Court, was listed for $138 million, but sold in 2011 for about $50 million. A log mansion planned for the Yellowstone Club in Montana, with a promised price of $155 million, was never built, and the land sold for $10 million.Of course, anyone can slap a $100 million price tag on a home to get attention. Yet actual sales of nine-figure homes are rare, even in good times. Between 2011 and 2016, only 15 homes in the world have sold for $100 million or more, according to Christies, and five of those were in 2014.\u201cThe era of aspirational pricing is over, and I\u2019m not sure it ever really worked,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cThese prices get headlines, but the properties just don\u2019t sell.\u201dBrokers promoting the listings say their properties are one-of-a-kind masterpieces \u2014 like Picassos or Modiglianis \u2014 that rarely come on the market. They add that the more than 1,800 billionaires in the world see property as a safer store of wealth than stocks or art. Mr. Conn estimates that of the 27 nine-figure listings, a third will sell for under $100 million, a third will sell for around $100 million and a third for far more.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a sign of a bubble,\u201d Mr. Conn said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign of growing wealth in the world and the quality of some of the new construction.\u201dYet the market for megamansions and penthouses has cooled significantly in the last year. Prices for homes in the top 5 percent of the real estate market fell 1.1 percent in the first quarter of 2016, according to Redfin. Prices for the rest of the housing market increased 4.7 percent.Brokers say the very top of the market \u2014 consisting of eight- and nine-figure homes \u2014 is faring the worst as slowing economies overseas and volatile stock markets have spooked buyers. The supply of homes for the rich exploded as builders aimed at the high end after the financial crisis.Of the 10 most expensive listings in the world, seven are in the United States and four of these are in Los Angeles. The most expensive listing in the world is the $500 million compound being built in the Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles by Nile Niami, a film producer and speculative builder. The property will have a 74,000-square-foot main house, a 30-car garage and a \u201cMonaco-style casino.\u201dIn nearby Holmby Hills, a more modest 38,000-square-foot mansion, built by the investor and developer Gala Asher, came on the market in April for $150 million. The ultramodern house, on the prestigious Carolwood Drive, has a 5,300-square-foot master suite and a club level with bar, dance floor, wine room, lap pool, theater complex, beauty parlor and massage rooms. The property also includes several guesthouses and staff housing. The broker, Ginger Glass, said the price of the property was justified.\u201cBuyers today want new construction,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd there isn\u2019t anything that\u2019s new like this in such a great location.\u201dStill more nine-figure homes are on the way. Real estate agents and developers say a home under construction in Bel Air is likely to have more than 50,000 square feet of living space, with finishes rivaling a superyacht\u2019s. The price will be yacht-like, too, at around $300 million.

{"Headline": "For Chinese Police Officers, Light Duty on Tourist Patrol in Italy", "Date": "2016-05-12", "News": "Supported byRome JournalROME \u2014 On a perfect May afternoon, with the Roman sunlight glinting off the ancient arches of the Colosseum, Officer Pang Bo adjusted his sunglasses and began his patrol. More or less. He walked around. He looked at tourists, and a few tourists looked at him. He posed for a few photographs.In his dark-blue uniform and cap, Officer Pang is a top supervisor in one of China\u2019s biggest police departments, in the southern metropolis of Guangzhou. But for two weeks, he and three other Chinese police officers are in Italy with strict orders: to protect Chinese tourists.That is, even if it isn\u2019t completely clear how four Chinese cops divided between Rome and Milan can make a difference. Or what the tourists need to be protected from.\u201cThe first day when we patrolled, the Chinese tourists saw us, and they were amazed,\u201d said Officer Pang, 44.Tourist season is in full bloom in Italy, and few countries are more important suppliers of tourists than China. Nearly three million Chinese visit Italy every year, a figure that is steadily rising, as Italy has become one of the top European destinations for Chinese tourists, along with France.In 2014, Chinese tourists spent 468 million euros (or about $569 million) in Italy, according to the Bank of Italy, and Italian leaders are trying to nurture closer economic ties to China. That was the year the two countries signed a bilateral police cooperation agreement, the first of its kind between China and a European nation.But for some Chinese tourists, Italy and other European countries can mean anxiety and confusion. The recent terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels have raised security concerns for tourists coming to Europe, including Chinese visitors. And reports of petty crime are fairly common in Rome (and in cities like Barcelona and Paris), especially of pickpockets preying on Chinese tourists known for carrying cash.Such thefts are amplified on Chinese social media, as some travelers spin dark tales of stolen wallets, lost passports and Italian swindlers. These are problems that can arise for travelers from any country, except Chinese also face a cultural and linguistic divide in knowing how to seek help.\u201cIt\u2019s our duty to make Chinese fall in love with Rome and Italy,\u201d said Alessandro Zucconi, the president of the Young Hoteliers Federation in Rome, who agreed that \u201cmisunderstandings\u201d sometimes occur between the two cultures. \u201cThey are not like the Germans, who mostly come knowing our culture and literature better than we do.\u201dEnter Officer Pang and his cohort.Beginning last week, they split into two-man teams in Rome and Milan. So far, it is not exactly tough police work.Officer Pang and his partner, Li Xiang, have bumped into several Chinese tour groups but none have reported any problems. The Chinese officers do not have arrest powers in Italy, but they are paired with Italian officers who could arrest someone, except no arrests have been needed.\u201cSo far, no,\u201d said Officer Pang, who once worked as a peacekeeper in Bosnia and who speaks English, French, Mandarin and Cantonese. \u201cWe just help the people. Most of them say, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m very glad to see you. I\u2019m glad you are here.\u2019 \u201dIn China, the police are not always beloved in an authoritarian country where the ruling Communist Party exists above the law and can use the domestic legal system as a tool for maintaining political and social control.\u201cWe are telling Italian citizens that their state is joining hands with a great country,\u201d Italy\u2019s interior minister, Angelino Alfano, told Xinhua, adding with a flourish that \u201cChina has a fundamental role in the world\u2019s destiny.\u201dWhich is true. Italy once played a fundamental role in the world\u2019s destiny but is now a medium-size nation with a rich cultural heritage trying to stimulate economic growth after a two-decade slump.Tourism is a critical sector. In a report this year, Italy\u2019s Foreign Ministry cited the need to improve services for Chinese visitors, such as to provide more signs in Mandarin and also to be sensitive to the \u201cperception of petty crime risks.\u201dItalian police officers are supposed to visit China next year \u2014 it is unclear if Italians need special protection in China \u2014 and officials have spoken of broader cooperation in the future.Italian leaders are certainly eager to deepen economic ties. Prime Minister Matteo Renzi recently announced an agreement with Jack Ma, the executive chairman of the e-commerce giant Alibaba, to promote Italian wines in the Chinese market.Italian officials note that police teams from Spain, Poland and other countries, including the United States, have visited Rome. The New York Police Department sent over officers in December.Out on the streets of Rome, Officer Pang and Officer Li strode down one of the capital\u2019s busiest shopping streets, Via del Corso, parting a sea of tourists. When they came upon two young women from China, they stopped, chatted and posed for selfies.One of the women, who would identify herself only by her surname, Fang, was an exchange student at a local university. Though she had not experienced any problems in Rome, she seemed pleased to see Chinese officers on the streets.\u201cThey make me feel very safe in another country,\u201d said Ms. Fang, 20.Officer Pang acknowledged that four officers were not likely to make a big impact. But he said more officers could possibly come in the future. And clearly the publicity was raising awareness. Officer Pang said he had granted interviews to news media outlets from around the world.He praised Rome and reminisced about his first visit 14 years ago, when he came as a tourist. Had he encountered any problems? Thick chested and beefy, Officer Pang looked out from behind his reflector shades, and then laughed.\u201cNo, no problems,\u201d he said.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the dollar equivalency for 468 million euros at the end of 2014. It equaled about $569 million, not $569 billion.Zhang Tiantian contributed reporting from Beijing, and Gaia Pianigiani from Rome.Advertisement"}
