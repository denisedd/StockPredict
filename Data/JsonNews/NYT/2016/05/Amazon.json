And admittedly, it brings to mind certain stinging government losses on narrow market definitions, like that Whole Foods Market and Wild Oats competed only with \u201cpremium, natural, and organic supermarkets,\u201d or that Oracle\u2019s purchase of PeopleSoft would restrain competition in \u201chigh function financial and human resource management enterprise resource planning software.\u201dNeither is it surprising that Judge Sullivan rejected defense claims concerning new entry, which was that the market would be kept healthy by online competition or by competitors like Target and Walmart. After all, people said the same thing about the 1997 merger, and the government proved them wrong in an overwhelmingly impressive econometric demonstration that the two companies were one another\u2019s only real rivals.And as Judge Sullivan emphasized in the ruling released on Tuesday, the claim that Amazon\u2019s nascent business supplies division would discipline the new megaretailer \u2014 a point that defendants asserted \u2014 was \u201cpure speculation.\u201dWhatever may be the case, Judge Sullivan quietly, decorously confirmed that resting without evidence was probably rash.

How to Ship Your Luggage", "Date": "2016-05-31", "News": "Supported byThe GetawayFamily vacations, especially multigenerational trips, can involve a lot of baggage, if only literally.Tempted by a package service like UPS? It\u2019s not necessarily convenient. Will UPS pick up at your off-the-beaten path rental? And, honestly, do you want to be boxing up suitcases on vacation?Below, a guide to the latest in luggage transport.The first time you send the company your packed suitcase, it photographs your items and creates a virtual online closet so you can see everything or read a description. Whenever you\u2019re about to travel, use the app to select which items you\u2019d like and when you would like the bag to arrive. Then DUFL packs and sends the bag to your hotel. When it\u2019s time to leave, you schedule a pickup online, and DUFL takes the bag back to a warehouse, dry-cleans dirty clothes, and stores everything until the next time. If you ever want to add clothes by, say, buying something online on Amazon or Saks, you can have the items sent directly to DUFL where they will be photographed and added to your virtual closet. You can also pay to have your bag sent home to change the clothes inside, or just swap them out when you are on the road. Families are most likely to benefit from the DUFL Sports service, which allows members to store and ship items like surf boards, ski equipment, golf clubs and bikes \u2014 particularly handy for those with small homes.DUFL International is available in Europe and Canada as well as business hubs in places including Singapore, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Sydney and Melbourne in Australia. Prices depend on locations.DUFL Sports is $9.95 a month for a locker, which is large enough to hold several items, such as golf clubs and ski equipment. Standard three-day domestic shipping for golf clubs starts at about $75 round trip, including cleaning.This company, which has acquired a number of experienced competitors, has been shipping clothes and sports gear like skis for more than 10 years. It\u2019s also one of the more far-reaching players, shipping among hundreds of countries and territories worldwide, as well as to and from cruise ships and golf courses.Pack your clothes in bags the same way you would for air travel and then have Luggage Forward pick them up from you. And the company will complete and submit all customs documentation. Within the United States, you can generally choose from overnight to seven business days from pickup to delivery.But that doesn\u2019t save you from having to carry your luggage to the airport, to your lodgings and back again. If you plan to check more than two bags, or very heavy or oversize bags, use a shipping service. It\u2019s likely to cost the same or less. Checking a third bag on a domestic flight on American, for example, is $150 one way. Four or more checked bags cost $200 each, one way.If you do ship, be aware of any potential pitfalls like a last-minute trip change, which could mean that your luggage arrives in one place while you\u2019re in another.Then again, that\u2019s been known to happen on airlines too.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Impeachment of Dilma Rousseff Is Debated by Brazil\u2019s Senate After Months of Chaos", "Date": "2016-05-11", "News": "Supported byBRAS\u00cdLIA \u2014 After months of tirades, secret maneuvering and legal appeals, Brazil\u2019s Senate began debating on Wednesday whether to impeach President Dilma Rousseff, suspend her from office and put her on trial.The debate, followed by a vote as late as Thursday morning, is a watershed in the power struggle consuming Brazil, a country that experienced a rare stretch of stability over the last two decades as it strengthened its economy and achieved greater prominence on the world stage.If she is suspended and put on trial, she would become the second of Brazil\u2019s four elected presidents to be removed from office since democracy was re-established in the mid-1980s after a long dictatorship.Dilma Rousseff, Brazil\u2019s president, is facing removal from office. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the proceedings.\u201cPlainly said, this is the worst crisis in our history, with its combination of economic calamity, discredited politics and the violation of the lowest ethical standards,\u201d Boris Fausto, a Brazilian historian, told reporters this month while summing up the country\u2019s grim mood.\u201cTemer is what we\u2019ve got,\u201d Mr. Fausto said. \u201cI hope he\u2019ll be up to the difficult and often highly unpopular tasks ahead of him.\u201dFixing the economy, which may require adopting unpopular austerity measures, is just one of the challenges facing Mr. Temer, 75, a lawyer and career politician who kept a low profile as vice president.But the impasse between Ms. Rousseff and her rivals has kept the government in Bras\u00edlia distracted from these problems, exposing the political establishment to withering scrutiny around the country.Ms. Rousseff, an operative in a guerrilla group in her youth, is accused of using money from public banks to cover deficits, masking budget shortfalls in Brazil\u2019s giant federal bureaucracy. She contends that her predecessors enacted similar policies and that the effort to oust her amounts to a coup.Still, Ms. Rousseff is rare among top politicians in Brazil in that she has not faced accusations of illegally enriching herself. An array of figures in her Workers\u2019 Party are either in jail or under investigation on charges of graft, dealing a blow to the legitimacy of a party that had vowed to end such practices.But fears are growing at the prospect of a government assembled by Mr. Temer. If Ms. Rousseff and the Workers\u2019 Party shift into the opposition, they will most likely claim her ouster was illegal, and Mr. Temer\u2019s top allies remain mired in corruption scandals as well.Several of his top advisers are under investigation, including Romero Juc\u00e1, a senator from Roraima State in the Amazon, and Geddel Vieira Lima, a former executive at one of Brazil\u2019s largest public banks. Mr. Temer has insisted that those inquiries would not prevent him from naming the advisers to his cabinet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brazil Workers\u2019 Party, Leaders \u2018Intoxicated by Power,\u2019 Falls From Grace", "Date": "2016-05-12", "News": "Supported byBRAS\u00cdLIA \u2014 From its earliest days as a scrappy band of Marxists defying Brazil\u2019s military rulers, the Workers\u2019 Party grew to become one of world\u2019s most enduring leftist movements \u2014 an electoral powerhouse that dominated the nation\u2019s politics for more than a decade.\u201cThe Workers\u2019 Party was a party of hope, but its leaders got intoxicated by power, and now that hope has been dashed,\u201d said H\u00e9lio Bicudo, 93, an early member of the party and a former legislator who defected in 2005.Mr. da Silva has yet to be charged with a crime, but federal prosecutors are investigating his role in a scheme that involved funneling money from the national oil company into the Workers\u2019 Party campaign coffers.An array of top allies of Mr. da Silva, including senior members of the party, have been imprisoned or are under investigation for their involvement in the scheme, which distributed billions of dollars in bribes to figures across the political spectrum.Even in a nation inured to systemic corruption, the fall of a party once devoted to transparency and clean government has deepened mistrust of politics.It also threatens to upend some of the accomplishments of the party, a political juggernaut that even critics concede helped ease the crushing poverty and economic disparity that has long plagued this nation of 200 million.\u201cThat the Workers\u2019 Party sullied itself by getting involved in all this corruption, this is a tragedy, maybe the major tragedy of what is happening today,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Murilo de Carvalho, a historian.In recent weeks, more than 130 mayors who won office on the Workers\u2019 Party ticket have switched parties, and nearly 30 deputies in the lower house of Congress, roughly half of its caucus, have suggested they might do the same, according to tallies in the Brazilian news media.Other parties took part in the graft scheme. But emboldened by Ms. Rousseff\u2019s political demise, her opponents in the legislature are working to reverse some of her party\u2019s hallmarks, including stringent environmental rules, protections for indigenous Brazilians in the Amazon and laws criminalizing abusive work conditions on cattle ranches.Jan Rocha, an author of the book \u201cBrazil Under the Workers\u2019 Party,\u201d said such efforts, if successful, could stoke class divisions and provoke a violent backlash from disenfranchised Brazilians who stand to lose the most from a rollback of the party\u2019s policies.\u201cThe Workers\u2019 Party represented an attempt to change the political landscape in Brazil and give a voice to all the millions of Brazilians who never had a voice,\u201d she said. \u201cThey lifted millions of people out of poverty, but Brazil still has an awfully long way to go before becoming an equitable society.\u201dMarked by greed, betrayal and the quest for ever-greater power, the party\u2019s fall from grace has all the elements of a Shakespearean tragedy.Its main protagonist is Mr. da Silva, 70, who worked as a shoeshine boy before landing a job at a screw factory. From there, he rose to the presidency and oversaw an economic boom.Starting in the 1970s, he helped transform a ragtag collection of labor activists, liberal Roman Catholic clergy members and idealistic students into a formidable political movement that stood up to the country\u2019s military leaders.Formed in 1980, the Workers\u2019 Party eschewed strict Marxist dogma and embraced a democratic process for electing its leaders.Mr. da Silva ran for office with the slogan \u201cLand, labor and freedom.\u201dBy the late 1980s, the party\u2019s candidates were winning elections. In 1986, Mr. da Silva was elected to Congress and, two years later, a Workers\u2019 Party candidate won the mayoralty of S\u00e3o Paulo, the country\u2019s largest city. Mr. da Silva then set his sights on the presidency.Universally referred to by the nickname Lula, he was an unlikely political figure whose unpolished syntax and leftist rhetoric rattled the Brazilian elite. But in 1998, after three unsuccessful bids for president, Mr. da Silva changed his strategy. He traded his T-shirts for tailored suits and jettisoned talk of revolutionary change, saying he would honor the $250 billion in foreign debt that was then hobbling the Brazilian economy.His new slogan: \u201cLula, Peace and Love.\u201dFor former party stalwarts like Idelber Avelar, the breaking point came when Mr. da Silva began to dole out patronage posts and form alliances with opposition party bosses who did not share the Workers\u2019 Party\u2019s ideals.\u201cIt represented everything that the party had been fighting against,\u201d said Mr. Avelar, an academic who now lives in the United States. \u201cThere were a number of options, but the early choice was made for the politics of making deals behind closed doors.\u201dApparently unchastened by their brush with scandal, Workers\u2019 Party officials were secretly engaged in a huge kickback scheme with executives at Petrobras, the state-owned energy giant. The arrangement involved skimming off billions of dollars from an oil boom and diverting the money to the Workers\u2019 Party and its coalition partners in Congress.The scandal has shaken the country\u2019s political establishment, with dozens of business executives and party leaders imprisoned or under investigation.Some of Mr. da Silva\u2019s closest aides are among the fallen, but he has insisted he was unaware of the arrangement.\u201cOur greatest achievements were to raise 36 million people out of poverty and elevate 40 million others into the middle class,\u201d Mr. da Silva said in an email this week. \u201cWe remain a party that cares about the poor and about social justice.\u201dUnless he is charged with a crime, many political analysts still expect Mr. da Silva to run for president in two years.\u201cIn Brazilian politics, you can never throw someone under the bus and think they won\u2019t recover,\u201d said Alfred P. Montero, the author of the book \u201cBrazil: Reversal of Fortune\u201d and a professor at Carleton College. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching these guys since the \u201980s, and they always seem to come back.\u201dDilma Rousseff, Brazil\u2019s president, is facing removal from office. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the proceedings.Experts say that despite its current tribulations, the Workers\u2019 Party, with its 500,000 active members, will remain a potent force in Brazilian politics for years to come. The impeachment crisis, some say, may spur a period of introspection that could help reinvigorate the party.\u201cThe Workers\u2019 Party is heading back to the opposition, which perhaps is just what the doctor ordered,\u201d Mr. Montero said.For now, the Workers\u2019 Party faithful are engaged in soul-searching. Did the party abandon its ideals in the heady rush of power? Or were its leaders adapting to a flawed, entrenched system?Lincoln Secco, a professor of contemporary history at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo and an early party member, said Mr. da Silva made a fateful error during his first months in power by not seeking to push through difficult political changes, including an overhaul of a campaign finance system that is heavily reliant on corporate donors.\u201cIf the party doesn\u2019t confront the political system, there is no other way to govern in Brazil than to enter into rotten alliances,\u201d he said. \u201cThey chose the easier way.\u201dDespite the disillusionment, millions of Brazilians still hold great affection for the party, especially those who have benefited from the many social welfare programs put into place during the tenures of Mr. da Silva and Ms. Rousseff. They include a monthly stipend to the nation\u2019s poorest residents and programs that allowed millions of people to attend college for the first time.Milton Nunes Sobrinho, 53, a doorman in S\u00e3o Paulo, credits the party with helping him obtain steady work; buy a used car; and move his family out of a rat-infested shack, thanks to a federally subsidized loan program that produced 2.6 million new homeowners over the past decade.\u201cEverything they promised, they did,\u201d Mr. Sobrinho said. \u201cAll the progress we\u2019ve experienced in our lives is because of them.\u201dAsked about party\u2019s troubles, he shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s all a political game,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd next time, I\u2019ll definitely be voting for the candidate from the Workers\u2019 Party.\u201dAn article on May 13 about the sagging fortunes of the Workers\u2019 Party of Brazil, whose standard-bearer, President Dilma Rousseff, was suspended by the Brazilian Senate, misstated the amount of foreign debt that was hobbling the Brazilian economy in 1998, when Ms. Rousseff\u2019s mentor, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, ran for president. It was $250 billion, not $250 million.Paula Moura contributed reporting from Bras\u00edlia, and Vinod Sreeharsha from Rio de Janeiro.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Antitrust in the Age of Amazon", "Date": "2016-05-12", "News": "Supported byPens matter. Ink does not.The trade commission\u2019s argument underscores just how complicated it has become to judge Amazon\u2019s place in the retail industry. To put it simply: The agency does not think that the company benefits all customers equally.The decision also shows how difficult it is for regulators to keep up with industries being reshaped almost daily by technology.\u201cThe impact of online is not uniform,\u201d said Paul T. Denis, a lawyer at Dechert in Washington, who represented Office Max during its approved merger with Office Depot in 2013. \u201cJust because it\u2019s an effective competitive alternative for individual consumers doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s necessarily an effective competitive alternative for other types of customers.\u201dCompanies that stock up on pens, Post-it Notes and other items by the thousands have different needs than a college freshman buying a new printer. In the Office Max case, the F.T.C. agreed with Mr. Denis and another partner, James A. Fishkin, that individual customers would still have plenty of low-cost options.But for the decision this week, the agency was not convinced that Amazon was about to offer services that would suit large office supply buyers. Staples and Office Depot are the country\u2019s two largest office supply companies, with fleets of trucks, thousands of stores and large geographic footprints. Cutting the two down to one, the agency decided, would hurt those large buyers.As Amazon\u2019s history has shown, though, its capabilities can undergo swift and sweeping expansion: A company that started as a bookseller just over 20 years ago now has a business with a stock market valuation of almost $350 billion, dozens of times larger than the combined valuation of Office Depot and Staples.For the two office supply giants, which declined to comment for this article, the future was clear. Amazon has eaten into the profits of traditional retailers for years, and has given every indication that it only intends to grow, including deeper into their business.\u201cThe question becomes, how quickly will they offer that?\u201d said Daniel S. Bitton, a partner at Axinn, Veltrop & Harkrider.Last week, Amazon said its business-to-business website, Amazon Business, generated $1 billion in sales in its first year. Amazon offers same-day delivery in a growing number of stores, and has deep pockets to expand the ventures that it deems successful.Staples and Office Depot argued that Amazon\u2019s flurry of new initiatives would make it remain a strong rival, including in the business market. But to win antitrust cases, companies must prove that competitive threats are imminent if not present.The Federal Trade Commission is willing to look into the future, but not too far.Office Depot and Staples, once fierce rivals, saw teaming up as the best way to survive a highly competitive and challenging atmosphere. Consumer spending has lagged in the years since the 2008 financial collapse, and online merchants have increasingly lured away customers from traditional brick-and-mortar stores.Staples closed a combined 242 stores in 2014 and 2015, and expects to shutter another 50 this year, according to the company\u2019s most recent annual report. For the year ending Jan. 30, sales fell more than 6 percent, to $21 billion.Office Depot said it had closed 349 stores in 2014 and 2015, and had marked \u201cat least\u201d 400 retail stores for closing through 2016. Sales fell 10 percent last year, to $14.5 billion.But evaluating the competitive landscape is about more than store counts and market share, said Ben Gomes-Casseres, a professor at Brandeis International Business School who studies corporate alliances.\u201cIt is basically evaluating the potential, maybe, for that player to expand more rapidly,\u201d he said.The F.T.C. argued in court documents that Amazon did not have a \u201cdemonstrated track record\u201d of serving business customers, a segment of the population that many people may not associate with typical antitrust cases. But the commission has blocked mergers that threaten business contracts before, notably with the proposed Sysco and US Foods deal last year.\u201cWe will challenge transactions that have an adverse effect on business customers, not just ordinary consumers,\u201d Ms. Feinstein said.Including, it might be added, when those shoppers are buying Post-it Notes.Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Just Add Salt: How to Make Bacon and Pancetta at Home", "Date": "2016-05-17", "News": "Supported byCuring meat is why humans could stay put when there was nothing to grow, kill or steal. It is how conquerors and discoverers lasted while they traveled the world.But the refrigerator and the modern food industry \u2014 with its cans, plastic bags and chemicals \u2014 have made the average home cook afraid of this most simple and useful food preparation.There is no good reason for this: All you really need is salt. And the result? Malcolm, my 17-year-old son, may have said it best, \u201cWhatever is on my bagel is really good.\u201dHe was a test taster for home-cured lox I made while madly seasoning and drying out flesh over several months for this article. I had worried that I left the fish socked with salt in the refrigerator too long. The outside was dry, jerkylike, not the silky sort from a package of even average lox. I had to cut deeper \u2014 into fresh wild salmon infused with smoked salt, sugar, fennel fronds and fennel pollen \u2014 to reach the prize.I was surprised by how good it was, and this is no humble brag. You can buy wonderful lox from a store: This was a different taste planet.It was also easy. I made it myself with exactly the fish and flavors I wanted. And the boy liked it, a lot.Unlike the decision to become a better cook generally, which pays off every day, the resolve to do your own curing prompts a few basic questions before you start. Mostly: Why bother?A second question is one of ambition. Curing spans a range from bacon or basic corned beef to the elaborate, lard-chunked salamis of Italian or French charcuterie. The latter take much practice; dredging eBay and Amazon for humidifiers, grinders, slicers, casings and pH readers, even building a drying room for precise temperatures and moisture.I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a satisfying hobby, but it\u2019s also an insane amount of work \u2014 and requires elevated caution about safety. Cured food is, by definition, not cooked. Without proper precautions, it can foster dangerous bacteria. Rot can be good for wine, beer, cheese or yogurt. It can also make you sick or die. Cured meat that involves fermentation raises that risk.What I\u2019ve been experimenting with for the last eight or so years is not grinding and fermenting but drying out solid pieces of meat as they are transformed with just salt, spices and air. Turns out our ancestors stumbled onto something magical: Salt preserves the meat by sucking the water out, retarding spoilage and concentrating flavor.The process also allows the added flavors to infuse into the meat, making it something different altogether, as well as making it more your own.How long it lasts depends on whom you ask. It\u2019s safe to say dried meat will last a few weeks in the refrigerator without problems and much longer if frozen, which is perfectly fine.Fresh products like bacon or nondried pancetta go rancid much more quickly and should be checked carefully. Trouble is easy to detect: I\u2019ve noticed dried meats don\u2019t so much spoil as grow yellowish and don\u2019t smell fresh. Then it\u2019s time to toss them.Don\u2019t think of curing as an heirloom exercise in recreating life how it used to be. Like Mr. Bertolli, many proponents of curing learned it from relatives who did it partly out of love, partly out of necessity. So despite the last few generations of mass produced and preserved food, curing is an art that was never lost. Maybe out of fashion, but ever alive.\u201cFor me, it\u2019s the pleasure of making things you are going to consume yourself,\u201d Mr. Bertolli said. \u201cThere is a pride in it.\u201dI\u2019ve developed a basic and useful repertoire that requires no special equipment, space or even much time: bacon, both American and Italian (pancetta); lox, and duck prosciutto, an impressive and fun little trick that I learned from Mr. Polcyn and that you can brag over at your next dinner party as if you just brought it back from Parma. It cures for just one day under kosher salt alone.Romans say with snobby certainty you can make carbonara only with guanciale, not pancetta or bacon. I\u2019m fine with any, but there is no question that guanciale makes the dish taste like Rome.It promised the exotic without much pain or cost: salt, sugar, pepper, garlic, coriander and rosemary rubbed over the cheek and plopped into a Ziploc bag in the refrigerator for just three days. To use right away, you roast it for about three hours. It is sublime.We are fortunate enough to have a fireplace, so I thought: Why not dry it the way they do in Italy? I did, even if it drove the dogs mad, hanging temptingly just behind the screen in the unlit fireplace.Three weeks later I was rewarded with something I felt I didn\u2019t do enough to deserve: It looked Old World on the outside, all tough and dry, the inside a strip of meat encased in almost buttery, flavorful fat.I realize most cooks aren\u2019t going to find regular use for guanciale, though it adds wonders to other pastas, soups and even seafood dishes. For me, though, it lit a fuse: I moved from the pig\u2019s cheek to its belly. Salts, sugar and maple syrup are all you need for tremendous American bacon.Nutmeg, juniper, garlic, thyme and bay leaf make pancetta, which can be used dry or fresh and is singularly versatile in the kitchen. Fish, salmon especially, cures in a few days and makes a New York bagel brunch a special occasion. (I just tried a recipe from Mr. Polcyn curing salmon with beets and fresh horseradish. I recommend it.)The list goes on, for every taste and ambition: jerky, pastrami, corned beef, full hams. I don\u2019t own a smoker, but it notches the art up with little effort. There are websites devoted to prosciutto, which requires only salt, patience and the optimism of being alive in the year or so an entire pig leg takes to dry. Results, apparently, are spectacular.A few basics for new curers: It\u2019s nice to have a fireplace, for temperature and air flow, but you can hang meat to dry in many places. People use closets, garages, basements, old refrigerators, a kitchen\u2019s out-of-the-way nook.You won\u2019t smell much of anything as it cures, since it generally is wrapped in plastic for many reasons, mostly because the meat gets quite wet as the salt pulls out the water. But the aroma is terrific: sweet and salty, with flavors like rosemary and cracked pepper at high decibel.Then there are the inevitable controversies of curing, which I\u2019ll cover here only in outline. This is what the Internet was invented for, and readers of age can decide for themselves.There is also a theological debate over whether to use the most common curing salt, often called pink salt or Prague powder. It is a nitrite, and thus poisonous in quantity. Some curers prefer alternatives as safer and more natural. Experts I consulted recommended using it (in the prescribed small amounts) for several reasons: It\u2019s effective in killing dangerous bacteria and contributes to the taste and color of good cured meat. I do, without apology.Finally, I\u2019ll say that curing is handy (this was the whole point, before history was even invented) and can save a bundle. One recent rainy Sunday, our younger son, Nelson, came home from a day of hard New York skateboarding with a friend, starving, as 15-year-olds tend to be. We had not strategized dinner. We considered ordering out, but Indian food or sushi would run $60 at least.Took 20 minutes. Cost less than $20 for four. The boys didn\u2019t care where that crazy-great, salty bacon came from, but they ate and were happy. I was, too, and the pleasure was not just in my stomach.cookingcookingcookingcookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Podcasts Surge, but Producers Fear Apple Isn\u2019t Listening", "Date": "2016-05-07", "News": "Supported bySteven P. Jobs put his talent as a master salesman to the test when, in 2005, he introduced new Apple software for downloading digital audio shows. The format was so incipient that he struggled to describe it.\u201cIt\u2019s sort of like TiVo, for radio, for your iPod,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the \u2018Wayne\u2019s World\u2019 of radio, but real radio is jumping onto this.\u201dBut he was clear about the potential. \u201cIt\u2019s getting very, very exciting,\u201d he said.He was talking about podcasting \u2014 radio-style shows made for the Internet that have, in recent years, exploded in popularity. These days, many amateur podcasters are going professional. Major media organizations, searching for answers and bright spots in a fast-changing and confusing digital world, are releasing new shows every week. Advertisers are starting to follow them, and so are millions of dollars of venture capital.It is, in other words, an industry now, one that Apple essentially gave life to and still dominates. Yet at this moment of triumph for podcasting, concerns are growing in the community about how much Apple actually cares.Interviews with over two dozen podcasters and people inside Apple reveal a variety of complaints. The podcasters say that they are relegated to wooing a single Apple employee for the best promotion. That sharing on social media is cumbersome. And that for podcasters to make money, they need more information about their listeners, and Apple is in a unique position to provide it. The problems, they say, could even open up an opportunity for a competitor.\u201cThe lack of podcast data is kind of shocking,\u201d said Gina Delvac, the producer of \u201cCall Your Girlfriend,\u201d a popular show about pop culture and politics.Late last month, Apple brought seven leading podcast professionals to the company\u2019s campus in Cupertino, Calif., to air their case to a room full of employees, according to two people who were there. The people would speak only on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. The company made no promises, the people said, but several pressing issues for podcasters were discussed in frank terms.After the presentations concluded, Eddy Cue, the executive at Apple who oversees software and services, arrived for a closed session with the company\u2019s employees, according to the attendees.\u201cI think everyone who\u2019s seriously involved in this space, they\u2019d at least like to know what the endgame is,\u201d said Chris Morrow, the chief executive of the Loud Speakers Podcast Network. \u201cPeople think there\u2019s another shoe that\u2019s going to drop.\u201dBut podcasting is a product of a different era for digital media \u2014 and for Apple. When Mr. Jobs introduced the updated podcast software in 2005, the company was still in comeback mode, driven by iPods. The iPhone wouldn\u2019t come out for two more years.Now Apple is the biggest public company in the world, but podcasts bring Apple virtually nothing in direct revenue. Perhaps as a result, the iTunes podcasting hub that Mr. Jobs introduced remains strikingly unchanged. Sharing on social media, which basically didn\u2019t exist in 2005, takes multiple clicks.Promotion within iTunes, which is still one of the only reliable ways to build an audience, particularly for a new show, is decided by a small team that fields pitches and does its own outreach. Interviews with people inside and outside the company make it clear that Apple\u2019s small podcast team has been hearing \u2014 and assuaging \u2014 such concerns for years.The question for podcasters \u2014 and for Apple \u2014 is about what comes next. Apple has at least two obvious choices: to rush to accommodate an industry that is quickly outgrowing its origins, or to let podcasting be, at the risk of losing its claim over a medium that owes its very name to the company.Even podcasters are conflicted; a hands-off Apple retains some appeal. \u201cSome would argue that it could have advanced in certain ways,\u201d said Andy Bowers, chief content officer of Slate\u2019s Panoply podcast network. But since 2005, he said, \u201cthey\u2019ve provided a remarkably level playing field.\u201dIn a statement, Mr. Cue of Apple said, \u201cWe have more people than ever focused on podcasting, including engineers, editors and programmers.\u201d He added, \u201cPodcasts hold a special place with us at Apple.\u201dIn terms of revenue, podcasting is still minuscule compared with the technology and entertainment industries. In the early days, hobbyists grew passion projects into businesses and full-time jobs. Now a few established podcast networks and popular podcasters have millions in revenue.Podcasters can sell advertisements at rates ranging from $20 to $100 for every thousand listeners. For podcasts with hundreds of thousands of listeners \u2014 and, in rare cases, millions \u2014 those numbers add up. The spending on advertisements will generate hundreds of millions of dollars for the industry this year, said Matt Lieber, a co-founder of Gimlet Media, a podcasting start-up that has raised $7.5 million from venture capitalists.Expanding the industry much more, though, gets tricky. Apple does not allow shows to charge people to download episodes, for example, and does not support paid subscriptions, as many podcasters would like. Apple has stuck with an advertising model for podcasting that looks almost exactly like what Mr. Jobs predicted onstage in 2005.Measuring how many people listen is also inconsistent and a regular source of frustration. Podcasters know how many times their podcasts are downloaded, for example, but they don\u2019t know how many people actually listened, or how far those listeners might have gotten.With data like listener counts and listening duration \u2014 similar to what Apple provides app developers \u2014 the industry could accelerate quickly, said Ms. Delvac of \u201cCall Your Girlfriend.\u201dBut unlike with downloads of music, movies and apps \u2014 sources of billions of dollars of revenue for Apple, which takes a cut from sales and subscriptions \u2014 the company\u2019s financial incentive in podcasting is limited. The company takes no cut from podcast advertising, and all podcast downloads are free, so there is no cut to take from that, either. As it stands, podcasting is effectively just one more free feature to help the company sell hardware.And it\u2019s a popular one. Apple\u2019s service now contains over 325,000 podcasts. The company expects users to listen to 10 billion episodes in its apps \u2014 on computers, mobile devices and on Apple TV \u2014 by the end of the year.\u201cApple built this village 10 years ago,\u201d Mr. Lieber said. \u201cThere\u2019s really interesting things in the village, and interesting characters. But the village now has the population of a city \u2014 and when a village becomes a city, you need new infrastructure.\u201dApple\u2019s conservative approach may be creating an opportunity for competitors, as has happened before. Apple\u2019s iTunes software helped popularize online music, only to watch streaming services like Spotify and Pandora create compelling alternatives. Apple pressured the television and film industries to sell, and rent, their content online; then Netflix built subscription streaming into a business worth nearly $40 billion.Google abandoned a podcast app in 2012, but this year it added a podcast features to its music app, which is included with smartphones that run the company\u2019s Android operating system. Todd Cochrane, chief executive of RawVoice, a company that tracks podcasts, said Apple\u2019s share of podcast listeners is now about 65 percent, down from 70 percent a year ago. He attributed that change almost entirely to an \u201cupsurge\u201d in listening on Android.In January, Spotify, the streaming music service, began rolling out an ambitious slate of podcasts. Among the company\u2019s promises to podcasters: hosting, streaming and extensive listening data. Audible, the audiobook service owned by the notoriously aggressive Amazon, is investing heavily in original audio content under the guidance of Eric Nuzum, a former vice president at National Public Radio. (The New York Times is among the partners working with Audible.)\u201cWe\u2019re actively distributing our content in many different places right now,\u201d said Laura Walker, president and chief executive of New York Public Radio, whose podcasts include \u201cRadiolab,\u201d \u201cFreakonomics\u201d and \u201c2 Dope Queens.\u201d \u201cEverything is growing.\u201dApple\u2019s stance as the giant of the industry remains undisputed, though, and podcasters are left to navigate a complicated relationship with the company. Most send messages to the company at a general email address. To those who have direct contact, their relationship centers on one person: Steve Wilson.Mr. Wilson, podcasters say, acts as Apple\u2019s de facto podcast gatekeeper. Attention from him can be the difference between a hit and a dud \u2014 and between a podcast that pays and one that doesn\u2019t.The most consistent major source of new listeners \u2014 in some cases, tens of thousands \u2014 is a top spot on iTunes and Apple\u2019s podcast app. That is the real estate that Mr. Wilson helps oversee, and that podcasters covet. (Mr. Wilson directed a request for an interview to a company publicist, who declined to make him available for an interview.)\u201cAs far as I can tell they\u2019re huge podcasts enthusiasts,\u201d said Jody Avirgan, who hosts and produces podcasts for the ESPN data journalism site FiveThirtyEight. \u201cBut you\u2019re trying to cram thousands of new shows into, what, six things that get featured on the home page?\u201dMr. Wilson\u2019s identity and contact information are shared among podcasters like a juicy secret, and his podcast preferences are furtively debated in the industry, as are those of his boss, James Boggs. Mostly, it makes podcasters wonder: At a company the size of Apple, what does it mean that American podcasters are left to lobby a single person?From Apple\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s not that simple. Of the more than 150 iTunes podcast portals around the world, 29 have hand-edited selections and Steve Wilsons of their own. Any change to the way Apple handles podcasting could have wide ramifications.Additionally, the \u201cTop Podcast\u201d list within iTunes is also the subject of constant speculation among podcasters. An apparent change in the system this year resulted in small podcasts from Disney fans \u2014 and a show that hadn\u2019t yet published its first full episode \u2014 being ranked alongside shows with hundreds of thousands of listeners, according to Nicholas Quah, who publishes Hot Pod, a newsletter about the industry.For listeners, quirks like this may only be a little weird. For podcasters, who already struggle to communicate their success to advertisers, it leaves them frustrated.\u201cI think it\u2019s like the question everyone asks of any company,\u201d said Ms. Delvac, the \u201cCall Your Girlfriend\u201d producer. \u201cHow can I keep the good parts of my relationship the same, and get more of what I want?\u201dAdvertisement"}

FUJI, JAPANSigur Ros, Beck and the Red Hot Chili Peppers will play headline concerts at this three-day festival, set in a mountaintop ski resort in central Japan. The lineup includes a mix of rising stars (like Courtney Barnett, Kula Shaker and Stereophonics) and some more unusual acts, like 2Cellos, a Croatian cello duo who mix classical songs with covers of contemporary artists like Avicii. Acts from Japan include the neo-punk band WANIMA and the electronic composer Soichi Terada.BARCELONAThis beloved festival, known to some as Europe\u2019s answer to Coachella, has earned a reputation as one of the best places to spot young talent. As its reputation has grown, so has the prestige of its acts. This year\u2019s lineup of more than 200 acts includes Air, PJ Harvey and Radiohead, who just surprise-released their latest album, \u201cA Moon Shaped Pool.\u201dNOVI SAD, SERBIAThis electronic dance music festival presents high-level club music at the Petrovaradin Fortress, a 17th-century fort in this small city overlooking the Danube. Some major rap, pop and EDM names are in the lineup, including Wiz Khalifa, Ellie Goulding and David Guetta. Those who are craving even more trance music can head to Jaz Beach in Montenegro, where Exit\u2019s sister event, the Sea Dance Festival, takes place from July 14-16.GLASTONBURY, ENGLANDBritain has a reputation for excellent summer festivals, held on rolling, verdant parklands across the countryside. The jewel in the season crown is Glastonbury. Headliners this year include the cream of the crop of contemporary pop: Adele, Beck, Disclosure and more. Niche acts, like Wolf Alice and James Blake, will also perform. Some off-kilter events, like a tomato-slinging festival, take place alongside the music. Britain votes on whether it should leave the European Union on June 23, and some have voiced fears that Glastonbury\u2019s roughly 130,000, mostly young attendees, who will probably not vote while at the festival, could skew election results.BUDAPESTThis festival, once Eastern Europe\u2019s fringiest music upstart, has grown into one of the largest music festivals in the world. Rihanna, Sia and David Guetta will all play this year. The program still includes indie darlings like the electronic band Crystal Castles and the far-out South African rock and rap group Die Antwoord. Freddie, who represented Hungary at Eurovision with a performance that featured several whistling background performers and a shirtless man playing a giant gong, will also perform.AMSTERDAMIn the director-performer Simon McBurney\u2019s play \u201cThe Encounter,\u201d audience members wear headphones while Mr. McBurney tells the true story of Loren McIntyre, an American journalist who, in the 1960s, got lost in the Amazon and was unwittingly swept into the life of a local tribe. The piece is one of dozens of works in this eclectic lineup, which includes dance, music and movie offerings in venues around Amsterdam. Also appearing: Africa Express presents Terry Riley\u2019s \u201cIn C Mali,\u201d a new version of a 1964 work recorded in Bamako after the Islamist takeover of much of Mali in 2013.SINGAPOREThe young composer Huang Ruo\u2019s \u201cParadise Interrupted\u201d blends traditional Chinese opera with modern musical elements. Based on a Ming opera, the piece follows a woman who encounters her ideal mate in a dream and then embarks on an epic quest to find him again. A lushly designed production of it is one of about 20 works that will be shown at SIFA, which focuses on international and interdisciplinary performances. Other pieces include \u201cThe Last Supper,\u201d a family drama by the Iranian playwright Ahmed El Attar; \u201cMaking and Doing,\u201d a dance and lecture piece starring the celebrated American choreographer Bill T. Jones; and \u201cHamlet|Collage,\u201d an update of Shakespeare\u2019s play by the circus-inspired director Robert Lepage.

The festival\u2019s centerpiece is \u201cField Lines,\u201d a series of drawings, light installations and sculptures by the artist Cameron Robbins. The rest of the eclectic program includes a concert by the London-based pop sensation Savages; Dark Park, featuring eerie artworks that double as playground equipment; and \u201cAsylum,\u201d an installation piece that the artist Mike Parr will stage in a 19th-century mental institution on the outskirts of Hobart.VIENNAEach year this festival showcases new dance from across Europe as well as established talent. The choreographer Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker will show two celebrated works, \u201cTransfigured Night\u201d and \u201cDie Weise von Liebe und Tod des Cornets Christoph Rilke.\u201d The festival also includes a series dedicated to young choreographers from Europe, Brazil and the United States.POZNAN, POLANDThe Dutch artist Dries Verhoeven aims to unsettle with his artworks, like \u201cCeci n\u2019est pas\u2026,\u201d in which he places a boxed structure with glass sides in public and invites viewers to look at the strange characters within \u2014 a dwarf dressed as a prostitute, a child polishing a gun. That piece will appear in this festival, which brings an array of edgy performing arts to this city in central Poland.

Other productions include \u201cAll You Need to Know,\u201d an adaptation of Jos\u00e9 Saramago\u2019s novel \u201cSeeing,\u201d about a town where, one day, for reasons that are unclear, around 80 percent of voters in an unnamed country cast blank ballots in a local election.EDINBURGHEdinburgh comes alive in August with two major festivals: The heady International Festival and the edgier fringe, which takes place in smaller theaters, pubs, and found venues around the city. Some major names will play this year\u2019s International Festival, which features a mix of dance, opera, music and theater. The offerings include performances by Sigur Ros and the Scottish Ballet, and a lauded American production of \u201cThe Glass Menagerie,\u201d starring Cherry Jones. The fringe program includes hundreds of acts in all, like comedy shows, a tour of a local graveyard and \u201cCafe Palestine,\u201d a revue featuring performers from a Bethlehem refugee camp.BREGENZ, AUSTRIAThis annual festival is best known for its lake stage, a giant outdoor performance space that hovers above Lake Constance. This year, the company will stage \u201cTurandot,\u201d about a malevolent princess who makes men compete for her hand. The production features a giant set inspired by the Great Wall of China.

Productions this year include a monumental \u201cAida,\u201d directed by Gianfranco de Bosio, and an epic \u201cIl Trovatore,\u201d staged by Mr. Zeffirelli. On July 18, Roberto Bolle will perform a special evening of dance.BAYREUTH, GERMANYWagner himself first devised this festival, which, since 1876, has served as the world\u2019s leading showcase of his work, in particular his \u201cRing Cycle\u201d (the four-opera cycle gets a full staging each summer). Controversy erupts every few years here over edgy, experimental versions. Recent iconoclastic stagings by the German director Frank Castorf have irked traditionalists by tinkering with the source material. Mr. Castorf is back this year with his \u201cRing\u201d cycle. Other pieces in the summer season include the composer\u2019s \u201cTristan und Isolde,\u201d directed by Wagner\u2019s great granddaughter Katharina Wagner; and \u201cDer Fliegende Holl\u00e4nder,\u201d by the German director Jan Philipp Gloger.HONG KONGThis festival explores the rich history of Chinese traditional opera through a mix of performances, lectures and films. Productions include \u201cSacrificing the Son,\u201d a new adaptation of the Cantonese opera staple \u201cThe Lotus Lantern;\u201d and a tribute to the Ming operatist Tang Xianzu.

{"Headline": "De Blasio\u2019s Press Secretary Says She Will Quit", "Date": "2016-05-05", "News": "Supported byIn his two and a half years as mayor, Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, has often lamented that his liberal policies have not been clearly conveyed to New Yorkers, pointing to those challenges as an explanation for the criticism that has buffeted his administration. The press office has undergone shifts in personnel and new hirings, including at least two rounds of changes since last May, when Ms. Hinton was brought in \u2014 filling a post that had been empty for three months.Ms. Hinton confirmed her resignation on Thursday afternoon, which she said was motivated, at least in part, by a desire to spend more time with her daughter, a junior in high school.\u201cFor the past year, I have had the privilege of being part of Mayor de Blasio\u2019s efforts to build affordable housing, prevent homelessness, educate pre-K students and support the mentally ill,\u201d she said in a statement to The New York Times. \u201cThe mayor\u2019s commitment and tenacity have turned progressive values into everyday realities for so many New York City families. I am proud to have been part of that effort and look forward to continuing to support the mayor\u2019s future successes.\u201dWhen she was appointed, Mr. de Blasio described Ms. Hinton as a \u201cbattle-tested communications professional\u201d and highlighted their work together at the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development when Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo was President Bill Clinton\u2019s housing secretary. Ms. Hinton is married to Howard Glaser, a former top Cuomo aide.But Ms. Hinton, 57, who early in her career was a reporter in Jackson, Miss., and became communications consultant for Democrats and high-profile officials, never fully assimilated into the core group of mayoral aides and City Hall decision makers. In some cases, she was not informed of important decisions until just before they were to be announced.That early stumble occurred during a moment of feuding between Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Cuomo, who was said to have privately bristled at someone as close to his orbit as Ms. Hinton taking the job with the mayor.Lately, the mayor has appeared to struggle with how to respond to the spate of inquiries, which have centered on whether his fund-raising activities \u2014 aimed at pressing for his liberal agenda or at getting Democrats elected to the State Senate in 2014 \u2014 went beyond the boundaries of the law. Prosecutors are looking both at campaign finance violations and, separately, at whether any favorable municipal action was taken on behalf of contributors.At one point last month, Mr. de Blasio said he would no longer take questions on the investigations. Two days later he decided to address the inquiries again. Since then he has spoken on a number of occasions, repeating that he holds himself and the administration \u201cto the highest ethical standards.\u201dOn Tuesday, Mr. de Blasio changed tack again: For nearly 20 minutes after a news conference on crime statistics and plans for a new police precinct in Queens, he sat alone behind a blue curtain-draped desk and answered questions from reporters who traveled from City Hall to the precinct, near the city\u2019s eastern border.City Hall officials have not named a replacement for Ms. Hinton, whose resignation was not among the series of changes to Mr. de Blasio\u2019s communications staff announced this week, including the hiring of a social media director and a new speechwriter.In a statement on Thursday, Mr. de Blasio praised Ms. Hinton\u2019s work for the administration in helping \u201cus inform New Yorkers about our vision\u201d and said she \u201cwill be missed.\u201d\u201cI thank Karen for her service, and I know she will remain a source of trusted advice for me and our team,\u201d the mayor said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Moore\u2019s Law Running Out of Room, Tech Looks for a Successor", "Date": "2016-05-04", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For decades, the computer industry has been guided by a faith that engineers would always find a way to make the components on computer chips smaller, faster and cheaper.But a decision by a global alliance of chip makers to back away from reliance on Moore\u2019s Law, a principle that has guided tech companies from the giant mainframes of the 1960s to today\u2019s smartphones, shows that the industry may need to rethink the central tenet of Silicon Valley\u2019s innovation ethos.Chip scientists are nearly at the point where they are manipulating material as small as atoms. When they hit that mark within the next five years or so, they may bump into the boundaries of how tiny semiconductors can become. After that, they may have to look for alternatives to silicon, which is used to make computer chips, or new design ideas in order to make computers more powerful.It is hard to overstate the importance of Moore\u2019s Law to the entire world. Despite its official sound, it is not actually a scientific rule like Newton\u2019s laws of motion. Instead, it describes the pace of change in a manufacturing process that has made computers exponentially more affordable.In 1965, the Intel co-founder Gordon Moore first observed that the number of components that could be etched onto the surface of a silicon wafer was doubling at regular intervals and would do so for the foreseeable future.That iPad 2, mind you, is slow compared to newer models.Without those remarkable improvements, today\u2019s computer industry wouldn\u2019t exist. The vast cloud-computing data centers run by companies like Google and Amazon would be impossibly expensive to build. There would be no smartphones with apps that allow you to order a ride home or get dinner delivered. And scientific breakthroughs like decoding the human genome or teaching machines to listen would not have happened.Signaling their belief that the best way to forecast the future of computing needs to be changed, the Semiconductor Industry Associations of the United States, Europe, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan will make one final report based on a chip technology forecasting system called the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors.Nearly every big chip maker, including Intel, IBM and Samsung, belongs to the organization, though Intel says it is not participating in the last report.To replace what the semiconductor industry has done for nearly 25 years, a professional organization called the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers announced on Wednesday that it will a create a new forecasting system, called the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems, that is intended to track a wider range of computer technologies.\u201cThe end of Moore\u2019s Law is what led to this,\u201d said Thomas M. Conte, a Georgia Institute of Technology computer scientist and co-chairman of the effort to draw up a new set of benchmarks to replace the semiconductor reports. \u201cJust relying on the semiconductor industry is no longer enough. We have to shift and punch through some walls and break through some barriers.\u201dPredicting the end of Moore\u2019s Law has for years been a parlor game in Silicon Valley, and not everyone in the industry believes that what it has come to represent is nearly over. Intel, the world\u2019s largest chip maker, is a notable contrarian and predicts it has the means and know-how to push further into the atomic level.In a statement on his company\u2019s website last month, Brian Krzanich, Intel\u2019s chief executive, played down concerns. \u201cI have witnessed the advertised death of Moore\u2019s Law no less than four times,\u201d he wrote.Intel, however, faces its own problems because of a long slump in PC sales and an inability to sell many chips to smartphone makers. Last month, the company announced plans to lay off 12,000 workers \u2014 roughly 11 percent of its work force \u2014 and take a $1.2 billion charge.The industry saw signs that Moore\u2019s Law was running out of steam as far back as 2005, when researchers began to worry that computer processors were becoming so hot that they would soon match the surface of the sun in heat output.But the industry managed to fix the problem by worrying less about increasing speed and instead splitting tasks among many processors. In effect, it kept things cool by finding a way to share the load.By walking away from a task they have managed for so long, the chip makers other than Intel \u2014 the Silicon Valley giant says it is no longer formally contributing to the forecasting process \u2014 are posing broader questions about their businesses.\u201cAs you look at Intel saying the PC industry is slowing and seeing the first signs of slowing in mobile computing, people are starting to look for new places to put semiconductors,\u201d said David Kanter, a semiconductor industry analyst at Real World Technologies in San Francisco.In addition to the impending physical limits of transistors, other barriers are looming. For example, most of the semiconductor industry now insists that the per-transistor cost of computer chips has stopped falling. That had been one of the factors leading to rapid development of new computer technologies.Many executives and analysts in the computer industry are skeptical about Intel\u2019s ability to keep Moore\u2019s Law going. They point out that if the chip maker were able to continue to reduce costs, it would have been able to make larger inroads into the mobile computing world of smartphones. As part of its recent cutbacks, the company killed its Atom microprocessors, which it had been unsuccessfully trying to sell to smartphone makers.\u201cIf your whole business was about Moore\u2019s Law, and it was ending, how would you react?\u201d Dr. Conte wrote in an email message.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cannes Keeps Its Traditions, Including Its Boos", "Date": "2016-05-20", "News": "Supported byCritic's NotebookCANNES, France \u2014 A week into the Cannes Film Festival, the machine-gun-carrying soldiers vanished. For the first stretch of this event, a cluster of soldiers had been patrolling the main shopping drag that runs parallel to the promenade overlooking the Mediterranean, just one part of the show of force this year. France remains in a state of emergency, but festivalgoers exist in a bubble, and, in time, talk about heavy security gave way to other concerns, like whether Maren Ade\u2019s \u201cToni Erdmann\u201d would win the Palme d\u2019Or, and if Sean Penn\u2019s \u201cThe Last Face\u201d was worse than Nicolas Winding Refn\u2019s \u201cThe Neon Demon\u201d or Xavier Dolan\u2019s \u201cIt\u2019s Only the End of the World.\u201dMr. Penn may be the unfortunate winner of this dubious contest, to judge from the insistent jeers that greeted \u201cThe Last Face\u201d at its Friday morning press screening. Booing \u2014 lustily, rightly, wrongly \u2014 is a Cannes tradition. Michelangelo Antonioni\u2019s art film landmark \u201cL\u2019Avventura\u201d was famously heckled, as was Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cTaxi Driver,\u201d which went on to win the Palme. Mr. Penn is unlikely to receive any awards here; it\u2019s doubtful that he will even receive many (any) good reviews for \u201cThe Last Face,\u201d which centers on two relief-aid doctors (Charlize Theron and Javier Bardem) who fall in love in 2003 amid the genocidal horrors of Sierra Leone and Liberia.It\u2019s similarly mystifying how Mr. Refn and Mr. Dolan made it into competition, except as would-be representatives of a younger auteurist guard. The parade of beautiful, bloodied women in Mr. Refn\u2019s flashy dud \u2014 about a young model (Elle Fanning), newly arrived in Los Angeles \u2014 suggests that he fell under the spell of both Helmut Newton and David Lynch at an impressionable age, but without learning anything, including how to move beyond shocks or how to animate his visuals. Mr. Dolan, in his family drama, seems to be trying for the operatic excesses that sometimes work for Pedro Almod\u00f3var, with a touch of John Cassavetes thrown in.This welcoming applause was an emotional acknowledgment of Mr. L\u00e9aud\u2019s stature, starting, of course, with \u201cThe 400 Blows,\u201d which inaugurated his working relationship with Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut. Elsewhere at the festival, though, ovations can be as cheap and unreliable a marker of quality as the jeers. Olivier Assayas\u2019s competition entry, \u201cPersonal Shopper,\u201d starring an exceptional Kristen Stewart, was unfairly booed at its first press screening. Ms. Stewart, who appeared in Mr. Assayas\u2019s earlier film \u201cClouds of Sils Maria\u201d (at Cannes in 2014), plays a young American working in Paris who\u2019s trying to contact her dead twin, even as she juggles a living malign force.\u201cPersonal Shopper\u201d primarily comes across as a lovingly appointed platform for Ms. Stewart\u2019s talents and beauty. Mr. Assayas places her in wide-ranging situations \u2014 the movie embraces a range of genres, from a paranormal thriller to a glossy action movie to a coming-of-age tale \u2014 and dresses her in a variety of costumes, from haute couture fetish to cool-girl schlub wear. It\u2019s a reminder that the history of cinema is also a history of male directors working with superb actresses, a truism borne out in \u201cAquarius,\u201d from the Brazilian director Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho. Sonia Braga (\u201cKiss of the Spider Woman\u201d) stars as a widow and retired music critic whose fight with some developers (they want to evict her) evolves into a stirring look at the intersection of class, history and memory.Going into the festival, Amazon Studios, with its deep pockets and great ambitions, was the hot prospect turning everyone\u2019s head. The ardor may have cooled by the time Cannes ends Sunday, given that not all its titles have been well received, Mr. Refn\u2019s included, but maybe not. Cannes is about many things, including the romance of cinema, and right now Amazon is at least partly in the romance business. Compared with the superblockbusters released by the big American studios, its titles \u2014 like many of this festival\u2019s selections \u2014 can seem small, little more than Hollywood chump change. Yet, as movies like \u201cPaterson\u201d remind us, good art invariably finds a way, even amid the vulgarity.Advertisement"}

That means he also has to spend hours each week coordinating that travel.Help has arrived with the Pana app, which employs artificial intelligence to aid customers.Many of the virtual assistant services use artificial intelligence, a branch of computer science that simulates intelligent human behavior. Some respond to questions posed by travelers, either in live speech or digitally, while some, like Pana, rely on additional input by humans to provide answers.Although many services are now in their infancy, they are expected to change the way travel is planned in the not-too-distant future.The Pana app lets users chat, in conversational language, about booking travel and helps if they encounter a delay or cancellation. Responses are provided by a team of travel agents who are on duty round the clock and have access to artificial intelligence to gather information customized for the traveler.Mr. Baer, who has been a Pana devotee since last year and recently signed a contract for his staff of 11 to use it, relies on it primarily for tips on places he visits and to rebook when his schedule changes or he encounters an unexpected delay.Like many in the travel industry, Miriam Moscovici, director of emerging technologies for BCD Travel, a travel management company, predicts that within a year \u201clower-priority tasks will be handled by self-service artificial intelligence, which will free up human travel agents to do more of the intense work required.\u201dWayBlazer and Watson\u2019s cognitive technology are the brains behind Connie, a robot being tested at the Hilton in McLean, Va., outside Washington. Connie answers guests\u2019 questions about amenities and services, and also suggests local attractions.Norm Rose, an analyst for Phocuswright, a travel research company, predicted that artificial intelligence would help simplify and automate travel planning by providing quicker responses and more relevant content.But noting that artificial intelligence is not yet capable of completely replacing human interactions, he warned it could also alienate travelers if a travel company used it but was unable to answer their questions.He said artificial intelligence systems need to understand the vocabulary used in travel to be successful, but still may have difficulty helping travelers if their requests are complex. He also said some emerging systems are arranging complex itineraries that contain multiple flights or involve flights and hotels, and predicted many will eventually be able to handle both.Expedia is among a few dozen companies and organizations that Facebook recently said would use a new chatbot on the social network\u2019s Messenger platform. This lets users pose questions in digital chats and employs artificial intelligence-powered systems to provide answers. Expedia is testing responding to hotel booking requests via Messenger.Passengers of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, an earlier partner on Messenger, can now use the platform to confirm bookings and get flight status updates. The airline also plans to offer bookings through Messenger. And since 2011, the airline has been testing a 6-foot-3 robot, Spencer, at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, its home base. In its most recent trial, which ended in March, Spencer escorted travelers to their gates.Robots are also being used at select Starwood, InterContinental and Marriott hotels in the United States and are being tested in Europe by SNCF, the French railway, and on cruise ships operated by Costa and Aida.Skyscanner, a travel search engine, this year developed a voice-enabled app for Alexa, the cloud-based voice service for the Echo from Amazon, to search for flights. Alexa also recently began working with Kayak to help users search for flights, hotels, rental cars and destinations, though no booking is done through it.HelloGBye will begin testing an app this summer that lets users type or speak into their phone and create an itinerary with flights and hotel accommodations. The app can book travel for as many as nine people at once.In November, Hipmunk, which has helped travelers research and book travel online since 2010, began testing a free, personalized virtual travel-planning assistant, Hello Hipmunk, powered by artificial intelligence. It provides help via email. Users can also give Hello Hipmunk permission to access their Google calendar, which it then periodically scans for events requiring travel and proactively provides booking options.The Pana app answers many users\u2019 questions in less than a minute, said Devon Tivona, the company\u2019s chief executive, and agents notify customers if more time is required. Pana is geared toward people who frequently travel for business. Its monthly fees range from $19 for one person to $449 for companies with fewer than 200 employees. Introduced in a beta test last summer, it formally began operating in April and works with thousands of individual travelers and fewer than 100 businesses.Mr. Baer, the digital marketing consultant, said Pana is \u201cso reasonably priced and so fast, if you travel any more than once a month, it\u2019s literally a no-brainer to buy this.\u201d His company pays $250 a month for its services.Henry Harteveldt, a travel analyst for Atmosphere Research, predicted that artificial intelligence would make shopping for travel \u201cmore efficient, less time-consuming and more useful.\u201dMr. Harteveldt said this would occur, in part, because travel-planning tools that employ artificial intelligence would make use of travelers\u2019 relevant data, such as their home city and age, and would not require them to use technical terms, like airport codes, as many sellers now do. The result, he added, would be tools that come up with suggestions \u201cat lightning speed that are contextually relevant.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But next season it\u2019s placing a big bet on the past.MacGyver, the crafty secret agent, is returning to CBS three decades after his 1985 debut. \u201cTales From the Crypt,\u201d an HBO series that first aired in 1989, will be resurrected on TNT. \u201cMTV Unplugged,\u201d whose Eric Clapton heyday was in the 1990s, is back \u2014 and so are \u201c24,\u201d \u201cPrison Break\u201d and \u201cGilmore Girls.\u201d\u201cWe now live in a world where TV shows never die,\u201d said David Nevins, the chief executive of Showtime. He has his own revival on the way: Mr. Nevins helped persuade David Lynch to create a new chapter of \u201cTwin Peaks,\u201d the cult series that went off the air a quarter-century ago.Call it a familiarity fetish. At the network upfront presentations, which began on Monday, executives are expected to unveil new adaptations of favored franchises that extend beyond TV shows, including films like \u201cThe Exorcist,\u201d \u201cTraining Day,\u201d \u201cTaken\u201d and, potentially, \u201cCruel Intentions,\u201d with Sarah Michelle Gellar reprising her role in the 1999 original.\u201cWe are not saying we are out of the original idea business,\u201d said David Madden, president of entertainment at Fox. \u201cHaving said that, there are a lot of shows out there, a lot of material competing for people\u2019s attention. And where you have a title that people recognize, value and appreciate, that\u2019s something we want to take advantage of.\u201dName-brand programs can excite existing fan bases, reduce marketing costs and appeal to an increasingly important international market. (The French, it turns out, are big fans of \u201cPrison Break,\u201d Mr. Madden said.)But there are no guarantees. Fox\u2019s revival of \u201cThe X-Files\u201d was among this season\u2019s best-rated new shows, but the network canceled \u201cMinority Report,\u201d based on the Tom Cruise sci-fi movie, after dismal ratings. ABC is axing its revival of \u201cThe Muppets,\u201d and on Monday, CBS said it was canceling the low-rated \u201cRush Hour.\u201d\u201cIt is irresistible in a world that has 60 or 80 makers of original programming to have something that has pre-existing awareness,\u201d said Mr. Nevins of Showtime. \u201cStill, at the end of the day, it\u2019s going to rise and fall based on its quality.\u201dAnd not all revivals are created equal. Mr. Nevins said he pursued a new \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d only because Mr. Lynch agreed to participate. (\u201cWe\u2019ve persuaded the original creators to complete their mission,\u201d he said.) David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson signed on for \u201cThe X-Files,\u201d but Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker were missing from \u201cRush Hour.\u201dOther titles will be reimagined, even if the name initially helped open doors. Sarah Aubrey, who oversees programming at TNT, described the excitement when M. Night Shyamalan approached the network about revamping \u201cTales From the Crypt,\u201d the kitschy HBO horror series. But the plan is for a new twist on the cackling Cryptkeeper character, and not a shot-by-shot remake.\u201cWe like the idea of it, signifying tone,\u201d Ms. Aubrey said of the title. \u201cIt put out the right kind of thematic indicator of what we were going for in the horror space.\u201dMTV has a similar strategy for \u201cUnplugged,\u201d which returns as the channel pivots back to its music video roots. The new \u201cUnplugged\u201d is meant to appeal to Generation Xers and millennials alike. But \u201cit will not be carpets and candles,\u201d said Erik Flannigan, the channel\u2019s head of music programming, referring to the scenery that distinguished \u201cUnplugged\u201d concerts by \u201990s staples like Nirvana and 10,000 Maniacs.\u201cI don\u2019t think we need to trade on the nostalgia of what \u2018Unplugged\u2019 meant for me and you if you witnessed it the first time,\u201d Mr. Flannigan said. \u201cIt really is a brand-new idea to somebody who is 22 years old.\u201dIn part, the move toward all these reboots is a product of \u2014 and hedge against \u2014 the rise of Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Video, where cord-cutting viewers are rediscovering shows whose syndication days on cable and broadcast networks are long over. In another era, shows like \u201cThe X-Files\u201d would persist only in private DVD collections; now, viewers bored with the latest network offerings are binging on them.For networks that own their old shows, the financial allure of a remake is even greater. \u201cIt refreshes and regenerates the library,\u201d said Peter Rice, chairman of Fox Networks Group, noting that old episodes become newly valuable domestically and overseas.A social anthropologist might wonder if television\u2019s nostalgia craze can be attributed to viewers who are seeking out the familiar in a disruptive, uneasy age (See Trump, Donald J.). But when that question was posed to Martin Kaplan, director of the Norman Lear Center for media and society at the University of Southern California, he laughed.\u201cI would not discount the commercial motivations,\u201d Mr. Kaplan, a screenwriter and former studio executive, said dryly.\u201cMacGyver is a name that\u2019s in the culture,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you see that, you know what you\u2019re getting, as opposed to some name that means nothing.\u201d That\u2019s why, he added, viewers often encounter \u201cendless sequels to things that seem to have come out only 20 minutes ago.\u201dThe nostalgia, he noted, may be on the studios\u2019 end, rather than viewers\u2019. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing as helpful to a programmer as a title or a show that has brand equity already built into it,\u201d he said.So is there anything Mr. Kaplan would like to see rebooted?\u201c\u2018College Bowl,\u2019\u201d he replied. \u201cIt\u2019s a higher-end version of \u2018Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader?\u2019\u201dBrooks Barnes contributed reporting from Los Angeles.Advertisement"}

Mr. Temer seems to be embracing a more conservative disposition for his government as well, with the country\u2019s business establishment pressuring him to privatize state-controlled companies and cut public spending.To many of Mr. Temer\u2019s critics, the shift is perhaps most evident in the role of women in his and Ms. Rousseff\u2019s administrations.The contrasts could not be more glaring. Ms. Rousseff, 68, was a former operative in an urban guerrilla group. She was tortured during the military dictatorship and eventually rose to lead the board of the national oil company before becoming Brazil\u2019s first female president.Until recently, relatively few Brazilians had even heard of Mr. Temer. When they did, it often involved references to his wife, Marcela Temer, 32, a former beauty pageant contestant who is 43 years younger than he is. They met when she was just 18.The magazine did not mention the tattoo on the nape of Ms. Temer\u2019s neck featuring her husband\u2019s name, but the message was clear: Mr. Temer, a law professor and career politician, embodies a more conservative approach than Ms. Rousseff in the corridors of power and in his own home.Then there is the issue of race. After a long stretch in which Brazil pressed ahead with affirmative action policies, Mr. Temer\u2019s critics point out the lack of Afro-Brazilians in his cabinet, especially when nearly 51 percent of Brazilians define themselves as black or mixed race, according to the 2010 census.In a speech to the nation on Thursday, Mr. Temer said he would seek to soothe tensions in Brazil, a nation polarized by the impeachment trial of Ms. Rousseff. She is accused of manipulating the federal budget to hide yawning deficits, a budgetary sleight of hand that her critics say helped her get re-elected in 2014.\u201cIt\u2019s urgent to seek the unity of Brazil,\u201d Mr. Temer said during a ceremony introducing his ministers. \u201cWe urgently need a government of national salvation.\u201dThe new president\u2019s supporters point out that he considered a couple of women for cabinet-level posts, including Renata Abreu, 34, a lawmaker, to oversee human rights policies.But that effort, along with other test balloons, did not prosper. First, it became widely known that Ms. Abreu had voted in favor of legislation to make it difficult for women who are raped to get abortions. Then Mr. Temer opted to fold the human rights post into the Ministry of Justice, making it a second-tier appointment.Mr. Temer\u2019s offer of the science ministry to Marcos Pereira, an evangelical pastor who does not believe in evolution, also fizzled. He named Mr. Pereira trade minister instead. Then, to the dismay of leaders in Brazil\u2019s scientific community, Mr. Temer merged the ministries of science and communications.Like many of Brazil\u2019s political leaders, Mr. Temer has legal problems of his own. He was recently found guilty of violating campaign finance limits, a conviction that could make him ineligible to run for office for eight years, leaving a cloud of scandal that has raised concerns about his capacity to govern with a strong mandate.\u201cTemer faces the fundamental problem of legitimacy,\u201d said Michael Shifter, the president of Inter-American Dialogue, a policy group in Washington. \u201cHe did not become president as a result of a popular vote, but rather because of a controversial impeachment process.\u201dBut some argue, in Mr. Temer\u2019s favor, that his cabinet includes officials who held important posts when Ms. Rousseff\u2019s leftist Workers\u2019 Party was in control. Henrique Meirelles, a banker who is the new finance minister, served as central bank president for eight years during the government of Ms. Rousseff\u2019s predecessor and mentor, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, from 2003 through 2010.During that time, Brazil\u2019s government gained the respect of investors as incomes soared during a commodities boom. Prominent figures in Brazil\u2019s financial markets hope that Mr. Meirelles can rebuild that credibility.The rancor around the ouster of Ms. Rousseff, who will go on trial in the Senate, was evident Thursday on the streets of Bras\u00edlia, the capital. Dozens of women chained themselves to barriers surrounding the presidential palace, shouting slogans in support of Ms. Rousseff and expressing alarm about Mr. Temer\u2019s top advisers.Maria Herm\u00ednia Tavares de Almeida, a political scientist at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, said that the last time a Brazilian cabinet did not have any women was in the early 1980s, during the military dictatorship that ruled from 1964 to 1985.Until Mr. Temer\u2019s rise to power on Thursday, she said, \u201call the democratic governments have had women.\u201dVinod Sreeharsha contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro, and Paula Moura from Bras\u00edlia.videovideoAdvertisement"}

Construction cranes claw the sky. Trucks hauling steel or concrete rubble shake the streets. Amazon, the giant online retailer, is building out its headquarters campus in every direction as it and other tech companies, in a scramble for real estate and highly educated talent, reshape the city and its work force.But as tens of thousands of newcomers and longtime residents are finding, the allure of the tech economy comes with big risks and dangers, too, in the rapidly climbing housing and rent prices that have shocked them. The boom has brought with it a crisis of homelessness that the mayor has declared an emergency.\u201cWe knew it was going to be expensive,\u201d said Mary Delp, who arrived here last month with her partner, J.D. Cox, and her extended family, after a job loss and then an eviction in Las Vegas. They considered and rejected the idea of a move to Texas. Seattle, Ms. Delp said, felt like the place with the rawest, roaring economic boom.But the costs of moving and rent \u201cwere more than we expected,\u201d she said, \u201cso we ended up homeless.\u201dThey and their two children are settling for now into the Guest Rooms, a former TraveLodge hotel owned by Amazon, which offered it last month to a local nonprofit group called Mary\u2019s Place to run as a 200-bed shelter for families. The old hotel is now one of Seattle\u2019s largest but most temporary of homeless refuges \u2014 doomed to destruction next year as Amazon continues to build.\u201cWe can make it work here,\u201d Ms. Delp said with crisp resolve, sitting in a brightly painted recreation room, as her children, Krystallynn, 7, and Elijah, 6, played nearby. \u201cThere are job signs everywhere you look out there.\u201dMs. Delp, 26, is pregnant, due in September. She spoke vividly of the trip north, full of hopes and plans but also pain, in condensing the contents of a three-bedroom house into her father\u2019s van and a small U-Haul trailer pulled behind.\u201cMy dad would sleep in the driver\u2019s seat, and at first we were sleeping in the middle seat, and the kids had the back. But then it got too uncomfortable for me to sleep, being pregnant sitting up and everything, so we took over the back and the kids would sleep in the middle seat. My dad was still in the front seat. He raised me as a single father, so I\u2019ve got to make sure he\u2019s O.K. He never gave up on me.\u201dJoe Dopp, 39, a former roofer and surgical scrub tech, took his family of five to Seattle this year from a small town on Washington\u2019s Pacific coast where second homes and tourism defined the economy, and it was even harder, he said, to earn a decent wage and afford a home. He spoke fast, sitting on a mattress in the family\u2019s room, words tumbling out.\u201cI made $12 an hour. For two years, I didn\u2019t get a raise. I asked for one. I was told no, when other people had gotten them. I still don\u2019t understand that. I did everything I was supposed to do, but that\u2019s one of the main reasons I said, well, if we\u2019re out, we can go to Seattle or somewhere else and actually have an opportunity.\u201d The tech boom, Mr. Dopp said, is clearly making some people very rich, but that does not bother him a bit, because it is also creating construction jobs that he is qualified for and ready to take. \u201cI never got a job from a poor man in my life,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t mind people making their money.\u201dChelsie Brown, 32, Mr. Dopp\u2019s partner, talked about the things left behind.\u201cWhen we had an apartment, we could take showers, cook dinner whenever you wanted to, could eat whenever we wanted to, could have groceries in the house, we had furniture, beds to lay in, blankets \u2013 we had security, you know. We actually had stuff that we loved.\u201dOn the road, it was all so different.\u201cI did a lot of meal planning: This is what we\u2019re having. But when it came down to meats, I would have to get it that day because refrigeration was nonexistent. Anything we had, foodwise, we had to put it in our car.\u201dThere were stories of hope and light. Laura Long\u2019s son, Gio\u2019moni Caro, 6, has multiple disabilities. He has had five heart operations already. She and her partner, Angel Caro, 34, a former locksmith, have moved repeatedly and left jobs behind to give him the care he needs. They came here so he could be treated at Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital, which anchors a corner of the city\u2019s biotech corridor and recently expanded its cardiac specialty care.\u201cIt\u2019s just been a struggle,\u201d Ms. Long said. \u201cAs soon as you start climbing the stairs, boom! \u2014 another medical issue happens, another hospital stay, another something you can\u2019t overcome. That last step that gets us over the top, it just keeps getting knocked back down.\u201dTyrus Gilbertson, 39, came to Seattle last fall to take care of his two children, ages 7 and 14, after their mother vanished. He had been involved in his children\u2019s lives, he said, living in a city half an hour north. But the crash course as a single father has pushed him to places he never imagined.\u201cI was a wrestler in high school, and my coach was always, like, \u2018Never give up,\u2019 so I\u2019ve always been a fighter, always been. Quitting is not in my vocabulary.\u201dHe sat with his palms flat on the table, soft-spoken but resolute in talking about how he has made ends meet. He plans to enroll in a welding course this fall.\u201cI even panhandled a couple of times. I\u2019ve always been a shy person so panhandling was like the worst thing in the world for me to do. I hope I\u2019ll never have to do that again.\u201d Joe Dopp and Chelsie Brown said being homeless can\u2019t help but make you more empathetic.\u201cYou recognize the things that other people have gone through \u2014 you see the world through other people\u2019s eyes a little bit,\u201d Mr. Dopp said.\u201cEven still, right now,\u201d Ms. Brown replied, \u201cyou can\u2019t judge a book by its cover until you read it. That\u2019s what I look at it as. You can\u2019t judge people, just because they\u2019re sitting in the street.\u201dMr. Dopp: \u201cYou don\u2019t know their story at all.\u201dMs. Brown: \u201cNo, you don\u2019t know their story.\u201dAs they spoke, near sunset, the Guest Rooms was quieting for the night \u2014 doors closing, common room lights clicking out \u2014 sheltering the people within.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Drones Pique the Interest of Entrepreneurs", "Date": "2016-05-25", "News": "Supported byOver the last few years, drones have gone from being a contentious military tool for airstrikes to a far more mundane magnet for aerial hobbyists.But as drones move into the mainstream, entrepreneurs are finding ways to harness the technology as the core of their business ideas.Ryan Jenson showed its business potential in a demonstration for his new venture, HoneyComb. His idea was to use drones to scout fields for irrigation and pest problems. If not caught early, such problems can cost farmers thousands of dollars an acre.Nevertheless, farmers were left scratching their heads. Mr. Jenson said they asked him: \u201cWhy do we need those? And if we do, how can we afford them?\u201dHe and his two co-founders at HoneyComb built a rough prototype. On a sunny day in August 2013, they gathered 50 growers at Gold Dust Farms, a 9,000-acre farm in southern Oregon that specializes in potatoes.As the drone soared in the sky above, the growers watched a screen nearby that showed a view from the drone\u2019s video camera of the fields below. Once the drone returned, they saw photographs it had taken on its trip.\u201cA big light bulb lit up,\u201d said Mr. Jenson, 30, who had an interest in aerospace and engineering at a young age. He took college classes at age 14 and began working for NASA at 18. \u201cWhen they realized, \u2018You\u2019re telling me I can see every square inch of my farm whenever I want?\u2019 They were sold.\u201dOne recent convert to HoneyComb\u2019s AgDrone found an irrigation leak, saving him nearly $100,000 in crop loss. Another grower was able to detect the onset of blight in his potatoes early enough to apply the needed fungicide in time to save the crop.The company, based in Wilsonville, Ore., now has 16 employees and has raised $2 million in financing.HoneyComb is part of a new wave of commercial drone start-ups. Often described as \u201cdrone services,\u201d these companies are one-stop shops, providing both the drones to collect the data and the software to analyze it afterward.\u201cFrom catastrophe response to news-gathering to construction-site monitoring, commercial drones represent one of the fastest-growing sectors in technology,\u201d said Lisa Ellman, a partner and Washington-based co-chairwoman of the unmanned aircraft systems practice at the law firm Hogan Lovells.While the opportunity looms large, starting a new business centered on drones (or unmanned aircraft systems, as they are officially known) has its challenges, not least of which are laws that seem to be a moving target. Many of these start-ups are small, and venture financing has been hard to secure.\u201cThe regulations have made it very difficult for many small businesses to pull themselves up from the bootstraps,\u201d says Jeffrey J. Antonelli, a Chicago lawyer whose legal practice focuses on drones.Most have gone to larger companies. Companies in photography, film and real estate have received the largest share of these permits.The biggest hurdle, most small businesses say, is that once they have the drone permit, they still need someone with a manned vehicle license \u2014 like an airplane or helicopter pilot \u2014 to fly it.One significant potential change would be to drop the requirement for a manned vehicle license. Instead, drone pilot certification would resemble getting a driver\u2019s license at the department of motor vehicles, a process that could be completed in weeks rather than months.Identified Technologies recently brought on two employees who used to work with commercial airlines, with the aim of helping clients get the F.A.A. exemption, find pilots, get drone insurance and complete paperwork.\u201cPeople don\u2019t realize how much has to be done before and after a flight to remain compliant,\u201d said the company\u2019s founder, Dick Zhang. \u201cWe take care of everything so clients don\u2019t have to.\u201dAs the final barriers to entry come down, many anticipate a flood of new businesses. \u201cWhen cellphones were first invented, we didn\u2019t envision all the ways we would use them,\u201d said Ms. Ellman of Hogan Lovells. \u201cDrones are very similar.\u201dMost important, hobbyists could help public perception of the industry\u2019s potential, said Mr. Jenson of HoneyComb.\u201cPeople don\u2019t yet automatically think of drones as commercial tools,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re getting closer.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The company made more money by charging retailers to use its platforms, which connect vendors small and large with China\u2019s growing ranks of connected consumers.But the figures, covering the fourth quarter of the company\u2019s fiscal year, also showed stalling growth in the volume of sales over its platforms. Gross merchandise volume, a closely watched measure of the transactions on the company\u2019s websites, grew 24 percent compared with the same period a year earlier, about the same pace in the prior quarter.\u201cChinese consumers, with their healthy balance sheets and ability to spend, will propel China\u2019s shift from an export- and investment-led economy to a consumption-driven economy,\u201d Mr. Tsai said.For American investors, Alibaba has become a proxy for the Chinese economy. Though a sizable portion of China\u2019s retail sales take place on Alibaba\u2019s marketplace websites \u2014 Chinese consumers spent almost $500 billion on Alibaba last year \u2014 the company\u2019s sales growth outperformed the rise in transactions on its site.The results also showed the growing toll that Alibaba\u2019s forays into hypercompetitive areas outside its core business are taking on its finances. It said that its Koubei business, which allows Chinese consumers to order food and other items and services on their smartphones, had generated $135 million in losses for its parent company in the quarter.In his post, Mr. Tsai pointed to the patience involved in creating the company\u2019s Taobao marketplace, now the major sales driver of the company. He said the company would take a similar long-term view and continue spending on new businesses it thinks can help it grow.Still, Alibaba has made progress making more money from its main business.Unlike Amazon.com in the United States, which keeps its own inventory and sells directly to customers, Alibaba serves as a middleman and makes money from getting vendors on its services to buy advertising and other services. Although the amount spent on Alibaba\u2019s marketplaces has grown about 20 percent this quarter and last, its revenue from ads and commissions on those sites has grown 30 percent or more. In the longer term, investors expect those numbers to align more closely, meaning slower sales growth.Still, Chi Tsang, an HSBC analyst in Hong Kong, pointed to its continued strong cash position and dominance in online shopping as advantages. \u201cPeople don\u2019t think about how much cash this company generates,\u201d he said.Alibaba said on Thursday that sales rose 39 percent in the fourth quarter, to $3.75 billion. Gross merchandise volume rose 24 percent, to $115 billion. Its profit rose more than 80 percent, to $832 million. Minus one-time items, the company posted a profit of 3.02 renminbi, or 46 cents, a share, lower than the 3.60 renminbi a share that analysts had expected.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Regeneron Pharmaceuticals to Sponsor Science Talent Search", "Date": "2016-05-26", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A long-running scholastic science and math competition has a new champion, more money and a splashy kickoff with a famous scientist.On Thursday, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, a biotechnology company based in Tarrytown, N.Y., will announce that it is taking over sponsorship of the Science Talent Search with a 10-year, $100 million commitment to the high school competition.The new sponsors will be announced in New York at the American Museum of Natural History by Neil deGrasse Tyson, the celebrity astrophysicist who is director of the museum\u2019s Hayden Planetarium.Sponsorship of the prize increasingly reflects the state of American business as it relates to education in so-called STEM subjects, or science, technology, engineering and mathematics.The contest, started during World War II, counts among its finalists several Nobel Prize winners, as well as university professors, popular science authors and business executives.Westinghouse Electric \u2014 a pioneer in areas including electrification, nuclear power, commercial radio and home appliances \u2014 initially sponsored the competition. Westinghouse came to ruin over bad loans from its credit division, and Intel, riding high on the personal computer and Internet booms, took over sponsorship in 1998.Like many older companies in computer tech, Intel is now struggling with the transition from traditional software and PCs to a future of cloud computing and mobile devices. In April, Intel announced that it was laying off 12,000 people, and would concentrate more on making chips for big cloud-computing companies like Amazon and Google.Even with its troubles, the decision by Intel\u2019s chief executive, Brian M. Krzanich, to drop a $6 million prize when Intel still had net income of $2 billion in the last quarter dismayed many inside the company. Craig R. Barrett, a former Intel chief executive, sits on the board of trustees for the Society for Science & the Public, which administers the prize.\u201cI don\u2019t overinterpret facts, but I\u2019m happy to observe them,\u201d Dr. Tyson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign of the times and a statement about the future that a computer company doesn\u2019t see this as important, and a biotech company, in an industry on the eve of big breakthroughs, does.\u201dHe added, \u201cIt\u2019s still a surprise why a company would do this to its branding.\u201dStock in Regeneron, which makes drugs that treat ailments like cardiovascular disease and degeneration of the eye, has risen sixfold in the last five years. Intel has gained 35 percent, about half as much as the tech-heavy Nasdaq.In addition to increasing the top prize money to $250,000 from $150,000 and doubling awards to the top 300 contestants and their schools to $2,000 each, Regeneron will spend $30 million in outreach to potential contestants in underserved areas, paying for things like mentoring and help with writing applications and participating in contests.\u201cThis should be the best reality show in the world \u2014 we need these kinds of kids to save the planet,\u201d said George D. Yancopoulos, Regeneron\u2019s founding scientist and president of its laboratory division. \u201cThe world has challenges like cancer, the Zika virus and global warming. We need to change who our heroes are.\u201dDr. Tyson attended the prestigious Bronx High School of Science with Dr. Yancopoulos, who in 1976 placed fourth in the contest for his experiment on cellular regeneration in a type of protozoa.\u201cI didn\u2019t compete, but I remember just being in the company of people who were creating an atmosphere of learning and achievement,\u201d Dr. Tyson said. Leonard S. Schleifer, Regeneron\u2019s founder and chief executive, participated in the 1970 contest.The Science Talent Search begins with about 1,800 applicants, a number that has held steady for a decade. Their projects are narrowed down to 300. Eventually 40 finalists go to Washington for several days, where they meet leaders in government and science and have their projects judged.Rosalind L. Hudnell, an Intel vice president and president of the company\u2019s charity, Intel Foundation, congratulated the Society for Science & the Public in a statement.Regeneron stood out, she said, for \u201ca tremendous contribution to get more students to care and compete.\u201d In addition to raising the money and paying for mentors, Regeneron will also support the creation and publication of science news to 4,000 high schools.Dr. Yancopoulos, a child of immigrants, said having the Westinghouse contest around was an important reason he became a university professor, and then a business scientist.\u201cMuch in life, where you go and what you do, is about dreams and role models,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I got to Bronx Science, I wanted to play football for Notre Dame, but then in the hallways as a freshman I\u2019d see people pointing out somebody and whispering, \u2018He\u2019s a Westinghouse winner.\u2019 My world changed.\u201dSince that time, he said, elite schools like Bronx Science have done well enough in STEM, but in general local schools have found it increasingly hard to find the funds and the mentorship to make those kinds of inspirational moments possible.Even before taking over the prize, Dr. Yancopoulos said, Regeneron has sponsored about 200 high schools in local science competitions, a precursor to the national Science Talent Search.\u201cI don\u2019t want the best minds in this country to be hedge fund managers,\u201d he said. \u201cI want them to be scientists and engineers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alphabet Chairman Testifies in Oracle Suit Against Google", "Date": "2016-05-10", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Eric E. Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, may have unique insight into the multibillion-dollar lawsuit filed against his company by another Silicon Valley heavyweight, Oracle Corporation.Mr. Schmidt, in an earlier job, was in charge of the programming language that Oracle claims Google misused years later when it created software called Android, which is now the most popular operating system in the world.On Tuesday, Mr. Schmidt was the first witness in the latest round of a lawsuit Oracle first filed against Google nearly six years ago.The outcome of the trial, expected in early June after testimony by some of the most famous people in technology, could have industrywide implications for software development.Oracle initially sought $8.8 billion, but is expected to raise that to $9.4 billion, based on recent estimates of how much profit Google has made from Android, which a lawyer for Oracle put at $21 billion since a working version of Android made its debut in 2008.About three billion Android smartphones have been activated in that time.At issue in the Federal District Court for Northern California is how freely someone might use Java, a popular software language that Oracle acquired when it bought Sun Microsystems for $7.4 billion in 2009. Much of Java is open source, meaning anyone may use it, but some aspects require obtaining a license.Some 11,000 lines of Java code inside Android were taken without paying a copyright fee, Oracle argues.\u201cThis involves fundamental principles of fairness and business conduct,\u201d Peter Bicks, a lawyer with Orrick, Herrington, & Sutcliffe, said in his opening statement for Oracle. \u201cThey knew they needed a license.\u201dGoogle counters that the software, just 0.08 percent of all the software in Android but critical for its operation, was legitimately obtained and used in ways that free it from paying fees.\u201cOur view was that Android was a completely different approach\u201d to building a smartphone, Mr. Schmidt said.Google originally tried to work with Sun on Android, he said, but those talks broke down because Google would not be able to control the final product. Mr. Schmidt, who formerly was in charge of Java at Sun, said his expertise informed how Google could use Java.The trial, including a possible penalty phase, is expected to end by June 10. The payoff could be Oracle\u2019s biggest victory from buying Sun. Some parts of Sun, like its computer hardware, have lost Oracle money.Mr. Bicks noted that a version of Android is used in Amazon\u2019s Kindle reader, raising the prospect that Oracle will pursue payments from more companies that use Android. Deborah Hellinger, a spokeswoman for Oracle, declined to comment on what Oracle might do.Even if it wins, Oracle is unlikely to see any money for a long time. The expected appeals from whichever side loses would also slow any changes in corporate policies on open source, copyrights and licensing.Oracle first sued Google in 2010. That case, over patents and copyrights, featured contentious testimony by Lawrence J. Ellison, Oracle\u2019s founder and then chief executive, and Larry Page, the founder and chief executive of Google.It was decided largely in favor of Google in 2012, but then in 2014 an appeals court found that certain parts of Java were protected by copyright. Last year the Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of that decision, which sent the case back for this new trial.While the clock in Judge William Alsup\u2019s court is stuck at 6:08, the latest phase of the long trial process showed signs of how much the world has changed since the first trial began. This one is expected to end by June 10.Mr. Ellison, now Oracle\u2019s executive chairman, may appear in this trial on video. Safra Catz, Oracle\u2019s co-chief executive, is expected to appear. Mr. Page may also testify, along with Andy Rubin, who developed Android for Google and now works in robotics and artificial intelligence.The parts of Java that Oracle wants to be paid for are the Application Programmer Interfaces, or A.P.I.s, which are the instruction sets that enable one computer to share the data and behavior of another. They have become critically important as computing moves to smartphones, apps and the cloud, because these uses frequently involve using elements from several computers.Google argued that A.P.I.s are tools used by programmers, and that its use of them constitutes \u201cfair use,\u201d a legal standard that permits use of copyrighted material. It also said its use of Java transformed it from something used in computers to something used in smartphones, which could also justify fair use.Advertisement"}

In 2010, she interviewed Justin Bieber, an up-and-coming teenage musician who owed part of his celebrity to the social media platform. At the end of their chat, Mr. Bieber looked appraisingly at his interviewer: \u201cYou\u2019re adorable.\u201dMs. Ezarik said she\u2019s not worried about what superstardom has done to him.Create an ironclad character.When you meet Ms. Ezarik in person, it is not easy to spot the lines between her and iJustine.

Her mood shifted to downbeat only briefly, when I asked about her problems with Internet stalking and the nasty nature of some online comments.You will be harassed. Yes, even if you are nice to everyone, as iJustine generally is, there can be trouble. Ms. Ezarik said that she and her fellow YouTube personalities don\u2019t like to talk about the problems they\u2019ve had with online harassment, but said most people in the community have dealt with this problem at some point.

Nor does she have a go-to trick to disconnect. \u201cI was going to say video games, but then I\u2019m still in front of a screen.\u201dShe said that the lack of face-to-face interaction can get tough.\u201cThe biggest obstacle is staying inspired and motivated to keep doing it,\u201d she said.Numbers aren\u2019t everything.\u201cThe front-facing numbers that people see don\u2019t correlate to what you\u2019re doing in the grand scheme of things,\u201d Ms. Ezarik said.Seriously. Numbers mean nothing.* Ms. Ezarik won\u2019t say how much money she\u2019s made over the years, if the income has allowed her to buy a house, if she\u2019s a millionaire or how long she could survive if she walked away from it all tomorrow.\u201cI don\u2019t actually ever look,\u201d she said of her bank accounts. \u201cThat\u2019s what the accountants are for; that\u2019s what the investing is for.\u201d* Numbers obviously mean something, but it\u2019s hard to estimate without her help or data from YouTube. Follow your dreams! Or maybe not. Or do! What advice would she give to aspiring iJustines? \u201cI would probably say maybe don\u2019t quit your job right away.\u201dShe added: \u201cBut heck, you know what, maybe quit your job. Because maybe that would be the motivation that you need.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Start-Ups Embrace Arbitration to Settle Workplace Disputes", "Date": "2016-05-14", "News": "Supported by\u201cIt was like walking onto a set of a movie,\u201d Ms. Zoumer said.But shortly after she became an associate community manager in WeWork\u2019s office in Berkeley, Calif., reality set in. Ms. Zoumer said she was feeling pinched because her annual salary was only $42,000, a sum that, on some weeks, left her without money to ride the subway.She said she thought many of her duties \u2014 leading tours for prospective tenants, tidying up, answering phones and changing the kegs \u2014 were more suited to an hourly wage with a possibility for overtime.Ms. Zoumer tried to enlist colleagues to file what she hoped would be a class-action lawsuit to fight for overtime pay. But the company had instituted a policy that could force employees to ultimately resolve disputes through arbitration instead of the courts, which essentially shut down Ms. Zoumer\u2019s lawsuit, since arbitration bars individuals from joining in a class action.When Ms. Zoumer refused to sign the new policy, she was fired.Uber and Lyft, the ride-hailing services, make their drivers sign an arbitration clause. Square, the mobile payment processor, also requires that employees agree to bring disputes to arbitration. In advice to start-ups, Brotman Law, a tax firm in San Diego, promotes the benefits of arbitration for \u201ccompanies doing business over the Internet,\u201d emphasizing that it \u201ccan save significant costs.\u201dAmazon and Google also use arbitration to resolve disputes with customers.Far from burying its arbitration clause in its employment contracts, WeWork is proud of its policy. The company\u2019s top executives said they thought that by adopting an arbitration clause as part of a broader dispute resolution program, they were staying true to their principles, which prize all levels of employees as members of a single community. WeWork says its employees are eligible for bonuses and equity in the company in addition to their salaries.\u201cWe want to show the world that this works,\u201d Jennifer Berrent, WeWork\u2019s general counsel and chief culture officer, a recently created position, said of the dispute resolution program.For start-ups \u2014 many of which began in Silicon Valley \u2014 the clauses can seem to conflict with professed goals of upending business as usual and being open with employees. Arbitration, by its very nature, is a secretive process that is often lopsided in favor of the employer. That secrecy, federal labor officials said, can allow widespread problems to persist because the process bars employees from sharing their experiences with others who might be in similar positions.\u201cThey give their young workers Ping-Pong tables and take away their constitutional rights,\u201d said Cliff Palefsky, an employment and civil rights lawyer in San Francisco.As Silicon Valley companies grow from small start-ups into major employers, their labor practices are coming into focus. Despite the popular image that the industry is predominantly made up of nerdy millionaires, many of these growing companies depend increasingly on lower-paid employees.And with some technology companies now working harder to raise money, there are growing pressures on these companies from investors to cut costs \u2014 pressures that can fall disproportionately on the workers at the lower rungs.At WeWork, Ms. Berrent said, arbitration is part of a multistep process to resolve disputes. The company adopted the policy after months of discussion about how to deal most fairly with complaints.At the outset of the process, WeWork requires employees to raise any complaints with their managers. If that does not work, the employee and WeWork must try mediation. Only if that fails does the issue go before an arbitrator, whose decision is binding.Ms. Berrent said this process was in keeping with the company\u2019s values, settling problems \u201cthrough open collaboration\u201d rather than the courts. She confirmed that Ms. Zoumer was fired for not signing the arbitration clause.She said the employees who hold the job that Ms. Zoumer used to have were the \u201csoul\u201d of the company and its \u201cbrand ambassadors.\u201d She said they performed tasks that were far from menial and were not suited to an hourly wage.Ms. Berrent also notes that while lawsuits are both costly for the employee and confrontational, the company pays for arbitration no matter who wins.At large corporations, many employees have come to expect the clauses as standard. But those working at smaller firms that claimed to treat their employees like family tend to be surprised when they collide with one.Mr. Ziober had already been at the company for several months when he was asked to sign the arbitration policy in January 2011. He did so without a second thought.It was a decision he would regret. In the fall of 2012, he informed BLB Resources that he was being deployed to Afghanistan. On his last day, the company threw him a farewell party, complete with a cake shaped like an American flag.\u201cI was on Cloud 9,\u201d Mr. Ziober said, recalling how he phoned his family to tell them about the party.That afternoon, as Mr. Ziober said he was packing up his cubicle, he was called into the human resources office and was \u201csummarily\u201d fired, according to his legal appeal.The reason for his termination, the company said, was that he was not being included in a federal contract that the company was applying for.In a statement, BLB said the decision not to include Mr. Ziober in the contract occurred months before he informed the company that he was being deployed. The statement added that BLB had offered to allow Mr. Ziober to work on the remainder of his existing contract if he returned in time from his deployment.Mr. Ziober\u2019s lawyer, Peter Romer-Friedman, has appealed the case, arguing that Userra preserves the rights of service members to go to court.BLB said in a statement that \u201cthe company is extremely disappointed about Mr. Ziober\u2019s allegations and denies them wholeheartedly.\u201dWith their appeal, Mr. Ziober has waded into an intense battle playing out across the country. In Washington, a group of bipartisan lawmakers introduced a bill in 2014 that would exempt service members from having to take claims of wrongful auto repossession or improper debt collection to arbitration. An almost identical bill was quashed after intense lobbying by big banks and credit card companies, never making it out of committee. A bill in California that would have prevented companies from requiring employees to sign arbitration clauses suffered a similar fate when Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed it last year.The legislative skirmishes point to just how valuable arbitration has become to companies and just how far they will go to defend it.Despite WeWork\u2019s arbitration requirement, Ms. Zoumer decided to sue the company on her own, hoping she would prevail in overturning the clause. Ms. Zoumer\u2019s lawyer, Ramsey Hanafi, filed her case in December over wrongful termination and unfair labor practices, and Boies, Schiller & Flexner, a top corporate defense firm, is representing WeWork.Ms. Zoumer, 31, said she knew she was taking a risk when she challenged WeWork over arbitration. She told the company she needed at least a week to review the policy before deciding whether to sign it. In an email to colleagues, she encouraged them to do the same, citing The Times\u2019s investigation into arbitration.Ms. Berrent said Ms. Zoumer was the only employee who refused to sign other than two employees who had planned to leave the company anyway. Ultimately, no other employees joined Ms. Zoumer\u2019s lawsuit.\u201cYounger people don\u2019t want to pick fights, but we are losing our rights,\u201d Ms. Zoumer said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Walmart Outperforms Estimates, but Online Retail Lags", "Date": "2016-05-19", "News": "Supported byOne percent growth may not seem like a lot \u2014 unless you\u2019re the world\u2019s largest retailer.Walmart reported on Thursday that its quarterly revenue had risen 0.9 percent, exceeding analysts\u2019 forecasts and signaling that its strategies to combat a tough retail environment were working. The results were particularly striking after dismal earnings reports by several retail chains last week, and Walmart\u2019s shares shot up nearly 10 percent.Investments in everything from employee wages to store layouts had led to higher customer satisfaction, the company said. Shoppers filled more prescriptions, purchased more over-the-counter products and showed more of an appetite for apparel and other general merchandise.\u201cWe\u2019re improving our stores, adding critical capabilities and deepening relationships with customers,\u201d Doug McMillon, Walmart\u2019s president and chief executive, said in a call with reporters on Thursday.Department stores including Macy\u2019s, Nordstrom and Kohl\u2019s reported that quarterly sales fell at stores open longer than a year. But Walmart appears to have benefited from Americans\u2019 increased reliance on low-cost or discount stores. Off-price retailers like Ross and the TJX Companies \u2014 which operates T. J. Maxx and Marshalls \u2014 reported sales increases last year.\u201cPeople are definitely hunting for value, and I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing,\u201d said Charlie O\u2019Shea, the lead retail analyst for Moody\u2019s. \u201cEspecially in the apparel sector.\u201dBut doubts persist about whether Walmart is growing fast enough in one increasingly important area: online.\u201cFor a company of its size, Walmart underperforms in e-commerce,\u201d said Neil Saunders, a retail analyst for Conlumino.Percentage growth can be misleading. Walmart\u2019s sales increase translates to more than a billion dollars in revenue, essentially the same as adding the entire businesses of Burger King and Tim Hortons. Walmart does not break out a quarterly figure for online sales, but said its e-commerce business had grown 7 percent in the last quarter.Walmart has been investing heavily to increase that business, which, like every other retailer\u2019s, continues to get clobbered by Amazon. Some analysts said that given Walmart\u2019s vast resources, its web business should be growing faster, and Mr. McMillon acknowledged on Thursday that its growth rate was \u201ctoo slow.\u201d\u201cThe U.S. number is better than the global number, but neither is as high as we\u2019d like,\u201d he said.Amazon does much more business than Walmart.com, Mr. Saunders said, and yet it still reports double-digit growth. Amazon reported that net product sales rose 13 percent, to $79.3 billion in 2015, while Walmart reported that global annual e-commerce revenue had risen 12 percent to $13.7 billion in its latest fiscal year.\u201cOther retailers are tackling the problems and making headway much better,\u201d said Bernie Sosnick, a retail analyst with Madison Global Partners. \u201cWalmart has plowed so much capital in this that it should be doing as well or better than other retailers.\u201dBut Mr. O\u2019Shea of Moody\u2019s argues that comparing Walmart.com and Amazon is like comparing \u201capples to watermelons.\u201d\u201cIf Amazon were to get into brick-and-mortar, would it be fair to compare Amazon\u2019s brick-and-mortar business to Walmart\u2019s brick-and-mortar business?\u201d he said. \u201cProbably not, and we\u2019re doing the reverse to that here.\u201dWalmart\u2019s online reinvention, Mr. O\u2019Shea pointed out, has just begun. The company has been aggressively tackling its online business in the last few months, and has committed to investing heavily in a number of areas, including technology.The company recently announced plans to offer free two-day shipping to customers who paid an annual $49 fee. On Thursday, Mr. McMillon also disclosed Walmart\u2019s plans to expand its grocery pickup business to 40 markets by the end of the month, up from 22 early this year.At the same time, the company has expanded its online assortment. At the end of last year, about eight million items were available through Walmart.com. That number is now up to 10 million. Four years ago, it was fewer than two million, according to a spokesman, Dan Toporek.\u201cThis takes time,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Shea said. \u201cYou don\u2019t just flip a switch and become a great online retailer.\u201dIn other areas, Walmart significantly outperformed its peers.Over all, Walmart reported that profit fell to $3.08 billion, or 98 cents a share, compared with $3.34 billion, or $1.03 a share, a year earlier. That beat expectations of 88 cents a share, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue was $115.9 billion; analysts had expected $113.2 billion.\u201cWalmart, especially with apparel, did better than other retailers for a really stressful period,\u201d Mr. Sosnick said.Advertisement"}

The device existed on the stage, but its features still seemed to be works in progress.Why introduce it now and make such a big thing of it? The reason seemed to lie in Mr. Pichai\u2019s unusual shout-out to a competitor. \u201cCredit to the team at Amazon for creating a lot of excitement in this space,\u201d he said.Those are millions of consumers who are lost, at least to some extent, to Google. The search company had to begin competing with Amazon before that number swelled to tens of millions. Mr. Pichai pointedly noted that Google was \u201cat a pivotal moment.\u201dThis was Google\u2019s 10th annual developers conference, but the first held in the amphitheater adjacent to its headquarters. The event is designed to be mostly instructive and inspirational for the freelance software engineers who use Google\u2019s tools to build things. But it is also promotional, an opportunity taken to broadcast around the world \u2014 there were a million people listening in China, Mr. Pichai said \u2014 what tomorrow will hold.Mario Queiroz, the Google executive in charge of Home, said it would \u201cbe a beautiful addition to any room in your house.\u201d In a short film, a family was shown waking up with Home. The father used it to play music in one child\u2019s room and to turn on the lights in another to get them out of bed. The girl, finishing her homework, asked Home what the Spanish word was for \u201capple.\u201d The parents rearranged their schedules.\u201cIt will let anyone in the family, kids or adults, have a conversation with Google,\u201d Mr. Queiroz said. Indeed, in the film, everyone is so busy communicating with Home they hardly talk to each other.Google already does search solely through voice, but its efforts have been confusingly branded. On Wednesday, Google promoted Google assistant \u2014 the company\u2019s name for the ability to have a two-way conversation to get information. It will be available this summer in a messaging app called Allo and later in Google Home.There have been efforts before to develop control centers for the home, but none have made serious inroads. Even the Echo was not an immediate hit with reviewers, some of whom wondered whether it might be little more than a gimmick.\u201cBefore I got an Echo I thought it was a joke and a bad idea,\u201d said Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray. \u201cBut I saw the utility and ended up buying five of them for my family.\u201dFor Google Home to stand out, he said, it would have to outdo the Echo, particularly in search. \u201cYou have to be able to ask it a complex question, and then it would go to the Internet and read it back to you,\u201d Mr. Munster said. \u201cEcho doesn\u2019t do a good job of that today.\u201dThe big tech companies are the new middlemen of commerce and communication. People used to go to stores to buy brands on impulse or by design.

{"Headline": "Dilma Rousseff, Facing Impeachment in Brazil, Has Alienated Many Allies", "Date": "2016-05-01", "News": "Supported by\u201cI never imagined a president could utter such words,\u201d Mr. Ziulkoski said, noting that dozens of mayors have abandoned Ms. Rousseff and her party. To Mr. Ziulkoski, the public dressing down was the kind of rupture that symbolized \u201cthe beginning of the end for her administration.\u201dBut many political analysts say Ms. Rousseff\u2019s slow-motion downfall can also be tied to an autocratic persona and a go-it-alone work style that has driven away scores of political allies, former staff members and cabinet ministers, many of whom have endured searing episodes of public humiliation.\u201cShe\u2019s alienated so many politicians and squandered the good will of so many people, in part because of her terrible political skills but also because of her arrogance,\u201d said Edson Sardinha, the editor of Congresso em Foco, a magazine that focuses on government corruption. \u201cIn her hour of need, very few people are willing to run to her defense.\u201dMs. Rousseff, who has been politically battered by the scandal, said she was the victim of a naked power grab and sexist assumptions of how a woman should lead. She also said she was a convenient scapegoat for something she cannot control: the global plunge in commodity prices that has sent the economy into a tailspin.In more than five years in office, Ms. Rousseff has largely refused to meet with members of Congress, both opponents and allies, eroding the majority support she once enjoyed in the lower house. The aggrieved include Eduardo Suplicy, a former senator and beloved figure in Ms. Rousseff\u2019s Workers\u2019 Party, who said she had turned down multiple requests for a meeting.\u201cIn politics, either you talk or you die,\u201d said Alfredo Nascimento, a former transportation minister. In April, he voted for her impeachment.\u201cI can\u2019t support a president who is incapable of governing,\u201d he said.In Bras\u00edlia, the capital, most everyone can recount stories about Ms. Rousseff\u2019s intolerance for dissent and her short fuse. The anecdotes include the time she smashed an office computer in anger, her refusal to meet with indigenous leaders or gay rights activists and the castigation of aides for the smallest of infractions.She is also finding little sympathy from the Brazilian news media, which has long viewed her as cold and condescending \u2014 a marked contrast to the charismatic, backslapping approach of Mr. da Silva.Some agree that Ms. Rousseff is being judged by a double standard that has unfairly tarnished powerful women around the world. Would she be considered so obstinate and uncooperative if she were a man? Or would she simply be called a strong, decisive leader?\u201cThe president is enduring all the stereotypes and prejudices of Brazil\u2019s highly patriarchal and oligarchic society,\u201d said Rosana Schwartz, a historian and sociologist at Mackenzie Presbyterian University in S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cI\u2019ve even heard people say, \u2018We will never again vote for a woman.\u2019 \u201dBut Antonia Melo, a former Workers\u2019 Party member, said Ms. Rousseff\u2019s gruff manner had alienated many of the party faithful. Ms. Melo described a meeting, when Ms. Rousseff was minister of energy, during which activists hoped to make their case against a contentious dam project in the Amazon.Ms. Melo said she had barely finished her first sentence when Ms. Rousseff cut her off, pounded on the table and vowed to press forward with the dam\u2019s construction. Then she turned around and left the room.\u201cWe stood there looking at each other in silence, perplexed,\u201d Ms. Melo said. \u201cWe felt so disrespected and discarded.\u201dThe episode was stinging given the origin of the Workers\u2019 Party and Ms. Rousseff\u2019s pedigree as a champion of the disenfranchised. The party\u2019s founders were Marxist guerrillas who rose to power through a coalition of trade unionists, landless farmers, indigenous activists and leftist intellectuals who helped pave the way for the re-establishment of democracy in 1985.But that coalition is in tatters. Ms. Rousseff is battling accusations that she hid the depths of Brazil\u2019s economic troubles to enhance her re-election prospects. Many bedrock supporters are disillusioned by widespread corruption in the national oil company, Petrobras, and by what many describe as Ms. Rousseff\u2019s about-face, after her re-election in 2014, on several campaign promises to preserve generous government spending.Dilma Rousseff, Brazil\u2019s president, is facing removal from office. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the proceedings.In recent weeks, at least 135 mayors aligned with the Workers\u2019 Party have changed their party affiliations \u2014 about a fifth of the nation\u2019s mayors who had been elected on the party\u2019s ticket. Among them are Jo\u00e3o Paulo Ribeiro, 31, the mayor of a small city, who said he had grown weary of the attacks by residents and even friends who questioned his association with Ms. Rousseff\u2019s party.\u201cI have to listen to the people,\u201d said Mr. Ribeiro, who changed parties last month, hoping to improve his chances for re-election in October.It is not as if the political figures lining up to oust Ms. Rousseff are viewed as saviors. Many of them are battling serious accusations of corruption, and they were in positions of great power as the country\u2019s once-enviable economy ran aground.Rising unemployment and the broad unrest over Brazil\u2019s economy only added to the strains between Ms. Rousseff and Congress. Had the economy been ascendant \u2014 as it was in 2005 when her predecessor, Mr. da Silva, became embroiled in a vote-buying scandal \u2014 she might have emerged unscathed.The end of Brazil\u2019s bonanza complicated the patronage used to navigate the fractious legislature, in which more than two dozen parties fight for government funding.\u201cWe have a political system based on extracting money from the economy and transferring it to political parties to finance elections,\u201d said Rubens Ric\u00fapero, who served as minister of finance in the mid-1990s.Many Brazilian economists and policy makers contend that the economic crisis was largely a product of Ms. Rousseff\u2019s own making. She increased the government\u2019s footprint in the economy, spending large amounts on favored industries and corporations to build up national champions.\u201cBrazil insisted in carrying out an industrial policy devoid of logic,\u201d said Arminio Fraga, a former governor of the Central Bank of Brazil. \u201cWhen the government offers companies all sorts of advantages, through protection, subsidies and contracts, it creates enormous space for this sort of thing.\u201dFriends and associates say Ms. Rousseff\u2019s worldview and personality were partly shaped by the three years she was imprisoned by the military, a trauma that included torture like beatings and shocks with an electric baton.An economist and career bureaucrat, Ms. Rousseff, 68, had not held elected office until Mr. da Silva, who was barred under the Constitution from seeking a third consecutive term, picked her to run for president on the Workers\u2019 Party ticket. Mr. da Silva has said he was impressed by her grasp of complex data and her no-nonsense managerial style.Idelber Avelar, an early member of the Workers\u2019 Party, said Mr. da Silva also viewed Ms. Rousseff as a compliant soldier who would continue his policies and keep the economy humming until he could run again.\u201cClearly, he thought Dilma was somebody he could easily control, a technocrat who would run the machine, which is pretty ironic given that she\u2019s proven to be a disastrous administrator,\u201d said Mr. Avelar, who now teaches at Tulane University in New Orleans. \u201cThe root of all her problems is a profound aversion to politics.\u201dAt least 86 cabinet ministers have come and gone since she took office, and only three remain from her first term. Many were forced to resign after being accused of corruption.Ms. Rousseff has not been accused of graft, though many people question her innocence, given her role as chairwoman of the national oil company at a time when the epic kickback scheme was being hatched.In an interview, Ms. Rousseff brushed off suggestions that her disdain for retail politics and the horse trading required to pass legislation had contributed to her woes. She defended her decision to ignore members of Congress.\u201cThere were certain types of blackmail negotiations I would not engage in,\u201d she said.For a time, the Brazilian public viewed her steely resolve positively. During her first year in office, Ms. Rousseff\u2019s popularity stood at 77 percent, among the highest percentages in recent history. These days, that figure is in the single digits.Many Brazilians still admire Ms. Rousseff\u2019s ethics. But after two years of economic turmoil, her televised speeches prompt a cacophony on the streets, as thousands bang on pots and pans to drown out her voice.Few give Ms. Rousseff credit for big achievements, including a landmark freedom of information law and measures that gave federal police and prosecutors new tools to tackle corruption.In some ways, analysts said, Ms. Rousseff has become a victim of those laws, which paved the way for the investigations that have claimed scores of the political and business elite, exposing the depths of Brazil\u2019s political rot.\u201cThis is one of the greatest paradoxes of her fall, because she put in place the machinery that ensnared the politicians who mattered the most,\u201d said Gregory Michener, a professor at Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Get\u00falio Vargas, a research institute in Rio de Janeiro. \u201cDilma did a lot for good government, and I think she ultimately wanted good government, but in the end she wasn\u2019t a good politician because in Brazil\u2019s rent-seeking party system, she was unwilling to give her allies their fill.\u201dPaula Moura contributed reporting from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, and Eduardo Porter from New York.Advertisement"}

I have lots of books, but that doesn\u2019t stop me from buying new ones.\u201dWhen so much educational material is available online, much of it free, courses like these are something of a throwback. Nevertheless, for the last 25 years, the format has gained the company a loyal customer base, made up primarily of older professionals and retirees. Customers pay from $35 to more than $500 for audio and video courses that offer the intellectual stimulation of college without the worries of finishing assignments or taking final exams.Now the Great Courses program hopes to broaden its demographics with an all-you-can-learn streaming service, Great Courses Plus, which it introduced late last year. With the streaming option, customers are not limited to a single course. For $19.99 a month, or about $180 for an annual subscription, they have unlimited online access to more than 280 of the most recent and popular courses from the company\u2019s library of roughly 600 courses on topics including astrophysics and wine tasting.\u201cI\u2019m a big believer that we are the Netflix of learning,\u201d said Paul Suijk, chief executive of the Teaching Company of Chantilly, Va., which owns the Great Courses and has $150 million a year in revenue. \u201cLooking at Netflix and where they are going, I think there are many similarities.\u201dFor years, Great Courses was just about the only game in town. Its advertisements have long been familiar to anyone who reads The New York Times Book Review or The New Yorker. But now it faces competition from massive open online courses, or MOOCs, offered by colleges and even from outlets like YouTube.Coursera, for example, offers courses from more than 140 universities and organizations around the world, with topics as varied as grammar and punctuation, and Tibetan meditation. Students can take classes free or pay for a more complete experience, with assessments and interaction with professors.About 25 percent to 30 percent of Coursera users \u201care purely enrichment learners, and the demographics of the Great Courses,\u201d said Daphne Koller, president and co-founder of Coursera. The average age of a Coursera student is 33, versus 45 plus for the typical Great Courses customer.\u201cIf you are interested in community and interaction, MOOCs may be your best option,\u201d Mr. Haber said. \u201cIf you are interested in lectures, the Great Courses are probably your best option.\u201dThe Great Courses do not offer the same opportunity as MOOCs to interact with professors. Instead, writers and producers \u201ctry to predict as much of that exchange as possible\u201d by addressing common questions in the lecture, said Marcy McDonald, who was senior director of content for the Great Courses and is now a freelance course producer.The production quality and depth of Great Courses\u2019 material is still a cut above most of what is available free. \u201cPeople go to YouTube looking for an answer to a question,\u201d said Ron Davis, a chemistry professor at Georgetown University who has a YouTube channel and recently finished his second Great Courses series on chemistry. \u201cThe Great Courses is about immersing yourself.\u201dWhile the plots do not have the same twists and turns as those of \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d or \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d the courses do attract \u201cbinge learners\u201d who power through dozens of 30-minute lectures on a weekend. Data on Plus subscribers show that many are sampling a wide range of courses that suit their moods or circumstances, whether it is a high school student needing to catch up on organic chemistry or a foodie interested in the finer points of French cuisine.The inspiration for the Great Courses came after its founder, Tom Rollins, skipped his evidence class on federal rules during his second year in law school at Harvard. In a panic before the final exam, he found a series of video lectures taught by Prof. Irving Younger of Cornell University.\u201cI was prepared for the worst weekend of my life,\u201d Mr. Rollins said. Instead, he was captivated, got an A on the exam and, after serving as chief of staff to Senator Edward M. Kennedy\u2019s Labor Committee, built a business based on that experience. \u201cIt made me realize that we dramatically undervalue the power of great teachers,\u201d he said.Mr. Rollins filmed the first courses \u2014 which covered psychology, political theory and Shakespeare \u2014 at Georgetown University but quickly realized that taking crews and equipment on location added cost and complexity. In 1992, he brought production in house to the original headquarters in Springfield, Va., shooting with two cameras and the same backdrop.A turning point came in 1996, when Mr. Rollins shifted gears from thinking solely about content to creating a successful business. He pored over Harvard Business School case studies, sought outside expertise and created a 120-page playbook for doing business and building customer loyalty. Through direct marketing and abundant print advertising, he built a loyal audience of repeat customers.Despite the successes, Mr. Rollins started looking for a buyer around 2000, when many of his early investors were ready to leave. He ultimately struck a deal with Brentwood Associates, a private equity firm based in Los Angeles.In 2006, Brentwood invested $50 million, a majority stake, in the Teaching Company with the goal of improving production quality and expanding the company\u2019s reach. When streaming video took off, it made the business model that much more appealing. \u201cWe bought a fantastic DVD company,\u201d which sold DVDs via direct marketing, said Bill Barnum, who helped found Brentwood\u2019s private equity group. \u201cAnd then there was an incredible revolution on the device side and with new online distribution channels.\u201dUnder Brentwood, the company has more than tripled the circulation of its course catalogs to about 70 million. In 2013, it added indirect distribution channels, including Audible.com, Amazon Instant Video, Comcast Video on Demand and even Netflix.In addition, the company has forged partnerships with the Culinary Institute of America, the Smithsonian Institution and the Mayo Clinic, among others, to produce videos. These partnerships offer access to experts, locations and resources, and expand the marketing reach. The Fundamentals of Photography, which is produced with National Geographic, is the best-selling course in the history of the company.Most videos are still produced in one of the company\u2019s two studios, one with a permanent set and one that changes with the topic. One week it resembles the site of an archaeological dig, and the next it is a physiology lab. Increasingly, postproduction animation is part of the equation, though it is still a far cry from Hollywood. Most courses are easily converted into audio-only products, which account for roughly 20 percent of the company\u2019s revenue.New customers might be drawn to a single topic, but the company\u2019s direct marketing aims to turn them into repeat customers. Roughly a third of first-time buyers buy more courses, according to the company.Great Courses producers typically generate ideas for new courses, but those ideas are tested using customer surveys. If a topic gets the green light, internal talent scouts search for the expert best suited to write the course and present it on camera. \u201cYou could be Einstein, but if you\u2019re not engaging, you\u2019re not going to cut it,\u201d said Mr. Suijk, the chief executive. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to find the professors who are truly special.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Save 20 percent!Macy\u2019s has discount fever, and signs like these pepper its sprawling flagship store in Manhattan. But while shoppers love a sale, those discounts are coming at a steep price to Macy\u2019s and the country\u2019s other large department stores.\u201cIt\u2019s poison,\u201d said Mark Cohen, the director of retail studies at Columbia Business School. \u201cThey\u2019ve created no motivation for consumers to respond to their promotions, since if you missed this week\u2019s sale you just need to wait around until next week.\u201dOr not at all. Shoppers may be addicted to discounts, but not necessarily those at the leading department stores. This week, Macy\u2019s, Nordstrom, Kohl\u2019s and J. C. Penney all reported unexpectedly weak sales, driving their stocks sharply lower.The headwinds facing department stores are coming from several directions, including from online shopping. The companies\u2019 earnings look especially bleak in comparison with the broad retail picture in the United States. On Friday, the government reported that overall retail spending had ticked higher in April.But the results this week reinforced the degree to which companies have failed to adjust to discount retail chains like Ross and the TJX companies, T. J. Maxx and Marshalls, which have spent years developing their niche and are attracting more people.Bargain-hunting, of course, is nothing new. But the hunt itself has changed. The economic collapse of 2008 forced many Americans to cling tighter to their purse strings, and forced many shoppers to more aggressively hunt for low-cost options.That spurred many consumers toward so-called off-price retailers like T. J. Maxx, Marshalls and Ross, where many have remained, according to Jharonne Martis, the director of consumer research for Thomson Reuters.\u201cDuring the recession, they were a favorite among customers,\u201d Ms. Martis said.A decade ago, Mr. Saunders said, there were sharper distinctions between the customers who shopped at Nordstrom and those who picked through the racks at off-price stores. In 2005, 5.1 percent of shoppers who regularly used off-price retailers also shopped at department stores for clothing, he said. Last year, that figure rose to 12.9 percent.\u201cPeople that used off-price and discount channels tended to be a bit more isolated,\u201d Mr. Saunders said. \u201cNow, there\u2019s a lot more customer sharing, and a lot more people who use department stores also use off-price retailers much more freely.\u201dThe difference between the products offered at the different retailers is also getting blurry. Department stores and discount chains have sold increasingly similar products. Macy\u2019s and Nordstrom may have once been associated with brands like Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren, but those labels now frequently appear in the off-price aisles as well, Ms. Martis said. That has made department stores less of a destination, she said.Still, department stores are trying to match the demand for discount shopping, slashing prices and combining points in a frenzied attempt to keep up with an increasing variety of low-cost rivals. But they have not done enough to stem the tide of losses.\u201cWhen you have a significant amount of clearance, you dilute your own brand,\u201d Ms. Martis said. \u201cThe department stores were built for a different decade.\u201dMacy\u2019s and J. C. Penney declined to comment for this article. Nordstrom and Kohl\u2019s could not be reached for comment.Ms. Martis and other retail analysts said that department stores had done a poor job of keeping up with younger consumers. Those shoppers are often cost-conscious and generally less inclined to shop at the same stores that their parents once did. The promotions might do a good job of targeting people looking for low prices, but the brands sometimes do not.At Macy\u2019s in Herald Square on Thursday, shoppers combed through entire rooms dedicated to discount shoes. But the assortment, however plentiful, may not have been for everyone. \u201cThey probably missed out on that whole sneaker thing,\u201d said Jacqui Booker, 38, who had come to Macy\u2019s to look at appliances.\u201cThe fact that they don\u2019t sell a Jordan in here is probably keeping every kid away,\u201d Ms. Booker said, referring to Air Jordan, Nike\u2019s popular athletic shoe.On Friday, J. C. Penney reported a loss of 32 cents a share, and said that sales at stores open more than a year had fallen 0.4 percent. Same-store sales at Macy\u2019s fell 5.6 percent in the first quarter.Some department stores, like Nordstrom, have been aggressive about opening their own discount chains. But while business improved at Nordstrom\u2019s discount division, Nordstrom Rack, full-price net sales fell 2.2 percent.Also on Friday, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales rose 1.3 percent in April, driven in large part by sales of automobiles and gas, along with online shopping.\u201cThe retail sales numbers underscore the shift, underscore the challenges department stores are having,\u201d said Richard Jaffe, a managing director and retail analyst with Stifel Nicolaus.Amazon represents one of those main challenges. The online shopping giant has increasingly pulled consumers away from traditional brick-and-mortar stores, and has shown every indication that it intends to grow.But while Amazon accounts for half of all e-commerce by some estimates, most shopping in the United States still happens in person. The problems at the larger department stores, Mr. Saunders argued, run deeper.\u201cAmazon plays a big part of this, but it\u2019s not the only part,\u201d Mr. Saunders said. \u201cI think retailers have to take some share of the blame themselves.\u201dIncluding, some might say, for their discounts.\u201cI think at this point,\u201d Ms. Booker said, \u201ceveryone that knows Macy\u2019s knows that you go on Sale Wednesday.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Europe Seeks Greater Control Over Digital Services", "Date": "2016-05-25", "News": "Supported byIf European regulators get their way, Netflix may soon have to do more than just offer \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u201d with French subtitles.But Netflix and others do not want Europe to set specific quotas for the amount of content, arguing that doing so would harm consumer choice as many Europeans want to watch American, not local, programming.\u201cWe appreciate the commission\u2019s objective to have European production flourish, however, the proposed measures won\u2019t actually achieve that,\u201d Joris Evers, a Netflix spokesman in Amsterdam, said in a statement.Netflix and other American technology companies have found themselves at the center of the changing regulatory environment in Europe.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Europe\u2019s latest rule changes are more challenging for Netflix.European officials on Wednesday said they would give individual countries the power, if they so chose, to force video streaming services to help pay for the production of local content, like movies and television programs.\u201cThe way we watch TV or videos may have changed, but our values don\u2019t,\u201d G\u00fcnther H. Oettinger, the European commissioner in charge of the digital economy, said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cWith these new rules, we will uphold media pluralism.\u201dSuch rules already exist for traditional broadcasters, like the BBC in Britain and the TF1 Group in France. On average, they pay the equivalent of millions of dollars each year, or roughly 20 percent of their annual revenue in the countries where they operate, to support local content.European policy makers said that online streaming rivals currently invested only around 1 percent of their annual revenue in local content. Netflix has been able to sidestep existing funding rules, most notably in France, because the company\u2019s European headquarters are in the Netherlands.Streaming services will also be required to ensure that at least 20 percent of their online content is from Europe, and that those movies and television programs are given prominence in their digital catalogs. A report funded by the European Commission recently found that both Netflix and Apple already met this requirement.The commission\u2019s digital plans are subject to the approval of the European Parliament and individual member states, a lengthy process that could lead to significant changes.Europe\u2019s proposals on digital services are only the beginning.The European Commission said on Wednesday that it would also propose new copyright rules in the fall that could force companies like Google to pay online publishers when using their content, including in its news aggregation service Google News.Officials also said that they were still reviewing potential new rules to control how so-called online platforms like Facebook and Amazon operate in the 28-member bloc.European officials said they were looking into making it easier for people to move their digital information between online platforms by the end of the year, giving them greater control over data that companies collected on their daily digital lives.\u201cI want online platforms and the audiovisual and creative sectors to be powerhouses in the digital economy,\u201d said Andrus Ansip, the European Commission vice president in charge of the region\u2019s digital single market proposals. \u201cThey need the certainty of a modern and fair legal environment: That is what we are providing today.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Free Speech: Ten Principles for a Connected World,\u2019 by Timothy Garton Ash", "Date": "2016-05-22", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Among our most treasured public values, free speech is indispensable and perplexing. It involves us at once in high principle and shaming triviality, as two otherwise unconnected headline cases nicely attest. In Germany, a comedian who mocked the Turkish president on air may soon stand trial under an antique law against offending foreign dignitaries. In Florida, a jury in March rejected Gawker Media\u2019s free-speech defense and ordered it to pay $140 million in damages for posting a tawdry video on its gossip site showing a retired wrestler in bed with another celebrity\u2019s wife.Free speech\u2019s many-sided appeal is not hard to identify. It prods society to criticize itself and learn from mistakes. It fosters the independence of mind we need to be responsible grown-ups. Take away free speech, and liberal democracy \u00adceases to be truly liberal or democratic. Free speech hunts out truth and spreads knowledge. When stifled, it responds with soaring words of defiance. Think of Milton or Voltaire, Nelson Mandela or Vaclav Havel, Salman Rushdie or Kamel Daoud.Defending free speech, alas, takes more than standing up for science, sound argument and brave eloquence. It takes standing up as well for the right to say things that are false, hateful, mindless, base, vulgar, stupid or reckless. It is easy to defend what we admire and believe in. To defend free speech, you have to allow for bad speech. Free speech gave us Martin Luther King\u2019s \u201cI have a dream.\u201d It also gave us Donald Trump.It would be nice to have one without the other. But that is not what free speech promises. Free speech is complicated and comes at a high price. We pay for it in terms of other things we also need to care about: public order and security, children\u2019s needs, private reputations, civic courtesy, cultural worth, the social \u00addignity of vulnerable minorities. As Timothy Garton Ash makes admirably clear in his wise, up-to-the-minute and wide-ranging new survey, \u201cFree Speech: Ten Principles for a Connected World,\u201d most of the difficult arguments about free speech bear on its price in terms of other things that also ought to matter to us.The controversies are fierce and familiar. Ought leakers be punished, and how can whistle-blowers be protected? Should pornography be restricted? Do libel laws gag the press? May religion be shielded from mockery? Ought hate speech be criminalized? Garton Ash pursues each in depth. He follows the common practice of taking \u201cfree speech\u201d to mean a cluster of freedoms to express yourself and your thoughts as you please: not just voicing words but printing what you want, \u00adproclaiming your faith as you wish, campaigning for your chosen causes and making art without interference.Speech in that broad sense was once suspect unless expressly permitted; monitored speech was the norm. But in liberal modernity, unmonitored speech is the norm and limits to speech are suspect unless specifically justified. The main arguments now separate laxists from restrictionists. Laxists favor few limits, restrictionists many. The kinds of limits matter. Coercive laws, whether prior censorship or after-the-fact sanctions, provide one kind of limit. Garton Ash is generally against them. High standards of public argument and common decency are another kind of limit. Garton Ash is broadly for them. You could say he is laxist about law and restrictionist about standards. His approach has the great merit of keeping distinct what is legally permissible and what is or ought to be socially acceptable. Garton Ash treasures the jewel but recognizes and regrets the mud. His guiding maxim, never wholly lost amid near encyclopedic detail, is \u201cMore free speech but also better speech.\u201dAs a scholar-journalist, Garton Ash knows what he is talking about from a career of reading, writing, listening and, more lately, web-clicking. When reporting on the breakup of the Communist world in the 1980s, he befriended East European dissidents, saw how truthful speech could sap the will of wrongful power and collected a private lexicon of sardonic political jokes that here lighten the going. Now a fellow at St. Antony\u2019s College, Oxford, he supervises a 13-language online debating platform \u2014 freespeechdebate.com \u2014 for promoting free speech and arguing with all sides about its proper limits. His travels and interviews for \u201cFree Speech\u201d spanned the world, or what he calls the \u201ccosmopolis,\u201d a global space that is virtual as well as geographic. That range alone will squelch the fantasy that free speech is a purely Western concern.Garton Ash invokes recent work by lawyers and philosophers but sees that fine distinctions and tight reasoning get you only so far in public argument. Talk of freedom is empty, he recognizes, when it neglects unequal power. In illustration, he offers a nice cartoon metaphor. Speech, he writes, is fought over by dogs (big state powers like the United States, the European Union and China), cats (big Internet and media concerns) and mice (that is, us). Government and corporations, he thinks, should interfere with speech very little. We should accordingly not look to them to improve speech. Making speech better is up to us, the mice.Law to Garton Ash is a poor tool for \u00adcivic education. He questions hate-speech laws and Holocaust-denial laws, fearing a \u00ad\u201ctaboo ratchet.\u201d Corporations in their turn are after profit, not civic uplift. He distrusts the idea that Google, Amazon and Facebook, for example, serve \u00adequally the values of free speech and good speech. His preferred answer to the more flagrant vices of liberty \u2014 hate speech, manipulative journalism, coarsened debate and a vast sewer of abuse on social media \u2014 is to encourage \u201cshared norms and practices that enable us to make best use of this essential freedom.\u201dIn lesser hands, that recommendation might sound overabstract or simply pious. Garton Ash, \u00adhowever, applies and tests it in 10 chapters offering \u201ccomplex, contextual judgments\u201d that pretty well cover the field of present controversy. He writes with panache and understands the world he works in, especially the virtual world of the Net. Practical answers interest him more than doctrinal purity. His website has adopted a \u201cone-click-away\u201d rule. It screens provocative material \u2014 Muhammad cartoons, for example \u2014 with a warning that some may take offense, leaving them to see it or not as they choose.He knows that \u201cwe,\u201d the citizenry of mice, are not all secular-minded liberals like him but deeply divided in outlook. Heading each chapter is a free-speech maxim that he hopes modernity and tradition may agree on: for example, \u201cNeither make threats of violence nor accept violent intimidation\u201d or \u201cRespect the believer but not necessarily the content of the belief.\u201d His watchword for dialogue amid \u00adcultural diversity is \u201crobust civility,\u201d an ideal somewhere between internal warfare and inauthentic making nice. He derides trigger warnings and on-campus censorship, explaining tersely that \u201cchildren should be educated to become sovereign adults, but not treated as if they already are.\u201dMost of us are somewhat stunned at present by the scale and \u00adcomplexity of the forces in play, be they government surveillance; the \u201cGreat Firewall of \u00adChina\u201d that can censor the national web; the mounting strength of the Internet giants; or the frightening violence of militant Islam. Bewilderment is the easy option. \u201cFree Speech\u201d encourages us to take a breath, look hard at the facts and see how well-tried liberal principles can be applied and defended in daunting new circumstances.Edmund Fawcett, the author of \u201cLiberalism: The Life of an Idea,\u201d is writing a study of conservatism in Europe and the United States from the 19th century to the present.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon Proves Infertile Soil for Unions, So Far", "Date": "2016-05-16", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 In early April, Kellen Wadach, the general manager at Amazon\u2019s warehouse in Middletown, Del., told hundreds of workers at the cavernous facility a troubling story about his family being abandoned by his father\u2019s union.Flashing a photograph of himself as a boy with his father, Mr. Wadach said the union did not help his family financially after his father died suddenly in front of their house, not even bothering to send a condolence card, according to three current workers at the warehouse who heard him speak and asked for anonymity for fear of losing their jobs.The problem with Mr. Wadach\u2019s story was that much of it appears to have been untrue.For years, Amazon has successfully battled to keep unions out of the company. And the incident involving Mr. Wadach was an illustration of how important it was to Amazon \u2014 or at least to some of its employees \u2014 to keep it that way.Just days after a reporter approached Amazon about inconsistencies in Mr. Wadach\u2019s story, Scott Stanzel, an Amazon spokesman, said Mr. Wadach was no longer with the company.Mr. Wadach did not respond to repeated messages sent to his email address and Facebook account. A voice mail message left at a listed number for his mother was not returned.Some Amazon fulfillment center workers see unions as a way to gain more influence on pay, how job assignments are doled out and the handling of workplace complaints. Amazon worries unions will burden its operations with red tape, hurting the nimbleness of facilities it is constantly adjusting to be more efficient with robots and other innovations.\u201cAmazon\u2019s culture and business model are based on rapid innovation, flexibility and open lines of direct communication between managers and associates,\u201d Mr. Stanzel said. \u201cThis direct connection is the most effective way to understand and respond to the wants and needs of our associates.\u201dUnion officials think Amazon fights so hard to keep them at bay to prevent a domino effect among its warehouses.\u201cThis is Amazon\u2019s biggest fear,\u201d said Andy Powell, a district organizer for the International Association of Machinists & Aerospace Workers who is trying to organize Amazon fulfillment center workers in Delaware and several nearby states. \u201cThe minute one falls and people see they got a better deal, it\u2019s going to be a cancer for them.\u201dUnions have not made much progress at Amazon after years of campaigns, which union officials and warehouse workers blame partly on the high turnover rate in its fulfillment centers.A labor union in Germany has organized frequent strikes over pay and workplace conditions by a portion of workers at Amazon fulfillment centers in the country, though workers do not have a union contract with the company.In 2014, the machinists union helped organize a union vote by a small number of technicians and mechanics who worked on order-fulfillment equipment at the fulfillment center in Middletown, a community of about 19,000 about a half-hour from Wilmington.It was the first vote of its kind at an Amazon warehouse, but workers voted 21 to 6 to reject the plan, which was opposed by Amazon. The company said there were about 3,000 full-time workers at the facility.Since late fall, representatives of the machinists union, including Mr. Powell, have passed out leaflets at a busy intersection outside the fulfillment center. Some employees at the facility have encouraged co-workers to consider the potential benefits of joining a union.In many cases, pay and benefits are not even the top concerns of workers \u2014 pay at the Middletown warehouse starts around $13 an hour and health care and parental leave benefits are the same for warehouse workers as they are for senior executives at Amazon. The company said full-time workers at the facility made, on average, over $15 an hour in overall compensation when including base pay, bonuses and stock awards.But workers want things like better protection from termination and mechanisms for contesting favoritism by managers. Mr. Stanzel said the company had a process for employees to appeal terminations and an open-door policy that encourages workers to bring their concerns to managers.Like many other companies, Amazon employs standard \u201cunion avoidance\u201d techniques, telling workers in gatherings that they will no longer be able to communicate directly with Amazon if a union represents them, union officials said. Around Christmas last year, managers began making the rounds at the Middletown warehouse, questioning workers on their thoughts about unions, said employees at the warehouse.Last June, Scott Gragilla, a former Amazon fulfillment center employee at the warehouse, began asking questions about why workers were not receiving bonuses they had gotten in the past. Not long after, he said, he was reprimanded for his job performance for the first time.Mr. Gragilla, 38, worked as a picker, someone who gathers items from shelves for Amazon orders, and eventually was promoted to \u201cambassador,\u201d an employee who leads training sessions for other employees.He began openly promoting the idea of unionizing the warehouse to co-workers. But in early December, Mr. Gragilla said he was told he was being fired by Amazon for his work performance, including leaving early for his lunch break and failing to return after being ordered back to work by two managers. He denies either is true.Amazon maintains that no employee has ever been terminated as a result of union activity, said Mr. Stanzel, the company spokesman.Mr. Gragilla filed a complaint about his termination with the National Labor Relations Board. He said he was unable to gather enough former co-workers from the Amazon fulfillment center to testify on his behalf, and the board declined to take the case to a judge.Mr. Wadach\u2019s emotional story, after those months of union activity, aroused suspicions among employees who were skeptical that a union would act so callously.Word of the story got to the machinists union, which found an obituary in The Ithaca Journal in New York on April 20, 2006, that said Mr. Wadach\u2019s father, Peter Dana Wadach, had died while jogging on a family vacation in South Carolina \u2014 not in front of the family home, as Mr. Wadach had said.The obituary and another news story said Peter Wadach was a partner at an insurance agency in Ithaca and had worked in the insurance business for nearly three decades. He was 49 when he died.Amazon declined to discuss details of Kellen Wadach\u2019s departure from the company.Charlotte Garden, an associate professor of law at the Seattle University School of Law, said Mr. Wadach\u2019s story, odd as it may have been, would probably not reach a legal threshold for \u201ccoercive\u201d behavior.\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty high bar,\u201d she said. \u201cThat means a lot of employer persuader activity is lawful.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Ebert\u2019s words testify to the lingering power of the old \u2014 digitally stored and projected motion pictures are technically neither \u201cprints\u201d nor \u201cfilms\u201d \u2014 and also to the speed with which the new passes into obsolescence. For the studios, DVDs were a boon to the bottom line, and to consumers they were collectible tokens of movie love. In any case, they didn\u2019t last long and are now increasingly niche items rather than commodities for mass consumption. Why clutter your shelves with special editions of last year\u2019s blockbusters when a whole mobile cinematheque is a few clicks and swipes away?It\u2019s often idealized as a space of collective reverence and aesthetic bliss, where photochemical alchemy unfolds in room full of worshipers. But how often does that really happen? Most of the time aren\u2019t we just eating unhealthy snacks and watching a digital file in obnoxious company? Couldn\u2019t we just do that at home?The key word here is people. After all, what makes movies a mass art is that they are made on a mass scale for a mass audience, which is true even for work that\u2019s largely exhibited on the festival and art-cinema circuit. What happens to that art when we begin to remove, well, people from part of the equation? What happens to its democratic promise, which may be a fantasy at best, a lie at worst, but remains nonetheless? When I think about Mr. Parker\u2019s Screening Room, I flash on the image of Howard Hughes in Mr. Scorsese\u2019s film \u201cThe Aviator,\u201d watching films all alone in his private theater, safely isolated from the contamination known as other human beings.For some, part of the allure of Screening Room, clearly, is that it would allow them to see first-run titles in Hughes-like isolation. There seems to be a high level of dissatisfaction with moviegoing, much of it focused on other people\u2019s behavior, including texting. This brings to mind the days of early cinema, when theaters issued audiences dos and don\u2019ts like take off your hats, don\u2019t spit, don\u2019t talk. (D. W. Griffith even made a film mocking women\u2019s haberdashery: \u201cThose Awful Hats.\u201d)In the postwar years, the rise of car culture and the growth of the suburbs planted drive-ins in wide-open spaces, while grindhouses, art houses and campus film societies flourished in the cities and college towns. Moviegoing has never been just one thing.And people are still doing it! The M.P.A.A. notes that theater attendance increased by around 4 percent in North America in 2015, after wobbling and dipping in the previous few years. The highly scientific explanation for this, as you and I have discussed, is that the studios released a lot of movies that people were eager to leave the house to see, including \u201cJurassic World,\u201d \u201cTrainwreck,\u201d \u201cStraight Outta Compton\u201d and \u201cInside Out.\u201dWe\u2019re increasingly able to bring the movies home, and also to bring the comforts of home with us wherever we go. Moviegoing is not what it used to be, for sure, but I suspect it will flourish as long as it answers to the primal human urge to get out of the house.Advertisement"}

Others even seemed a little relieved; at least the long battle was almost over.\u201cI\u2019m convinced that there is more than enough proof of her crimes,\u201d said Marta Suplicy, a senator from S\u00e3o Paulo who was Ms. Rousseff\u2019s ally before defecting from her leftist Workers\u2019 Party.Even some of Ms. Rousseff\u2019s supporters in the Senate expected her to lose the vote, which would oust the Workers\u2019 Party from the presidency it has held for 13 years.\u201cThere is no other path for us than opposition,\u201d Humberto Costa, the Workers\u2019 Party leader in the Senate, told reporters during the session on Wednesday. Still, he said it would be a \u201cvery firm opposition.\u201dThe Senate vote is a watershed in the power struggle consuming Brazil, a country that experienced a rare stretch of stability over the last two decades as it strengthened its economy and achieved greater prominence on the world stage.Dilma Rousseff, Brazil\u2019s president, is facing removal from office. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the proceedings.If she is suspended and put on trial, she will become the second of Brazil\u2019s four elected presidents to be removed from office since democracy was re-established in the mid-1980s after a long dictatorship.\u201cPlainly said, this is the worst crisis in our history, with its combination of economic calamity, discredited politics and the violation of the lowest ethical standards,\u201d Boris Fausto, a Brazilian historian, told reporters this month.Unlike some of her adversaries in Congress, Ms. Rousseff is not suspected of stealing for personal enrichment. Instead, she faces accusations that she borrowed money from state banks to plug budget holes. Her opponents say she used this strategy to hide Brazil\u2019s economic problems, in an attempt to improve her re-election prospects.\u201cTemer is what we\u2019ve got,\u201d Mr. Fausto said. \u201cI hope he\u2019ll be up to the difficult and often highly unpopular tasks ahead of him.\u201dBut the impasse between Ms. Rousseff and her rivals has kept the government in Bras\u00edlia distracted from these problems, exposing the political establishment to withering scrutiny around the country.While Ms. Rousseff, Brazil\u2019s first female president, has largely stuck to her routine in recent days, consulting with cabinet ministers and meeting with supporters, aides said they expected her to watch the Senate vote on television.Ms. Rousseff, 68, contends that her predecessors enacted the same budgetary manipulation policies that she is accused of. Her rivals say that does not make her innocent.Beyond that, an array of figures in her Workers\u2019 Party are either in jail or under investigation on charges of graft, dealing a blow to the legitimacy of a party that came to power vowing to end such practices.During a suspension, her salary would be cut in half, to about $4,400 a month, though she would still have access to a large staff, numbering in the dozens. The man seeking to replace her, Mr. Temer, would take the helm of government while living in his official residence, the Pal\u00e1cio do Jaburu.Concerns are growing about the legitimacy of a government assembled by Mr. Temer. If Ms. Rousseff and the Workers\u2019 Party shift into the opposition, they will most likely claim her ouster was illegal, and Mr. Temer\u2019s top allies remain mired in corruption scandals of their own.Several of his top advisers are under investigation, including Romero Juc\u00e1, a senator from Roraima State in the Amazon, and Geddel Vieira Lima, a former executive at one of Brazil\u2019s largest public banks. Mr. Temer has insisted that those inquiries would not prevent him from naming the advisers to his cabinet.The president has maintained a sense of resolve. Speaking in Bras\u00edlia to activists promoting women\u2019s rights this week, Ms. Rousseff, who was an operative in an urban guerrilla group in her youth, addressed the crestfallen mood around her.Calling her adversaries \u201ctraitors,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m not tired of fighting.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The case was supercomplicated but many programmers worried that a win for Oracle would cast a shadow over the legality of using open-source code, which is at the center of a lot of the technology that modern computing relies on. A jury sided with Google.Do you understand any of this? I\u2019m guessing no. The upshot for you is, thanks to this win, your phone won\u2019t get superexpensive and will probably still keep getting better. And that\u2019s probably pretty much all you care about.Let\u2019s talk about the big news of the week, or month, in tech and media land: #Thielgate.The story is sort of unbelievable, in and of itself, but also hits a sweet spot within all the crazy things that editors love: tech, billionaires, tech billionaires and, of course, media.The basic argument of those on the tech side was that Gawker was singularly bad. They said that Gawker abused its journalistic platform, it routinely invaded people\u2019s private lives, including outing their sexual orientation, and in other ways made life very difficult for wealthy coastal techies.I\u2019ve certainly not been a fan of everything Gawker has done. But I\u2019m struck by the inability of techies to consider both the proportionality of this punishment and the chilling effects this case could induce on the media generally. First, to me, it doesn\u2019t make sense that a small excerpt from a sex tape should result in a company-ending decision. And I don\u2019t see how techies could support that.All of these examples are potentially far more damaging to the world than a leaked sex tape. But none of these companies were fined anywhere near hundreds of millions of dollars for their recklessness. Do tech venture capitalists really want to support a system in which moving fast and breaking things results in company-ending lawsuits?I\u2019m not sure I quite believe that. But it\u2019s fair to say that Gawker had its day in court \u2014 with a lot of caveats over jurisdiction and judge and jury, Gawker supporters would say \u2014 and that the company lost the case. This should be a deterrent to \u201cbad\u201d journalism.That\u2019s a rosy view, but again, I don\u2019t quite buy it wholesale. Do I agree with every story Gawker chooses to publish? No. Do I think they do good journalism? Absolutely. Do I think people with money will use a tactic such as Thiel\u2019s for only its \u201cproper\u201d and intended purpose of eliminating the wrong in the world? No way, Jos\u00e9.Advertisement"}

There was only one film, Warner Bros.\u2019s \u201cHot Pursuit,\u201d that contained a transgender character, the group said.There were no lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender characters in any film produced by Disney or Paramount in 2015.Racial diversity fell sharply in 2015 too, the report said. White characters made up 72.3 percent of the total while people of color made up 25.5 percent, compared with 31.1 percent the year before.The report found 47 gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender characters in films produced by the seven studios, an increase from 28 in 2014.(Because this is Hollywood, one character in 2015, or 2.1 percent of the total, was not human: Fabian, a flamboyant makeup artist who is also an egg, in the Lionsgate film \u201cHuevos: Little Rooster\u2019s Egg-cellent Adventure.\u201d)\u201cLeaving L.G.B.T. people out of the picture \u2014 or including them only as a punch line \u2014 keeps old prejudices alive and creates an unsafe environment, not only here in America, but around the world where most audiences see these depictions,\u201d Ms. Ellis said. \u201cHollywood must do better to improve the messages they are sending.\u201dThe group gave higher marks to programs on the small screens, where streaming services like Netflix and Amazon produced critically acclaimed shows such as \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d and \u201cTransparent\u201d that contain diverse casts of fully realized gay and transgender characters, the report said.Ms. Ellis said that in the future her organization would judge Hollywood based on the standard set by \u201cthe steady and remarkable changes in the television landscape.\u201d\u201cIt is clear that what we once considered \u2018adequate\u2019 from the film industry is no longer adequate at all,\u201d she said. \u201cThe film industry must embrace new stories reflective of the actual world if it wants to remain competitive and relevant.\u201dslide showAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Traveler\u2019s Guide to Taking a Smartphone Abroad", "Date": "2016-05-25", "News": "Supported byTech FixThe summer travel season will soon be upon us, with notions of escape, unplugging and faraway lands.But while the idea of disconnecting from technology when abroad seems relaxing, the stress of visiting a foreign country without a smartphone connection can quickly counteract the benefits of a digital detox. After landing in an unfamiliar place, you may realize that an inability to look up mobile maps or places to eat on a phone can be crippling. Relying on a printed tourist guide may feel primitive and immediately inform muggers that you are holding lots of cash.So what to do? There are two ways to take your cellphone abroad and get data \u2014 the frugal way and the pay-full-price way. The inexpensive method involves some tinkering and planning ahead, while the full-price way is easy but requires paying even more money to your carrier.First, the full-price option. For many years, American wireless customers have been able to pay extra to their carrier for international roaming, or the ability to seamlessly use a foreign network. Among other options, AT&T sells an international package with a modest amount of data (800 megabytes, enough to last about a week) for $120, and Verizon Wireless charges $10 a day for roaming in many countries. And in recent years, T-Mobile USA and Sprint began offering free international roaming, but with a caveat: The data speeds are very slow.Toni Toikka, chief executive of Alekstra, a research firm that analyzes cellphone bills, said he finally caved in to paying AT&T an extra $120 whenever he traveled abroad after growing tired of juggling multiple cellphones and SIM cards when in Europe and New York.\u201cAfter all the frustration, they finally got me,\u201d Mr. Toikka said. Paying AT&T or Verizon some extra money is the most convenient option for taking a smartphone abroad, he said.For frugal travelers, there are some smart alternatives if they are willing to do a bit of homework.To get a good deal, bring an \u201cunlocked\u201d smartphone, which is a phone not restricted to use with one carrier, into a foreign carrier\u2019s store, buy a data package and insert its SIM card into the phone. (In wireless industry jargon, these are called prepaid international SIM cards.) Even better, some overseas carriers let you order a SIM card ahead of time so you can get it before your trip or have it delivered to your hotel.Here is a guide to taking your smartphone abroad on the cheap, including analyses by Alekstra on the costs of mobile services in five popular travel destinations: China, Japan, Britain, France and Spain.First and foremost, to use a foreign carrier\u2019s SIM card, you usually have to unlock your smartphone or buy a cheap unlocked phone. Typically, when you buy a new smartphone, it comes locked so you can use it with only one carrier. After you have fully paid off the phone, you can ask the carrier unlock it.If you get a foreign SIM card, you will be using a different phone number from your regular one. To simplify taking a smartphone abroad, we recommend ignoring traditional phone and texting services and relying on free communication services that rely purely on data connections.Apple iPhones include iMessage and FaceTime, services for sending messages and placing calls over a data connection. If someone wants to contact you, tell them to use one of those services.Once you have freed your smartphone of carrier restrictions and downloaded a messaging app, it\u2019s time to find a service package for wherever you are traveling. Mr. Toikka recommends buying service from well-known carriers in each country because they are more reliable than off-brand carriers.For China, the big carriers are China Mobile and China Unicom. Both carriers sell a package in their stores that includes one gigabyte of data for $20.40 \u2014 enough for a two-week trip.For a longer visit, you might consider the two-gigabyte package offered by both carriers for $24.90.In Japan, Mr. Toikka recommended considering the carrier eConnect. It sells a one-gigabyte package that can be used for 15 days for $25.95. For a longer visit, it offers a three-gigabyte package for $40.64 that is valid for 30 days.In Spain, Vodafone offers three cheap options in its stores. Its one-gigabyte package costs $11.20, the 1.5 gigabyte option costs $16.80, and the two-gigabyte option costs $22.40. Each of the packages works for 30 days. We would recommend the one-gigabyte option for a one-week trip, the 1.5-gigabyte package for a two- to three-week trip and the two-gigabyte option for a four-week visit.In Britain, the carrier EE offers a handful of options in its stores, including a two-gigabyte package for $21.75 and a four-gigabyte package for $36.25. Both plans are valid for 30 days.We recommend foreign SIM cards with a few caveats. If you are traveling to multiple countries \u2014 among Britain, France and Spain, for example \u2014 you will need a separate SIM card for each country, and the costs will add up quickly. In that situation, contacting AT&T and Verizon to set up international roaming or tolerating T-Mobile and Sprint\u2019s slow data speeds may be better than the extra trouble of juggling multiple SIMs.Otherwise, you can save a lot of money and get a lot more high-speed data by planning ahead and buying a foreign SIM card.Because of an editing error, an article on the Personal Tech pages on Thursday about traveling abroad with a smartphone misstated the recommended data option for visitors to Spain. It is one gigabyte for one week and 1.5 gigabytes for a two- to three-week trip, not 1.5 gigabytes for a one-week visit and two gigabytes for a two- to three-week visit.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brazilian Lawmaker Behind Rousseff Impeachment Is Told to Step Down", "Date": "2016-05-05", "News": "Supported byThe decision added to the political turmoil in Brazil, a country deeply divided over its scandal-plagued leaders. Just this week, Vice President Michel Temer, the man preparing to take over the president\u2019s office from Ms. Rousseff, was ordered to pay a fine for violating campaign financing limits.The twin decisions are not expected to save Ms. Rousseff\u2019s presidency. Support for her ouster remains strong in the Senate, which is preparing to vote next week on whether to remove her from office and put her on trial over claims of budgetary manipulation.Still, the decisions tarnish the men in line to take over from her. Despite his conviction, Mr. Temer is still expected to become president if Ms. Rousseff is removed by the Senate. Yet the ruling could make him ineligible to run for elected office for eight years, creating an unusual situation in which a politician who may be barred from campaigning ends up running the country.Brazil is in the midst of its deepest political crisis in decades, with its president facing impeachment proceedings and many in Congress facing criminal or corruption charges.Scholars and political analysts described the initial ruling by Justice Zavascki, which the 11-member court later endorsed, as reflecting the capacity for Brazil\u2019s legal system to curb abuses of power. Joaquim Barbosa, a former chief justice of the Supreme Court, called the move \u201cextraordinary and courageous.\u201dThe ruling to remove Mr. Cunha, an evangelical Christian radio commentator, sidelines a top political opponent of Ms. Rousseff after much of his role in impeachment process had been completed. The impeachment decision is now in the hands of the Senate, which is expected to vote against the president on May 11.Mr. Cunha can appeal the ruling against him, and he is expected to do so. A spokesman for Mr. Temer said he would not appeal his conviction and would pay a fine of about $23,000. (Mr. Temer, 75, has already signaled that if he were to become president, he would not run for re-election.)In a statement, Mr. Temer\u2019s office said that he had exceeded the limit for campaign donations because of a \u201ccalculation error.\u201d Mr. Temer\u2019s office also said that he would become ineligible to run for office only if another court chose to act on the electoral court\u2019s ruling.In the lower house, attention now shifts to Waldir Maranh\u00e3o, an obscure ally of Mr. Cunha poised to take over as speaker. Like Mr. Cunha, Mr. Maranh\u00e3o is under investigation on graft charges, raising the possibility that the Supreme Court could also order him to step down.Dilma Rousseff, Brazil\u2019s president, is facing removal from office. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the proceedings.The legal clouds around Mr. Cunha and Mr. Temer raise concerns over the legitimacy of a possible government led by their centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, which recently broke an alliance with Ms. Rousseff\u2019s leftist Workers\u2019 Party to seek her impeachment.The ruling involving Mr. Temer was issued on Tuesday in a case before an electoral court in S\u00e3o Paulo. In that case, prosecutors were trying to increase the fine against him over campaign donations he made in 2014. The court decided against increasing the fine, but it upheld the ruling that Mr. Temer had violated campaign finance laws.Mr. Temer said this week that he saw no problem naming such politicians to his cabinet, maintaining that they were innocent until proven guilty.D\u00e9bora Nogueira and Paula Moura contributed reporting from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.Advertisement"}

A few years ago, another outpost opened in Chelsea, one block from a Whole Foods that had been in operation for more than a decade. Simultaneously, of course, came the guerrilla incursions from FreshDirect and Blue Apron and the countless other three-steps-to-vegetarian-cassoulet meal-delivery services that the Internet economy has facilitated.Arguably, though, Fairway has also fallen victim to a culture of increasingly tiered consumer experiences, for which it remains almost too quaintly ecumenical. Beginning in the 1990s, with the growth of stores like Target, cultural commentators spoke often of the democratization of design \u2014 the phrase was trotted out to the point of linguistic abuse \u2014 a reference to the notion that clothes, teapots, place mats and so on, created to the standards of elite tastes, were now available to a mass audience. If you had money and you were hip, you expressed your renegade affluence by positioning a West Elm vase on top of a $20,000 Biedermeier chest. In some sense, however, rising inequality has pushed the trend toward a reversal. In a city where $4 million apartments are so common that they begin to seem modest, shopping down risks an affliction of heightened status anxiety.Recently a friend sent me a photograph of an empty aisle at a Fairway on the Upper East Side, taken on a weekday evening at 5:30, when the store should have been flooded with shoppers waiting in line to buy wild Alaskan salmon on their way home to watch \u201cThe Night Manager.\u201d A large \u201cBig Sale\u201d sign loomed ominously. I held this image in my mind against the one I have of the Dean & DeLuca on Madison Avenue in the 80s, which I have never seen short of full \u2014 full of uniformed private-school children getting cookies in the afternoon, full of grown men and women in Barbour coats and Burberry and Herm\u00e8s nearly at every other time.Architects and urban planners say that, around the world, retail space will eventually be colonized by food vendors, because no matter how many rolls of toilet paper or value packs of LED light bulbs or 10-ply cashmere sweaters we can buy on Amazon, we, as human beings, will always crave the tactile pleasure of buying food when we are in front of it.Fairway catered to that instinct well. What the \u201cmarket like no other\u201d underestimated was the growing desire to feel as if you are living in the pages of Elle Decor when you are buying dried fruit.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Police and Tech Giants Wrangle Over Encryption on Capitol Hill", "Date": "2016-05-08", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the district attorney of Manhattan, visited Washington late last month to argue his case on a pressing issue: encryption.\u201cI wanted to express a sense of urgency around resolution of this issue,\u201d Mr. Vance said in an interview about his Washington visit.Law enforcement officials immediately announced their support of the bill and began to push lawmakers to back it. Trade groups representing tech companies like Apple and Facebook have flooded into congressional offices, sent letters expressing concerns that the bill weakens consumer privacy and security, and delivered scorching speeches about the proposals.\u201cThis is an escalating fight,\u201d said Robert D. Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a research firm based in Washington that is funded by tech companies including Google and Microsoft. \u201cIt\u2019s become the focus now in Washington, with hearings and legislative activity.\u201dLaw enforcement officials blame tech companies for creating the impasse.\u201cThere\u2019s no question our relationship with the tech industry has gotten worse, and now it seems like the tech industry is taking every opportunity they have to put up obstacles in our way, including trying to derail legislative efforts that would give law enforcement what they need to keep people safe,\u201d said Terrence Cunningham, president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police.\u201cToday, terrorists and criminals are increasingly using encryption to foil law enforcement efforts, even in the face of a court order,\u201d Senator Feinstein said in a statement about the draft bill. \u201cWe need strong encryption to protect personal data, but we also need to know when terrorists are plotting to kill Americans.\u201dThe rhetoric in Washington around encryption has grown increasingly sharp. Last month, when the contents of the draft encryption bill were leaked, the president of the Consumer Technology Association, a trade group that counts Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon among its 4,000 members, spoke to an audience filled with government officials at a lunch hosted by the Media Institute.The bill is \u201cdangerously overreaching and technically unsophisticated,\u201d said Gary Shapiro, president of the association. \u201cThis bill would essentially make effective cybersecurity illegal in the United States, pushing companies that take cybersecurity seriously offshore.\u201dOther tech trade groups, including Reform Government Surveillance and the Business Software Alliance, have also waded into the fray, sending critical letters and meeting with senators to warn of the dangers of the bill. And Silicon Valley executives have, in increasing numbers, made the trek to Washington to make their cases directly.Bob Lord, chief information security officer at Yahoo, visited several members of Congress in late April to talk about the technology behind encryption and to warn of the \u201cunintended consequences\u201d of legislation that could weaken security. While he did not specifically mention the Burr-Feinstein bill, he emphasized how consumers and human rights activists worldwide depend on encrypted technology for their safety and privacy.\u201cThe notion that we would weaken encryption or provide back doors, those suggestions will have unintended consequences,\u201d Mr. Lord said.Law enforcement officials, in turn, have frequently met with the same lawmakers in the Senate and House intelligence, judiciary and commerce committees who are being targeted by the tech companies, according to congressional staff members. Chief Cunningham and other members of the police chiefs\u2019 group have talked with Mr. Burr and Ms. Feinstein, given opinions during the drafting of the legislation and hosted panels on encryption for House and Senate lawmakers.Tech companies have turned to certain politicians to champion their cause, such as Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon. On the day the draft encryption bill was introduced, Mr. Wyden, who voted against the 2012 copyright bills known as the Stop Online Piracy Act and the Protect Intellectual Property Act, which were also opposed by the tech industry, said he had been flooded with calls from tech companies wanting to know what he would do.Mr. Wyden said he intended to filibuster the proposal. He has since met with Intelligence Committee members to persuade them to kill the bill.\u201cI have not filibustered many issues, but I think the stakes are enormous,\u201d Mr. Wyden said in an interview. \u201cThe bill as written is a lose-lose, because it will create less security, American families will be less safe, and your liberty and privacy will be damaged.\u201dFor all the lobbying, few lawmakers have expressed their views on the encryption bill.\u201cI\u2019m reserving judgment,\u201d said Senator King, who met with Mr. Vance last month. \u201cThe issues are so complex, it\u2019s like trying to nail Jell-O to the wall.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Economic Promises a President Trump Could (and Couldn\u2019t) Keep", "Date": "2016-05-21", "News": "Supported byIn the hills and hollows of Mingo County, W.Va., where unemployment is nearly triple the national average, it\u2019s coal. On the southwest side of Chicago, where the landscape couldn\u2019t be more different but the economic fears are much the same, it\u2019s Oreo cookies. Elsewhere, it is cars, computers and air-conditioners.And whether it is through rolling back regulations, imposing tariffs or making some none-too-discreet phone calls from the Oval Office to the C-suites, Donald J. Trump has vowed to bring back the vanishing jobs of miners, bakers and assembly-line workers, beginning on Day 1 of his administration.\u201cIt\u2019s going to happen fast,\u201d Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, recently told a cheering crowd in Charleston, W.Va. \u201cThis is so easy.\u201dIf only that were true.For all of the appeal his message might have for residents there (Mr. Trump captured almost 90 percent of the vote in Mingo County), much of what he is promising to do \u2014 on his own, and through congressional legislation \u2014 couldn\u2019t be accomplished in the first 1,000 days of a Trump administration, much less the first 100.For example, Mr. Trump has suggested easing clean-air regulations enacted by Democrats and Republicans alike that have hurt the coal industry. But King Coal is unlikely to ever recapture market share lost in recent years to natural gas made cheap by the fracking boom, not to mention fast-growing alternative energy sources like wind and solar.Nor could Mr. Trump, a billionaire businessman, force steel makers to buy coal from Appalachia to heat furnaces in Asia, Europe and North America that have been idled by weak demand.\u201cI will not say he can\u2019t do anything, but it\u2019s very unlikely he\u2019ll be able to restore coal to where it was,\u201d said John Deskins, director of the West Virginia University Bureau of Business and Economic Research. With production and employment in the mines down by about a third since 2008, Mr. Deskins said, \u201ceven in our most optimistic scenario, we don\u2019t expect a big bounce back.\u201dOf course, a Trump presidency is far from certain. And any president\u2019s sway over the national economy is debatable.But a big part of what has gotten Mr. Trump this far are his outsize promises. And while the case of coal and clean air illustrates the limits of a president\u2019s power in the economic arena, there are other places where Mr. Trump would have considerably more room to maneuver.Like much of his speechifying, Mr. Trump\u2019s economic and business agenda is a mixture of opening bids and dog-whistle messages as well as some nuts-and-bolts proposals he might be able to put in effect as president, even without congressional approval. Sorting out what\u2019s what, though, isn\u2019t simple or safe. Just ask the pundits who wrote off Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy as a sideshow even as he won one primary after another.For his part, Mr. Trump warns it would be a mistake to underestimate his ability to change the rules of the game.\u201cIn my whole life, I\u2019ve gotten things done,\u201d he said in an interview on Saturday. \u201cWhether it\u2019s getting a city built on the West Side of Manhattan or getting zoning board approvals, my whole life has been finding a consensus.\u201dBut when it comes to companies moving jobs out of the United States, he said a tougher tone was in order.\u201cI\u2019m not Obama, and there are stupid people in our government,\u201d he said. \u201cWith me, there will be consequences if you move, and the consequences will be severe.\u201dIn terms of coal and recovering all of those vanished jobs in West Virginia, Mr. Trump acknowledged that price competition from cheaper natural gas was fierce.\u201cBut coal is still less expensive, and it has a major place in terms of energy,\u201d he said. And regulatory relief \u2014 whether in terms of environmental rules or workplace safety \u2014 would benefit the industry, he said.\u201cI have become very well versed on coal,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThe regulations are brutal, and they are sending inspectors into the mines two and three times a day. Even the miners say it\u2019s out of control.\u201dIn law firms, corporate boardrooms, lobbyist watering holes and think tanks in Washington and beyond, experts are quietly assessing what a Trump presidency might actually look like in practice. Or to put it more bluntly, business is business. So whether they find Mr. Trump politically abhorrent or a welcome antidote to the status quo, these insiders also want to know what he might mean for their bottom line.National debate: \u201cTrump would put the bully in bully pulpit.\u201dPerhaps the greatest opportunity for Mr. Trump lies in the extraordinary ability of any president to direct the tone and contours of the national debate, especially on issues he has highlighted, like how American companies should treat their American workers. And unlike most past Republican candidates, Mr. Trump has not been reluctant to criticize big business on that topic.\u201cDonald Trump would put the bully in bully pulpit,\u201d said Seth Harris, who served as a top official in the Labor Department under Democratic presidents.Immigration: \u201cWhere the president\u2019s power is least restricted.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a reason why so many of Trump\u2019s proposals revolve around the idea of denying visas to people,\u201d said William A. Stock, a lawyer in Philadelphia who is the president-elect of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. \u201cThat\u2019s where the president\u2019s power is least restricted, if he asserts it.\u201dThe Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, Mr. Stock said, gives the president \u201cthe ability to suspend the entry of foreign nationals whose entry is deemed to be detrimental to the interests of the U.S.\u201dNoting that recent administrations have invoked the law to forbid entry to individuals from the former Yugoslavia accused of human rights violations, as well as to Cuban and Iranian government officials, Mr. Stock said, \u201cThis is a tool that is pretty powerful, but it\u2019s usually been used in more limited instances.\u201dFinancial reform: \u201cWhen it comes to regulation, people are policy.\u201dRepealing the law might be difficult, but experts who helped draft the regulations agreed that Mr. Trump could defang them through selective enforcement \u2014 appointing different officials to the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission \u2014 and by issuing new executive orders.A President Trump would have wide latitude to name his own people to oversee less conspicuous but powerful agencies like the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and to seed Treasury and other government departments with like-minded officials.\u201cWhen it comes to regulation, people are policy,\u201d said Aaron Klein, a top official at the Treasury Department from 2009 to 2012 and helped draft the Dodd-Frank bill. \u201cRegulators who don\u2019t want to regulate can thwart the will of Congress.\u201dBut the president\u2019s reach isn\u2019t unlimited. Nor is it speedy. And however stupendous Mr. Trump\u2019s deal-making skills may be, the forces of gridlock in the nation\u2019s capital are no less awesome.\u201cThe system doesn\u2019t change,\u201d said Tom Korologos, a longtime Republican strategist and an adviser at the law firm DLA Piper in Washington. \u201cTrump can say, \u2018I\u2019m going to repeal this or I\u2019m going to repeal that,\u2019 but it\u2019s going to take longer than 100 days.\u201dMr. Korologos, who served on the transition teams of President Ronald Reagan and President George W. Bush, isn\u2019t supporting Mr. Trump this year. He added that while the presumptive Republican nominee\u2019s promises might make \u201cfor nice talking points, it will be harder than he thinks.\u201dTax cuts: A Republican Congress is unlikely to accept a $10 trillion deficit over 10 years.That\u2019s especially true when it comes to the macroeconomic picture. Mr. Trump claims his proposal for sweeping tax cuts for individuals and businesses wouldn\u2019t bust the budget and could lift the economy\u2019s annual growth rate to 6 percent.More sober-minded experts say that\u2019s magical thinking, a 2016 version of \u201cvoodoo economics,\u201d as President George H. W. Bush famously described what came to be known as Reaganomics in the 1980s. They estimate Mr. Trump\u2019s tax plan could create a $10 trillion shortfall at the Treasury over the next decade, and note that annual economic growth has topped 5 percent only once in the last 35 years.\u201cI have a hard time believing that even a Republican Congress would enact his tax plan, because it would create enormous deficits,\u201d said William G. Gale, an economist under the first President Bush who is now co-director of the Tax Policy Center in Washington.Mr. Trump responded that \u201cthose tax cuts go hand in hand with many other things.\u201dAs a result of getting tough on trade policy and what he considers currency manipulation by China, Mr. Trump argues that more jobs would return to the United States, which in turn would spur economic growth and therefore tax revenues.Whether or not that\u2019s realistic, any significant alteration in trade or tax policy means winning over the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee, both of which zealously guard their turf. \u201cThis is what makes them tick,\u201d Mr. Korologos said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take more than just a bunch of rhetoric to change things.\u201dLabor: An ebb and flow when administrations change hands in Washington.Like Mr. Korologos, Mr. Harris, the former Labor Department official, has seen the ebb and flow when administrations change hands in Washington. Except he was on the opposite side of the aisle, having served on the Democratic transition teams after President Bill Clinton was elected in 1992 and after President Obama\u2019s victory in 2008.At Labor, where he was a top adviser under Mr. Clinton, and then as deputy secretary in the Obama administration, Mr. Harris saw firsthand just how much influence the president could have.Tasked with enforcing regulations on whether companies are abiding by minimum wage requirements, child labor restrictions, affirmative action guidelines, workplace safety rules and a web of other laws, Mr. Harris said, the Labor Department has never been very popular with big business or the Republican candidates it supports.And when George W. Bush succeeded Bill Clinton, the change was swift, Mr. Harris said. Budgets were cut, and travel to inspect factories and mines decreased. There was less emphasis on enforcement, going into workplaces and punishing violations, he said, and more on educating employers about potential infractions.After Mr. Harris returned to the Labor Department in 2009, budgets were increased, and surprise workplace inspections were resumed.\u201cWe investigated more deeply, enforced procedures, and were more likely to find violations,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was no executive order or action by Congress or the White House. We just did it. The laws existed \u2014 it was a matter of whether you were going to solve the problem aggressively or be more passive.\u201dRepublicans, including Mr. Trump, have long argued that regulatory zeal kills jobs and undermines economic growth. Democrats maintain it is necessary to protect employees from abuses and risks, while imposing checks on the power of big companies.Both arguments contain elements of truth. But Mr. Harris said that what was critical was that rank-and-file civil servants quickly adapted to the message coming down from the Oval Office.\u201cThe president sets the tone for how our government is going to relate to our country,\u201d said Mr. Harris, who is now a lawyer in private practice in Washington. \u201cHow the laws are implemented and enforced, how the money is spent and how motivated people are to do their job.\u201dHealth care: \u201cSelling insurance isn\u2019t like selling credit cards.\u201dDodd-Frank isn\u2019t the only big Obama-era law Mr. Trump has talked about repealing. The other prominent target of Mr. Trump\u2019s ire \u2014 the Affordable Care Act \u2014 would be trickier to dispose of.The problem, said Nicholas Bagley, a professor of law at the University of Michigan, is that insurers don\u2019t want to do it because it\u2019s not practical. \u201cSelling insurance isn\u2019t like selling credit cards,\u201d Mr. Bagley said. \u201cOut-of-state health insurers don\u2019t have networks of doctors and hospitals in place. The problem isn\u2019t legal restraints, and it\u2019s not a solution to what ails the health care economy.\u201dMr. Trump responded that deregulation is still the answer, despite the skepticism of experts like Mr. Bagley.\u201cThe problem is rules, regulations and restrictions,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have rate increases that are catastrophic, and the deductibles are so high people can\u2019t even use the health care. If it was really open and you got competition going, amazing things will happen.\u201dEnvironment: Sending \u201ca chill down the spine\u201d of people who enforce the laws.Environmental regulation offers a more promising target for Mr. Trump, who has called the Environmental Protection Agency a laughingstock and a disgrace, and has promised to cut its budget.In fact, in the absence of congressional action, the Trump administration could target many other environmental regulations by simply going after the people who enforce them, said Don Barry, who spent two decades at the Interior Department and directed the United States Fish and Wildlife Service under President Clinton.Decades later, Mr. Barry still recalls how a round of firings in the Interior Department at the dawn of the Reagan administration signaled a turnabout in policy. \u201cThe single biggest thing they can do is send a chill down the spine of career survivors in the bureaucracy and bring things to a halt,\u201d he said.Similarly, a Trump administration might be willing to approve state environmental plans that are more friendly to fossil fuels, said Kevin Book, head of research at ClearView Energy Partners. Proposed, but not completed, clean-water regulations aimed at restricting mountaintop-removal mining for coal in West Virginia could be eased, he said.Trade: Trump can punish countries, but jobs are unlikely to return.Still, even if Mr. Trump were to win in November and roll back some environmental regulations, it wouldn\u2019t significantly alter the fate of Mingo County and much of the nation\u2019s depressed coal industry.\u201cTaking a more lenient stance on clean-air or clean-water rules would do nothing to help coal demand,\u201d Mr. Book said. \u201cCoal-fired power plants have been mothballed and are being disassembled, and that capacity is gone. It\u2019s not even close to something you could reverse by administrative fiat.\u201dIf Washington\u2019s ability to gridlock even the most ambitious of presidential agendas were to block Mr. Trump\u2019s White House plans, he would still have the bully pulpit, of course. And unlike Theodore Roosevelt, who coined that term, Mr. Trump probably wouldn\u2019t speak softly.Announced in July 2015, the Nabisco layoffs in Chicago continued during the Illinois primary in March, despite jabs from Mr. Trump and both Democratic presidential contenders, Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders.United Technologies is similarly unlikely to rethink Carrier\u2019s move out of Indianapolis. And in an era when Apple is willing to fight the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to unlock an iPhone on national security grounds, more corporate defiance may become the norm.Blanketing countries from China to Mexico with import duties would be a tall order without congressional approval. The White House, though, does retain plenty of leeway to punish countries it thinks are engaged in currency manipulation, dumping of products below the cost of production and other free-trade abuses.The problem for Mr. Trump \u2014 or any president who wants to get tough on trade violators \u2014 is that, in the global economy, imposing tariffs on competitors abroad could have serious economic consequences at home by sharply raising prices on imported goods.Cheaper flat-screen televisions, computers, clothes, furniture and other products from Walmart, Amazon and elsewhere have been a rare bright spot for struggling working- and middle-class Americans. And trade wars cut both ways: Retaliatory tariffs on American-made products from countries like China would prompt howls of pain at still strong domestic manufacturers like Caterpillar and Boeing.But for all the uncertainty around what might happen after Jan. 20, 2017, the lawyers and lobbyists who are now trying to gauge a Trump presidency are already emerging as winners. Mr. Trump\u2019s much-talked-about unpredictability, Mr. Korologos said, is proving to be a boon for Washington\u2019s legions of lobbyists.\u201cCorporate America hates the unknown,\u201d he said. \u201cGod only knows what the hell Trump is for. And corporate America is going to want someone to save them.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And if too much of Gawker survives, Mr. Thiel, with an estimated net worth of $2.7 billion, indicates he will keep financing anti-Gawker lawsuits to kill off whatever is left.Mr. Thiel\u2019s campaign is in keeping with the pledge his favored candidate for president, Donald J. Trump, made to ease barriers to lawsuits against journalists. But it is actually the flip side of the media realm\u2019s new coin. Many of his fellow billionaires have gained control of news organizations by buying them or starting them.Of course, powerful media executives have long been part of the global fabric. Rupert Murdoch, the News Corporation executive chairman, has been at it for decades, and his influence over his news group has taken on mythical status.And long before Mr. Murdoch, there was one William Randolph Hearst, who defined what it meant to be a media mogul.But there is a difference between Hearst and the many billionaires who are trying to control today\u2019s news media, said David Nasaw, the author of the great Hearst biography \u201cThe Chief: The Life of William Randolph Hearst.\u201d \u201cHearst made it abundantly clear \u2014 \u2018This is my newspaper, these are my views, take or leave it,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cHearst put his editorials on the front page, with his picture, and he signed them, for God\u2019s sake.\u201dMr. Nasaw, on the other hand, sees Mr. Adelson as \u201cdissembling\u201d when he says he isn\u2019t involving himself in editorial decisions at the paper. And then there are the Silicon Valley moguls, he said, who \u201ctry to have it both ways \u2014 they try to say, you know, \u2018Oh no we\u2019re playing by the rules and we\u2019re not indulging in our personal whims.\u2019\u201dThat\u2019s because Facebook has something Hearst never had: power over the distribution of content from most major American news organizations, which increasingly rely on exposure to the huge audience Facebook provides. Facebook has said no one person or even group of people controls what news its algorithmic formulas spit out for individual news feeds.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple, Set to Move to Its Spaceship, Should Try More Moonshots", "Date": "2016-05-04", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtApple is running out of parking spaces. If you drop by its Infinite Loop headquarters, you will find the place stretched beyond capacity. Even the valets, who double and triple-park the Teslas and Porsches that now flock to the world\u2019s most valuable company, have given up finding free spots.That is still true. Several analysts project that over the next year, Apple\u2019s iPhone sales will return to slow growth rather than decline, which should keep its bottom line at its current stratospheric level.But you don\u2019t build spaceship-shaped corporate monuments on the prospect of doing just fine. The deeper question is whether Apple can keep its place as the North Star of the tech firmament. Can the company build the next great platform in computing, as it did the last one? Are its best days ahead of it, as Timothy D. Cook, the chief executive, insists \u2014 or is the new campus the capstone of an era of Apple dominance that we will never see again?I will offer a suggestion. To thrive in the next era of tech, Apple needs to take a series of bigger, bolder risks.But the next moment in tech is likely to be dominated by data-driven online services \u2014 more products like Siri and Apple Pay, fewer stand-alone hardware innovations like the iPhone.In that environment, the slow search for precision and perfection might no longer be in Apple\u2019s best interest. Mr. Cook\u2019s goal, now, should be to alter Apple\u2019s governing ethos to induce a small measure of chaos into his company.It is likely that Apple is already working on some bold plans in secret (a car and a pay TV service are among several that have long been reported). The shift I\u2019m calling for would not be radical, just evolutionary. It should be more nimble and slightly more public with its experiments, and push more of them out sooner. When it releases stuff, it should move faster to fix and improve what is wrong. Above all, it should take more risks; it should say yes more often.These changes will be difficult because they could upset Apple\u2019s customer base and its brand. Experimenting more means failing more, usually in public. Failing means looking bad, and looking bad isn\u2019t something Apple does well.In this environment, the best new products are not likely to be obvious. They will most likely be ridiculed at first and they may actually be kind of useless in early versions. But over time, with brainstorming and updates based on consumer feedback, you might discover something precious.Apple has accumulated many of the pieces to create technologies of the future. It has expertise in voice recognition, data mining, wearables, and of course, hardware and software design. Most importantly, it also has a huge installed base of users who willingly try its newest products.What it doesn\u2019t have quite yet is enough of an appetite for the speed and risks that come with creating and maintaining new services. Some of its sins here have been unforgivable. Siri was one of the earliest voice-recognition technologies released to the public. It wasn\u2019t perfect when it came out and Apple has made slow improvements over time. Today\u2019s Siri is vastly more powerful than yesterday\u2019s.But it still feels like a missed opportunity. There is so much Siri should be able to do that it cannot. Why can\u2019t Siri plug into more parts of my phone? Why can\u2019t it tap into the Uber app to call a car for me, or start up HBO Now when I say, \u201cHey, show me last week\u2019s \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019?\u201dI\u2019m not sure I quite buy Mr. Thompson\u2019s thesis about the cause of some of Apple\u2019s mistakes in its online services. It is not clear that Apple needs a wholesale restructuring rather than simply a greater push from Mr. Cook to be bolder in these products.It is important to note, too, that Apple has very patient customers and that the overall value of its ecosystem often makes up for particular deficits in some of its services. Consider Apple Music, a subscription music service that offered no great improvements over competing services like Spotify. Yet despite being late to market and not as pleasant to use as rivals, Apple Music has snapped up 13 million subscribers paying $120 a year.\u201cIt\u2019s already become a $2 billion business, and it did not exist last year,\u201d said Kulbinder Garcha, an analyst at Credit Suisse who has said that Apple can realize significant growth in its profits by creating and improving online services. If Apple moves quickly to fix some of the problems with Apple Music \u2014 cleaning up its user interface, adding handy features like Spotify\u2019s in-app lyrics browser \u2014 it could easily build on that early growth.\u201cThese things don\u2019t have to be a hit from day one, but what\u2019s important is that they keep learning from their mistakes and keep updating them,\u201d Mr. Garcha said. In other words, Be faster, take more risks, go bold.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Farhad and Mike\u2019s Week in Tech: The Unstoppable Facebook", "Date": "2016-04-30", "News": "Supported byBitsSo you cover Facebook. Tell me, why are they doing so well? More important, can anything stop them?For one, we cannot stress enough just how well Facebook handled the broad consumer shift from using a desktop computer to get to the web to now using smartphones as our gateways to pretty much everything on the Internet. The entire industry was caught off guard by the success of iPhone and Android, and absolutely no one was prepared for how to make money on the phone.That killed \u2014 or at least deeply wounded \u2014 quite a few successful companies. Remember Zynga? That place was raking in the cash from FarmVille-loving moms on the desktop. Suddenly, everyone is playing Candy Crush Saga on the iPhone and all those cash crops are lying fallow. Zynga still hasn\u2019t recovered or found a viable way out.Anyway, Facebook nailed mobile ads in the news feed, and now 82 percent of the company\u2019s ad revenue comes from people viewing those ads on smartphones. That\u2019s a shift in just a few years, and it\u2019s insane.Facebook endured, I think, because it understood that its appeal was primal and wasn\u2019t dependent on format: People wanted to see what was going on with their friends and frenemies from whatever device they used. Kind of like how you and I can\u2019t stop chatting no matter what machine we\u2019re on.No one puts Zuck in the corner, ever again.That means huge gambles on acquiring start-ups like Oculus, the virtual reality company, and WhatsApp, the messaging app, for billions upon billions of dollars.I\u2019m nervous to give Facebook too much in the way of props, only because it\u2019s already a lovefest with analysts and what goes up must eventually come down. I think Isaac Newton said that. Or Gordon Gekko.Anyway, for now, Facebook is still the company to beat. I guess they get to keep taking victory laps.Advertisement"}

(The Museum of Modern Art acquired a painting last year.)Mr. Glimcher said that next season Pace would present a show of Mr. Schnabel\u2019s new work, which will also be featured in its booth at Art Basel next month: purple paintings made from photographic images of the patterns in his studio floor that have been transferred to canvas.\u201cJulian is a person who needs a lot of attention,\u201d Mr. Glimcher said. \u201cAnd this is a gallery that pays attention to artists.\u201dAn artist isn\u2019t typically rediscovered at 77.But that seems to be what\u2019s happening to Judy Chicago of \u201cThe Dinner Party\u201d fame, who is now going to be represented by Salon 94.Jill Soloway, creator of the acclaimed Amazon television series \u201cTransparent,\u201d is also making an Amazon series based on Womanhouse, the 1972 feminist art space that Ms. Chicago organized with Miriam Schapiro.\u201cI\u2019ve always loved what Judy Chicago likes to call \u2018circle pedagogy,\u2019\u201d Ms. Soloway said. \u201cLet\u2019s connect in a feminist and cooperative way.\u201dSo she visited Ms. Chicago in Albuquerque. \u201cHer archive is incredibly relevant,\u201d Ms. Rohatyn said, \u201cbut at the same time, we don\u2019t see her work out there commercially.\u201dMs. Chicago said that both developments would help her reach a major goal: \u201cOvercoming the erasure of women\u2019s achievements, including my own, and bringing them into the mainstream.\u201dIt\u2019s hard to imagine how an institution as comprehensive as the Metropolitan Museum of Art decides which pieces in its collection it no longer needs or wants. But somehow, the museum has made peace with parting with more than 600 pieces of Chinese ceramics, which it will offer at Christie\u2019s on Sept. 15 to benefit the Met\u2019s acquisition fund.\u201cWe have over 4,200 Chinese ceramics, so we\u2019re looking to thin out the collection where it\u2019s duplicative or the quality is not there, to raise funds for things we really need,\u201d said Maxwell Hearn, chairman of the Met\u2019s Asian art department, adding that the winnowing was conducted in consultation with outside experts.\u201cAbout 60 percent of the things we\u2019re deaccessioning came in 1879, so there wasn\u2019t that much scholarship, there wasn\u2019t that much discrimination,\u201d Mr. Hearn. \u201cThey\u2019ve really been extensively reviewed; most have never been exhibited or published.\u201dThe selection features Song dynasty (960-1279) Jun wares, blue-and-white porcelains from the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties, and pieces from the Kangxi (1662-1722), Yongzheng (1723-1735) and Qianlong periods (1735-1795).Many of the items have impressive provenance, including porcelains from the collection of the trustee Samuel Putnam Avery, part of the Met\u2019s first acquisition of Asian art in 1879.Under the guidelines of the American Association of Museum Directors, museums are allowed to sell works to support acquisitions, but not for operating funds.Some of the 100 etchings will be exhibited from June 2 to Aug. 21, with all of them on view during spring and summer 2018.Rendered in a neo-Classical style that the artist adapted from his studies of classical sculpture, the suite explores themes of mythology, identity and sexuality.\u201cYou see the artist as maker,\u201d said Sharon Corwin, the museum\u2019s director and chief curator. \u201cIt captures the themes and tropes that define his career.\u201dAdvertisement"}

(Secondhand sellers at the site are asking for up to $621 for their copies.) Despite a fairly robust first printing of 60,000, some booksellers have struggled to meet demand for the book, which came out on April 12. Its publisher, Grand Central, promptly ordered a second printing of 50,000 copies but doesn\u2019t expect that supply to last long, either. The company has since ordered a much bigger haul and intends to have 400,000 copies in print by summer.The oversize book, which has a list price of $40, is like catnip for \u201cHamilton\u201d addicts. It traces the evolution of the wildly successful hip-hop musical and includes the full text of the libretto, as well as more than 200 footnotes from Lin-Manuel Miranda, the show\u2019s creator and star; facsimiles of his notebook pages; and color photos from the production.Meeting demand for the book, which was written by Mr. Miranda and Jeremy McCarter, a cultural critic who was involved in the show\u2019s development, has been complicated by the elaborate production process that gives the book a Revolutionary-era feel.What\u2019s the story behind a show that\u2019s become a Broadway must-see with no marquee names, no special effects and almost no white actors? Erik Piepenburg explains, in six snapshots, why \u201cHamilton\u201d has become such a big deal.\u201cHamilton: The Revolution\u201d was designed to mimic the appearance of a text from Alexander Hamilton\u2019s era, with a ridged leather spine, Roman numerals for chapters and cream-colored lightweight paper that was a special-order stock from Asia. The books are printed in China, and reprints take approximately four to six weeks.\u201cThe thinking behind this was, how do we create something that, in its physical form and in its content, recaptures the innovation that Lin brought to the musical by reinventing a very old story for the modern day?\u201d said Charles Melcher, the chief executive and founder of Melcher Media, which produced the book for Grand Central.Of course, meeting those exacting aesthetic standards probably means lost sales in the short term. The book hit the No. 1 spot on The New York Times hardcover nonfiction best-seller list last week but has already slipped to No. 4, probably because of its limited availability. It has also fallen on Amazon, from No. 1 on April 13 to No. 20 on Tuesday. And as an intricately designed physical object, the book doesn\u2019t translate well digitally.

It wasn\u2019t like we just pulled up, unloaded our truck and started a business.\u201dThe Gatanas family has operated plant businesses around the city since the 1950s, when Mr. Gatanas\u2019s grandfather, Dimitri Gravanis, an immigrant from Greece, opened a shop at 89th Street and Madison Avenue. When the development corporation put out its request for proposals, Mr. Gatanas was running a struggling garden center in the Bronx. When he heard that a space in Manhattan might be available, he \u201csaw a glimmer of light.\u201d\u201cI saw asphalt, stanchions, and I thought, \u2018What a great place for a garden center,\u2019\u201d Mr. Gatanas said.The Gatanas family signed a five-year lease with the city for the two plots in 2010, with a five-year extension.Mr. Gatanas said it took about a year to get a mailing address, which was critical not only for setting up simple things like an Amazon account, but also for banking transactions.

People donated tools and machinery in various states of working order. There were old vehicles and two trailers, one of which was used as an office, and another filled with, among other things, Mr. Gatanas\u2019s collection of gardening books.Mr. Gatanas said the space had become unwieldy because of \u201cpoor planning.\u201d But many of the items were part of his unofficial recycling program, including piles of broken pallets that were remade into window boxes.And the garden center is hardly alone in using the space under the tracks as storage.

A stack of bills and letters, some with blackened edges, sat on the table. His mother and father, Nicholas, 77, and Aspasia, 63, who also work for the business, eventually filled the seats. Mrs. Gatanas has been fielding dozens of calls from concerned customers, and residents who know her face or see the logo on her apron have hugged her on the street.\u201cAs a family, we\u2019re embarrassed and disappointed about what\u2019s happened here,\u201d Mr. Gatanas said. \u201cWe feel bad about the businesses that closed that evening because of our mistake. And that a family had to be evacuated from the fourth-floor building nearby.\u201dMr. Gatanas said they had, at times, fallen behind on the rent, which he said was about $4,500 a month. The city has initiated eviction proceedings before, but each time, the family and the development corporation have worked out a payment arrangement.On Wednesday, the family found out they would be allowed to stay. More than a dozen officials from the Fire Department and the transportation authority spent three hours inspecting the garden center and issued several new warnings, Mr. Gatanas said. The development corporation presented the family with a new lease that raised the rent to $5,100 and also placed additional restrictions and conditions on how the lots could be used.Susan C.

{"Headline": "Cursed Films, Blessed on Blu-ray", "Date": "2016-05-13", "News": "Supported byOn DVDFilm history is filled with movies that have been mangled by their producers, maladroitly distributed and generally born under a bad sign \u2014 they are often misunderstood by critics and consequently difficult to see. But these films also hold a special place in cinephile hearts.Such films maudit (cursed films), as the French call them, can be cultist holy grails. Samuel Fuller\u2019s German telefilm \u201cDead Pigeon on Beethoven Street\u201d (1972) is one. Ivan Passer\u2019s thriller \u201cCutter\u2019s Way\u201d (1981) is another.Out on disc from Olive Films in a director\u2019s cut some 25 minutes longer than its United States release version, \u201cDead Pigeon on Beethoven Street\u201d was the first movie that Mr. Fuller \u2014 a prolific writer-director of offbeat, wildly energetic action films \u2014 made in full awareness of his paradoxical status. While washed up in Hollywood, he had become a revered figure first for French and later German and American new wave filmmakers.Given the opportunity to direct an episode for the West German TV series \u201cTatort\u201d (Crime Scene), Mr. Fuller appears to have enjoyed creative carte blanche, writing what he called a \u201ccartoon caper movie\u201d concerning an international blackmail ring in Cologne. The outfit, led by an icy professional fencer, specializes in photographing politicians in compromising positions. Intrigue follows when the ring is infiltrated by an American private eye (Glenn Corbett) representing one of the victims.\u201cDead Pigeon\u201d is self-consciously trendy in its percussive zoom shots and hyperkinetic montages, as well as casually outlandish in its locations (a shootout in a maternity ward; a cloak-and-dagger rendezvous at the Beethoven-Haus museum in Bonn; Cologne\u2019s annual carnival, in which a killer clown lurks among the costumed participants). A wink away from self-parody, Mr. Fuller evokes his own oeuvre throughout, quoting lines and recreating bits of business from previous movies. Not all are his. At one point, Mr. Corbett ducks into a movie house showing \u201cRio Bravo\u201d and cracks up at the spectacle of John Wayne speaking perfect German.The self-referential casting also has new wave flavor. The director Claude Chabrol\u2019s muse St\u00e9phane Audran is given a cameo as a glamorous lesbian named Dr. Bogdanovich (a nod to the director Peter Bogdanovich). The German filmmaker Peter Lilienthal is also present, and in his memoir \u201cA Third Face,\u201d Mr. Fuller writes that R. W. Fassbinder tried to talk his way into a part. Mr. Fuller himself appears briefly as a blackmailed American senator, but mainly \u201cDead Pigeon\u201d is a valentine addressed to Mr. Fuller\u2019s wife, the German actress Christa Lang, playing an actress turned femme fatale named Christa.As personal as it is, \u201cDead Pigeon\u201d often feels like a home movie or even a low-budget avant-garde production. Barely distributed in the United States, it even appeared in that context. I first saw \u201cDead Pigeon\u201d in late 1976. The packed one-off screening at the Collective for Living Cinema, a quasi-underground venue in Lower Manhattan, may actually have been the movie\u2019s New York theatrical premiere. Back then, I found \u201cDead Pigeon\u201d disappointing; seen again, as the filmmaker intended it and without expectation, it\u2019s less a failure than a small, unexpected gift for Mr. Fuller\u2019s fans.A far better movie, \u201cCutter\u2019s Way\u201d (released on Blu-ray by Twilight Time) is a classic hard-luck story. Although comparable to classic early \u201970s downers like \u201cChinatown\u201d and \u201cThe Long Goodbye,\u201d this story of three post-hippie losers drawn by chance and paranoia into a sordid murder mystery was born too late and has never gotten the recognition it deserves.Mr. Passer, an \u00e9migr\u00e9 from Czechoslovakia who came to America in the aftermath of the 1968 Soviet invasion, treats Jeffrey Alan Fiskin\u2019s script with a mixture of humanist warmth, caustic humor and detached fatalism. The director is fond of his doomed characters and, as in his lone Czech production, the rueful comedy \u201cIntimate Lighting\u201d (1965), he does not judge so much as observe them.As Mr. Fuller incorporates Cologne\u2019s carnival revelry, Mr. Passer seizes on the surreal facade of the Old Spanish Days celebration in Santa Barbara, Calif. Rather than a salute to local history, the fiesta feels like a cover-up of fat-cat malfeasance. Jordan Cronenweth\u2019s magic-hour cinematography distills the golden California sunlight into an atmosphere of malign ripeness. The movie\u2019s gimlet-eyed mise-en-sc\u00e8ne is exceeded only by the flamboyance of John Heard\u2019s career performance as a raspy-voiced madman who lost an arm, a leg, an eye and possibly his mind in Vietnam.Mr. Heard\u2019s furious pinwheel of resentment is supported, if not stabilized, by Lisa Eichhorn\u2019s self-effacing portrayal of his alcoholic wife and Jeff Bridges\u2019s turn as their self-loathing best friend, an unenthusiastic boat salesman who moonlights as a penny-ante gigolo. The three might as well be occupying Santa Barbara as if it were Zuccotti Park.Once intended as a vehicle for Dustin Hoffman, \u201cCutter\u2019s Way\u201d was a casualty of \u201cHeaven\u2019s Gate,\u201d a costly Michael Cimino western blamed for fatally damaging its studio, United Artists. Mr. Passer\u2019s budget was cut, and once his supporters at United Artists left, his film \u2014 originally titled \u201cCutter and Bone\u201d \u2014 was dumped into release with only two hastily scheduled previews and minimal publicity. Panned by three New York City dailies as well as by local TV, the movie was yanked from theaters before the favorable notices from the weeklies arrived.The Village Voice, where I was third-string film critic, was a particular champion. An initial enthusiastic review employing the newly minted term \u201cneo noir\u201d to characterize the movie\u2019s attitude was followed by a second positive review, as well as a profile of Mr. Passer when \u201cCutter\u2019s Way\u201d reopened a few months later under its new title. Nothing helped.NEWLY RELEASEDAdvertisement"}

It\u2019s a fight that can be won, and it is one we will win.\u201dBut given the margin of opposition against her on Thursday, political analysts said she stood little chance of winning the trial and finishing the remaining two and a half years of her final term in office.\u201cGiven the polarization in Brazil, if she sticks to her guns and fights this all the way to the end, it\u2019s going to prolong the agony for the country,\u201d said Mauro F. Guill\u00e9n, a professor of international management at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cThe best thing she could do for her country is to bite the bullet and step aside.\u201dThough widely expected, the spectacle of Ms. Rousseff\u2019s being put on trial is a watershed in the power struggle consuming Brazil, which experienced a rare stretch of stability over the last two decades as it strengthened its economy and achieved greater prominence on the world stage.The nation\u2019s economic woes are not simply a result of falling global prices for Brazilian commodities like oil and soybeans. They are also self-inflicted, economists say, a consequence of flawed policies and enormous graft scandals. Many voters blame Ms. Rousseff and her leftist Workers\u2019 Party.\u201cEverything is so expensive now, we can barely afford to eat,\u201d said Juliana Santos, 29, a ticket-taker who works for a public bus company in Bras\u00edlia, the capital. \u201cThe Workers\u2019 Party promised they would change things, but they changed things for the worse.\u201d\u201cPlainly said, this is the worst crisis in our history, with its combination of economic calamity, discredited politics and the violation of the lowest ethical standards,\u201d Boris Fausto, a Brazilian historian, told reporters this month while summing up the country\u2019s grim mood.Ms. Rousseff, 68, is the second Brazilian president to face impeachment since democracy was re-established in the mid-1980s after a long dictatorship.Dilma Rousseff, Brazil\u2019s president, is facing removal from office. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the proceedings.After 20 hours of often-somnolent speechmaking, the Brazilian solicitor general, Jos\u00e9 Eduardo Cardozo, took to the dais just after dawn on Thursday and told lawmakers that history would judge them harshly if they voted to try Ms. Rousseff for a crime he said she had not committed. \u201cIf this impeachment goes forward, Brazil will become the world\u2019s largest banana republic,\u201d he said, emotion filling his voice.Throughout the day, the corrugated-metal enclosures that had been erected outside Congress to contain protesters remained mostly empty, a marked contrast to the thousands of people who flocked to the capital last month to express their support or opposition during the impeachment vote in the lower house.By evening on Wednesday, several hundred people had gathered in the pens, and at one point, police officers fired tear gas into a crowd of anti-impeachment protesters after firecrackers were lobbed in the officers\u2019 direction.Ms. Rousseff is a former Marxist guerrilla and a trained economist who spent years working in the nation\u2019s energy bureaucracies. She had not held elected office until former President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who was constitutionally barred from running for a third consecutive term, picked her to be his successor.In 2010, she won handily, and during her time in office, she largely continued the generous social welfare programs that had earned Mr. da Silva unswerving loyalty from the country\u2019s poorest citizens.\u201cOur greatest achievements were to raise 36 million people out of poverty and elevate 40 million others into the middle class,\u201d Mr. da Silva said in an email on Wednesday. \u201cWe remain a party that cares about the poor and about social justice.\u201dBut as the economy soured and scandal rocked the political establishment, Ms. Rousseff\u2019s popularity sank into the single digits, giving her adversaries in Congress an opening to seek her removal.It was the recent defection of Mr. Temer that helped seal her fate, providing opponents in the lower house the crucial bloc of votes they needed to push forward with impeachment.But Mr. Temer may be even less popular than Ms. Rousseff, with one recent poll finding that only 2 percent of Brazilians would vote for him. He also faces his own legal problems. An electoral court ordered him this month to pay a fine for violating campaign finance limits. The ruling could make him ineligible to run for elected office for eight years, creating an unusual situation in which a politician barred from campaigning ends up running the country.Fixing the economy, which may require adopting unpopular austerity measures, is just one of the challenges facing Mr. Temer, 75. Critics have expressed concern over some of his top advisers, several of whom are under investigation, including Romero Juc\u00e1, a senator from Roraima State in the Amazon, and Geddel Vieira Lima, a former executive at one of Brazil\u2019s largest public banks. Mr. Temer has insisted that those inquiries would not prevent him from naming the advisers to his cabinet.Many business leaders and economists have expressed hope that Mr. Temer will win congressional support for changes like reducing federal pensions, privatizing state-owned companies and amending labor laws that critics say hamper economic growth.Despite the charges against her, Ms. Rousseff is rare among top politicians in Brazil in that she has not faced accusations of illegally enriching herself.His replacement, Waldir Maranh\u00e3o, is accused of taking bribes in the enormous graft scheme surrounding the national oil company, Petrobras. And Renan Calheiros, the Senate leader, is under investigation over claims that he received bribes in the scandal, too. He has also been accused of tax evasion and of allowing a lobbyist to pay child support for a daughter from an extramarital affair.Though badly weakened, leaders from Ms. Rousseff\u2019s party are determined to remain a thorn in the side of the incoming government, which many believe is illegitimate. Speaking to reporters outside the Senate chamber on Wednesday, Senator Humberto Costa, leader of the Workers\u2019 Party caucus, said he was left with no choice but to embrace obstructionism.\u201cWe will treat them to the kind of stiff opposition they imposed on our government,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no other path for us.\u201dPaula Moura contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

On the subway, this TV fan catches up on the news on the phone.When viewers turn on the service, it is already streaming their favorite programming depending on the time, place and device in use. It also understands what she is most likely to want to watch next.That is the new vision for Hulu, which got its start primarily as a rerun service for broadcast TV shows.\u201cHow do we get people to content that they love, fast?\u201d said Mike Hopkins, Hulu\u2019s chief executive. \u201cHow do we make it so personalized that we are thinking ahead for you so that you don\u2019t have to?\u201dSeveral details are still being determined, including the price and which channels will be included in the package. Executives with knowledge of the plans said the service was expected to cost about $40 a month and Hulu was close to deals to include broadcast and cable channels from both Disney and Fox.Hulu now counts more than 10 million subscribers, with a vast majority paying for the ad-supported model. That compares with Netflix\u2019s 45.7 million paid subscribers in the United States.In advance of Hulu\u2019s upfront presentation for advertisers on Wednesday, Mr. Hopkins discussed what is next for the company and for the future of streaming television. His answers have been lightly edited for length and clarity.Why create this new offering that would offer a live and on-demand stream of entire broadcast and cable channels now?Broadband speeds have advanced quite a bit over the last few years. There are a couple of other offerings that have been put out into the market in various forms that show that network groups are willing to license their channels in this way now.Some TV executives described Hulu\u2019s new service as an effort to rethink their approach to streaming video. What needs to be fixed?There is a paradox of choice that is out there today with the number of channels that are available. It is not intuitive or easy always to find them, particularly on your mobile device. We are going to try to solve that by making it more personalized.One major risk of a streamlined bundle from Hulu could be the potential that traditional cable and satellite distributors see the new service as a declaration of war. That could put at risk the billions of dollars that the TV networks receive each year from those traditional distributors. What can you do to prevent that?It is not a declaration of war on anyone. I don\u2019t think we are designing this for people that are really happy with their pay TV service. This is designed for the people that the marketplace is concerned are falling out of love with pay TV. We want to have a product for them.Will viewers be able to skip through commercials or pay for a commercial-free offering? We haven\u2019t made any of those decisions yet.How would you describe the competitive rivalry now among Netflix, Amazon and Hulu? How do you expect that to change?We\u2019re all in this new market and developing it together. I don\u2019t really see it as a rivalry per se between any of us. We certainly compete against each other for content rights, but I am not sure I would say we are rivals just yet.The last year has seen an explosion of new streaming services that allow people to ditch their traditional TV subscriptions that cost an average of $80 a month in favor of cheaper viewing. How many streaming services do you anticipate people will subscribe to?We\u2019re in this phase where a lot of people are going to launch these and test and see how they work. Over time, not all of them will last. It is not an easy business to be in. You are direct to consumer. Every single day you have to make people happy enough to stay a subscriber. It is very easy to sign up and it is very easy to cancel.A big win for Hulu was when it became the exclusive streaming home to episodes of \u201cSeinfeld.\u201d How did that fit into your strategy? What are other hot properties that you are after?TV is very personal for people. So when you think about the shows that you watch, they are different than the shows that I watch and they are different than the shows my daughter watches. When we look at our product, we have to have as many of the shows as you want and love as we can possibly have. And then we have to personalize the service for you so that you know that we have them and that we are recommending the next one that we hope you will enjoy.Last September, Hulu introduced an option that allowed people to pay $12 a month for a commercial-free version of the service. What have you learned from the rollout of the new offering? Giving people choice is really important. Even though a lot more people decided to stick with the ad-supported plan or to choose the ad-supported plan as new customers, by giving them the choice I think we have made people happier with the ultimate choice that they have made.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On DVD: Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll High Schools in Taiwan and America", "Date": "2016-05-19", "News": "Supported byOn DVDA universal tale of wayward adolescence is woven into complex context. Taiwan, a liberated Japanese colony with a large native Chinese population, was ruled from 1949 on by newly arrived Chinese nationalists backed by the American military. \u201cA Brighter Summer Day\u201d depicts but does not directly explicate the political situation. \u201cRather than working its way through a neatly predigested story line, it plunges the audience into a vast social fresco,\u201d the British critic Tony Rayns, one of the movie\u2019s first Western admirers, wrote in 1993.Along with his contemporary Hou Hsiao-hsien, Mr. Yang (1947-2007) helped usher Taiwanese cinema onto the world stage. Mr. Yang was also the new cinema movement\u2019s most cosmopolitan member \u2014 born in Shanghai, raised in Taipei and trained as an engineer at the University of Florida. Early films like \u201cTaipei Story\u201d (1985) and \u201cThe Terrorizer\u201d (1986) are laconic depictions of Taiwan\u2019s disaffected urban elite. \u201cA Brighter Summer Day,\u201d on which Mr. Yang worked for three years \u2014 one of which he said was devoted to rehearsing his cast\u2019s 60 young members \u2014 is more ambitious and personal.\u201cA City of Sadness\u201d (1989), Mr. Hou\u2019s intimate yet panoramic treatment of Taiwan\u2019s turbulent Cold War history, provided a template for Mr. Yang. While not strictly autobiographical, \u201cA Brighter Summer Day\u201d drew on his own experiences; set in 1960, it is based on a juvenile homicide that occurred at Mr. Yang\u2019s school when he was 13. In an interview published in 2005, Mr. Yang called making the movie \u201ca kind of responsibility that I had to take on.\u201d\u201cA Brighter Summer Day\u201d is largely focused on high school turf wars and imported Elvis worship. (The title refers to a misheard lyric from the Elvis Presley hit \u201cAre You Lonesome Tonight?\u201d) But it is also a family drama that evokes Taiwan\u2019s prolonged period of martial law. The protagonist Si\u2019r, a bright, impulsive 14-year-old, is enrolled in a secondary school where the uniforms and regimentation provide an unforced parallel to military rule.Originally on the fringes of a local gang, Si\u2019r is drawn into its power struggles, including an emotional vortex around the murdered gang leader\u2019s girlfriend, Ming. The title notwithstanding, much of the film\u2019s action takes place at night, or is otherwise obscured, reinforcing the sense of a clandestine youth culture coursing beneath the frozen surface of a mobilized society.Seeing \u201cA Brighter Summer Day\u201d in the early 1990s as part of a touring package of Taiwanese films, I was impressed by Mr. Yang\u2019s synthesis of detached European art cinema and florid Hollywood youth films; familiar yet exotic, his movie seemed a Michelangelo Antonioni version of \u201cWest Side Story\u201d or a Wim Wenders remake of \u201cRebel Without a Cause,\u201d with the added frisson of pop ballads by Frankie Avalon and Ricky Nelson performed by Taiwanese singers in phonetic English.To revisit the movie is to appreciate the precision of Mr. Yang\u2019s period details and novelistic touches. An outsize flashlight stolen by Si\u2019r and his friends from a night watchman in one of the movie\u2019s first scenes reappears throughout to illuminate (or not) the tangled conflicts. The school\u2019s proximity to a movie studio allows Mr. Yang to comment both on his film and his characters as historical actors, not least when the duplicitous Ming is given a screen test.Dialogue from \u201cRio Bravo\u201d is heard as well, but Mr. Yang\u2019s lofty aspiration may be gauged by several references to \u201cWar and Peace,\u201d a book seen by the movie\u2019s most romantic character as the Western equivalent of the Chinese martial arts novels in which he imagines he lives. That may have been Mr. Yang\u2019s feeling as well. Interviewed by Mr. Rayns, he remarked, \u201cIf someone asked me to make a 300-episode TV series about these people, I\u2019d have had the material to do it.\u201dMr. Feig (\u201cBridesmaids,\u201d the coming \u201cGhostbusters\u201d reboot) and Mr. Apatow (\u201cTrainwreck,\u201d \u201cKnocked Up\u201d) are now kingpins of Hollywood comedy. A number of the show\u2019s stars, including the three main \u201cfreaks\u201d \u2014 James Franco, Seth Rogen and Jason Segel \u2014 also enjoy great box-office visibility, but the series\u2019s real star is Linda Cardellini. In her mid-20s when the show was shot, she was a more convincing teenager than her co-stars, some of whom, like Mr. Rogen, were still in their teens.

Chi Chi DeVayne, a sweet Louisiana queen with a thick, country-fried accent, praised Bob the Drag Queen, a gifted, tenderhearted New York comedian, on her work in support of marriage equality.\u201cI wish that I had the guts to stand up for gay rights,\u201d she said wistfully (the contestants often use male and female pronouns interchangeably).Bob smiled and replied, \u201cGo do it, you can start anytime.\u201dMs. DeVayne, dazzling in full makeup and a fuchsia ball gown, shook her head firmly. \u201cYou can\u2019t do it in Shreveport,\u201d she replied. \u201cThey\u2019ll blow your head off.\u201dThat exchange reflected the cultural significance of \u201cDrag Race,\u201d for this particular moment in time.Queer and gay culture has been so widely co-opted and incorporated into mainstream popular culture that it can feel commonplace, embraced by default. On the surface, that feels like a positive thing \u2014 queer narratives, like those featured in \u201cCarol,\u201d \u201cThe Danish Girl,\u201d \u201cModern Family\u201d and \u201cTransparent\u201d go a long way toward humanizing difference. We may live in troubled times, but this visibility suggests people are finding their way.Bob and Ms. DeVayne are both 30, but they may as well be from parallel universes. They, like the show, remind viewers that these discrepancies, these gaping chasms exist. We live in a time of extreme dualities.\u201cThey talk so much about acceptance now today and it\u2019s like, yes, but trust me \u2014 I\u2019m old,\u201d he said, \u201dIt\u2019s superficial.\u201d\u201cThings haven\u2019t changed that much. You see it in politics right now,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd you know, people will have you think, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re fashion. We\u2019re gay. That\u2019s my gay over there!\u2019 It\u2019s like, no. We\u2019re still a very, very, very primitive culture.\u201dNow, more than ever, we need axes of realness to anchor and make sense of this strange world we live in. \u201cDrag Race\u201d has always been a show that knows how to balances scripted moments and genuine interactions \u2014 by turning the shadiness and catty drama underlining the plot of almost every major reality show into a good-natured theatrical performance, in which contestants earn points for the ability to mock one another.Drag lives to be weird, to mock conformity, and pokes hole in the artifice of normativity, exposing the notion of fixed identity and gender as an inherently flawed premise. \u201cDrag Race,\u201d which in every episode asks competitors to construct new identities and costumes, lives to point out that our meat suits can be altered, that anyone can paint and sew a new persona, that all appearances are illusions anyway.Last season, the show almost deflated that premise. Season 7 was dominated by two contestants, Violet Chachki and Pearl, who both shimmered on the surface, but didn\u2019t seem to have much depth below, at least, none that they were willing to reveal. Phenomenally talented, and already Instagram famous before their first appearance on the show, they were willowy and fair-skinned, exceptionally gifted at pulling off classically \u201cfishy\u201d looks, which in drag slang means feminine to the point of passing. They won competition after competition, and praise from the judges.\u201cDrag Race\u201d no longer seemed to exist to expose the performance of hyperfemininity, it seemed to cultivate it. The preference for heteronormative standards of beauty was tremendously disappointing.But this season rebounded from that. One of the earliest and most severe eliminations was a pageant queen. And two of the season\u2019s stronger contestants had male drag names. Weirdness reigned, through strong performances by Acid Betty, with her psychedelic palette, and the transformations of Thorgy Thor, a hippie with dreads and round glasses who invented a new character during every challenge.Kim Chi, one of the show\u2019s first breakout Asian-American contestants, constructed some of the most sophisticated looks to grace RuPaul\u2019s stage, a combination of flora and fauna and dessert pastry. Charming and chubby, with a lisp, his most revealing moment came when he tearfully revealed that he has hidden his exquisite talents at makeup and costume design from his own mother, for fear she will be repulsed by his love of drag. In another, he confessed that he was a virgin.Moments like that, both shocking and sad, affirmed the importance of \u201cDrag Race,\u201d the rare space on television that relishes honesty and exploration, that doesn\u2019t subscribe to the notion that all is well now that we live in a post-marriage-equality world. At its best, drag exposes the charade of modern life, the idea that there are set rules to follow, and even if there are, that you can win by following them. Personality, growth, the ability to evolve and, really, to survive, were the traits that the judges prioritized this season.But, you wonder, how can the show itself grow and evolve from here? At this point in its life cycle, RuPaul\u2019s universe has expanded so much that a generation has been weaned on the show and its spinoffs, like \u201cRuPaul Drag U.\u201d \u201cDrag Race\u201d is its own feedback loop, its own perpetual motion machine. It\u2019s as mainstream as a show about drag can get.At the same time, \u201cDrag Race\u201d flourishes in cultlike purgatory. Even the show\u2019s network, Logo TV, aimed at the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender audience, is squirreled away, available only to cable subscribers. Without streaming services like iTunes and Amazon Prime, \u201cDrag Race\u201d might not have the fandom and staying power that it currently does.That won\u2019t matter much on Monday night, when the finale is aired. It\u2019s not yet clear who will win. In the second-to-last episode, after the group trooped back out to hear the verdict, RuPaul informed Ms. DeVayne that she would not advance to the final round and win the $100,000 or the title. She seemed unsurprised, and smiled. \u201cYou have taught me how to be a better person,\u201d she said, about loving who she is and where she is from. \u201cAnd $100,000 can\u2019t buy that.\u201dAt that, Ms. DeVayne snapped her fingers so clear and loud it almost sounded like a bell, before sashaying away.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Home vs. Amazon Echo. Let the Battle Begin.", "Date": "2016-05-18", "News": "Supported byTech FixWhat do Home and Echo have in common?Home and Echo are both speakers that require a wired power connection. They stream music and perform tasks like web searches, adding calendar appointments and looking up movie showtimes over an Internet connection.What are the differences between Google Home and Amazon Echo?Google has yet to share many important details, including a price tag, about Google Home, which is scheduled for release this fall. However, from the announcement we can glean a few differences:Home, which can easily be held in one hand, is shorter and more compact than Echo.Both speakers have a cylindrical shape, but the top of Home is slanted downward, whereas Echo\u2019s top is flat. Google is allowing consumers to choose from different colors for the bottom part of Home, while Echo comes only in black. (Amazon also sells a smaller voice-controlled speaker called Tap.)Most important, the brains of Home will be Google\u2019s virtual assistant, which draws from Google\u2019s extensive search database, whereas Echo relies on Alexa, Amazon\u2019s assistant. In other words, consumers can expect voice commands that already work with Google\u2019s assistant to work with Google Home.Is Home smarter than Echo?Thanks to Home\u2019s reliance on Google\u2019s search engine, it will probably be a smarter speaker than the Echo when it comes to basic tasks like web searches and looking up traffic data. However, when it comes to actions offered by outside companies \u2014 like the ability to order a pizza from a restaurant or to set your Internet-connected thermostat \u2014 Home\u2019s success will depend largely on whether Google persuades third-party developers to create tasks that work with it.\u201cTo do this well we really need to work with developers and third parties so we can provide these actions to our users,\u201d said Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, during his announcement of Home.By contrast, Amazon has already made great progress with third-party developers for Echo. Alexa is capable of summoning an Uber car, ordering a pizza from Domino\u2019s, controlling smart light bulbs and much more. Time will tell which company\u2019s speaker gets more third-party support, but Echo, which was released last June, has a major head start.What is Google\u2019s assistant?Here\u2019s where things get confusing. Google is referring to the virtual-assistant portion of its search product as \u201cassistant.\u201d Previously it was called Google Now, and later it was renamed to just Google.The problem was that many consumers had trouble distinguishing Google search from its virtual assistant because the assistant lacked a friendly name like Siri or Alexa. The difference now, Google says, is that its assistant is more capable of being naturally conversational than other assistants. Adding to the confusion: Google\u2019s assistant is what comes with Google Home and Allo, the new messaging app. But you won\u2019t summon it by saying \u201cGoogle assistant.\u201d You\u2019ll just say \u201cGoogle.\u201dWhat is Allo?Allo is Google\u2019s forthcoming messaging app, which has Google\u2019s assistant built into it. Inside the app, you will be able to type \u201c@google\u201d and say conversational things like \u201cLet\u2019s go out for some Italian food.\u201d Google will then respond with some suggestions for tables to reserve at Italian restaurants using, for example, the OpenTable app.What\u2019s more, you will be able to have conversations with friends and type \u201c@google\u201d with questions or requests inside those conversations; all people in the conversation will see how Google\u2019s assistant responds. The Allo app will be released this summer for iPhones and Android phones.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Life Full of Experiences May Not Mean Less Financial Security", "Date": "2016-05-24", "News": "Supported bySketch Guy\u201cThe very first conversation I had with Kerri,\u201d Brett recalled, \u201cI had just read a book, and one of the key questions in the book was, \u2018If you lived without fear, what would you do?\u2019\u201d Eventually, they chose to take a turn toward the unconventional.Here\u2019s a portion of my conversation with Brett after he and Debbie made their decision:\u201cWe began with just taking more time off. However, about a year before we left London, we decided that working around a quarterly schedule for our face-to-face work would be O.K. for our clients and for us. At Kerri\u2019s insistence, we started investigating what would be involved with renting our home out. We got an auctioneer around to see if we might sell our furniture via auction (as we\u2019d decided that anything you ever put in storage never comes back out, so let\u2019s bite the bullet and let it go). The auctioneer guy turns up in late April or early May and says, \u2018I love your stuff, but I need it now so we can photograph it and get it in our catalog for June.\u2019 We looked at each other and said, \u2018Take it.\u2019 That forced our hand. Two days later, we had no furniture, and so we got serious about renting our place out. Four weeks later, we\u2019d found tenants who moved in, and we left.\u201dSince leaving the comfort and security of their ordinary existence in London, the Davidsons now have a pretty nice life. Their itinerary over the last year has included time in Amsterdam, Iceland, Canada and Spain, with intermittent trips back to Britain for work. They\u2019ve made time for a ski instructor course and yoga retreat.Worried about flexibility? The Davidsons are financially successful. Not having children makes a big difference, too (though not as big as you may think, which is something I\u2019ll address in a future column).Worried about money? The Davidsons are not spending significantly more money to live this way. Between the money they earn renting out their home in London and being smart about airline miles or buying cheap flights, they are close to breaking even compared with their previous life.So it\u2019s not a change in expenses that has allowed the Davidsons to make this shift. They are able to live in this remarkable way because they restructured their lives in a way that would allow it. It\u2019s simply because they had the courage to ask, \u201cWhy not?\u201dAnd if you\u2019re wondering how this radical shift affected their income, here\u2019s what the Davidsons have to say: \u201cSince we\u2019ve left home, we believe we\u2019ve become more creative in our business and are doing some of the best work we\u2019ve ever done. We\u2019re thinking bigger, but also eliminating the \u2018fake busy\u2019 stuff and only doing things that will really make a difference. We didn\u2019t know any of this would happen before we left.\u201dConsider that for a moment. Not only are Brett and Debbie living closer to their dream, they also say they are doing better work professionally. Experience? Check. Security? Check. Winning? Checkmate.None of this is to suggest you drop everything and live like the Davidsons. Maybe you don\u2019t want to travel. Maybe your dream is to work at home in your pajamas and walk the dog an extra two miles each day with the time you\u2019ve saved from your old commute. That\u2019s great.Advertisement"}

There\u2019s the \u201croach motel\u201d or \u201cwalled-garden\u201d technique, in which sites offer fast-and-easy sign-up processes but make it much more cumbersome for consumers to close accounts.There\u2019s also \u201cmisdirection,\u201d in which prominent marketing come-ons may distract users from seeing check boxes that by default, say, sign them up for a newsletter or membership, spam their contacts or alter their home pages.And then there\u2019s scarcity inflation: \u201cOnly two hotel rooms left at this price!\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s real scarcity, that\u2019s fine,\u201d Mr. Brignull says. \u201cIf it\u2019s fake scarcity, that\u2019s taking advantage of people\u2019s natural biases. It\u2019s a blurry line.\u201dBut the same techniques that encourage citizens to do good may also be used to exploit consumers\u2019 cognitive biases. User-experience designers and marketers are well aware that many people are so eager to start using a new service or complete a task, or are so loath to lose a perceived deal, that they will often click one \u201cNext\u201d button after another as if on autopilot \u2014 without necessarily understanding the terms they have agreed to along the way.\u201cThat\u2019s when things start to drift into manipulation,\u201d said Katie Swindler, director of user experience at FCB Chicago, an ad agency. She and Mr. Brignull are part of an informal effort among industry experts trying to make a business case for increased transparency.Steve Johnson, LinkedIn\u2019s vice president for user experience, said the company had worked over the last two years to make it clearer to members how the feature that imports their contacts works and to give them more control over it.\u201cWe need a way for them to build a network on LinkedIn quickly and efficiently without tricking them into doing things they don\u2019t want to do,\u201d Mr. Johnson told me.\u201cEveryone is pushing the envelope all the time,\u201d Ms. Swindler said. \u201cThat just erodes the relationship between the consumer and the brand.\u201dFor instance, when ride-hailing apps run promotions offering customers free rides to sign up their friends \u2014 and the friends get free rides as well \u2014 both the company and consumers benefit.Last week, Fabletics was offering a \u201cnew V.I.P. membership exclusive\u201d in which it discounts various outfits to $25. When first-time shoppers choose clothing and check out, the site gives them a pricing choice that highlights the discounted V.I.P. membership offer in black and red \u2014 while displaying the regular, non-V.I.P. price in gray.But this initial choice page does not inform consumers that the membership involves a $49.95 monthly subscription fee for clothing. That disclosure comes at the bottom of a subsequent membership page, where the site explains that it emails members a personalized selection of clothing on the first of every month.To avoid the $49.95 clothing fee, members must opt out online by the 5th of each month. To cancel their membership, they must call customer service.These kinds of subscription continuity plans are legal in the United States if the marketing is truthful and the terms and conditions are prominently displayed.In an email, Shawn Gold, a spokesman for JustFab, said Fabletics provided 14 different notices on the site about the subscription model, including two points where consumers must actively opt in. He added that the company was currently pilot-testing an online cancellation option.\u201cCustomers who accidentally sign up for membership are costly to the business,\u201d Mr. Gold wrote. \u201cSo we do everything we can to avoid that from happening.\u201dOther online patterns seem more puzzling to me.\u201cIt\u2019s really clever \u2014 they want you to do something that is counterintuitive and maybe a little freaky to you,\u201d Mr. Nodder said. \u201cThere\u2019s an element of \u2018Maybe I just won\u2019t sign out this time.\u2019\u201dI subsequently ordered Mr. Nodder\u2019s book on evil design from Amazon and then I logged out, my unease notwithstanding.Advertisement"}

But it turns out that he\u2019s a natural. Sitting on a book-lined set, wearing a pinstriped chocolate-brown suit and with a slightly unsettling gleam in his eye, explaining his Victorian-era mini-series to us Yanks, he\u2019s like a jovial uncle from the early stages of a Pinter play. If Ms. Linney moves on, her successor is in sight.The story begins with the accidental death of a man named Thorne in a drunken brawl in 1836, then jumps ahead 20 years. At first it\u2019s confusing to see a living Dr. Thorne, but Mr. Fellowes\u2019s lucid, nimble screenplay quickly acquaints us with the main figures and the social strata of the fictional town of Barchester. Dr. Thorne, played with circumspect grace by Tom Hollander (\u201cThe Night Manager\u201d), is respected but subordinate, tending to both the medical and financial affairs of a local baronet (Ian McShane), who affectionately bullies him.Dr. Thorne has a niece, Mary (Stefanie Martini), whose kindness and high spirits are outweighed, in the marriage market, by the shady and mysterious circumstances of her birth. This is the engine of the plot, as her chances with men of varying suitability rise and fall, and other young women in search of husbands keep a wary eye on her progress. Mr. Fellowes emphasizes Trollope\u2019s humor without shortchanging the melodrama, and the production has the feeling of a high-def tribute to an earlier era of British film and television (emphasized by the use of old-fashioned fonts for the credits) \u2014 it achieves a kind of rollicking serenity.\u201cDoctor Thorne\u201d is a minor canvas, compared with \u201cDownton Abbey,\u201d but Mr. Fellowes packs a lot of charm and amusement into its 160 minutes. \u201cThere\u2019s rather a lot going on, isn\u2019t there?\u201d he says before one episode, giving himself a well-deserved pat on the back.A television review on Friday about a new series on Amazon Prime, and a picture caption with it, omitted part of the title of the show. It is \u201cJulian Fellowes Presents Doctor Thorne,\u201d not \u201cDoctor Thorne.\u201dBecause of an editing error, a picture caption on May 20 with a television review of \u201cJulian Fellowes Presents Doctor Thorne,\u201d on Amazon Prime, misidentified an actor.

If successful, the value of the transaction will most likely get much bigger.\u201cFor sure, we\u2019re talking of billions of dollars in services over the next several years,\u201d said Marc Benioff, the co-founder and chief executive of Salesforce.Salesforce already uses A.W.S. for some of its businesses, but this is the first time its key applications will be on someone else\u2019s computers.Mr. Benioff said Salesforce had evaluated similar deals with Microsoft and Google, the other two giants in selling cloud-computing to corporations. So far, A.W.S. is still ahead on its range of offerings and low prices, he said. Salesforce will review the contract in one year, he added.Cloud computing uses a massive density of computer servers and sophisticated software to rent data storage, computing and applications to companies. Besides those capabilities, the deal with A.W.S. enables Salesforce to get into new markets faster, since Salesforce doesn\u2019t have to find facilities and recruit talent.Amazon has also established itself in countries like China that have strict requirements about what data can be sent offshore. Meeting those regulations is difficult and time-consuming, and companies like Salesforce put a premium on getting into markets quickly.While the deal could be a sign of larger trends in corporate computing, as businesses evaluate whether to keep their own computers or work with the big public clouds, for now it also has limits.That spending will probably be limited to new countries where Salesforce expands, Mr. Benioff said. That may change, he added, as the three giants bring down prices and increase the services they offer.\u201cWe have our own infrastructure in the U.S., Japan, the U.K., France and Germany,\u201d Mr. Benioff said. \u201cIf you have critical mass, your own infrastructure is still cheaper.\u201dMr. Benioff said that, down the line, A.W.S. may also become competitive purely on price, as their scale and engineering enables them to run big computing systems at a lower cost. \u201cIf Amazon, Microsoft and Google are smart, the price difference will change,\u201d he said.Adam Selipsky, vice president of marketing and sales for A.W.S., said the company was intent on getting its prices down enough to replace existing servers in established markets.\u201cOur prices relative to what they can build themselves \u2013 we\u2019re already at a stage where it\u2019s competitive,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re just at the starting point of enterprise adoption.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump and the Lord\u2019s Work", "Date": "2016-05-03", "News": "Supported byI watched that video with Chuck Todd, the host of \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d and he had the exact same reaction I had: \u201cWhere was that brotherly love when America needed it\u201d for a real grand bargain?That scene plucked the deepest emotional chord in the country today: The nonstop fighting between our two political parties has left many Americans feeling like the children of two permanently divorcing parents. The country is starved to see its two major parties do big hard things together again. And getting a glimpse \u2014 even just a pretend one \u2014 of Obama and Boehner teaming up reminds you what\u2019s been lost.I think what\u2019s propelling Donald Trump\u2019s success more than anything is the feeling of many Americans that our politics are totally stuck. There is an overwhelming sense of \u201cstuckness\u201d \u2014 and the fantasy that Trump plays to, and plays up, is that he can pull the sword from the stone and do deals. No one was more responsible for this \u201cstuckness,\u201d though, than today\u2019s Republican Party. When Mitch McConnell, the G.O.P. leader in the Senate, said in October 2010 that \u201cthe single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president,\u201d he described the Republicans\u2019 dominant strategy since 2008. The party stopped thinking seriously about market-based alternatives. Into that emptiness entered Trump, like an invasive species.This was a really bad time for us to be stuck. I\u2019m just finishing writing a new book, which is partly about the inflection point we hit around 2007. In 2007, Apple came out with the iPhone, beginning the smartphone/apps revolution; in late 2006 Facebook opened its doors to anyone, not just college and high school students, and took off like a rocket; Google came out with the Android operating system in 2007; Hadoop launched in 2007, helping create the storage/processing power for the big data revolution; Github, launched in 2007, scaling open-source software; Twitter was spun off as its own separate platform in 2007. Amazon came out with the Kindle in 2007. Airbnb started in 2007.That was the real grand bargain we needed. Instead, we had the 2008 economic meltdown, which set off more polarization, and way too much gridlock, given how much rethinking, reimagining and retooling we needed to do. In this vortex a lot of the public got unmoored and disoriented, opening the way for populists with simple answers. Get rid of immigrants, end trade with China or eliminate big banks and all will be fine. It\u2019s nonsense.But if you\u2019re for these things only as they now exist, you\u2019re also wrong. Each one needs retooling. It\u2019s clear: Free trade with China has hurt more people than originally thought. It\u2019s clear: Low-skilled illegal immigration has hurt more American workers than we\u2019ve fully understood. (And more high-skilled immigration in a knowledge age would enhance our economy more than most people understand.) It\u2019s clear: Social Security, Medicare and Obamacare all need fixes to remain sustainable. It\u2019s clear: Capitalism driven more by machines and robots poses new challenges for both white-collar and blue-collar workers.Every one of these challenges can be met if we put our heads and hands together. For that to happen, though, this version of the Republican Party had to be destroyed, so a thinking center-right party can emerge. If that is what Trump has done, he\u2019s done the Lord\u2019s work. We also need Democrats to be a center-left party, though, and not let Bernie Sanders pull them to the far left. If both happen, maybe something good can actually emerge from this crazy election.Advertisement"}

Each week, get the latest news on parenting, child health and relationships plus advice from our experts to help every family live well.\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s take some time off.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how Susan Corvino of Pasadena, Calif., remembers her husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reaction when her communications job was eliminated four years ago. At the time, her husband was working long hours, so they agreed she would stay home with their three young children.But returning to work two years later when her youngest daughter began preschool wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t so easy. Interviews in her field led nowhere, particularly when she asked for a flexible schedule. So she tried a different approach, thinking less like a midlife professional, and more like a midlife intern. Creating her own series of \u00e2\u0080\u009creturnships,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Corvino took on a project for a friend who ran a non-profit. Later she found a temporary contract position at a university. These stints helped her find her current role in communications and development for an independent school. Those short-term roles \u00e2\u0080\u009cbolster your r\u00c3\u00a9sum\u00c3\u00a9,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEveryone says, \u2018Oh, do some volunteer work,\u2019 and I did that, but it really helped to have some paid gigs.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s changing. A growing number of businesses are now targeting this pool of educated workers with temporary intern-style jobs or more formal \u00e2\u0080\u009creturnships\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0093 essentially midlife internships to help workers rebuild their r\u00c3\u00a9sum\u00c3\u00a9s.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThese are experienced employees, but also fast learners who are really ready to prove themselves,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Cohen said.The Apr\u00c3\u00a8s site aims to connect experienced but out-of-the-work-force employees with employers who are looking for both gender diversity and seasoned mid-career professionals. In addition to traditional positions, it offers options that can help people transition back to work including contract consulting projects, temporary jobs and unpaid pro bono work. The site was co-founded by Jennifer Gefsky, former deputy general counsel for Major League Baseball, who struggled to return to work after an eight-year career break, and Niccole Kroll, who had left her job as a New York University dietitian and researcher. Both had stepped out of the work force to raise their children.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe were both surrounded by all these friends in that same category \u00e2\u0080\u0094 educated, previously successful women looking to re-enter the work force \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and no one knowing how to do it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Gefsky said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThen there were all these companies worried that their mid- and senior-level executives were all men.\u00e2\u0080\u009d One advantage of working with a company with a returnship-style program, or one that has otherwise expressed an interest in welcoming caregivers back to the workforce, is that those companies are effectively saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe know we are going to see r\u00c3\u00a9sum\u00c3\u00a9s with a gap and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re O.K. with that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Gefsky said. These are companies that understand that there are many reasons, economic and personal, for stepping out of the work force \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and for returning. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSome women are financially motivated, and some are personally motivated, and both make good employees,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.Workers who can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find a formal midlife internship can still create their own internship-style path back to work. Erin Gibson Allen, a lawyer in Pittsburgh, created an unpaid internship with Judge Lisa Lenihan, a magistrate judge for the United States District Court in the Western District of Pennsylvania. After spending six months looking to re-enter the legal profession and with no formal re-entry programs in Pittsburgh, her plan was to get work experience and network in the legal community, rather than to find permanent employment with her judicial boss.  Her efforts paid of: After nine months with the judge she accepted a job at a law firm, and then moved to a Pittsburgh firm, Marcus & Shapira, where she now works in the area of competition law. She chose her internship experience wisely: Ms. Allen said the judge, a mother herself, appreciated the challenges of managing both a family and a legal career. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe judge was my biggest advocate,\u201d she said. \u201cShe introduced me to attorneys around town and included me in as many legal events as possible. My time with her was priceless.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHelen Wolter of  Mountain View, Calif, describes her career path before having children as \u00e2\u0080\u009ctypical liberal arts major.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She taught high school, she did outdoor education, she worked in film and video. When her son was born, she was a high school social studies teacher. She made it work for a year, but went through \u00e2\u0080\u009cthree nannies and a day care\u00e2\u0080\u009d trying to find an affordable and flexible fit.Ms. Wolter began her journey back to work by pursing a master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s degree in public administration. To keep it affordable, avoid the need to hire babysitters in order to attend classes and maintain the flexibility she needed, she completed an online program through the University of Colorado. Now a graduate, with a son in first grade, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s taken an internship approach \u00e2\u0080\u0093 opting for a six-month contract position with a political re-election campaign as her first job after seven years as a caregiver. She hopes it will lead to permanent work. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI checked with a career counselor to ask if I should take that, or wait for something more permanent,\u201d Ms. Wolter said, \u201cand she told me, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Grab it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so much easier to find a job if you have a job.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009dHow do you create your own midlife internship? Those returning to work without the benefit of an organized program can use such internships as a model for both how they approach and talk to potential employers, look for the support they need, and find ways to expand their skills.

{"Headline": "Office Depot and Staples Call Off Merger After Judge Blocks It", "Date": "2016-05-10", "News": "Supported byA federal judge on Tuesday blocked a $6.3 billion proposed merger of Staples and Office Depot, dashing another huge deal and handing the Obama administration one more antitrust victory.The decision is a setback for the beleaguered retailers, which have each endured years of slumping sales and increased competition from Amazon and other rivals.The Federal Trade Commission had sued the two companies late last year, arguing that combining them would effectively create just one dominant retailer focused on pens, paper clips and Post-it notes.In a three-page order, Judge Emmet G. Sullivan of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia agreed, writing that the pairing of the two would \u201csubstantially impair\u201d competition in the business of selling office supplies.Both companies said after the ruling that they planned to end their merger plans.Once fierce competitors, the office supply giants have struggled to compete as more people shop online. The growth of e-commerce has eroded the sales and customer base for many traditional brick-and-mortar retailers.Staples closed a combined 242 stores in 2014 and 2015, and expects to close another 50 stores this year, according to the company\u2019s most recent annual report. For the year ending Jan. 30, sales fell more than 6 percent, to $21 billion. With the deal\u2019s end, Staples also plans to cut $300 million in expenses and weigh a potential sale of its European operations.Office Depot said it had closed 349 stores in 2014 and 2015, and had identified \u201cat least\u201d 400 retail stores for closing through 2016. Sales fell 10 percent last year, to $14.5 billion.Shares in Staples fell 10 percent in after-hours trading, to $9.31, while Office Depot tumbled 26 percent, to $4.49.In a record-setting boom in mergers last year, nearly $5 trillion in deals were struck. But many of them represented consolidation in industries that, government regulators have said, were already thin on competition.\u201cVictories across a wide range of industries make clear that if our analysis leads us to conclude that a merger will restrict competition, we will not hesitate to intervene,\u201d she said.The F.T.C. also blocked an effort by Sysco and US Foods to merge, a deal that would have united two of the country\u2019s biggest food service providers.Other proposed transactions that fell apart under government opposition include AT&T\u2019s $39 billion bid for T-Mobile USA and Comcast\u2019s $45 billion offer for Time Warner Cable.That crackdown has sent chills down the spines of many potential deal-makers and heightened caution in corporate boardrooms. In rebuffing a $90 billion takeover approach by Honeywell, United Technologies cited potential regulatory opposition as one reason to remain independent.Some pending mergers, including the unions of four of the country\u2019s biggest health insurers, face close review by the Justice Department and other regulators.In the case of Staples and Office Depot, the two would have had about $37 billion in revenue and roughly 3,500 stores. In 1997, the F.T.C. blocked a previous attempt by the two companies to combine.The companies had fought back in court, arguing that joining forces was necessary with much-larger competitors like Walmart and Amazon. Other antitrust regulators, including in Europe, signed off on the deal after the two companies agreed to sell off certain parts of their businesses.But by the end of the trial last month, Judge Sullivan \u2014 who had questioned some of the government\u2019s analysis of the merger\u2019s effects on competition, as well as some of its legal tactics \u2014 had urged the two sides to settle.In statements on Tuesday, both Staples and Office Depot said that they planned to move on from the failed merger. Under the terms of the deal, Staples will pay Office Depot a $250 million breakup fee.Advertisement"}
