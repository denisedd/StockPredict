I don\u2019t care what his job was, or what his political views were,\u201d a user identified as Shazi Laoqi wrote. The commenter added, \u201cI just care that he\u2019s dead, and that he died while being detained. And all the things that are supposed to aid police during the process of detention were missing \u2014 they didn\u2019t bring their recording equipment, mobile phones that recorded it were damaged, close circuit cameras in the area were all broken.\u201dThe police had not used excessive force during the arrest, Xing Yongrui, the police officer in charge of the case, told People\u2019s Daily. Mr. Xing told the newspaper that Mr. Lei had paid 200 renminbi, about $30, for sex, and that after he was detained had bitten officers and tried to escape twice. He said it took five officers 20 minutes to subdue Mr. Lei with their bare hands.Demands for answers as to how Mr. Lei died continued to mount on Thursday, with four strongly worded petitions, said to be from different groups of alumni from Renmin University, circulating on social media. Some links were being deleted by censors.The petition was titled: \u201cWe Must Speak Out \u2014 Statement by Some 1988 Alumni of Renmin University of China on Fellow Student Lei Yang\u2019s Death.\u201dIt demanded greater rights for Chinese citizens and justice for Mr. Lei, whose family has requested an independent autopsy. The results will take about a month, news reports said.Here are translated excerpts from the petition, which appeared on a Baidu website on Thursday but was deleted later in the day:\u201cWe are outraged by the Changping police\u2019s assortment of hypocritical and evasive rhetoric!\u201cLooking over the entire episode of Lei Yang\u2019s homicide, it looks more like a malicious act of randomly targeting ordinary people or middle-class urbanites than an accident. And such malicious acts could be happening everyday, without notice.\u201cWhether or not Lei Yang visited a prostitute (what one can do with just 200 renminbi at a massage parlor?), he was not involved in any criminal offense. Even if he had moral shortcomings, like the rest of us, he didn\u2019t deserve to die. Even if he was unhappy with the way he was being handled and might have obstructed official business, he should not have been executed on the spot without a trial!\u201cAs senior fellow students of Lei Yang, we have been working hard for many years amid the waves of reform and opening-up. Most of our fellow alumni can be found in various specialty areas like Lei Yang, but they dare not call themselves the elite of society. We painfully feel that today, more than 30 years after the reform and opening-up, our personal safety and civil rights have not been guaranteed.\u201cAt a time when citizens are routinely confronted with a wide range of lawlessness such as demolitions and the kidnapping of children, it is difficult for them to be guaranteed their personal safety from the police. The relationship between public security departments and citizens is extremely abnormal.\u201cSo, the death of Lei Yang was by no means an accident. It was a tragedy arising from the system. We call on the top authorities to conduct an independent and impartial investigation into Lei Yang\u2019s death. We demand that his killers be severely punished and that discipline within the public security departments be corrected. We want our most basic rights to personal safety, civil rights and urban order.\u201dVanessa Piao contributed research. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Artificial Intelligence Is Far From Matching Humans, Panel Says", "Date": "2016-05-25", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Never mind Terminator-like killer robots. Artificial intelligence researchers are grappling with more realistic questions like whether their creations will take too many jobs from humans.Eight years after leading artificial intelligence scientists said their field did not need to be regulated, the question of government oversight has re-emerged as the technology has rapidly progressed.On Tuesday, at an event sponsored by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, legal specialists and technologists explored questions about autonomous systems that would increasingly make decisions without human input in areas like warfare, transportation and health.Still, despite improvement in areas like machine vision and speech understanding, A.I. research is still far from matching the flexibility and learning capability of the human mind, researchers at the conference said.\u201cThe A.I. community keeps climbing one mountain after another, and as it gets to the top of each mountain, it sees ahead still more mountains,\u201d said Ed Felten, a computer scientist who is a deputy chief technology officer in the Office of Science and Technology Policy.The half-day program, co-sponsored with the University of Washington School of Law and the university\u2019s Tech Policy Lab, was the first of four events the White House has planned that will focus on law and policy, as well as the social and economic implications of autonomous machine research.\u201cThese issues of A.I. and machines learning were popping up all over the government, and there was an opportunity to get more coordinated in how we address them,\u201d Dr. Felten said.After 25 artificial intelligence researchers met in 2009, the group, sponsored by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, reported that there was no imminent danger from a technology that had prompted fears of Hollywood-style weapons and advanced economies that were devoid of human workers.Leading technologists and scientists have also pondered the possibility that artificial intelligence, like genetic engineering, might soon constitute an existential threat to the human race.In recent years, the debate has spread to the broader social impact of autonomous programs that will perform tasks like driving cars and offering medical and financial advice.One challenge for A.I., according to a number of the researchers who spoke, is that the public perception about the threat of A.I. has largely been shaped by Hollywood.\u201cCertainly, Hollywood has played a tremendous role with vision like Skynet,\u201d the computer network that turns on humans in the \u201cTerminator\u201d movies, said Oren Etzioni, chief executive of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, a nonprofit research group funded by the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much always the case in science fiction that A.I. is this monolithic entity that is scheming to take over.\u201dHe cautioned that attention-getting feats like Google\u2019s AlphaGo program, which defeated a human champion in the board game Go, had plenty of humans behind the machine doing the work.At the same time, despite the consensus about the limits of today\u2019s technology, many of the panelists wrestled with new challenges presented by A.I. systems that were appearing in virtually all walks of life, including services delivered by smartphones and algorithms that guide missiles.Kate Crawford, a principal researcher at Microsoft Research, called on the industry to add ethics to the professional training of engineers. \u201cWe need to start changing the skill set of the people who are going to be the data scientists of the future and the A.I. creators of the future,\u201d she said.A.I. systems are pervasive, Ms. Crawford said, pointing to a doll like Hello Barbie, which speaks and listens.\u201cYou might think that\u2019s a fantastic toy, that\u2019s really wonderful,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat you don\u2019t realize is that it is the front to this huge data ingestion machine that is taking all of those statements by that child and then using them for a whole range of purposes.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Elizabeth Olson reports in DealBook.David Wippman, the dean of the University of Minnesota Law School, has already overseen a shrinking first-year class, offsetting the loss in tuition income with more public subsidies. He said the school was trying to determine why applications for the course were dropping and was trying to identify students more precisely, while publicizing more broadly. Mr. Wippman had to decide whether to admit students with lower scores, but a surplus of graduates who do not find jobs can eviscerate a law school\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reputation. Raising tuition was not an option with so many students wary of taking on high debt. The school was also facing competition from others in its hometown.So the school opted for fewer students. It can at least tap into taxpayer funding, and almost three-quarters of its first-year students are from out of state and pay higher tuition fees. It has also shed staff and left openings unfilled.  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "There is one thing we do not see in a compelling 1982 self-portrait by Dean Wong: his face. Taken in Seattle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Chinatown, the photograph zeroes in on the back of a metal helmet, polished to a mirrorlike finish. In it is reflected a crowd of neighborhood residents \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a metaphor for the people and hometown community that have shaped and fascinated Mr. Wong. The image appears in Mr. Wong\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new book, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSeeing the Light: Four Decades in Chinatown\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Chin Music Press), which centers on Seattle but includes images from other cities, including San Francisco, New York and Vancouver, British Columbia. Juxtaposing photographs with short, anecdotal essays, the book serves as a powerful corrective to decades of one-dimensional and blinkered reporting on neighborhoods generally represented in the cultural mainstream as exotic, insular or irrelevant, as places to order a quick meal or marvel at the colorful rituals of the Chinese New Year.The photos remind us that despite the stubborn, stereotypical view of Chinatowns as places of vibrant exoticism, they continue to serve an important social function as gateways and homes to new immigrants, as guardians of art, history and heritage, and as a refuge from discrimination. Mr. Wong does so not by creating a visual and verbal gloss, but rather by meticulously documenting the rituals of everyday life and focusing on personal stories, ordinary and extraordinary, of people largely ignored in mainstream media.A continuing exploration of the relationship of race to photographic portrayals of race by the professor and curator Maurice Berger.Mr. Wong started photographing Seattle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Chinese-American community in the early 1970s, while working for the International District Emergency Center, a grassroots neighborhood services organization. Later, as a photojournalist for the International Examiner, a Seattle-based Asian-American newspaper, he continued to focus on Chinatown. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI photographed meetings, did portraits, went to community celebrations, and roamed the streets of Chinatown looking for anything that caught my eye,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he later recalled. Among the many contributions of \u00e2\u0080\u009cSeeing the Light\u00e2\u0080\u009d is its eloquent documentation of complex and evolving communities, neighborhoods that exist not for tourists, but as cultural, political, and historic sanctuaries for the Asian-American community. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor me, Chinatown has been a kind of compass by which to find where I belong in this country,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the writer Bonnie Tsui observed in her groundbreaking book, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmerican Chinatown: A People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s History of Five Neighborhoods.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cI haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always felt at ease in my identity as a Chinese-American, and as a young adult it was comforting to know that there was a place I could go in my city where everyone else looked like me.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIf \u00e2\u0080\u009cSeeing the Light\u00e2\u0080\u009d affirms the role of Chinese-American communities in empowering a people, their history has been fraught, complicated by racism, xenophobia and, more recently, the threats of urban renewal and gentrification. In the mid-19th century, Chinese migration to the United States began when natural catastrophes across China inspired some of its more intrepid citizens to go to Gum Shan, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGold Mountain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Chinese nickname for California, and the western regions of North America, stoked by news of gold-rich land and economic opportunity. But as the economy weakened in the United States, the Chinese labor force came to be viewed by white Californians as a threat. Racism and repressive legislation drove Chinese-Americans to self-segregate and form a sanctuary neighborhood in San Francisco: a so-called Chinatown, where close-knit families and benevolent associations sustained a spurned minority. As new businesses thrived within this community, however, the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s white residents continued to view Chinese-Americans as a danger to the region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fragile economy. It was not until the mid-20th century that Chinese-Americans began to enter the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mainstream, with Chinatowns in cities as diverse as New York, Seattle, Washington, Los Angeles and Boston flourishing. But in recent years, gentrification has encroached on some communities, outpricing many Asian-Americans from neighborhoods that had served as cultural havens for decades. At its peak, for example, Chinatown in the District of Columbia was once home to about 3,000 Chinese-Americans. That number has dwindled to 300. In light of this history, Mr. Wong\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vignettes and photographs \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including images of community activism, local businesses and organizations, political leaders, children playing, celebratory rituals and, on a more personal level, reminiscences about his family and student life \u00e2\u0080\u0094 speak to the cultural nuances, complexity and necessity of Chinatown, well beyond the touristic fascination with swirling paper dragons, countless restaurants and trinket shops. In a section titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople,\u00e2\u0080\u009d for example, Mr. Wong photographed and wrote about a range of Chinatown residents, some of them artists in their own right: the Japanese-American photographer Henry Takayoshi, for example, a reminder not only of Chinatown\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cultural diversity but also of the non-Chinese Asian-Americans who have gravitated to its precincts; Ryan Rhinehart, a gay Korean-born drag queen, who died of AIDS in the mid-1990s; Sun Yang, a Seattle artist whose early paintings were of landscapes near his hometown, Anhui, in central east China; Eun-Gyong Lee, legally blind since birth, who daily navigated the bustling metropolis of Seattle; and the sculptor Meng Huang, who transformed the detritus of daily life \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the things people had literally thrown away \u00e2\u0080\u0094 into dynamic assemblages.The overall effect of \u00e2\u0080\u009cSeeing the Light\u00e2\u0080\u009d is to illuminate the cultural uniqueness and social consequence of Chinatown, both historically and in recent years.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat I take away from Chinatown when I leave \u2026 is a sharpened sense of why Chinatown still matters,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Tsui observed in words relevant to Mr. Wong\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important book, adding: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter a century and a half of Chinese immigration, Chinatown can still be the first step for new immigrants into America, and for American-born Chinese into their Chinese heritage. Their personal stories are narrative epics; by reading them, we find out what Chinatown means to its people at present. And by looking behind, we also get a sense of what may lie ahead, beyond its borders.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMaurice Berger is a research professor and the chief curator at the Center for Art, Design and Visual Culture at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County."}

{"Headline": "North Korea Expels BBC Journalists Over Coverage", "Date": "2016-05-09", "News": "Supported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 North Korea expelled a BBC reporting crew on Monday for what it deemed a disrespectful portrayal of the country and its leader, Kim Jong-un, as Mr. Kim used a rare Workers\u2019 Party congress to cement his grip on power.North Korea makes few goods that the rest of the world wants, but it does specialize in exporting bombastic, bellicose pronouncements.In one of his reports, Mr. Wingfield-Hayes said that his team was \u201cin trouble\u201d after shooting a segment in front of a statue of the North\u2019s founding president, Kim Il-sung, in which he said something on camera that he said government minders deemed disrespectful. He said the officials demanded that the video be erased. Mr. Wingfield-Hayes did not elaborate on what he had said.Before its four-day session ended on Monday, the congress bestowed Kim Jong-un with a new top title, chairman of the Workers\u2019 Party, after he called for a more vigorous development of nuclear weapons and missiles, state-run news media reported. The announcement was made during the 10 minutes that a small group of foreign journalists was allowed, for the first time, to watch the meeting, The A.P. reported from Pyongyang, the North\u2019s capital.The congress also elevated two of Mr. Kim\u2019s closest aides \u2014 the party secretary, Choe Ryong-hae, and Pak Pong-ju, the prime minister and chief economic official \u2014 to join the presidium of the party\u2019s Politburo. Mr. Kim leads the presidium, which has two other members: Kim Yong-nam, the head of Parliament, and Hwang Pyong-so, the chief political officer of the military.Mr. Kim, the third-generation leader in his family\u2019s dynastic rule of North Korea, had been widely expected to use the congress to cement his grip on power and have his crucial policies, including the so-called byungjin policy of increasing a nuclear arsenal while rebuilding the economy, adopted as official party lines.It also said the country should launch more satellites. The United Nations has condemned the North\u2019s satellite program as a cover for developing an intercontinental ballistic missile.Mr. Kim also said that his country proudly stuck fast to its \u201csocialist path of our own choosing\u201d by successfully repelling \u201cthe confusing winds of bourgeois liberalization, reform and openness from around us.\u201dIn its decision, the congress also said that North Korea would act like a \u201cresponsible nuclear power,\u201d would not share its nuclear knowledge abroad and would work for \u201cthe denuclearization of the world.\u201d It said it would improve ties with other countries, including South Korea, if they respected the North.But the North made no commitment to denuclearizing itself. Instead, it demanded that the United States prove that it is no longer hostile by stopping its annual joint military drills with South Korea, withdrawing its troops from the peninsula and signing a peace treaty.South Korea dismissed the overture as propaganda, saying that dialogue was possible only when the North convinced the South that it was ready to give up its nuclear weapons.Advertisement"}

But its approach, said Julie Samuels, the executive director, will be to work early with city, state and federal officials on issues that affect tech companies, before laws are passed. Some broader issues like taxes, schools and affordable housing also help determine whether people want to work and live in a city.\u201cNew York is in a competition to be where start-ups are going to locate and bigger tech companies are going to grow second and third offices,\u201d Ms. Samuels said.The new organization arrives at a time when the path ahead for the local tech economy is uncertain. New York, it seems, has become fertile ground for start-ups, but has very few breakout winners.Silicon Valley venture firms suffered some of the biggest losses on those New York start-ups.Start-ups are inherently risky. That is why venture capital firms invest in a broad portfolio of companies, so a few winners can make up for the losers.In New York, it is not the setbacks that stand out as much as the scarcity of lucrative paydays \u2014 start-ups sold to the public or to other corporations for $1 billion or more.There have been a few over the years. In 2007, for example, Google paid $3.1 billion for DoubleClick, an online ad-serving service. In 2013, Yahoo bought Tumblr, a microblogging platform, for $1.1 billion. Last year, Etsy, an online marketplace for handmade and vintage goods, went public at a valuation of $1.8 billion, and traded above that for a while but has since retreated.Yet those are exceptions. \u201cBig exits really haven\u2019t happened yet in New York,\u201d said Fred Wilson, co-founder of Union Square Ventures, a New York venture capital firm. \u201cIt\u2019s a valid criticism.\u201dThat should gradually change, he argued, as the New York tech community matures. Mr. Wilson also said that New York entrepreneurs were influenced by the trading culture of Wall Street. They are more inclined, he said, to build a company, sell it, cash in and move to the next one than some Silicon Valley entrepreneurs who dream bigger and view their company as their life\u2019s work.New York ranked second over all, but was way behind by some measures. Compass estimated the value of all Bay Area start-ups \u2014 including sales to companies, public offerings and private valuations \u2014 at $264 billion to $323 billion. The comparable estimate for New York start-ups was $41 billion to $50 billion.Still, the New York tech economy has shown impressive job growth. An analysis by Jason Bram, a researcher at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, concluded that from 2007 to 2015 New York tech employment grew by more than 60 percent, to 126,170 workers. By contrast, tech employment in the Bay Area was more than 370,000 as of 2014, the most recent figure in the Fed analysis.The gap is hardly surprising, given Silicon Valley\u2019s decades-long head start and singular focus. \u201cTechnology innovation and entrepreneurship \u2014 that\u2019s our business in the Valley,\u201d said Steve Blank, an entrepreneur who lectures on technology and innovation at Stanford, Columbia and New York University.In New York, Mr. Blank said, \u201ctech start-ups have been layered on top of the city\u2019s existing industries,\u201d including advertising, media and finance.And tech giants like Facebook, Google and IBM have been aggressively hiring engineering talent for their New York outposts.Nathan Richardson, chief executive of Trade It, a financial technology start-up in New York, has worked in the Bay Area and in New York.

And because Infor\u2019s software was being overhauled for ease of use, he has hired software developers from New York advertising companies and fashion houses as well as the Parsons School of Design and the Fashion Institute of Technology.\u201cWe\u2019ve picked up some great programmers who understand design,\u201d Mr. Phillips said. \u201cAnd I wanted my engineers to be around people who weren\u2019t all engineers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Syria, Russia Plays Bach Where ISIS Executed 25", "Date": "2016-05-05", "News": "Supported byPALMYRA, Syria \u2014 Russia has made its mark on Syria with the crash of bombs and the thud of artillery. On Thursday the Russians added gentler sounds: live classical music echoing through an ancient stone theater and into the eerie, empty desert.The orchestra played pieces by Johann Sebastian Bach and two Russian composers, Sergei Prokofiev and Rodion Shchedrin, in a second-century Roman amphitheater, the set for a 2015 film produced by the Islamic State that featured the execution of 25 people.The contrast was intended to underscore what Russia sees as its underappreciated role in helping Syrian forces liberate Palmyra from zealots and fighting on the side of civilization against barbarism.The Russians were so eager to make that point that they flew a group of reporters from Moscow to Syria and then bused them to Palmyra to see the performance. The production, attended by a heavily guarded V.I.P. guest list, was broadcast live on Russian state television.Viewers in Russia saw the concert spliced with videos of Islamic State atrocities, part of a domestic political operation intended to mobilize pride in Russia\u2019s military role abroad, at a time when the economy at home is mired in the second year of a deep recession.Mr. Putin thanked the musicians by video link from his vacation home on the Black Sea.He said the performance signaled \u201chope for Palmyra\u2019s revival as the heritage of the whole humanity, but also as hope that our contemporary civilization will be relieved from this horrible disease, international terrorism.\u201dThe deployment of classical musicians in territory reconquered, with Russian help, by Syrian forces just two months ago reprised a performance conducted by Mr. Gergiev in August 2008 to celebrate Russia\u2019s victory in a brief war with the former Soviet republic of Georgia over South Ossetia. That Georgian region, also with Moscow\u2019s help, has declared itself an independent state, like the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine.Mr. Gergiev, the artistic and general director of the Mariinsky Theater Orchestra in St. Petersburg, music director of the Munich Symphony Orchestra and previously the principal conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra, has long been an eager supporter of Russia\u2019s direction under President Putin. He joined other prominent cultural figures in signing an open letter in 2014 in support of Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in Ukraine.Also taking part in the Palmyra spectacle, before an audience of Russian and Syrian soldiers, officials and dignitaries, was Mr. Putin\u2019s friend Mr. Roldugin, the cellist whose name surfaced last month in leaked papers from a Panama law firm that indicated he had $2 billion in offshore accounts.Wearing a white cap and accompanied by the orchestra, he played \u201cQuadrille\u201d from \u201cNot Only Love,\u201d an opera by Shchedrin.Mr. Putin has dismissed the so-called Panama Papers disclosures as a plot \u201cto weaken us from within\u201d and said Mr. Roldugin had used the money attributed to offshore companies he controlled to import musical instruments.The dignitaries attending the concert included several foreign ambassadors to Unesco, the United Nations cultural agency based in Paris, which has declared Palmyra a World Heritage Site.Darko Tanaskovic, the ambassador from Serbia, said the gathering was a way for \u201cinternational society\u201d to give Syrians hope.As it expanded across Iraq and Syria, the Islamic State destroyed many archaeological sites, looting them for profit and damaging some for propaganda.\u201cWe have to solve the problems of migrants in Europe, but we have to give them hope to live here as well,\u201d he said.Shortly before the concert, the desert silence was broken by a thud from a Russian demining center near the ruins.The concert on Thursday, like Mr. Gergiev\u2019s 2008 concert in Tskhinvali, the capital of South Ossetia, involved much more than just music. While showcasing Russia\u2019s musical richness, it was also a military mission, with guests bused in a heavily guarded convoy escorted by helicopter gunships. The route from Latakia, the site of Russia\u2019s main military base on Syria\u2019s Mediterranean coast, led past Syrian military outposts, destroyed villages, clusters of burned vehicles and other reminders of the fierce fighting that had raged in an area held by the Islamic State from May 2015 until March this year.The concert, performed by Mr. Gergiev\u2019s Mariinsky Theater Orchestra, was held just a week after Unesco experts had visited to assess the destruction inflicted by the militant group. They reported extensive damage to the city\u2019s museum, where statues had been \u201cdefaced, smashed, their heads severed, the fragments left lying on the ground.\u201d Also destroyed was an arch and the Temple of Baal Shamin, which the experts said had been \u201csmashed to smithereens.\u201dWestern governments have been reluctant to endorse Russia\u2019s military role in Syria, which they have repeatedly portrayed as an effort to not merely uproot terrorism but to help Syria\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad, crush all opposition, including rebel groups supported by the West. Russia has also been accused of bombing hospitals, something Moscow denies, and propping up a brutal dictator.Russia\u2019s military first became directly involved in the Syrian conflict last September. Declaring the mission mostly accomplished, Mr. Putin in March ordered the withdrawal of the \u201cmain part\u201d of Russian forces.Yet at Russia\u2019s base in Latakia this week there was no sign of any pullout at an airfield clogged with warplanes and helicopters. Su-24 fighter-bombers were taking off and landing regularly.A library established in a shipping container offered a growing collection of Russian-language novels and other books. Sgt. Alexander Korenyev, the librarian, said it had 1,476 titles when he arrived three months ago and about 2,000 today. Many have military themes, like a tome titled \u201cThe Winged Heroes of Moscow.\u201d\u201cThe officers like history, the soldiers science fiction and the women in the canteen \u2014 well, you understand \u2014 like romances,\u201d the librarian said.The Russian military has also opened a rest center \u2014 called a \u201cpsychological unloading\u201d in Russian \u2014 in a base tent. Oil paintings of a birch forest and a snowy landscape adorn the tent walls to help soldiers forget Syria.As part of a push to persuade skeptics of its intervention, Russia has deployed teams of officers to promote reconciliation between the Syrian government and its opponents.The Russians, like the American military in Iraq after the 2003 invasion, are diving into tangled local politics.A day before the concert, the Russian military took reporters to Kaukab, a village east of Latakia, where local chiefs held what was described as a \u201creconciliation ceremony\u201d with the Syrian government. The village, on a hill overlooking orchards and badly damaged by recent fighting, looked deserted at first, but when the buses carrying reporters arrived, a crowd of children appeared waving portraits of Mr. Assad.The Russians said they had carried out 92 such ceremonies involving 52 armed groups.As shadows lengthened in Palmyra after Thursday\u2019s concert and dusk cooled the heat of the day, Mr. Roldugin, the cello maestro, said he had left his Stradivarius home.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t bring such a cello to this climate, with the heat and the dust,\u201d Mr. Roldugin said, portraying himself as a musician of modest means that seemingly belied his vast \u2014 at least on paper \u2014 offshore wealth. \u201cIt\u2019s a rare instrument,\u201d he said. \u201cIt costs a lot.\u201dAn article on May 6 about a concert by a Russian orchestra, the Mariinsky Theater Orchestra, in Palmyra, a Syrian city of ancient Roman ruins further damaged by the Islamic State during its occupation, misspelled the given name of one of the composers whose music was played and misstated one of the other orchestral titles of Valery Gergiev, artistic director of the Mariinsky. The composer was Johann Sebastian Bach, not Johan, and Mr. Gergiev is also the current music director of the Munich Symphony Orchestra, not its former principal conductor.Andrew E. Kramer reported from Palmyra, and Andrew Higgins from Moscow. Alexandra Odynova and Ivan Nechepurenko contributed reporting from Moscow.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Challenge to Donald Trump\u2019s Energy Claims: Economic Reality", "Date": "2016-05-27", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In his pledge to aggressively expand American oil and gas production, and his framing of that push as a salvation for the nation\u2019s economic and fiscal health, Donald J. Trump is following in the footsteps of decades of Republican politicians.But in a market where domestic oil production is already higher than it has been in 40 years, and natural gas production is at a historic high, those proposals have run up against a major problem: the global economy.The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries \u2014 especially its leading producer, Saudi Arabia \u2014 also gets a say. If it decides to keep the spigot cranked, the bar for profitable American production gets higher, investment falls and the sector contracts, regardless of Mr. Trump\u2019s intentions.Energy policy experts who followed Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals said that while some hewed to standard Republican orthodoxy, others appeared implausible and ill considered.One major consequence of the surge in domestic natural gas production has been a turn by electricity generators toward gas from coal. That has cost thousands of coal jobs. Yet Mr. Trump has both vowed to increase natural gas production even as he promises to restore coal jobs, scoffed Robert N. Stavins, director of the environmental economics program at Harvard.\u201cTrump will presumably support less regulation and other actions to encourage greater use of fracking. That would tend to lower natural gas prices,\u201d Mr. Stavins wrote in an email. \u201cAnd, therefore, Trump\u2019s promised support of greater natural gas fracking would actually have the effect of lowering demand for coal, causing more mines to close.\u201dMr. Stavins added, \u201cHe can\u2019t have it both ways \u2014 talk up expanding natural gas supply when in North Dakota, and talk about bringing back coal mining jobs when in Kentucky!\u201dAt a news conference before his North Dakota speech, Mr. Trump said he could bring the cost of coal down as well, by eliminating or easing environmental regulations.Experts also questioned Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that an aggressive push to expand oil and gas production would increase employment, economic growth and federal revenue.Even with oil and gas production at or near record highs, the industry is not a large direct employer. Last year, there were 103,000 workers directly employed in oil and gas extraction, and 68,000 workers in coal mining, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Yet in his speech, Mr. Trump claimed that the oil and natural gas industry \u201csupports 10 million high-paying jobs.\u201d\u201cThis would suggest that his energy policies alone would give a 5 percent boost to the entire economy,\u201d Mr. Victor said. \u201cThat strikes me as fantasy. The numbers seem off by an order of magnitude.\u201dMr. Trump also laid out plans to spend new federal revenue that he claimed would be generated by new oil and gas drilling.\u201cWe will make so much money with energy that we will start to pay down our $19 trillion debt,\u201d he claimed. \u201cWe\u2019ll use the revenue from energy for roads, schools, bridges and infrastructure.\u201dBut energy economists dismissed the idea that new drilling could bring enough money to substantially fund such proposals. In 2015, coal, oil and gas companies paid the federal government $9.6 billion in fees and royalties for drilling on public lands and waters, in a budget of $3.8 trillion. Even with a large expansion of such drilling on public land, experts say it is difficult to predict a new such revenue stream at the scale envisioned by Mr. Trump.The chief source of federal revenue from coal, oil and gas extraction comes from taxes and fees paid by companies drilling and mining on federal lands and waters, but most oil and gas production takes place on state or private land. Mr. Trump has declared that he will lift regulatory barriers to drilling on federal lands and waters, but experts say that will not be easy.\u201cIt\u2019s not like you just sit in the Oval Office and press a \u2018rigs\u2019 button,\u201d Mr. Victor said. \u201cThere are tremendous legal and bureaucratic challenges and an extremely long time horizon.\u201dAnd as long as the global market remains glutted, companies will be disinclined to lease federal land for new drilling. With the lifting of sanctions under the nuclear deal, Iranian oil is only beginning to enter the world market in a big way.Economists also derided Mr. Trump\u2019s repeated calls for \u201cenergy independence\u201d \u2014 a phrase commonly used by politicians to suggest that the United States could isolate itself from global energy markets, producing and consuming only what it needs.Several economists pointed out that the best way to wean the nation from imported oil is to lower the dependence on oil over all, with policies designed to reduce oil demand.\u201cThe oil supply side will take care of itself, through the market,\u201d Mr. Kloza said. \u201cThe demand side is where progress can be made through policy. The best thing a president could do, given the market, would be to lower oil demand.\u201dHe added, \u201cI doubt if Trump understands that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Historian Is at Heart of Indianapolis Motor Speedway\u2019s Home", "Date": "2016-05-29", "News": "Supported bySPEEDWAY, Ind. \u2014 Every year, for decades, on the morning of the Indianapolis 500, the speedway historian Donald Davidson made it a tradition to walk from his home here to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, which is about a mile away.When Davidson decided to move here from his native England in 1964 to pursue his fascination with the Greatest Spectacle in Racing \u2014 as it was widely known then \u2014 he chose to live in Speedway, the town named for the racetrack within its borders.There was never any other real consideration for him.\u201cI mean, where else would I live?\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cSpeedway the town and the speedway itself have become my life.\u201dIndeed, Davidson\u2019s encyclopedic knowledge of the race, and more than a half-century of attending it and associating with its stars, is listed by some sources alongside the actress Joyce DeWitt (of \u201cThree\u2019s Company\") among the town\u2019s most notable residents. She merely lived here as a child; Davidson has been living in the same house here, within earshot of the epicenter of racing, for nearly five decades.Ahead of the 100th Indianapolis 500 on Sunday, nine past winners reminisced about what makes the race great.Now 73 and somewhat hobbled by arthritis in his ankles, Davidson concedes that he has had to give up his neighborhood walk in favor of a ride. But he will always remember the ritual fondly. He would leave his home through the back gate, walking a few paces down a back alley onto 15th Street, then zigzag over toward 16th, where the speedway\u2019s main entrance used to be. Davidson said he would be reminded what a grass-roots tradition the race was for so many others.\u201cYou would see fathers and sons, families and friends carrying their picnic baskets and their blankets, their chair cushions, dragging their coolers; it was a very cool thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was so all-American. I loved it, always did, still do.\u201dBy the time he would reach the gates of the famed Brickyard, the trickle of friends and neighbors he started out with would integrate into an ever-larger throng of racegoers, who swelled this working-class town\u2019s population, normally about 12,000 residents, to several hundred thousand.The speedway and the town were founded by Carl Fisher, who along with a group of partners bought a large tract of farmland five miles west of downtown Indianapolis in 1909. The two-and-a-half-mile racetrack was built first (and rebuilt again with a brick surface two years later, after an original base of cinders proved too destructive), and the first 500-mile race was held in 1911. The town was laid out a year later.Fisher envisioned the town as an experiment. He wanted to create a new kind of city: a 20th-century city populated by cars, not horses, as its primary mode of transportation. Not only would the residents build the cars and parts to supply greater Indianapolis\u2019s burgeoning auto industry, they and the town would also produce inventions and innovations in transportation.The town\u2019s mission statement was fulfilled to a degree, as several plants were built and operated here for many years, feeding a middle-class economy, but Speedway\u2019s growth was stunted by an overall decline in the Indianapolis auto industry.When Davidson moved here, Speedway was in many ways just a quiet little town \u2014 except for the month of May, when the hordes would converge here for weeks of practice, qualifying and the race itself. Practice days could draw 50,000; pole position qualifying might bring in 200,000. The race, for which official attendance figures were never given, drew an estimated 400,000, making it the largest single-day sporting event in the world.But in the last 20 years, the race and the sport of IndyCar racing itself have been in decline. A dispute between speedway management and the competitors for control of the sport devolved into boycotts, the split of sanctioning bodies and schedules, and the general flight of sponsors.Though the rift was healed over time, the sport\u2019s recovery has been further slowed by a rocky economy. So the old wounds have been hard to heal, and the herds flocking to the speedway on race mornings have been thinned by more than the loss of Davidson.But this year, the indications were that the good old days may be back again.\u201cThis year, the town will be more like it was for many years, on race day at least, because of the huge amount of interest around this year\u2019s 100th running of the 500,\u201d Davidson said, adding, \u201cThis would be a good year to do the walk again.\u201dSpeedway, the town built by a racetrack more than a century ago, was once again the center of the racing world.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mitsubishi Cheating Scandal Expands to More Models", "Date": "2016-05-11", "News": "Supported byTOKYO \u2014 A fuel-economy cheating scandal that began with a single line of microcars now encompasses the entire domestic lineup of Mitsubishi Motors after the carmaker admitted on Wednesday that it had published exaggerated mileage ratings for every model it sells in Japan.Mitsubishi disclosed last month that it had been using improper methods to test fuel economy for 25 years. It disclosed the mistake after engineers at another carmaker, Nissan, discovered discrepancies in the ratings of a family of ultralight cars developed by Mitsubishi and sold by both companies. Mitsubishi did not initially say how extensively it had used the unapproved methods, whether it was on all models or just a few.On Wednesday, Mitsubishi added nine more models \u2014 the remainder of its current lineup \u2014 to the list of affected vehicles. The company said it was still retesting older vehicles, but it said it had confirmed discrepancies in the ratings of an unspecified number of discontinued models, too.The company said it had even misstated the energy efficiency of a vehicle that does not use gasoline, the all-electric i-MiEV. It acknowledged that there could be problems with the ratings of every car and truck it had produced since 1991.The widening scandal at Mitsubishi adds to the scrutiny over carmakers\u2019 reports of fuel economy and pollution ratings. The industry\u2019s reputation took a serious blow when Volkswagen admitted last year to cheating on emissions tests.Mitsubishi is already a diminished brand, especially at home. Its market share in Japan has shriveled since a scandal in the 2000s in which officials admitted hiding reports of dangerous vehicle defects for decades.Today, Mitsubishi\u2019s favored markets are in areas like Southeast Asia and Russia. It sells only about 10 percent of its cars in Japan.Analysts have speculated that Mitsubishi, a small manufacturer with far fewer resources than Nissan, promised its partner a car with impressive mileage specifications but was unable to deliver. Cheap, small-engine microcars are a fiercely competitive segment of the auto market in Japan, where they account for 40 percent of new cars sold.\u201cI think the fact that work was being done in an insular company was one big factor,\u201d Chairman Osamu Masuko said at a news conference. He said successive Mitsubishi development teams had used the same flawed testing methods without questioning them.\u201cThere was perhaps a sense that, if someone authorized something in the past, it couldn\u2019t be wrong,\u201d he said.Mr. Masuko said he and other top executives had been unaware of the cheating. He said Mitsubishi was still investigating how a fuel-economy testing method not approved for use in Japan came to be used on domestic models.The issue centers on the way engineers calculate so-called running resistance, the effect of the friction between tires and the road, under various driving conditions. The method used by Mitsubishi tends to result in a more flattering assessment of fuel economy and is approved in the United States but not in Japan.Mitsubishi said discrepancies in the ratings of the nine additional models named on Wednesday were relatively small, amounting only to \u201cseveral percent.\u201d The company said it had exaggerated the mileage of the ultralight car line \u2014 sold by Mitsubishi as the eK and Nissan as the DAYZ \u2014 by a much greater extent, from 5 to 15 percent.Hisako Ueno contributed reportingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "$1 Billion Went to Buffalo. Cuomo Donors Benefited.", "Date": "2016-05-24", "News": "Supported byALBANY \u2014 It was to be the salvation of Buffalo, a billion-dollar godsend from the administration of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo that promised to revitalize the depleted city with bold investments there and across western New York.In the latest indication of the Buffalo Billion\u2019s woes, state officials unexpectedly postponed approving an infusion of nearly $500 million for the SolarCity project last week, as legislators in Albany hinted they would exercise more oversight of the governor\u2019s banner economic initiative.Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has repeatedly praised the Buffalo Billion\u2019s successes, citing new jobs, new buildings and a new optimism in the city. But federal investigators\u2019 interest seems to lie less with whether the people of Buffalo will ultimately benefit than with those who already have: a tangle of well-connected players \u2014 including developers and frequent donors to the governor \u2014 who have feasted on Buffalo Billion money.A small group of densely interwoven figures linked to multiple projects and state entities has conceived, built and promoted most of the central Buffalo Billion initiatives, leading to accusations by some government watchdogs of conflicts of interest and questionable uses of state subsidies.By last month, when investigators subpoenaed Mr. Cuomo\u2019s office, the federal inquiry appeared to be focusing on the links between state officials and the sprawling investment New York has made, not only in Buffalo, but also in Syracuse and other struggling upstate cities.While no one has been charged, the governor\u2019s office has opened its own investigation into what it has called suspicions of \u201cimproper lobbying and undisclosed conflicts of interest\u201d that may have defrauded the state. The administration has also taken the unusual step of requiring that all decisions regarding the projects be reviewed by Bart M. Schwartz, the lawyer leading the governor\u2019s investigation.The Cuomo administration strongly defends the project, noting drops in unemployment and rises in spending as signs of Buffalo\u2019s turnaround. And at a news conference on Tuesday, the governor called the Buffalo Billion a \u201ctremendous success,\u201d adding that the encroaching investigation did not \u201cgo to the essence\u201d of the program.In November 2013, Mr. Ciminelli and his wife, Ann Louise, hosted a fund-raiser for Mr. Cuomo in Buffalo, three weeks before submitting a proposal to build parts of the Buffalo Billion. The couple gave $29,200 to the governor in January 2014, shortly before LPCiminelli was selected as one of the winning developers.In the latter half of 2014, Mr. Cuomo tripled down on SolarCity, raising the state\u2019s commitment to $750 million, from $225 million, even as he hopped across western New York, collecting campaign donations from at least two developers connected to Buffalo Billion projects, in the run-up to his successful bid for a second term.LPCiminelli, which has received a federal subpoena in the case, says it is not a target of the investigation.Federal investigators are looking into the activities of one person tied to LPCiminelli: Todd R. Howe, a well-connected lobbyist who once worked for Mr. Cuomo and his father, and whose links to several companies that have received state projects are under scrutiny.Until he was recently fired, Mr. Howe worked for Whiteman Osterman & Hanna, a prominent Albany law firm; among its clients was the State University of New York Polytechnic Institute, which, as a linchpin of the Cuomo administration\u2019s efforts to stimulate economic growth upstate, has received and helped distribute hundreds of millions of dollars in state funds.Whiteman Osterman & Hanna has also represented separate interests that sought Buffalo Billion money.Mr. Ciminelli\u2019s brother, Paul Ciminelli, who leads a separate real estate development firm, has also capitalized on the Buffalo Billion gold rush.Ciminelli Real Estate Corporation, headed by Paul Ciminelli, has benefited from the Buffalo Billion through two major enterprises, a medical innovation center and an information technology project.And in 2013, when Ciminelli Real Estate lost one of the largest tenants in its Key Center building in Buffalo \u2014 the tenant was granted millions of dollars in tax breaks to move to a new building two blocks away \u2014 Mr. Ciminelli did not have to wait long to recoup the loss. Mr. Cuomo announced in June 2014 that the state would bring IBM to Key Center.About $25 million in state money would go to redeveloping part of the building to suit IBM\u2019s needs, a project for which the state hired McGuire Development Company, another Buffalo developer. Two months after Mr. Cuomo\u2019s office announced McGuire\u2019s selection, it donated $25,000 to the governor\u2019s re-election campaign, with $10,000 more coming later in the year.Neither the Ciminelli Real Estate Corporation nor a spokeswoman for McGuire responded to a request for comment.The Buffalo Billion includes more than a dozen other regional projects, a potpourri of state-backed ventures such as an information technology hub, a pharmaceutical research center, a pediatric hospital, a visual effects center, various residential redevelopments and even a candy store renovation.Other companies involved in building the Buffalo Billion have financially supported Mr. Cuomo as well. A small chunk of Buffalo Billion funds designated for revitalizing neighborhoods and improving transit in the city went to about two dozen companies and local groups, a few of which also donated to the governor.His office said the formal awarding of the SolarCity contract was made by Fort Schuyler on behalf of the state. It has also said that donations, no matter how substantial, do not influence official actions.Howard Zemsky, the chief executive of Empire State Development, the state\u2019s economic development agency, argued that while Mr. Bharara\u2019s inquiry may have cast a temporary shadow over the Buffalo Billion, the program\u2019s long-term legacy would be positive.\u201cMy personal belief is that the investigation will come and go and it will find out what it finds out,\u201d Mr. Zemsky said. \u201cBut one thing I can tell you for sure is the economic development planning that has gone on in Buffalo has had a tremendous impact.\u201dThe growing concerns about the Buffalo Billion have reached the capital, where the Public Authorities Control Board delayed a May 18 meeting at which it was set to approve $485 million in new funds for SolarCity.Jerry Gretzinger, a spokesman for SUNY Poly, said SolarCity had actually increased the total number of jobs it had promised throughout the state \u2014 5,000 in 10 years \u2014 though automation at the Buffalo factory meant that fewer jobs would be in manufacturing and more would be in research, sales and management.SolarCity also said that federal agents had been in contact and that it was cooperating with the investigation.For his part, Mr. Cuomo, who attributed the delay in the meeting of the authorities board to a scheduling issue, said last week that he wanted people to \u201chave total confidence and trust in the integrity of this government\u201d and welcomed the scrutiny by federal agents.\u201cIf there\u2019s a question about Buffalo Billion, fine, any way we can help the U.S. attorney in his investigation and we\u2019ll do our own independent inquiry,\u201d he said.The control board is now scheduled to take up the SolarCity money on Wednesday. But there remains the question of whether Mr. Cuomo\u2019s approach to revitalizing the upstate economy is a good return on a sizable taxpayer investment.John Kaehny, the executive director of Reinvent Albany, a government watchdog group, said it remained to be seen whether the Buffalo Billion was a good use of state funds.\u201cYou have to ask yourself,\u201d Mr. Kaehny said, \u201cif we\u2019re going to spend $750 million to help people in Buffalo, how the heck did we end up with this?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Unplugging the Colorado River", "Date": "2016-05-20", "News": "OpinionCould the end be near for one of the West\u2019s biggest dams?Supported byWEDGED between Arizona and Utah, less than 20 miles upriver from the Grand Canyon, a soaring concrete wall nearly the height of two football fields blocks the flow of the Colorado River. There, at Glen Canyon Dam, the river is turned back on itself, drowning more than 200 miles of plasma-red gorges and replacing the Colorado\u2019s free-spirited rapids with an immense lake of flat, still water called Lake Powell, the nation\u2019s second-largest reserve.When Glen Canyon Dam was built in the middle of the last century, giant dam projects promised to elevate the American West above its greatest handicap \u2014 a perennial shortage of water. These monolithic wonders of engineering would bring wild rivers to heel, produce cheap, clean power and stockpile water necessary to grow a thriving economy in the desert. And because they were often remotely located, they were rarely questioned.But today, there are signs that the promise of this great dam and others has run its course.Climate change is fundamentally altering the environment, making the West hotter and drier. There is less water to store, and few remaining good sites for new dams.Many of the West\u2019s big dams, meanwhile, have proved far less efficient and effective than their champions had hoped. They have altered ecosystems and disrupted fisheries. They have left taxpayers saddled with debt.And in what is perhaps the most egregious failure for a system intended to conserve water, many of the reservoirs created by these dams lose hundreds of billions of gallons of precious water each year to evaporation and, sometimes, to leakage underground. These losses increasingly undercut the longstanding benefits of damming big rivers like the Colorado, and may now be making the West\u2019s water crisis worse.In no place is this lesson more acute than at Glen Canyon.And yet even as these consequences come into focus, four states on the Colorado River are developing plans to build new dams and river diversions in an effort to seize a larger share of dwindling water supplies for themselves before that water flows downstream.The projects, coupled with perhaps the most severe water shortages the region has ever seen, have reignited a debate about whether 20th-century solutions can address the challenges of a 21st-century drought, with a growing chorus of prominent former officials saying the plans fly in the face of a new climate reality.\u201cThe Colorado River system is changing rapidly,\u201d said Daniel Beard, a former commissioner of the federal Bureau of Reclamation, which oversees the government\u2019s dams in the West. \u201cWe have a responsibility to reassess the fundamental precepts of how we have managed the river.\u201dThat reassessment, Mr. Beard and others said, demands that even as new projects are debated, it is time to decommission one of the grandest dams of them all, Glen Canyon.The dam, completed in 1963, was erected as a compromise.In 1956 the Colorado River Storage Project Act paved the way for the construction of four large power-generating dams in the upper basin of the Colorado River \u2014 a project meant to match the dam development that the southern half of the river had already seen. The Bureau of Reclamation had zeroed in on a dam site on a tributary in northwestern Colorado called the Green River, where the resulting reservoir would have submerged a tract of treasured, fossil-laden parkland called Dinosaur National Monument. Environmentalists, led by David Brower, executive director of the Sierra Club, fought passionately to preserve the monument in one of the nation\u2019s epic conservation battles.As a compromise, all sides agreed instead to build a dam at a remote spot in southern Utah called Glen Canyon, in a region far from highways, about 200 miles northeast of Las Vegas. Glen Canyon Dam would help normalize the erratic flows of the Colorado and flood a land of barren sandstone domes and inaccessible dendritic canyons \u2014 transforming them into a surreal oasis called Lake Powell.The result was an elegant, sweeping structure engineered in an arch bowing against the pressure of the water, enabling a relatively thin sheet of concrete to withstand unfathomable forces. The reservoir behind the dam would be so deep that the sheer height of the water promised to generate enormous currents of power. By all measures, its completion was a feat.It took 17 years for the reservoir to fill; 19 years later, a steady decline began. Thanks to the steady overuse of the Colorado River system \u2014 which provides water to one in eight Americans and supports one-seventh of the nation\u2019s crops \u2014 Lake Powell has been drained to less than half of its capacity as less water flows into it than is taken out.That relative puddle is no longer capable of generating the amount of power the dam\u2019s builders originally planned, and so the power has become more expensive for the government to deliver, with the burden increasingly falling on the nation\u2019s taxpayers. In 2014 the agency managing power at the dam spent $62 million buying extra power on the open market to make up for shortfalls. The dam\u2019s power sales are relied on to pay for the operations of other, smaller, dams and reservoirs used for irrigation in the West, and as Glen Canyon crumbles financially, so might the system that depends on it.But it is not just the reservoir\u2019s overuse that is causing it to shrink. More than 160 billion gallons of water evaporate off Lake Powell\u2019s surface every year, enough to lower the reservoir by four inches each month. Another 120 billion gallons are believed to leak out of the bottom of the canyon each year into fissures in the earth \u2014 a loss that if tallied up over the life of the dam amounts to more than a year\u2019s flow of the entire Colorado River.In all, these debits amount to \u201cthe largest loss of water on the Colorado River,\u201d Mr. Beard said, enough to supply some nine million people each year.Glen Canyon is not the only dam to fall out of favor. Other major projects are also being decommissioned or re-evaluated.The Hoover Dam\u2019s Lake Mead, which on Wednesday fell to its lowest level ever, some 145 feet below capacity, also loses hundreds of billions of gallons to evaporation and is now 37 percent full. The lake behind Arizona\u2019s Coolidge Dam, one of the state\u2019s largest reservoirs, is virtually empty.And dams are coming down. Six Western dams were deconstructed in 2015 alone. Just last month California and Oregon agreed to dismantle four more power-generating dams on the Klamath River, having realized that the facilities were crippling native salmon fisheries, which also have enormous economic value. And earlier this month a federal judge in Oregon ruled that, because of extensive ecological damage, the system of dams on the Snake and Columbia Rivers \u201ccries out for a major overhaul.\u201dStill, on the Colorado, water managers dispute the notion that it\u2019s time for a change.Glen Canyon Dam may be past its prime, said Michael Connor, the deputy Interior secretary and a former commissioner of reclamation, but it\u2019s not past its usefulness. Though he called the amount of water lost to evaporation and leakage \u201cincredibly significant,\u201d Mr. Connor credited Glen Canyon with numbing the pain of the recent drought. \u201cLook at the last 15 years,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the lowest inflow in history and there\u2019s been no shortages on the Colorado River, and that\u2019s because of Glen Canyon Dam and Lake Powell and Hoover Dam and Lake Mead.\u201dThere is also a political tide to be reckoned with: the delicate peace accord struck among seven Western states in 1922, and later with Mexico, that divides Colorado River water among them, and the fear that they\u2019d never be able to reach such an agreement again. Lake Powell is the gateway that gives the Colorado\u2019s upper basin states control of their water, and a way to withhold every drop not required to be sent to the states downriver. Get rid of Powell, its protectors warn, and the states will drag one another into legal chaos.But decommissioning Glen Canyon Dam could offer a solution hard to ignore \u2014 a cheap, immediate and significant new source of water where it is most desperately needed.The idea is this: Since two of the nation\u2019s largest reservoirs \u2014 Lake Mead and Lake Powell, just 300 miles apart \u2014 depend on the same dwindling water source but are each less than half full, they should be combined into one. Lake Mead would be deeper, and its evaporative losses would increase. But the surface area of Lake Powell would be substantially reduced, and the evaporating water from there would be saved. Furthermore, sending the water out of Glen Canyon would move it from a valley that leaks like a sieve into one that is watertight. Evaporation losses at Mead \u2014 say plan proponents \u2014 would be more than offset by savings at Lake Powell.In all, according to Tom Myers, a hydrologist who studied the proposal for the Glen Canyon Institute, an environmental group advocating for combining the two reservoirs, about 179 billion gallons of water would be saved each year \u2014 more than enough to supply the population of the city of Los Angeles.The argument has weight because both reservoirs have been struggling to remain half full, and may never refill as temperatures rise because of climate change. At the same time, the Bureau of Reclamation predicts that demand for water will continue to increase on the river so much that by 2060 the region will run short by a trillion gallons each year.The Glen Canyon Dam itself would not be removed. Rather, its gates would be opened, and the water behind it allowed to pass through, restoring the natural flows into the Grand Canyon just below it, draining Lake Powell, and allowing the magnificently scenic landscape of Glen Canyon to be resurrected.The water would not be lost. It would simply flow down through the Grand Canyon and be recaptured behind the Hoover Dam in Lake Mead.\u201cTo me it is a no-brainer,\u201d said David Wegner, who studied Glen Canyon as a scientist with the Department of Interior. \u201cYou\u2019ve got very few options.\u201dVast tracts of land now submerged would be restored, and broad sections of river pinned between vertical canyon walls would be transformed into remote wilderness valleys, their floors once again inviting exploration on horseback or on foot. Dozens of archaeological sites, their walls covered in petroglyphs, would be revealed. The flow of the river through the Grand Canyon would again be defined mainly by the precipitation gathered by the mountains upstream.Restoring Glen Canyon this way has long been the campaign of ardent environmentalists. Mr. Brower, who agreed to the dam\u2019s construction without having ever visited Glen Canyon, mounted an intense campaign to save \u201cthe place no one knew\u201d after seeing it. He called the reservoir his greatest regret, and the Glen Canyon dam has been a potent symbol of the desecration of wild places ever since.Now the shortages on the river, and the likelihood that climate change is certain to make them worse, have breathed new, pragmatic life into their arguments.Whether the \u201cFill Mead First\u201d proposal would improve the water supply depends on whether Mr. Myers is right about the amount of water that leaks out of the bottom of Lake Powell. He puts that number at about 124 billion gallons each year. But the Bureau of Reclamation has not adopted Mr. Myers\u2019s findings and has long said that water that seeps into the ground eventually returns to the river. Combining the reservoirs would save negligible amounts of water, in the bureau\u2019s view.\u201cThis is an attempt to find a water supply rationale which supports their recreational focus and narrow view of what the river should look like,\u201d said Colby Pellegrino, the Colorado River programs manager for the Southern Nevada Water Authority.Ultimately, the decision to drain Lake Powell \u2014 or perhaps to forgo the other new dam and water projects now in the works on the river \u2014 comes down to a question of whether the seven states and Mexico that share the Colorado River really need the water badly enough.If they conclude that they do, abandoning parochial concerns about how the river is supposed to work, and changing the status quo, however uncomfortable or complicated, will begin to seem worth it.But Jim Lochhead, chief executive of Denver\u2019s water utility, said decommissioning the dam would probably require an act of Congress, a new agreement among seven state legislatures, a revised treaty with Mexico, and a lengthy federal environmental impact analysis.\u201cA half a million acre feet sounds like a lot of water,\u201d he said, referring to the water saved by combining the Powell and Mead reservoirs, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s significant enough, frankly, to justify going through all of that.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the chief executive of Denver\u2019s water utility. He is Jim Lochhead, not Lockhead. The article also misspelled the surname of the deputy Interior secretary. He is Michael Connor, not Conner.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Slice of the Confederacy in the Interior of Brazil", "Date": "2016-05-08", "News": "Supported bySanta B\u00e1rbara D\u2019Oeste Journal\u201cWe\u2019re not racists,\u201d said C\u00edcero Carr, 54, an engineer whose great-great-grandfather hailed from Texas. Wearing a fedora featuring the rebel battle flag, he explained in Portuguese, \u201cWe\u2019re just revering our ancestors who had the good sense to settle in Brazil.\u201dAt the annual celebration of Brazil\u2019s self-described Confederados one scorching Sunday in April, Confederate flags adorned the hoop-skirted gowns of young belles and the trucker caps worn by beer-guzzling bikers, as well as the graves of pioneers with surnames like McAlpine, Northrup and Seawright.The presence of the Confederados in the interior of S\u00e3o Paulo State dates to an effort by Emperor Dom Pedro II, a staunch ally of the Confederate States of America during the Civil War, to lure white immigrants to Brazil. Thousands of Southerners took him up on his offer, moving here in the 1860s and 1870s.Unable to adjust to Brazil\u2019s boom-and-bust economy, many of the colonists returned to the United States. But others put down stakes in a country that was the last in the Americas to abolish slavery, doing so in 1888, allowing some of the Americans to acquire slaves for their plantations in Brazil.Instead, the descendants of the Confederates, who are thought to number in the thousands across Brazil, generally say their festivities are detached from the polarizing views around similar commemorations in the United States.Among the hundreds who attended April\u2019s Festa Confederada (Confederate Party), including some visitors of African descent, the discussion around the flag\u2019s meaning to descendants of enslaved Africans hardly registered. (Brazilians who define themselves as black or mixed race make up nearly 51 percent of the country\u2019s population, according to Brazil\u2019s 2010 census.)Marcelo Sans Dodson, the president of the organization here representing descendants of Confederates, expressed his condolences in a statement about the Charleston massacre. He called the killings a \u201cclear example of intolerance.\u201dStill, Mr. Dodson defended using symbols of the Old South to celebrate the heritage of Brazil\u2019s Confederados. \u201cFor us,\u201d he said, \u201cthe Confederate flag symbolizes family, unity, fraternity and friendship.\u201dSome Confederados go further, arguing that examples of intermarriage in their ranks over the generations have diluted the toxic legacy of slavery. Others say Brazil\u2019s prohibition on importing slaves forged a sense of self-reliance among ancestors fleeing economic devastation who could not bring slaves with them or were too poor to buy slaves in Brazil.But some scholars say the skirting of slavery during the celebration of Confederate heritage reflects a broader reluctance in Brazil to examine the staggering scale of the slave trade in the country\u2019s history.Historians examining the Confederate exodus say some of the Southerners bolstered Brazil\u2019s slavery-based economy, citing the settlers who brought African-American servants with them who were effectively still held in bondage. And once in Brazil, many of the Confederates took advantage of the ease and low cost of acquiring slaves.\u201cThere\u2019s an attempt by the Confederados to erase the interest in slavery as a principal motivation for their arrival in Brazil,\u201d said Luciana da Cruz Brito, a Brazilian historian of slavery at the City University of New York.In one example, Ms. Brito documented a case in which Charles G. Gunter, a former Alabama state representative, described in 1866 the acquisition of 40 slaves in Brazil for $12,500. That amount is thought to be cheaper than similar deals in the United States before slavery was prohibited.As Brazil\u2019s abolitionists advanced their cause in the late 19th century, some of the Confederados sought to preserve slavery even as the region around their settlements emerged as a setting for slave revolts.\u201cMany of the Confederate immigrants were remorseless white supremacists,\u201d said Maria Helena Machado, a historian of slavery at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo.\u201cOf course, reluctance to pursue abolition was not the only cause for this migration,\u201d Dr. Horne said. \u201cMany of the migrants had good reason to believe they would be prosecuted for treason, while many simply endured a sour distaste when contemplating a different kind of relationship with Africans than what had existed previously.\u201dWhile the descendants are scattered around Brazil, the commemoration at the Cemit\u00e9rio dos Americanos even lured a few Americans who had traveled thousands of miles below the Mason-Dixon line.\u201cI feel right at home here,\u201d said Stanley Hudson, 60, a lawyer from Dallas who had heard about the commemoration through the Sons of Confederate Veterans, an association of descendants of Confederate soldiers. Dressed in a captain\u2019s uniform, he added, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to admire them for maintaining the culture through so many generations.\u201d\u201cThis was the first place I saw a Confederate flag up close,\u201d said Ms. Ford, 46, who was raised in New Jersey.While Ms. Ford said she hoped to explore the \u201ccomplexities of race and history\u201d among the Confederados, the festivities in April seemed to offer instead a simplified Brazilian rendition of Southern culture in the United States.Near the stage where couples practiced Fanci-Dancing, as a sign put it, vendors hawked T-shirts with the slogan \u201cRebel & Proud of It.\u201d Everything on sale could be paid for with Confederate dollars obtainable at the entrance.\u201cThis is a joyful event,\u201d said Carlos Copriva, 52, a security guard who described his ancestry as a mix of Hungarian and Italian. He was wearing a Confederate kepi cap that he had bought online as he and his wife, Raquel Copriva, who is Afro-Brazilian, strolled through the bougainvillea-shaded cemetery.Smiling at her husband, Ms. Copriva, 43, who works as a maid, gazed at the graves around them. \u201cWe know there was slavery in both the United States and Brazil, but look at us now, white and black, together in this place,\u201d she said while pointing to the tombstones. \u201cMaybe we\u2019re the future and they\u2019re the past.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Get Brutal Guards Out of the Jails", "Date": "2016-05-02", "News": "Supported byEditorialGov. Andrew Cuomo has strengthened the state office that investigates misconduct by prison guards, and also proposed legislation that would make it easier to dismiss corrections officers who commit crimes on the job.These are good first steps toward rooting out the culture of violence that has long dominated the prison system. The next task is to renegotiate a recently expired union contract that has shielded brutal or unqualified guards from accountability in any number of ways.The Cuomo administration has professionalized the staff, bringing in people who have worked for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Drug Enforcement Administration. As a result, the unit seems ready to do a better job and has shown a greater willingness to refer cases for criminal prosecution. This does not address the reluctance of district attorneys in places where prisons dominate the local economy to bring charges against their prison guard neighbors. But it\u2019s an improvement over the status quo.The governor has also proposed giving the corrections commissioner the power to fire workers who commit misdemeanor crimes, instead of sending them into a convoluted arbitration system that inevitably allows guards to keep their jobs.That will require changing the flawed union contract. The current disciplinary system does not give the commissioner final say in dismissing officers who have committed even serious offenses. That power is instead held by arbitrators who are chosen jointly the state and the union \u2014 and who try to find a middle ground so as not to fall out of favor with either side.The state needs to negotiate a new disciplinary process like the one for the State Police Department, where charges against troopers are heard by three commissioned officers, two appointed by the State Police superintendent and one by the union. The panel\u2019s decisions are subject to final approval by the superintendent.Until these weaknesses are remedied, there will be little accountability and the prison brutality problem will not be solved.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Coral vs. Coal", "Date": "2016-05-26", "News": "Supported byMELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 Tim Flannery, a scientist and environmentalist who was named Australian of the Year in 2007, lost his job in 2013. The right-wing government of then-Prime Minister Tony Abbott shut down the Climate Commission that Flannery headed in a peremptory move designed to demonstrate its contempt for climate change. The commission had been established two years earlier to provide \u201cauthoritative information\u201d to the Australian public.Abbott, of the conservative Liberal Party, had no time for such information. Climate change, he argued in his autobiography, was bunk. It had been \u201chappening since the earth\u2019s beginning.\u201d Therefore it made no sense to \u201cimpose certain and substantial costs on the economy now in order to avoid unknown and perhaps even benign changes in the future.\u201d\u201cTo Abbott, I was the devil incarnate,\u201d Flannery told me. Throughout the developed world \u2014 from the \u201cDrill, baby, drill!\u201d crowd in the United States to Abbott\u2019s \u201cax-the-tax\u201d attack on clean-energy legislation in Australia \u2014 denial of climate change has become a tribal, almost masonic badge of the coal and fossil-fuel loving right. In today\u2019s culture wars it\u2019s as much of a wedge issue as any.Through crowdfunding, Flannery raised enough money in short order to turn the state-funded commission into the Climate Council, an independent nonprofit organization with the same role. Earlier this month, he headed for the Great Barrier Reef to see what \u201cbenign changes,\u201d as Abbott would have it, global warming has produced in the world\u2019s largest coral reef. He found what he saw northeast of Port Douglas on the outer rim of the reef devastating.The reef, one of the largest living things on earth, has started to fail. Whether it can recover is unclear. An organism roughly the size of Germany is bleaching to death. More than 90 percent of the reef that Flannery saw had suffered. Bleaching occurs when excessive heat and sunlight cause the algae that give coral reefs their shimmering colors to create toxins.The toxins repel the tiny animals called polyps essential to the ecosystem of the corals. As my colleague Michelle Innis put it, \u201cWhen heat stress continues, they starve to death.\u201d Because the coral reefs support vast fish stocks, the livelihoods \u2014 sometimes the very survival \u2014 of countless people depend on them.The causes of this disaster are clear enough. The impact of rising water temperatures caused by climate change was compounded by the El Ni\u00f1o cycle and by an underwater heat wave. This year, in a survey of 520 reefs that form the northern section of the Great Barrier Reef, scientists found only four free of bleaching. About 620 miles of previously pristine reef had been affected.\u201cI knew there was bleaching but not to this degree,\u201d Flannery told me. \u201cFor me, it was almost like watching my father die, seeing his organism slowly shut down.\u201dSo it\u2019s coral versus coal, the earth\u2019s health against a big industry, and science versus the Abbott-inspired denial gang. As if to illustrate Australia\u2019s divisions, Queensland\u2019s environment minister, alluding to climate change, warned last month of the need to \u201creduce as many pressures\u201d as possible on the Great Barrier Reef just after the state approved leases for what would be Australia\u2019s largest coal mine.Malcolm Turnbull, the Liberal Party prime minister who replaced Abbott and faces a tight election in early July, knows exactly what\u2019s at stake. In 2010, he called for moving to a situation \u201cwhere all or almost all of our energy comes from zero or very near zero emissions sources.\u201d He described forecasts of the devastating effects of climate change as likely erring \u201con the conservative side.\u201d He called for \u201cexpenditures today so as to safeguard our children.\u201d He advocated concentrated solar thermal power, calling it \u201ca more proven technology than clean coal.\u201d Global warming, he declared, would lead, if unchecked, to \u201ctruly catastrophic consequences.\u201dThe state of the Great Barrier Reef is one such consequence. Yet, Turnbull, beholden to Abbott\u2019s right wing of the Liberal Party, has, as leader, done his best to forget what he said six years ago. Climate change? What climate change? \u201cI\u2019ve known Turnbull for 30 years, I know what he believes, but he\u2019s fallen victim to his tribe,\u201d Flannery told me.That\u2019s a great pity. The reef is as irreplaceable as this planet. Australia has overcapacity in electricity generation. It should close several of its old coal-fired plants. Rich in renewable and clean-energy sources, Australia should be a leader, not a laggard, on climate change. Reputations, like the reef, are easily bleached.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is the Era of Great Famines Over?", "Date": "2016-05-08", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed Contributor8 PhotosADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia \u2014 The worst drought in three decades has left almost 20 million Ethiopians \u2014 one-fifth of the population \u2014 desperately short of food. And yet the country\u2019s mortality rate isn\u2019t expected to increase: In other words, Ethiopians aren\u2019t starving to death.I\u2019ve studied famine and humanitarian relief for more than 30 years, and I wasn\u2019t prepared for what I saw during a visit to Ethiopia last month. As I traveled through northern and central provinces, I saw imported wheat being brought to the smallest and most remote villages, thanks to a new Chinese-built railroad and a fleet of newly imported trucks. Water was delivered to places where wells had run dry. Malnourished children were being treated in properly staffed clinics.Compare that to the aftermath of the 1984 drought, which killed at least 600,000 people, caused the economy to shrink by nearly 14 percent and turned the name \u201cEthiopia\u201d into a synonym for shriveled, glazed-eyed children on saline drips.How did Ethiopia go from being the world\u2019s symbol of mass famines to fending off starvation? Thanks partly to some good fortune, but mostly to peace, greater transparency and prudent planning. Ethiopia\u2019s success in averting another disaster is confirmation that famine is elective because, at its core, it is an artifact and a tool of political repression.In 1984, the rains failed in the midst of a civil war, pitting the military regime headed by Mengistu Haile Mariam against rebels in the northern province of Tigray and neighboring Eritrea. When food ran short, Mengistu\u2019s government blocked trade, bombed markets and withheld emergency supplies in rebel-controlled areas.The suffering that ensued elicited a vast outpouring of generosity from the West, brought about in part by the Live Aid concerts. But all that charity was no more than a Band-Aid, as even its instigator, the musician Bob Geldof, observed at the time. That was because war was destroying Ethiopia\u2019s rural economy, and food aid was being redirected from civilians to soldiers and government militias.In 1987, as the famine was receding, a group of researchers and I went to Tigray on a mission for Oxfam to study local food markets. We reached a simple conclusion: When farmers could bring foodstuffs to points of sale \u2014 when the roads were clear of army checkpoints, when markets were held at night to reduce the risk of being bombed \u2014 the local economy worked efficiently enough. With markets in operation, the production of local crops increased, and food prices fell to levels people could afford.Ending famine required ending fighting.The Mengistu regime collapsed in 1991. Under the government of Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, a former guerrilla turned advocate of rapid economic growth, Ethiopia enjoyed internal peace for the first time in a generation. There were localized droughts but no famines \u2014 with one notable exception.In 1999, food shortages in the southeastern part of the country killed 29,000 people. What could have just been a crisis devolved into disaster because the government was at war with Eritrea along its northern border, and foreign donors, appalled that the government would spend its meager resources on fighting, were slow to provide food aid.A major drought in 2002 caused hunger nationwide. But the following year, when I traveled with a team from the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund to stricken areas in Wollo (north), Hararghe (east) and Sidama and Wollaita (south), we didn\u2019t see the telltale canvas tents of emergency distribution centers. A vast relief effort mounted by the government and international agencies was managing to deliver at least some food to many villages, and so people were staying at home.Some people were still going hungry, for sure, and in the worst cases children were starving, but in far smaller numbers than in the past. Our survey of child survival rates also found that outside these pockets of starvation, mortality rates weren\u2019t rising relative to non-drought years.By 2015, when El Ni\u00f1o brought the worst drought in decades, Ethiopia was better prepared than ever. In the intervening decade, the government had begun programs to help families facing food shortages with various forms of food and cash assistance. It had taken measures to mitigate the effects of droughts, rehabilitating water catchments, reforesting and building roads and clinics, especially in the countryside.The government also had money on hand. Ethiopia is a petroleum importer, and the central bank had set aside nearly $1 billion in case oil prices rose, Finance Minister Abdulaziz Mohammed told me. But instead oil prices had plummeted, and within a few months of the drought hitting, the government had spent some $300 million on emergency relief, with more to come.The economy will take a hit. Animals are dying of thirst, and the livelihoods of families that rely on sheep or cattle are being wiped out. The International Monetary Fund forecasts that the G.D.P. growth rate will drop to about 8.5 percent in 2015 and 2016, down from more than 10 percent in 2014. But that\u2019s still 8.5 percent, an impressive figure. And people aren\u2019t dying.Some risks remain. Ethiopia\u2019s early-warning system is designed to detect and respond to drought in farming areas, rather than, say, small cities. Urbanization, dislocation and other economic changes are happening faster than the government\u2019s prevention and relief measures can adapt.But these challenges are manageable, so long as there is the political will to manage them. Grimly certain that droughts will recur \u2014 and when there won\u2019t be an oil contingency fund to tap \u2014 Mr. Mohammed has opened talks with the World Bank to devise a national drought insurance plan. This is a sensible move.It\u2019s also evidence that after countries have passed a certain threshold of prosperity and development, peace, political liberalization and greater government accountability are the best safeguards against famine. There is no record of people dying of famine in a democracy.Nearly 115 million people died of starvation between 1870 and 1980, almost 90 percent of them as a result of imperial conquest, great wars or repression under totalitarian regimes, according to an analysis we conducted at the World Peace Foundation. Since then, with the end of major international conflicts and at least some measure of democratization across much of the world, starvation has receded.So is the era of great famines finally over? Let\u2019s just say it could be. Famine isn\u2019t caused by overpopulation, and as Ethiopia\u2019s experience shows, it\u2019s not a necessary consequence of drought. Politics creates famine, and politics can stop it. Alex de Waal is the executive director of the World Peace Foundation at Tufts University.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Impeachment of Dilma Rousseff Is Debated by Brazil\u2019s Senate After Months of Chaos", "Date": "2016-05-11", "News": "Supported byBRAS\u00cdLIA \u2014 After months of tirades, secret maneuvering and legal appeals, Brazil\u2019s Senate began debating on Wednesday whether to impeach President Dilma Rousseff, suspend her from office and put her on trial.The debate, followed by a vote as late as Thursday morning, is a watershed in the power struggle consuming Brazil, a country that experienced a rare stretch of stability over the last two decades as it strengthened its economy and achieved greater prominence on the world stage.If she is suspended and put on trial, she would become the second of Brazil\u2019s four elected presidents to be removed from office since democracy was re-established in the mid-1980s after a long dictatorship.Dilma Rousseff, Brazil\u2019s president, is facing removal from office. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the proceedings.\u201cPlainly said, this is the worst crisis in our history, with its combination of economic calamity, discredited politics and the violation of the lowest ethical standards,\u201d Boris Fausto, a Brazilian historian, told reporters this month while summing up the country\u2019s grim mood.\u201cTemer is what we\u2019ve got,\u201d Mr. Fausto said. \u201cI hope he\u2019ll be up to the difficult and often highly unpopular tasks ahead of him.\u201dFixing the economy, which may require adopting unpopular austerity measures, is just one of the challenges facing Mr. Temer, 75, a lawyer and career politician who kept a low profile as vice president.But the impasse between Ms. Rousseff and her rivals has kept the government in Bras\u00edlia distracted from these problems, exposing the political establishment to withering scrutiny around the country.Ms. Rousseff, an operative in a guerrilla group in her youth, is accused of using money from public banks to cover deficits, masking budget shortfalls in Brazil\u2019s giant federal bureaucracy. She contends that her predecessors enacted similar policies and that the effort to oust her amounts to a coup.Still, Ms. Rousseff is rare among top politicians in Brazil in that she has not faced accusations of illegally enriching herself. An array of figures in her Workers\u2019 Party are either in jail or under investigation on charges of graft, dealing a blow to the legitimacy of a party that had vowed to end such practices.But fears are growing at the prospect of a government assembled by Mr. Temer. If Ms. Rousseff and the Workers\u2019 Party shift into the opposition, they will most likely claim her ouster was illegal, and Mr. Temer\u2019s top allies remain mired in corruption scandals as well.Several of his top advisers are under investigation, including Romero Juc\u00e1, a senator from Roraima State in the Amazon, and Geddel Vieira Lima, a former executive at one of Brazil\u2019s largest public banks. Mr. Temer has insisted that those inquiries would not prevent him from naming the advisers to his cabinet.Advertisement"}

Worth\u2019s \u2018A Rage for Order\u2019", "Date": "2016-04-25", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.This is the book on the Middle East you have been waiting to read.\u201cA Rage for Order: The Middle East in Turmoil, From Tahrir Square to ISIS,\u201d by Robert F. Worth, tells the story of the 2011 Arab Spring and its slide into autocracy and civil war better than I ever could have imagined its being told. The volume is remarkably slender for one of such drama and scope \u2014 beautifully written, Worth\u2019s words scudding easily and gracefully across the pages. It is also a marvel of storytelling, with the chapters conjuring a poignancy fitting for the subject.Worth, a former correspondent for The New York Times, employs the familiar journalistic conceit of telling the history of the Arab Spring by presenting the stories of different individuals whose lives became caught up in it. While the method is timeworn, it has rarely been done with such skill.Worth has chosen his subjects perfectly. Their experiences exquisitely capture the awe of the revolutions and the anguish of the unravelings that followed. Often, reducing grand events like the Arab Spring to portraits of unconnected individuals fails to encompass the wider canvas of events. Here, the vignettes allow the reader to grasp the totality far better than a \u201cbird\u2019s eye\u201d version of history might. In large measure, that is because so much of what happened in the Arab world since 2011 has been about human psychology.Scholars, experts and policy makers have been struggling to explain the events of the Middle East in 2011, but the simplest answer remains the best. The people of the Arab world got fed up with their circumstances. After decades of failing economies, callous governance and social systems that no longer fit the globalizing world around them, they took to the streets to demand change. But as Worth\u2019s stories show, they were united in opposing the old system but divided in what they wanted to come next. Many had thought only in the vaguest of banalities, but nonetheless insisted that paradise must somehow follow the fall of the regime.That has been the history of revolutions. Bringing down the ancien r\u00e9gime is often the easy part, even if it is never really easy. But that accomplishment is primarily psychological. Mubarak lost his nerve. He did not order the army to shoot the protesters. We don\u2019t know why. Perhaps because the army decided that it could preserve its privileges even without Mubarak and might not have shot had Mubarak ordered it to do so. In any case, it is the psychology that proved decisive and that remains so elusive.Those same powerful emotions carried the people of the Middle East from the ecstasy of revolution to the agony of civil war. With nothing to take the place of the decrepit regimes, Syria, Libya and Yemen collapsed into chaos. Chaos bred fear, fear bred violence and violence bred revenge and anger and more violence. All three countries are now trapped in self-inflaming conflagrations that could easily burn on for decades. Egypt chose a different path, preferring to return to the wonted pain of dysfunctional autocracy and avoid civil war (although civil war seems even still to be creeping up on the Egyptians out of Sinai and Libya). Only Tunisia bravely tried to create something like democracy, and there is still a long way to go before a conclusion can be reached about its \u00adexperiment.Worth evokes all these intricacies by masterfully tracing the paths of a handful of representative figures as they make their way through the false dawn of the revolutions and on into the darkness that followed. Some of his subjects are famous, like Muhammad Beltagy \u2014 once the great hope of Egypt\u2019s moderate Islamists \u2014 and Rached Ghannouchi and Beji Caid Essebsi, the two Tunisian leaders who preserved something of their revolution. Others are unknowns: a Libyan interrogator, a Yemeni tribesman, a Kuwaiti volunteer for (then defector from) ISIS.For my money, the most powerful chapter of all is the story of two Syrian women, best friends since childhood, one an Alawite and the other a Sunni. Their story begins with the two of them clinging to each other as Syria slides into civil war. But over time, the fear and anger that engulf their country swallow them too. Although neither ever takes any action against the other, they end up ferocious enemies, both rewriting the history of their friendship to justify their new hatred.It is an archetypal tale of how the fall of the state tears communities apart, reducing them to warring identity groups in ways that few ever consciously desired to happen. This is a fundamental truth lost to most Americans watching the immolation of the Middle East from a seemingly safe distance. We console ourselves that their wars are the product of \u201cancient hatreds\u201d or badly drawn borders. Worth\u2019s book dispels those mirages.In the Middle East, as in countless other civil wars, the savagery is driven by mere anarchy. Worth\u2019s characters, like so many people in the region today, fear constantly for their lives and those of their families. They hear rumors of evil men killing any who are not like them \u2014 who are the \u201cothers,\u201d whether that be Sunni or Shia in Iraq, Sunni or Alawite in Syria, Cyrenaican or Tripolitanian in Libya, or some other difference. They band together with those like themselves for safety, and then lash out in what they perceive to be justified acts of self-defense. Killings beget revenge killings, and the most vicious see in the violence an opportunity for gaining power that can be achieved only by further killing. How many of the men and women who are the heroes of Worth\u2019s tales can possibly stand in the face of such purposeless slaughter?Though set amid chaos, Worth\u2019s stories interweave effortlessly, each providing a counterpoint to the others \u2014 but softly and gently, without beating the reader over the head. This subtlety is critical in allowing him to capture the complexities of the region. Thus, the two women whose friendship is torn apart by the Syrian maelstrom stand in contrast to the two Tunisian power brokers, brought together in hope of preventing the same devastation from engulfing their own country. These friendships provide a clean backdrop to better highlight the differences: the powerful versus the powerless, the centrifugal versus the centripetal, trying to stem the tide versus riding it. In turn, the relative success of Ghannouchi is contrasted with the utter failure of Beltagy. The disillusionment with revolution of Worth\u2019s Libyan mirrors the disillusionment with jihad of his Kuwaiti. They mingle in the reader\u2019s mind like the music of a well-rehearsed orchestra, creating a score greater than the sum of its parts.All great works of fiction are works of great philosophy, pondering the fundamentals of humanity. Few volumes of nonfiction ever achieve this, but Worth\u2019s does, touching essential truths about the human condition. The Middle East he sketches for the reader is a Hobbesian state of nature, a war of all against all. His subjects must struggle as best they can against the impersonal forces of the collective will and of circumstances far beyond their control.The writing in \u201cA Rage for Order\u201d is so beautiful and the storytelling so easy that you won\u2019t realize how much you are learning as you read. But there is no escaping the import of the stories. No way to read this marvelous book and not understand far more than you did before about this troubled region and the people struggling to find their way back to quiet lives.Kenneth M.

{"Headline": "Make Britain Great Again", "Date": "2016-05-03", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorMANCHESTER, England \u2014 Who wants Brexit? Not David Cameron, the British prime minister, for he opposes it. Not the leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, whose Euroskepticism is subsumed by fear of Little Englander nationalism. And not even Boris Johnson, the mayor of London and unofficial leader of the campaign to leave the European Union, who has spent much of his career arguing that Britain would be better off in a reformed union.But Mr. Johnson wants to be prime minister, and many of the Conservative Party members who will select their next leader are euroskeptic. And so last month Mr. Johnson came to Manchester to campaign for Brexit in a disused television studio that was ugly, cold and half-filled with an audience that was largely white and middle age.\u201cIt\u2019s a question of sovereignty. I would like our parliament to be sovereign and make its own decisions,\u201d said Michael Powell, a retired doctor. \u201cI fear that if we don\u2019t leave the E.U. we shall be overwhelmed by people who wish to come here.\u201d\u201cI feel that we are being taken over. This open border with all the trouble in the world is so scary,\u201d said Susan Fink, another retiree. \u201cIt seems it\u2019s only the common man on the street who seems to know that it\u2019s being used to traffic people and terrorists all over Europe.\u201dIt is usual for europhiles to call euroskeptics racists and imbeciles dreaming of a Britain that never was \u2014 a happy Britain in control of one-quarter of a happy world. But many of the people I met were rational and frightened. (Others were more amorous: I met a femme fatale with a leg in plaster cast. On it was scrawled, like a lover\u2019s note, #Brexit.)Then came Mr. Johnson. His weapon is comic derision, his tragic flaw is glibness. Some call him Britain\u2019s Donald Trump. Both men are raging narcissists and blondes, both are media obsessions, both loathe detail \u2014 for what has that to do with them? But I do not think Mr. Trump speaks Latin, as Mr. Johnson does, so I will assist him: The Latin for Mexicans Go Home is Mexicani Ite Domum!He rolled on his heels and called Brits \u201cpassengers locked in the back of a minicab with a wonky satnav driven by a driver who doesn\u2019t have perfect command of English and going in a direction we, frankly, don\u2019t want to go.\u201d He thinks he is Winston Churchill, but he is really Lord Halifax who, after the fall of France in 1940, wished to lead Britain out of the turmoil of Europe and back to the \u201csplendid isolation\u201d of 19th-century British self-confidence. In 1940 this position was called appeasement.The Remain Camp oppose isolation, splendid or dismal. If Britain leaves the European Union, this camp says, we will lose our global prominence and the economy will shrink by a very precise 6 percent by 2030.\u201cKnickers to the pessimists and to the merchants of gloom,\u201d said Mr. Johnson to the audience, who cheered. \u201cIf we hold our nerve and we\u2019re not cowed and we vote for freedom and we vote for democracy on June 23 then I believe this country will prosper and thrive as never before \u2014 and yes it will be independence day on June 24.\u201dEven as he delighted the crowd, I pondered Mr. Johnson\u2019s ability or even desire to save democracy in Britain. His Conservative party has disenfranchised voters and is planning to cut funding to opposition parties. Mr. Johnson\u2019s term as mayor of London, which ends this week, has been marked chiefly by crises left unsolved. (In a poll last year Londoners had the most pessimistic views of any region in Britain of his prime ministerial potential.)He likes to distract from his inadequacies by, say, dangling from a zip wire while holding two union flags, as he did in 2012, or by bullying journalists, as Mr. Trump might. At the rally in Manchester Mr. Johnson spotted Michael Crick, a television journalist, doing a piece live on camera. He said, \u201cShut up ... Can we tell Crick ... Can someone go and interrupt Crick at the back there?\u201dA bald man tried to stop the broadcast but \u201cCrick\u201d was insistent: \u201cI\u2019m just trying to explain what\u2019s going on here,\u201d he said. Mr. Johnson did not want Mr. Crick to explain anything. He prefers the trivial questions, and Mr. Crick does not ask them. During the Q&A that followed his speech, a man asked Mr. Johnson who styled his hair. The moderator asked, \u201cDo you have a real question?\u201d But I have followed Mr. Johnson for years, and that is a real question.He also resorts to Little Englander nationalism \u2014 not from conviction, but from cynicism: Last month Mr. Johnson suggested, in an essay for a right-wing British tabloid, that the \u201cpart-Kenyan\u201d Barack Obama might have an \u201cancestral dislike of the British empire.\u201dThe Brexit camp is not all nostalgists longing to return to British exceptionalism. Mostly it attracts people who fear that Brussels excludes them and that there is a genuine deficit of democracy in Britain; that the political class, with a few exceptions, has forgotten them. They are not wrong. Where they err is in believing that a politician who deals in trivia and bombast will treat them any better. Mr. Johnson believes in Mr. Johnson. The Brexit campaign is only a step on the path of his ambition.Tanya Gold writes for The Spectator.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brazil Workers\u2019 Party, Leaders \u2018Intoxicated by Power,\u2019 Falls From Grace", "Date": "2016-05-12", "News": "Supported byBRAS\u00cdLIA \u2014 From its earliest days as a scrappy band of Marxists defying Brazil\u2019s military rulers, the Workers\u2019 Party grew to become one of world\u2019s most enduring leftist movements \u2014 an electoral powerhouse that dominated the nation\u2019s politics for more than a decade.\u201cThe Workers\u2019 Party was a party of hope, but its leaders got intoxicated by power, and now that hope has been dashed,\u201d said H\u00e9lio Bicudo, 93, an early member of the party and a former legislator who defected in 2005.Mr. da Silva has yet to be charged with a crime, but federal prosecutors are investigating his role in a scheme that involved funneling money from the national oil company into the Workers\u2019 Party campaign coffers.An array of top allies of Mr. da Silva, including senior members of the party, have been imprisoned or are under investigation for their involvement in the scheme, which distributed billions of dollars in bribes to figures across the political spectrum.Even in a nation inured to systemic corruption, the fall of a party once devoted to transparency and clean government has deepened mistrust of politics.It also threatens to upend some of the accomplishments of the party, a political juggernaut that even critics concede helped ease the crushing poverty and economic disparity that has long plagued this nation of 200 million.\u201cThat the Workers\u2019 Party sullied itself by getting involved in all this corruption, this is a tragedy, maybe the major tragedy of what is happening today,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Murilo de Carvalho, a historian.In recent weeks, more than 130 mayors who won office on the Workers\u2019 Party ticket have switched parties, and nearly 30 deputies in the lower house of Congress, roughly half of its caucus, have suggested they might do the same, according to tallies in the Brazilian news media.Other parties took part in the graft scheme. But emboldened by Ms. Rousseff\u2019s political demise, her opponents in the legislature are working to reverse some of her party\u2019s hallmarks, including stringent environmental rules, protections for indigenous Brazilians in the Amazon and laws criminalizing abusive work conditions on cattle ranches.Jan Rocha, an author of the book \u201cBrazil Under the Workers\u2019 Party,\u201d said such efforts, if successful, could stoke class divisions and provoke a violent backlash from disenfranchised Brazilians who stand to lose the most from a rollback of the party\u2019s policies.\u201cThe Workers\u2019 Party represented an attempt to change the political landscape in Brazil and give a voice to all the millions of Brazilians who never had a voice,\u201d she said. \u201cThey lifted millions of people out of poverty, but Brazil still has an awfully long way to go before becoming an equitable society.\u201dMarked by greed, betrayal and the quest for ever-greater power, the party\u2019s fall from grace has all the elements of a Shakespearean tragedy.Its main protagonist is Mr. da Silva, 70, who worked as a shoeshine boy before landing a job at a screw factory. From there, he rose to the presidency and oversaw an economic boom.Starting in the 1970s, he helped transform a ragtag collection of labor activists, liberal Roman Catholic clergy members and idealistic students into a formidable political movement that stood up to the country\u2019s military leaders.Formed in 1980, the Workers\u2019 Party eschewed strict Marxist dogma and embraced a democratic process for electing its leaders.Mr. da Silva ran for office with the slogan \u201cLand, labor and freedom.\u201dBy the late 1980s, the party\u2019s candidates were winning elections. In 1986, Mr. da Silva was elected to Congress and, two years later, a Workers\u2019 Party candidate won the mayoralty of S\u00e3o Paulo, the country\u2019s largest city. Mr. da Silva then set his sights on the presidency.Universally referred to by the nickname Lula, he was an unlikely political figure whose unpolished syntax and leftist rhetoric rattled the Brazilian elite. But in 1998, after three unsuccessful bids for president, Mr. da Silva changed his strategy. He traded his T-shirts for tailored suits and jettisoned talk of revolutionary change, saying he would honor the $250 billion in foreign debt that was then hobbling the Brazilian economy.His new slogan: \u201cLula, Peace and Love.\u201dFor former party stalwarts like Idelber Avelar, the breaking point came when Mr. da Silva began to dole out patronage posts and form alliances with opposition party bosses who did not share the Workers\u2019 Party\u2019s ideals.\u201cIt represented everything that the party had been fighting against,\u201d said Mr. Avelar, an academic who now lives in the United States. \u201cThere were a number of options, but the early choice was made for the politics of making deals behind closed doors.\u201dApparently unchastened by their brush with scandal, Workers\u2019 Party officials were secretly engaged in a huge kickback scheme with executives at Petrobras, the state-owned energy giant. The arrangement involved skimming off billions of dollars from an oil boom and diverting the money to the Workers\u2019 Party and its coalition partners in Congress.The scandal has shaken the country\u2019s political establishment, with dozens of business executives and party leaders imprisoned or under investigation.Some of Mr. da Silva\u2019s closest aides are among the fallen, but he has insisted he was unaware of the arrangement.\u201cOur greatest achievements were to raise 36 million people out of poverty and elevate 40 million others into the middle class,\u201d Mr. da Silva said in an email this week. \u201cWe remain a party that cares about the poor and about social justice.\u201dUnless he is charged with a crime, many political analysts still expect Mr. da Silva to run for president in two years.\u201cIn Brazilian politics, you can never throw someone under the bus and think they won\u2019t recover,\u201d said Alfred P. Montero, the author of the book \u201cBrazil: Reversal of Fortune\u201d and a professor at Carleton College. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching these guys since the \u201980s, and they always seem to come back.\u201dDilma Rousseff, Brazil\u2019s president, is facing removal from office. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the proceedings.Experts say that despite its current tribulations, the Workers\u2019 Party, with its 500,000 active members, will remain a potent force in Brazilian politics for years to come. The impeachment crisis, some say, may spur a period of introspection that could help reinvigorate the party.\u201cThe Workers\u2019 Party is heading back to the opposition, which perhaps is just what the doctor ordered,\u201d Mr. Montero said.For now, the Workers\u2019 Party faithful are engaged in soul-searching. Did the party abandon its ideals in the heady rush of power? Or were its leaders adapting to a flawed, entrenched system?Lincoln Secco, a professor of contemporary history at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo and an early party member, said Mr. da Silva made a fateful error during his first months in power by not seeking to push through difficult political changes, including an overhaul of a campaign finance system that is heavily reliant on corporate donors.\u201cIf the party doesn\u2019t confront the political system, there is no other way to govern in Brazil than to enter into rotten alliances,\u201d he said. \u201cThey chose the easier way.\u201dDespite the disillusionment, millions of Brazilians still hold great affection for the party, especially those who have benefited from the many social welfare programs put into place during the tenures of Mr. da Silva and Ms. Rousseff. They include a monthly stipend to the nation\u2019s poorest residents and programs that allowed millions of people to attend college for the first time.Milton Nunes Sobrinho, 53, a doorman in S\u00e3o Paulo, credits the party with helping him obtain steady work; buy a used car; and move his family out of a rat-infested shack, thanks to a federally subsidized loan program that produced 2.6 million new homeowners over the past decade.\u201cEverything they promised, they did,\u201d Mr. Sobrinho said. \u201cAll the progress we\u2019ve experienced in our lives is because of them.\u201dAsked about party\u2019s troubles, he shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s all a political game,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd next time, I\u2019ll definitely be voting for the candidate from the Workers\u2019 Party.\u201dAn article on May 13 about the sagging fortunes of the Workers\u2019 Party of Brazil, whose standard-bearer, President Dilma Rousseff, was suspended by the Brazilian Senate, misstated the amount of foreign debt that was hobbling the Brazilian economy in 1998, when Ms. Rousseff\u2019s mentor, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, ran for president. It was $250 billion, not $250 million.Paula Moura contributed reporting from Bras\u00edlia, and Vinod Sreeharsha from Rio de Janeiro.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Canadian Wildfires Curtail Oil Sands Production", "Date": "2016-05-05", "News": "Supported byWhile the total reduction has not been revealed, analysts say it is substantial. Several companies have announced that they are throttling back or, in one case, shutting down their oil sands operations in the area and pulling their employees out.\u201cAt this point in time, we\u2019re not focusing on production numbers,\u201d said Chelsie Klassen, a spokeswoman for the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. \u201cOur operators are just focusing on the evacuation right now. We do not know the impact.\u201dA state of emergency was declared in Alberta, Canada, forcing the frightened residents of three additional communities to evacuate.Most of the oil sands operations are north of Fort McMurray and out of the direct path of the fire, which continued to move south of the city on Thursday, threatening the airport, forcing the evacuation of several small communities and showing no signs of abating.But some operations are to the south, and one of them \u2014 the Long Lake project owned by Nexen, a unit of Cnooc, the Chinese oil company \u2014 was closed in the face of the advancing fire. The company did not offer any statistics for the lost production from Long Lake, which has been plagued by technical problems.Production slowdowns north of the city, which is now cut off by road from the rest of Alberta, have been prompted by two factors: pipeline shutdowns because of the fire, and corporate decisions to evacuate all but the most essential employees far from the fires.Will Gibson, a spokesman for Syncrude, which pioneered the oil sands, said the company had \u201creduced operations to a minimum\u201d at its two projects and at facilities that turn the tar-like bitumen from the sands into synthetic crude oil. Syncrude\u2019s main operation is about 20 miles north of Fort McMurray, the nearest to the city.On Thursday, the company was evacuating about 1,500 employees by air.Syncrude has the capacity to produce about 350,000 barrels of oil a day. Mr. Gibson said he did not have a figure for what minimum output would be.Suncor, the largest integrated oil company based in Canada, has also reduced output and was flying out employees. \u201cIt\u2019s too soon to determine impact on production,\u201d said Paul Newmarch, a spokesman.Shell Canada shut down all but the bare minimum operations at its Albian Sands project, about 60 miles north of Fort McMurray. Husky Oil said it had reduced production from the oil sands by two-thirds, to 10,000 barrels a day.In addition to oil workers, as many as 10,000 residents of Fort McMurray fled north from the fire, most of them taking shelter in the work camps normally used to house oil workers. An airstrip at Shell\u2019s Albian Sands work camp was being used by the oil producers and the regional government to fly many of them out and to fly in food and supplies for those who remain.Because the capital costs of oil sands operations are high, few of them chose to cut production when oil prices slumped, and complete shutdowns for price reasons were not considered. Restarting the large projects after a shutdown can take months and be hugely expensive.Some very small demonstration projects have been closed, though, and several companies have delayed new projects or canceled expansion plans because of the market slump.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Selling Bottled Water That\u2019s Better for the Planet", "Date": "2016-04-30", "News": "Supported byOn a recent morning over avocado toast and world-renowned New York City tap water, Grace Jeon expounded on the virtues of public drinking water. Considering that the company she runs makes its money selling bottled water, her enthusiasm might have seemed a little strange. And in fact, she follows a decidedly odd business model.Ms. Jeon held up one of her company\u2019s bright blue opaque bottles, which are made mostly of paper, not plastic. \u201cI would never advocate drinking this over tap,\u201d Ms. Jeon said. But the reality is that more consumers are moving to bottled water as they cut down on drinking sugary beverages, she said. Her company has positioned its bottled water, called Just Water, as the next best thing to tap.Despite serious problems in places like Flint, Mich., and in the schools of Newark, N.J., and other cities, most tap water in the United States is safe to drink, according to environmental groups and the government. But many consumers prefer the convenience of bottled water, and are willing to pay for it.As Ms. Jeon sees it, she is making the best of a bad situation. The paper used for her bottles is sourced from trees that have been certified by the Forest Stewardship Council. The bottles, which are fully recyclable, are made of 53 percent paper; the rest of the bottle is made of plastic and a small amount of aluminum. Last month, Just Water released a new bottle with the top portion made of plant-based plastic derived from sugar cane. All told, she said, her product is less harmful to the environment and creates fewer carbon emissions than energy-intensive plastic.In the process, she is also helping the struggling city of Glens Falls, N.Y., about 20 miles from Saratoga Springs.What the city does have is water \u2014 four reservoirs and over 5,000 acres of watershed property. Just Water has an arrangement with the city to purchase water for at least six times the residential rate. Some of the money from the water purchase goes back to the community to address its aging water infrastructure, which is over 100 years old.Just Water does not obtain its water from that infrastructure; rather, it uses a well on the city\u2019s watershed property. It packages the water in a converted Catholic church that stood empty for years. The company employs 11 local residents.Tetra Pak, a food packaging and processing company, creates the Just Water packaging and ships the containers flat to Glens Falls, where they are shaped and filled.When Just Water first asked the mayor, Jack Diamond, about sourcing and bottling water in his city, he initially thought the offer was too good to be true. When he has been approached by companies in the past, in general, \u201cit\u2019s not so much what they\u2019re going to do for us, but what can we do for them,\u201d he said. \u201cThe roles were reversed with this company.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a completely ridiculous product, but it\u2019s also a wildly popular product,\u201d said Charles Fishman, a journalist and author of \u201cThe Big Thirst: The Secret Life and Turbulent Future of Water.\u201d \u201cThe reason is, and I think this is often overlooked, people aren\u2019t buying water \u2014 they\u2019re buying convenience. And with the branding, to some degree they\u2019re also buying image.\u201dThe reason for bottled water \u201chas nothing to do with the availability of good, clean appealing water in the country. It has to do with how we live,\u201d Mr. Fishman said. \u201cIt has to do with the disappearance of good water fountains \u2014 with the failure, frankly, of water fountain companies to innovate cool, interesting, appealing water fountains.\u201dJust Water went on sale last fall in Whole Foods stores across the country and Cibo Express airport markets. The company recently started selling bottles at Albertsons, Safeway, Kroger, Sprouts Farmers Markets and other stores.The bottles retail for 99 cents for 16.9 fluid ounces. That compares with about $1.50 for a comparable bottle of Fiji water. Ms. Jeon was previously Fiji\u2019s senior vice president for business development.Fiji is positioned as a luxury product, referred to in company news releases as \u201ca natural, artesian water bottled at the source in Viti Levu (Fiji islands)\u201d and \u201cknown for its soft mouth feel and iconic square bottle loved by discerning consumers, well-known celebrities and quality-conscious chefs.\u201dDoes water from different areas taste different? Some consumers swear that it does. Others, like Mr. Fishman, are skeptical: \u201cThere is no distinction, no matter what the people at all these places will tell you.\u201dMs. Jeon said she thought she had left the bottled water industry for good when Drew Fitzgerald, the founder of Just Water, approached her with his idea to make everyday packaged items more environmentally friendly, starting with bottled water. He has an eclectic r\u00e9sum\u00e9. He worked as the creative director for Universal Records, has worked with the Will and Jada Smith Family Foundation and is an adviser to Prime, an organization that helps foundations and wealthy families finance technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. And as it turns out, Mr. Fitzgerald\u2019s hometown is Glens Falls.It\u2019s true that water from upstate New York may not be considered as glamorous as water from Fiji, but New York\u2019s requires less transportation \u2014 another environmental selling point for Just Water.\u201cThere are bigger issues to bottled water than just what the package is made out of,\u201d said Mae Wu, a staff lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council. These include the environmental costs of shipping water, the effects of removing water from communities and water bottle waste.Of course, water bottles can be recycled. \u201cAll bottled water containers are 100 percent recyclable and many bottled water companies are already using recycled plastic in their bottles,\u201d said Chris Hogan, a spokesman for the International Bottled Water Association, in an email. Some are making 100 percent recycled bottles, he added. \u201cAs an industry, we are always looking for ways to strengthen existing programs and help to expand recycling efforts ever further,\u201d he wrote.But although bottles and cartons may be made of recyclable packaging, this does not ensure that the product will be recycled. Recycling rates have risen recently, but in 2013, the most recent year for which data is available, just over 31 percent of plastic jars and water bottles were recycled, according to government data.Just Water isn\u2019t the only company offering an alternative to traditional bottled water. Boxed Water packages its water in a gable-top paper box, much like a milk carton. Fred Water delivers water in hard plastic flasks and encourages drinkers to reuse the bottles. Green Sheep offers consumers water in aluminum bottles, which is more readily recycled than plastic.Like Just Water, many of these companies say they are committed to improving the environment. \u201cWe recognized that although reusable bottles are the best choice from an environmental standpoint, the reality is that people keep buying bottled water,\u201d Nicole Doucet, the co-founder and chief executive of Green Sheep, said in an email. \u201cThere was already a perfect solution out there, but we needed a pragmatic one.\u201dTraditional beverage companies, such as Nestl\u00e9 Waters North America, are offering alternatives, too. In 2007, Nestl\u00e9 introduced its lightweight Eco-Shape bottle, which uses less plastic; a few years later the company began incorporating recycled plastic into its bottles. Nestl\u00e9, which includes brands such as Arrowhead, Deer Park and Poland Springs, made up 23 percent of water bottle sales last year, according to Euromonitor International, a consumer research company.\u201cBeverage trends have changed dramatically over the last 10 to 12 years,\u201d Nelson A. Switzer, Nestl\u00e9 Waters North America\u2019s vice president and chief sustainability officer, wrote in an email. \u201cWater \u2014 bottled and tap \u2014 has become the beverage of choice.\u201dJust Water and its competitors make up a much smaller percentage of the market. \u201cI think that we will continue to see bottled water in more environmentally friendly packaging,\u201d said Virginia Lee, senior beverages analyst at Euromonitor. \u201cHowever, I see this for the next five years as still being very niche.\u201d She cites cost and consumers\u2019 familiarity with traditional bottled water as factors.The alternatives may be able to succeed as the economy improves, she said: \u201cAs people have more money in their pocket it stands that they\u2019d be more willing to pay a little extra for water or something else that claimed to have environmental or other benefits.\u201dBut a better water bottle is still a water bottle, said Ms. Wu of the Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cI recognize that there is a role for bottled water,\u201d especially in emergencies like the one occurring in Flint, she said, but most tap water in the United States is safe.Some consumers have switched to reusable water bottles, many of which have become status symbols, like the stainless steel insulated bottles made by S\u2019well, and the glass bottles in colorful silicon sleeves sold by Bkr.Still, there are no signs that shoppers will be sipping less bottled water anytime soon. Sales have increased steadily over the last decade. The water bottle industry took in $19.8 billion in retail sales last year in the United States, according to Euromonitor.Ms. Jeon claimed she would rather see the tide go in the opposite direction. \u201cIt\u2019s not about getting more people to drink bottled water,\u201d she said. But if you\u2019re going to drink bottled water, she said, \u201cconsider a better option than the current choice.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Kroeber on \u2018China\u2019s Economy\u2019", "Date": "2016-05-05", "News": "Supported bySinosphereOn the negative side, what you don\u2019t see in China so far is much exportable or globally significant innovation. You don\u2019t see people coming to China and saying, \u201cOh isn\u2019t that neat \u2014 let\u2019s bring that back to the U.S., or Japan, or wherever.\u201dIn the long run, this obsession with government control is a big problem for innovation.As for the exchange rate, the central bank wants a flexible rate that will help it set monetary policy in a more normal way, but the political leaders don\u2019t want the volatility that comes with that. You\u2019ve had a direct collision between the technocrats who honestly were trying to get a more market-oriented mechanism and those saying the key is for the exchange rate to be stable, because if it\u2019s not stable, then people will think that China isn\u2019t stable and that will be bad.Another way to look at it is that after three decades of economic growth that was mainly about building stuff \u2014 infrastructure, housing, heavy industry \u2014 China is now entering the phase where economic growth has to come mainly from squeezing efficiency out of the assets you\u2019ve already installed. That is always a tough transition and we should expect it to be rocky.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.The key thing is that all of economic history tells us that while state firms can be good at building stuff, when it comes to squeezing out efficiencies you need private companies. In China today, private industrial companies have a return on assets of 9 percent, compared to just 3 percent for state companies. Plus, state companies take on twice as much debt as private companies. So they are twice as indebted, but have a third of the performance. That\u2019s a huge gap, but the government keeps channeling too much money to this inefficient part of the economy.I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll put my chips on that, but the next party congress is when we\u2019ll know for sure whether Xi is a committed economic reformer, or someone who\u2019s mainly just interested in political control.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jodie Foster Is Still Afraid of Failure", "Date": "2016-04-25", "News": "Supported byBut to its director, Jodie Foster, it covers terrain more intimate than that, and more personal. It\u2019s a meditation on failure: how keenly people fear it, what they do when confronted with it. Its two main characters, captor and captive, inhabit the same purgatory. They\u2019re coming to terms with their own inadequacy.\u201cFailure is a big one for me \u2014 people in spiritual crisis, in a moment in life of total self-hatred,\u201d Ms. Foster told me recently, explaining how the movie, to be released May 13, connects to her.Does she often think of herself as a failure?\u201cOh yeah,\u201d she said. \u201cOh my God, yeah. If Mother Teresa is propelled to do good works because she believes in God, I am propelled to do good works because of how bad I feel about myself. It\u2019s the first place I go. \u2018Oh, what did I do wrong?\u2019\u201dThis is not the direction in which you expect a conversation with a two-time Oscar winner to turn. But as guarded as so many decades in the spotlight have made Ms. Foster, there\u2019s also something naked about her, a soul-searching too fervent to stay hidden.She was asking at once to be understood and to be left alone, still searching all these years later for a resolution to the contradiction of celebrity, and her remarks were so messy in their way that I was stunned when she told me that she\u2019d scripted them carefully in advance.\u201cEvery word,\u201d she said, adding that she even had them put on a teleprompter. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to get it wrong.\u201dBut what precisely was she trying to get right? The world was fixated on her allusions to her private life. She was focused on an announcement about her professional one: On the far side of 50, she was pivoting toward less glamorous work behind the scenes.Mr. Clooney is the financial guru, who loosely evokes Jim Cramer, the host of the CNBC cable show \u201cMad Money.\u201d Ms. Roberts is his producer, who\u2019s in his ear throughout the hostage crisis, talking him through it, as steady as he is spastic. (The captor is played by Jack O\u2019Connell.)One striking aspect of the movie is how large Ms. Roberts\u2019s character looms, and I asked Ms. Foster if that would have been the case in a male director\u2019s hands. She said that she hadn\u2019t thought about that, but, in fact, many of the screenplay revisions that she requested involved fleshing out that role.Strong women are her trademark as a performer, the thread running through \u201cThe Accused\u201d (her first Oscar for best actress), \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs\u201d (her second), \u201cPanic Room,\u201d \u201cFlightplan,\u201d \u201cThe Brave One\u201d and more.But not just strong women: women who don\u2019t turn to a man in the clutch; women whose strength is inseparable from the walls they\u2019ve built around themselves. They\u2019re \u201csolitary characters who don\u2019t have mothers and fathers and boyfriends,\u201d she told me, and they demonstrate her desire, when acting, \u201cto have an experience that\u2019s all mine, and I don\u2019t really want to share it.\u201d\u201cYet I\u2019m totally desperate to communicate it to you,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really weird dichotomy. And I think that\u2019s me in life.\u201dShe sat on a couch, legs curled under her and shoes kicked off, in an office here on the lot of Sony Pictures, which is distributing \u201cMoney Monster.\u201d I\u2019d last seen her in downtown Manhattan months earlier, when she was shooting a crucial scene and when she described, within minutes of our meeting, how powerfully the Clooney part spoke to her.\u201cHe\u2019s just a guy on TV, but he\u2019s imbued with this sense of power,\u201d she said, adding that he\u2019s forced to ask questions that she has asked herself: \u201cAm I real? Am I a sellout? Is all of this real?\u201dShe meant the adulation that comes with fame, which she achieved early. The year she turned 14, she had five movies released, including \u201cFreaky Friday,\u201d \u201cBugsy Malone\u201d and \u201cTaxi Driver,\u201d in which her precocious turn as an underage prostitute earned her an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actress.During her time at Yale University, she acted in another five movies, juggling them with her studies, including a thesis on African-American literature. Henry Louis Gates Jr., then teaching there, was one of her advisers. She babysat for his two young children, and he recalled arranging an interview for her with Toni Morrison and telling the novelist only that his student Alicia Foster \u2014 that\u2019s Jodie\u2019s real name \u2014 was en route.\u201cWhen she walked in, I think Toni almost had a heart attack,\u201d Professor Gates, now at Harvard, told me.He and Ms. Foster remain friends, and he said that he still marvels at the poise that \u201callowed her to get through a crisis that probably would have been crushing to most of us.\u201d He was referring to John Hinckley Jr.\u2019s shooting of President Reagan, which Mr. Hinckley, who had stalked Ms. Foster, said he did to impress her. She was in her freshman year at Yale.Not long after she graduated, she considered ditching movies altogether and doing graduate work with Professor Gates. \u201cThe Accused\u201d was about to be released, and she was convinced that the movie and her performance were no good.Her mother, Evelyn, worried that \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs\u201d would be a mistake and, as Ms. Foster remembers it, said to her: \u201cThe good part is Hannibal Lecter. Why are you taking the dull part?\u201dThe two have always been extraordinarily close \u2014 her mother was a single mom and carefully steered her career early on \u2014 so it pained the actress when they had a much bigger tussle over \u201cNell,\u201d in which Ms. Foster played a wild woman (literally) who spoke a gibberish of her own invention. Evelyn Foster channeled her broader apprehensions about the movie into her daughter\u2019s specific decision to darken her hair for the role.\u201cShe was relentless, and she wouldn\u2019t get off it,\u201d Ms. Foster said. \u201cShe was yelling at me. Why did I have to dye my hair? She was just like, \u2018You\u2019re ruining your image,\u2019 or whatever it was. And I remember sending her this really long letter, and the letter was, \u2018I really love you, but I\u2019m not going to talk to you for four and a half months,\u2019\u201d until the movie wraps.\u201cShe totally got it \u2014 she sent me flowers,\u201d Ms. Foster added. \u201cAnd then I talked to her four months later. That was one of the movies where if I thought for one minute that I was making a fool of myself, I would not be able to perform.\u201dShe made clear to me that she was sharing that story only because it couldn\u2019t embarrass her mother, who has advanced dementia.Ms. Foster is mindful of the privacy of family members, including her two sons, the oldest of whom will leave for college in the fall, and her wife, the photographer Alexandra Hedison. The couple began their relationship soon after that Golden Globes speech and were wed in early 2014. Ms. Foster deflected questions about that.\u201cI never will talk about marriage and friends,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are only so many steps I can take to protect people I love. There\u2019s only so much I can do to keep them safe. It\u2019s kind of a horrible feeling to know that if somebody\u2019s close to you, you put them in danger of being hurt, of being sullied \u2014 trivialized \u2014 just by virtue of knowing you.\u201dIn the Globes speech, she fleetingly acknowledged a previous relationship to Cydney Bernard, describing her as \u201cmy heroic co-parent, my ex-partner in love but righteous soul sister in life.\u201dDid she intend that as the kind of declaration about her sexual orientation that some gay-rights advocates had long pressed for?\u201cEverything I have to say on that subject, I said that night,\u201d she told me, acknowledging that some people remained puzzled. \u201cI can be vague. Vague is moving to me.\u201dIn recent years, she has directed episodes of \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d and \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d picking up Emmy and Directors Guild of America nominations. But her chance to helm movies came earlier, even though that opportunity still eludes many women.She was spared such resistance because so many male executives \u201cknew me as the 8-year-old who showed up on time, and they didn\u2019t see it as a risk,\u201d she said. \u201cThey looked at me as if I was a daughter. They\u2019d seen me grow up. They knew my professionalism.\u201dMel Gibson, who starred in \u201cThe Beaver,\u201d said that \u201cthe way she directs films, the way she does anything \u2014 it\u2019s just very smart. She attacks it and deals with it and delivers.\u201dThe two formed a deep friendship after making \u201cMaverick\u201d more than two decades ago, though their bond baffles outsiders.\u201cIt\u2019s not my job to adjudicate his behavior,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s certainly not sexist and certainly not racist. I know the guy I know, somebody who\u2019s really emotional, who I can have long, long conversations with, who\u2019s trustworthy, who shows up for me.\u201dMr. Gibson said: \u201cI just love her, that\u2019s all. You meet people like that sometimes. You just instantly fall in love, and that\u2019s it, and it\u2019s the purest kind of thing. We call each other up all the time and just say, \u2018Hey, I love you.\u2019\u201dMs. Foster\u2019s current emphasis on directing over acting partly recognizes that at 53, she won\u2019t find as many great roles as she once did. But it also reflects her ceaseless process of self-examination and self-discovery.\u201cEverybody in my life said to me: When you stop acting, you\u2019re going to be lost,\u201d she said, meaning that directors don\u2019t quite have the visibility and currency of actual movie stars. \u201cWhat are you going to do when people don\u2019t take your phone call or when you can\u2019t get a reservation in a restaurant?\u201dI looked for some sign that she was being falsely modest or pulling my leg. Amazingly, she wasn\u2019t.\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll lose my identity,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I guess I need to find out, and I\u2019m willing to take that chance.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Legalized Pot, Free Trade", "Date": "2016-05-20", "News": "Supported byMexico City \u2014 WHEN the Mexican Army actually allows journalists to watch its soldiers in action, it\u2019s often to see them burning marijuana crops. It\u2019s strictly for show, but it\u2019s fun. You get to fly in a military helicopter over the Sierra Madre, then touch down to see troops posing with their rifles as they walk into green marijuana fields. And the highlight: You watch hundreds of pounds of grass go up in flames.Mexican soldiers have been conducting this ritual for decades, and the photos have come to define the country\u2019s war on drugs. But amid a wave of drug policy reform, those photos may soon disappear from news pages and be relegated to historical archives.Speaking last month at the United Nations special session on drugs, President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto said he wanted to relax the nation\u2019s marijuana laws. He has since sent Mexico\u2019s Congress a bill to legalize medicine that contains cannabis, allow people to carry an ounce of marijuana without being prosecuted, and free some prisoners convicted on marijuana charges. \u201cWe Mexicans know all too well the range and the defects of prohibitionist and punitive policies, and of the so-called war on drugs that has prevailed for 40 years,\u201d he said.Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto is new to the drug-reform game. Only last year, he said he was against legalizing marijuana, and at one point said he was not even going to attend the United Nations session.What happened? He seems to have realized (or been advised) that it is better to be on the side of inevitable change. The proposal follows the rapid loosening of drug laws in the United States: Four states and the District of Columbia have legalized medical and recreational marijuana, and 20 more states now permit it as medicine. The president\u2019s shift also follows a November ruling by Mexico\u2019s Supreme Court, which held that the government had no constitutional right to arrest people for their \u201ccivil right\u201d of growing cannabis.And more is coming soon. In November, Californians could vote on an initiative to legalize marijuana. If America\u2019s richest state, and one on the border, votes yes, it will have a huge impact on Mexico. Why would the Mexican government want to crack down on traffickers taking marijuana into California if it were fully legal there?Various Mexican politicians and activists have come out in favor of wider marijuana legalization. Among them, the opposition senator Mario Delgado has proposed the decriminalization and regulation of cultivation, production and sales across Mexico. The former president Vicente Fox also supports this idea.Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s proposals make sense, but there\u2019s even more to be done. The current bill would effectively allow cannabis consumption, but it would leave most of the production and selling of it to the black market \u2014 which means largely in the hands of drug cartels.Marijuana reform in the United States has already eaten into the business of Mexican cartels. In 2011, the year before Colorado and Washington State legalized it, the United States border patrol seized 2.5 million pounds of cannabis coming from Mexico. Last year, with marijuana legal in four states and the District of Columbia, that had fallen to 1.5 million pounds.However, even the latest number indicates that a significant amount of marijuana is still being smuggled north. The profits pay the cartels\u2019 assassins, as well as corrupt police officers and soldiers, who discard piles of bodies across Mexico.Amid these changing dynamics, it becomes more and more pointless for Mexican soldiers (underwritten by the United States, through the Merida Initiative) to keep up the ritual of burning marijuana crops. What is needed, then, is for both countries to move from the current mishmash of laws toward the inevitable conclusion: that marijuana becomes a legalized product that can be traded over borders.The same market forces that shape the trade in liquor or tobacco will shape the trade in marijuana. Like those, it generates major profits for the formal economy. A research group predicts the legalized marijuana market in the United States will be worth more than $6 billion this year, rising to more than $20 billion by 2020. That could be a boon for the Mexican and United States economies.A regulated marijuana market won\u2019t suddenly end the bloodshed in Mexico. Cartels would still traffic cocaine, heroin and methamphetamines. The cartels have also diversified to kidnapping, extortion and even oil theft, crimes that can be dealt with only by markedly improved Mexican police forces.But marijuana reform will help immensely. Many in the ranks of Mexican cartels take their first step into the crime world by growing, smuggling or selling pot. That link would be cut, and legal jobs created. Mexican security forces could finally leave the marijuana issue behind to focus on real problems.The United Nations special session on drugs was heavy on empty talk, but several positive things came out of it. One was that there is no appetite to make countries abide by the United Nations treaties that prohibit the legalization of marijuana. Another is that a range of voices across the world are calling for a new approach to drug policy. The growth of a legalized, binational marijuana market would be a step toward turning those calls into reality.Ioan Grillo is the author of \u201cGangster Warlords: Drug Dollars, Killing Fields and the New Politics of Latin America\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

On Friday, Mr. Maduro declared a 60-day state of emergency, saying it was necessary to quash what he described as a \u201ccoup\u201d and confront \u201call the international and national threats our nation is facing.\u201dThe threats Venezuelans face today are not the result of foreign or domestic conspiracies, but Mr. Maduro\u2019s disastrous leadership. On his watch, the country\u2019s health care system has atrophied so severely that scores of Venezuelans are dying every week because of chronic shortages of medicine and ill-equipped hospitals.Shortages of food and basic goods are likely to worsen as Venezuela\u2019s economy continues to contract this year. Political prisoners, meanwhile, have languished behind bars for years, victims of a corrupt and broken justice system.Over the past decade and a half, Mr. Ch\u00e1vez and Mr. Maduro made spending on welfare benefits their top priority to keep their base loyal, while neglecting institutional reforms that would have diversified the country\u2019s revenue sources and made lasting improvements to the education and health systems.As the suffering of Venezuelans has increased, the opposition has garnered significant support abroad, which has left Mr. Maduro even more isolated. The Organization of American States is expected to convene a special session soon to assess the erosion of democratic practices in Venezuela. Mr. Maduro suffered a further blow last week when President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil, a close ally, was temporarily ousted from power and awaits an impeachment trial by the Senate.Mr. Maduro appears determined to make it practically impossible for the opposition to meet referendum requirements by the end of the year. (If a vote is held next year and removes Mr. Maduro from office, his vice president will serve out the rest of his term, which ends in 2019.) To defeat him on this, opposition leaders, who have called for mass demonstrations on Wednesday, will have to broaden their coalition. That means bringing in disaffected parts of Mr. Maduro\u2019s political base and offering them and Venezuelan voters a plausible blueprint for undoing years of catastrophically bad rule.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nissan Throws a Lifeline to Scandal-Stricken Mitsubishi", "Date": "2016-05-11", "News": "Supported byTOKYO \u2014 Nissan Motor announced on Thursday that it had an agreement to extend a $2.2 billion lifeline to its fellow Japanese carmaker Mitsubishi Motors, which has been battered by a scandal over falsified fuel-economy ratings.The deal, which buys Nissan about one-third of the company, draws Mitsubishi into a global automotive group centered on Nissan and Renault of France. The alliance\u2019s combined production volume, about nine million vehicles a year including Mitsubishi, is similar to that of the industry\u2019s giants, Volkswagen, General Motors and Toyota.The rescue has parallels with how Renault saved Nissan from collapse a decade and a half ago by buying a large minority stake in the then-ailing Japanese producer. Today, Carlos Ghosn, the executive Renault sent to Japan to turn Nissan around, is chairman of both companies.\u201cWe have been there not a very long time ago,\u201d Mr. Ghosn said at a news conference on Thursday. \u201cWe have the track record to make it work.\u201dNissan will become Mitsubishi\u2019s largest shareholder, buying a 34 percent stake for 237 billion yen, or $2.18 billion. Mr. Ghosn said adding Mitsubishi to the Renault-Nissan alliance would save \u201cbillions\u201d through joint development, purchasing and sales. He noted that Renault-Nissan and Mitsubishi were both big investors in all-electric vehicles, and that Mitsubishi has a strong presence in Southeast Asia, a market that Nissan has been targeting.Mr. Ghosn has often touted the loose alliance structure pioneered by Renault and Nissan as better than outright takeovers. Alliances allow carmakers to reduce costs by combining development efforts, while minimizing the political and cultural clashes that often accompany full-fledged mergers, he has said.Renault owns 43 percent of Nissan, and Nissan holds a 15 percent nonvoting stake in Renault. The pairing has survived where several other international tie-ups have failed. Daimler and Chrysler, for instance, merged about the same time Renault rescued Nissan, but the combination unraveled within a decade.The deal on Thursday does, however, expose Nissan to potential costs and complications from fixing Mitsubishi\u2019s problems. Mr. Ghosn said that the arrangement would be completed only after a full due-diligence examination, but that he was confident that Mitsubishi\u2019s problems were already well understood.Though the scandal poses risks, it has also allowed Nissan to buy into Mitsubishi relatively cheaply: Mitsubishi\u2019s share price has roughly halved since its first disclosure about fuel efficiency cheating last month. Trading in Mitsubishi shares was suspended on Thursday in response to a glut of buy orders. But shareholder sentiment appeared brighter, with an indicative price jumping 16 percent, which is the daily limit. Nissan\u2019s share price slipped 1.4 percent.Nissan and Mitsubishi already cooperate in several areas, most notably the development and sale of small-engine microcars. It was engineers at Nissan who discovered that Mitsubishi was using unapproved mileage tests that exaggerated fuel performance. Mitsubishi has since admitted that it has been cheating on its mileage ratings in Japan for a quarter of a century, and that all models in its domestic lineup were affected.\u201cThis is an important step toward rebuilding trust and stabilizing our business,\u201d Mitsubishi\u2019s chairman, Osamu Masuko, said of Nissan\u2019s investment.He said that he and Mr. Ghosn had been discussing ways to extend their partnership for some time, and that the cheating scandal had accelerated the process. As a relatively small producer, Mitsubishi lacked the resources to compete effectively on its own, he said.\u201cThis would have happened one day,\u201d he said.Jonathan Soble reported from Tokyoand Hiroko Tabuchi from NewYork.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "North Korea Linked to Digital Attacks on Global Banks", "Date": "2016-05-26", "News": "Supported bySecurity researchers have tied the recent spate of digital breaches on Asian banks to North Korea, in what they say appears to be the first known case of a nation using digital attacks for financial gain.In three recent attacks on banks, researchers working for the digital security firm Symantec said, the thieves deployed a rare piece of code that had been seen in only two previous cases: the hacking attack at Sony Pictures in December 2014 and attacks on banks and media companies in South Korea in 2013. Government officials in the United States and South Korea have blamed those attacks on North Korea, though they have not provided independent verification.On Thursday, the Symantec researchers said they had uncovered evidence linking an attack at a bank in the Philippines last October with attacks on Tien Phong Bank in Vietnam in December and one in February on the central bank of Bangladesh that resulted in the theft of more than $81 million.\u201cIf you believe North Korea was behind those attacks, then the bank attacks were also the work of North Korea,\u201d said Eric Chien, a security researcher at Symantec, who found that identical code was used across all three attacks.\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen an attack where a nation-state has gone in and stolen money,\u201d Mr. Chien added. \u201cThis is a first.\u201dThe attacks have raised alarms in the global banking industry because the thieves gained access to Swift, a Brussels-based banking consortium that runs what is considered the world\u2019s most secure payment messaging system. Swift\u2019s system is used by 11,000 banks and companies to move money from one country to another \u2014 one reason that it is a tempting target for criminals.Swift has warned publicly that the attacks are part of a broad coordinated assault on banks, though it has not assigned blame. It has also emphasized that it was the banks\u2019 connection points to its network \u2014 and not the core Swift messaging network itself \u2014 that the attackers were able to breach. Also, American bankers have noted that the security lapses all occurred at banks in third-world countries, which may give some comfort to banking customers in the United States.Security researchers and American government officials have tied thousands of attacks to nations in the past. They have linked the United States and Israel to an attack that destroyed Iranian centrifuges, and the Chinese military and contractors to attacks that stole military and trade secrets from thousands of foreign entities.But the latest spate of attacks on banks in Bangladesh and Southeast Asia would be the first time, security researchers say, that a nation has used malicious code to steal purely for financial profit.The idea that Pyongyang had turned to digital theft would not be surprising. North Korea\u2019s economy has been ravaged by sanctions, food shortages and other deprivations. Pyongyang does not publish economic data, but estimates have put North Korea\u2019s gross domestic product between $12 billion and $40 billion, tiny when compared with South Korea\u2019s economic output of more than $1.4 trillion.In the attack at Bangladesh\u2019s central bank in February, the thieves tried to transfer $1 billion in funds from an account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Fed officials became suspicious of the some of requested transfers and released only $81 million to accounts in the Philippines.\u201cIf you presume it\u2019s North Korea, $1 billion is almost 10 percent of their G.D.P.,\u201d Mr. Chien said. \u201cThis is not small change for them.\u201dSymantec researchers said it was possible that the bank in the Philippines containing the North Korean code was also involved in the Bangladesh bank scheme and the attempted breach on the Vietnamese bank. The researchers would not identify the Philippines bank and did not say whether the thieves had been successful in transferring funds. Researchers were able to confirm only that the attackers had managed to breach the bank and install identical code strings on the bank\u2019s computer systems \u2014 the same code that they discovered in Bangladesh, Vietnam and the two previous attacks at Sony in 2014 and South Korea in 2013.Mr. Chien noted that the attackers not only used identical numbers but wrote the code in the same, unusual sequence across all three attacks.Mr. Chien said the evidence pointed to all three attacks being the work of the \u201cLazarus Group,\u201d a name his team gave to the attackers behind the Sony and South Korean attacks.Officials have pointed to North Korea\u2019s threat of \u201cmerciless countermeasures\u201d against Sony if the studio released \u201cThe Interview,\u201d a movie by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg that made fun of North Korea and includes a fictional assassination of its leader. F.B.I. analysts also note critical mistakes North Korean hackers made, such as logging into their attack servers from known North Korean Internet addresses and even logging into both their Facebook account and Sony\u2019s servers from the same computers.In the months since evidence of the attacks involving the Swift network started to emerge, investigators have been looking for commonalities at numerous other potential breaches. It remains unclear whether these breaches are connected to the ones in Bangladesh and Vietnam, but they too have occurred in or around Southeast Asia.There is no evidence to date that the thieves have gone after large American or European banks, though new possible attacks are being reported weekly. Last week, evidence emerged that Banco del Austro, an Ecuadorean bank, was infiltrated by hackers who were also able to sneak onto the Swift network. The thieves transferred several million dollars to accounts around the world, according to a lawsuit the bank filed in federal court in the United States against Wells Fargo, which facilitated one of the transfers.Researchers have yet to unearth any of the code used in the Ecuador attack, but banking analysts say it is probably no coincidence that these attacks are happening in the developing world, where security measures tend not to be as tight as they are in financial hubs like New York and London.Swift has issued numerous warnings in recent weeks urging banks to step up their security protocols. Analysts worry that the breaches could have a chilling effect on global finance; larger banks may become reluctant or even refuse to transact with smaller banks in the developing world unless they can have assurances that their networks have not been compromised by thieves and malware.At a conference on Tuesday in Brussels, Swift\u2019s chief executive, Gottfried Leibbrandt, said the recent attacks could do far more damage than breaches on retailers and telephone companies, which he said suffer largely reputational and legal hits.\u201cBanks that are compromised like this can be put out of business,\u201d Mr. Leibbrandt said.\u201cNorth Korea is hurting for money,\u201d said Herb Lin, the senior research scholar for cyberpolicy and security at Stanford University\u2019s Center for International Security and Cooperation and a fellow at Stanford\u2019s Hoover Institution. \u201cThey\u2019ve been cut out of the financial system because of sanctions. They had been among the best counterfeiters in the world, and only recently have they been stymied in the counterfeiting of superdollars. If it\u2019s true that we\u2019ve cut them off from that, then it\u2019s not at all surprising that they would turn to something else.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Did Optimism Become Uncool?", "Date": "2016-05-12", "News": "Supported byOpinionGIVEN Donald J. Trump\u2019s virtual lock on the Republican presidential nomination, you\u2019d think he\u2019d be a bit more upbeat. Instead, his campaign began last summer with \u201cour country is going to hell,\u201d then declared, \u201cwe\u2019re becoming a third world country,\u201d and by this month had progressed to the United States \u201closing all the time.\u201dThis election season, the impending apocalypse has been issue No. 1 for presidential aspirants on both sides. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said he was running \u201cbecause the world is falling apart.\u201d Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, declared the United States \u201cnear an abyss.\u201d On the left, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont says the economy has been \u201cdestroyed\u201d for all but the wealthy few.Yet a glance out the window shows blue sky. There are troubling issues, including the horror of mass shootings, but most American social indicators have been positive at least for years, in many cases for decades. The country is, on the whole, in the best shape it\u2019s ever been in. So what explains all the bad vibes?Social media and cable news, which highlight scare stories and overstate anger, bear part of the blame. So does the long-running decline in respect for the clergy, the news media, the courts and other institutions. The Republican Party\u2019s strange insistence on disparaging the United States doesn\u2019t help, either.But the core reason for the disconnect between the nation\u2019s pretty-good condition and the gloomy conventional wisdom is that optimism itself has stopped being respectable. Pessimism is now the mainstream, with optimists viewed as Pollyannas. If you don\u2019t think everything is awful, you don\u2019t understand the situation!Objectively, the glass looks significantly more than half full.Job growth has been strong for five years, with unemployment now below where it was for most of the 1990s, a period some extol as the \u201cgood old days.\u201d The American economy is No. 1 by a huge margin, larger than Nos. 2 and 3 (China and Japan) combined. Americans are seven times as productive, per capita, as Chinese citizens. The dollar is the currency the world craves \u2014 which means other countries perceive America\u2019s long-term prospects as very good.Pollution, discrimination, crime and most diseases are in an extended decline; living standards, longevity and education levels continue to rise. The American military is not only the world\u2019s strongest, it is the strongest ever. The United States leads the world in science and engineering, in business innovation, in every aspect of creativity, including the arts. Terrorism is a serious concern, but in the last 15 years, even taking into account Sept. 11, an American is five times more likely to be hit by lightning than to be killed by a terrorist.Is the middle class in dire straits, as Mr. Sanders contends? Yes, inflation-adjusted middle-class household income peaked in 1998 and has dropped slightly since. But during the same period, federal income taxes on the middle class went down, while benefits went up. Gary Burtless of the Brookings Institution has shown that when lower taxes and higher benefits are factored in, middle-class buying power has risen 36 percent in the current generation.Manufacturing jobs described by Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders as \u201clost\u201d to China cannot be found there, or anywhere. As Charles Kenny of the nonpartisan Center for Global Development has shown, technology is causing factory-floor employment to diminish worldwide, even as loading docks hum with activity. This transition is jarring to say the least \u2014 but it was always inevitable. The evolution of the heavy-manufacturing sector away from workers and toward machines will not stop, even if international trade is cut off completely.A century ago, most Americans worked in agriculture: Today hardly any do, and we\u2019re all better off, including farmers. That manual labor, farm or factory, has given way to 60 percent of Americans employed in white-collar circumstances is the important story in the long term. But nothing is achieved by moaning about the past. The challenge is to create even more white-collar opportunities.Though candidates on the right are full of fire and brimstone this year, the trend away from optimism is most pronounced among liberals. A century ago Progressives were the optimists, believing society could be improved, while conservatism saw the end-times approaching. Today progressive thought embraces Judgment Day, too. Climate change, inequality and racial tension are viewed not as the next round of problems to be solved, but as proof that the United States is horrible.And yet developing the postindustrial economy \u2014 while addressing issues such as inequality, greenhouse emissions and the condition of public schools \u2014 will require optimism. Pessimists think in terms of rear-guard actions to turn back the clock. Optimists understand that where the nation has faults, it\u2019s time to roll up our sleeves and get to work.That\u2019s why the lack of progressive optimism is so keenly felt. In recent decades, progressives drank too deeply of instant-doomsday claims. If their predictions had come true, today petroleum would be exhausted, huge numbers of major animal species would be extinct, crop failures would be causing mass starvation, developing-world poverty would be getting worse instead of declining fast. (In 1990, 37 percent of humanity lived in what the World Bank defines as extreme poverty; today it\u2019s 10 percent.)The lack of optimism in contemporary liberal and centrist thinking opens the door to Trump-style demagogy, since if the country really is going to hell, we do indeed need walls. And because optimism has lost its standing in American public opinion, past reforms \u2014 among them environmental protection, anti-discrimination initiatives, income security for seniors, auto and aviation safety, interconnected global economics, improved policing and yes, Obamacare \u2014 don\u2019t get credit for the good they have accomplished.In almost every case, reform has made America a better place, with fewer unintended consequences and lower transaction costs than expected. This is the strongest argument for the next round of reforms. The argument is better made in positive terms \u2014 which is why we need a revival of optimism.Recently Warren Buffett said that because of the \u201cnegative drumbeat\u201d of politics, \u201cmany Americans now believe their children will not live as well as they themselves do. That view is dead wrong: The babies being born in America today are the luckiest crop in history.\u201d This was not Nebraska folk wisdom; rather, it\u2019s sophisticated analysis. The optimistic view is that it\u2019s still morning in America, and if we fix what\u2019s wrong, the best is yet to come. Such can-do, better-future thinking needs to make an appearance in the 2016 presidential campaign.Advertisement"}

But at least the prime minister maintained a degree of independence on issues like management of the economy, imprisonment of academics and journalists (which Mr. Davutoglu opposed) and anticorruption legislation (which Mr. Erdogan blocked).As the rift between the men widened, Mr. Davutoglu\u2019s ouster became inevitable. And when it is formally confirmed at a meeting of the Justice and Development Party (A.K.P.) on May 22, Mr. Erdogan is certain to install a more pliant prime minister, confirming himself as Turkey\u2019s unrivaled political leader.Even that would not fulfill Mr. Erdogan\u2019s ambitions. Though his party has a comfortable majority in Parliament, it lacks the votes to change the Constitution or call a referendum. The next prime minister\u2019s mission presumably will be to call elections and make sure the votes are there.That would be a disaster. It would be just as unfortunate if the West, which has treated Mr. Erdogan\u2019s repressive actions with kid gloves, were to be seen as abetting his gluttony for power. There is no doubt that the West needs him \u2014 the United States as a strategic NATO ally, the European Union for the deal with Turkey that has stemmed the flow of Syrian refugees into Europe.Democratic leaders should make abundantly clear that their dealings with Mr. Erdogan are emphatically not an endorsement of his illiberal rule, and that a turn back to the democratic promise of the early A.K.P. is a far surer path to partnership with the West.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spain\u2019s Wine Industry Is Hiccuping From Its Excesses", "Date": "2016-05-28", "News": "Supported byTOMELLOSO, Spain \u2014 For many, winemaking conjures up images of rolling vineyards, oak barrels and cavernous cellars.But here at Virgen de las Vi\u00f1as, or Virgin of the Vineyards, the biggest producer in Spain\u2019s largest wine region, production comes in the shape of giant steel vats and hoses connected to tank trucks. Employees work three shifts to keep the place running 24 hours a day.\u201cWe don\u2019t elaborate wine here \u2014 we produce wine,\u201d said Isidro Rodr\u00edguez, the company\u2019s technical director. \u201cThis is really a factory.\u201dThis is the unromantic side of winemaking in the region of Castile-La Mancha, which accounts for half of Spain\u2019s wine production. Most of it is sold in bulk and transported abroad, where it can be mixed with other wines and even re-exported.While Spain\u2019s producers churned out vast quantities of wine, some began to reconsider whether sheer volume was the best strategy, as overproduction sank both prices and the country\u2019s wine reputation.\u201cCastile-La Mancha ticks all the boxes as a bulk agricultural region, but perhaps not all of them for higher quality wine,\u201d said Miguel \u00c1ngel Benito, a sommelier and technical director of a wine museum in Pe\u00f1afiel, in Castile and Le\u00f3n, another wine region.\u201cSpain has been tapping into a growing market for bulk,\u201d he added, \u201cbecause there are millions of people who love wine but can\u2019t afford an expensive bottle.\u201dYet even some bulk producers in Castile-La Mancha are feeling a hangover from too much of a good thing.\u201cWe\u2019ve boosted our exports significantly, but probably too rapidly, so that we\u2019ve now got the wrong price pyramid, with a lot of wine sold very cheaply,\u201d said Rafael del Rey, the director of the Spanish Observatory of the Wine Market, an institute that researches and promotes the country\u2019s wine.In recent years, France and Italy have jostled for the top spot as the world\u2019s biggest wine-producing nation, with Spain third, well ahead of countries like the United States, Chile and Australia.The bulk producers in Castile-La Mancha are understandably proud of the state-of-the-art irrigation, harvest mechanization and storage systems that they put in place, with help from European Union subsidies. Coupled with relatively low labor costs, their infrastructure has allowed them to lower the price of their wine to half that of France\u2019s.But Mr. del Rey offers a telling comparison between Spain and Italy. In 2000, both countries exported their wine at the same average price, 1.41 euros per liter. By 2014, Italy was selling its wine for an average of \u20ac2.5 per liter, or $2.78 under the current exchange rate, while Spain\u2019s sold for \u20ac1.17, or $1.30.In that period, Italian exports rose 15 percent in volume and Spain\u2019s 154 percent. But Spain\u2019s export revenue reached only \u20ac2.6 billion, about half the value of Italian exports.Spain\u2019s bulk wine has displaced Italy\u2019s on the European market, particularly in France. Spain now sells about 500 million liters to France, 90 percent of which are bulk exports, at an average price of four-tenths of a euro per liter.France has recently been exporting almost 250 million liters of bulk wine, at an average of \u20ac1.24, three times Spain\u2019s price, Mr. del Rey said.\u201cI\u2019m not saying that exactly the same liter that left Spain is then re-exported from France,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s undeniable that some Spanish wine becomes part of French exports, with a lot of added value.\u201dBut even Spain\u2019s neighbors are beginning to complain that the country is producing too much wine \u2014 and dumping it in their markets.In April, French farmers stopped five Spanish trucks near the border and drained their wine onto the road, to protest what they see as unfair competition. Spain\u2019s Foreign Ministry then complained to France, saying it needed to prevent such attacks.Ces\u00e1reo Cabrera del Prado, the president of El Progreso, a large producer in Castile-La Mancha, said he could understand that some French farmers were upset, \u201cbut each country has its strengths.\u201dWhile Spain has been undercutting France\u2019s production costs for wine, he said, \u201cFrench dairy farmers have done the same to our Spanish milk.\u201dEl Progreso bottles only about 5 percent of its wine, the most expensive of which retails for \u20ac6, or $6.67, a bottle. Most of its wine is instead poured into the tanks of trucks, and some is then packaged through the bag-in-box system. A plastic bag of as much as 20 liters is placed inside a cardboard box, which sometimes already carries a foreign name.In one corner of the El Progreso warehouse, for instance, there are boxes marked as an American brand, but they also carry a \u201cProduct of Spain\u201d label of origin.Some Spanish wine regions, however, have changed their ways.Two decades ago, the authorities in La Rioja, in northern Spain, introduced legislation requiring producers to bottle their wine. The measure was challenged, going as far as the European Court of Justice, which in 2000 rejected a case brought by somebody who still wanted to import bulk Rioja wine.Could Castile-La Mancha follow Rioja\u2019s lead? That \u201csounds right but is simply not practical,\u201d mainly because of the size of Castile-La Mancha\u2019s vineyards, said Javier de la Fuente, the general manager of the Rioja wine regulatory council.When Rioja introduced the ban, bulk wine accounted for only 5 percent of its production, he said, while in Castile-La Mancha, \u201ca lot of big producers absolutely rely on bulk and its economies of scale.\u201dAlthough many experts believe Spain should reduce its reliance on bulk wine, such an overhaul could be harmful, they said, particularly to the thousands of farmers in Castile-La Mancha who sell their grapes for bulk production.Castile-La Mancha\u2019s producers began to emphasize bulk wine in 2009 after the European Union decided to end subsidies for distilled alcohol.Strong harvests since then have pushed Spain\u2019s pricing toward record lows, and Virgen de las Vi\u00f1as is hoping to break even this year, after reporting a loss last year, said Enrique Cepeda, its chief executive. He does not expect prices to rise soon.\u201cSomebody who makes a Seat would be happy to sell instead a Porsche,\u201d Mr. Cepeda said, comparing bulk wine to Spain\u2019s household car brand. \u201cBut you can\u2019t make such a switch easily.\u201dStill, some smaller producers in Castile-La Mancha are gaining recognition for the quality of their wine \u2014 and finding it increasingly uncomfortable to cohabit with their giant neighbors.\u201cWhen I have a foreign customer visiting my cellar and I want to sell him a bottle for 20, 30 or 40 euros, the fact that he might know that there are bottles sold nearby for just a few cents doesn\u2019t really help,\u201d Mr. Falc\u00f3 said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Added 160,000 Jobs Last Month as Brisk Hiring Slowed", "Date": "2016-05-06", "News": "Supported byAfter racing ahead for many months, the American jobs machine cooled in April, as employers took their cue from other signs that economic growth was slowing by easing up on new hiring.The 160,000 increase in payrolls in April reported by the Labor Department on Friday followed the best two-year stretch for the job market since the tech-fueled boom of the late 1990s.The unemployment rate, which is tied to a separate survey of households, was unchanged at 5 percent.\u201cIt\u2019s a soft report but it doesn\u2019t portend a turn in the labor market,\u201d said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays. \u201cI\u2019d be more concerned if there were weakness across the board, but there wasn\u2019t.\u201dApril\u2019s slower but still steady pace of payroll growth could be a sign of things to come. With economists expecting the economy to grow at an annual rate of 1.5 to 2.5 percent for the balance of 2016, monthly job gains may fall from the 192,000 pace registered so far this year.The latest jobs data is likely to leave the Federal Reserve waiting for further signs of a pickup in activity before moving ahead with any interest rate increases. Fed officials will see one more jobs report before their next meeting in June.William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in an interview on Friday that the latest government data demonstrated that the labor market continued to improve gradually, in line with the Fed\u2019s expectations.\u201cIt\u2019s a touch softer, maybe, than what people were expecting, but I wouldn\u2019t put a lot of weight on it in terms of how it would affect my economic outlook,\u201d he said.Mr. Dudley added that it remained a \u201creasonable expectation\u201d that the Fed would increase its benchmark interest rate two times this year.The Labor Department also revised downward its estimate of the number of jobs added in February and March by 19,000.Diane Swonk, an independent economist in Chicago, pointed to the strong gain of 67,000 jobs in the business and professional services category as additional evidence that the broader slowdown in hiring last month was not an ominous sign of trouble ahead.\u201cThe quality of the jobs improved but the quantity did not,\u201d she said, adding that the health of this heavily white-collar sector helped explain why wage growth was also robust.The 0.3 percentage point rise in average hourly earnings was the most positive sign of the economy\u2019s trajectory in Friday\u2019s report.Until recently, wages had been a sore point throughout the nearly seven-year-old recovery, barely rising in real terms despite the big drop in the unemployment rate.The change in earnings in April suggested that the upward tick in wages was not a fluke. Over the last 12 months, wages are up 2.5 percent, well ahead of the pace of inflation.In addition to a tighter labor market, which has prompted some major employers to raise their wage floor, dozens of states and cities either have already carried out or are considering increases in the minimum wage. Combined, those forces are helping push up pay at the low end of the job market.\u201cWe\u2019ve hit a tipping point,\u201d Ms. Swonk said. \u201cIt\u2019s showing up in low-wage jobs, for waiters and waitresses, in retail and in leisure and hospitality.\u201d\u201cThe good news is that we are re-engaging people who\u2019ve been on the sidelines,\u201d Ms. Swonk added.States including California, Colorado, Michigan and Massachusetts increased their minimum wages at the start of 2016. Maryland and the District of Columbia are set to enact raises on July 1.\u201cHere in the United States, there are folks out there who are still hurting,\u201d Mr. Obama said, \u201cand so we\u2019ve got to do everything we can to strengthen the good trends and to guard against some dangerous trends in the global economy.\u201dWith the race to succeed President Obama now moving from the primary phase into the general election campaign, the April jobs report contained fodder for candidates in both parties.Democrats can point to the rise in wages as evidence that conditions are improving, but the slowdown in hiring, particularly among manufacturing industries, and a large drop in the number of Americans in the work force may add to complaints among blue-collar workers that they are being left behind.The proportion of Americans in the labor force dropped last month to 62.8 percent from 63 percent in March, partly reversing a rebound that began last fall after the participation rate hit lows last seen in the 1970s.Like the unemployment rate, participation in the labor force is measured in the Labor Department\u2019s household survey, which is separate from the survey of businesses that is used to calculate the change in payrolls.Although the two tend to correlate over time, the household data is more volatile than the payroll survey, and April was no exception. It showed more than half a million people leaving the labor force.For college-educated workers, many of them supporters of Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders on the Democratic side, the already low jobless rate declined even further to 2.4 percent. The unemployment rate for Americans with a high school diploma, who have contributed to the crowds supporting the G.O.P. standard-bearer Donald Trump, was unchanged at 5.4 percent.The unemployment rate for workers without a high school diploma increased slightly to 7.5 percent in April, continuing a rise from 6.7 percent at the end of 2015.The payroll numbers and the unemployment rate tend to dominate the headlines, but the Federal Reserve also pays close attention to the participation rate.While Mr. Dudley, the New York Fed president, left open the possibility of higher interest rates in June, economists predicted that April\u2019s softness might persuade Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, and her colleagues to remain cautious about future rate increases.After the report, Barclays told clients in a note that the April data put a rate increase in June \u201coff the table\u201d and the that bank now expected only one interest rate increase by the Fed this year.Some notable pockets of weakness remain in the nation\u2019s economy.In the first three months of 2016, factories shed 47,000 jobs, hurt in part by a stronger dollar and weaker overseas demand. Manufacturing employment rose by 4,000 in April. The oil patch is still reeling from the impact of sharply lower energy prices, despite a recent rebound. Other commodity-based industries like metals and mining are also hurting.Between January 2015 and March 2016, the mining and logging industry lost 170,000 jobs. In April, miners and loggers cut another 8,000 jobs.Public sector employment unexpectedly fell by 11,000. And pacesetters with big gains in previous months, like retailers, hit the brakes on new hiring.When approximately 40,000 Verizon workers went on strike last month, it was right in the middle of the week that government number crunchers analyze to gauge the strength of the job market.Before the report, some economists predicted that the strike could have a modest impact on the numbers. Mr. Gapen, the Barclays economist, said he did not think that was the case, because the telecommunications industry did not register a big drop in employment.In hot fields like health care, technology and professional services, employers are scrambling to find new employees. In Chicago, ContextMedia, which provides tablets and digital wallboards for doctors\u2019 offices, brought 25 new employees aboard in April. The company plans to add about 100 workers a quarter for the rest of 2016, said Iman Jalali, the company\u2019s chief of staff.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to attract talent from across the country,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some of the best people in Chicago, but when you are growing so quickly, you need to keep growing the pool.\u201dBinyamin Appelbaum and Michael D. Shear contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, said on Friday that the Fed was on track to raise its benchmark interest rate \u201cin the coming months,\u201d reinforcing a recent effort by central bank officials to prepare investors for higher borrowing costs.Ms. Yellen said the Fed wanted to see evidence the economy was rebounding from a weak winter before it acted, but she added that evidence was beginning to pile up.\u201cGrowth looks to be picking up from the various data that we monitor, and if that continues and if the labor market continues to improve \u2014 and I expect those things will occur,\u201d then it would be appropriate to raise rates, Ms. Yellen said. She spoke before receiving the Radcliffe Medal in a ceremony at Harvard University.The central bank also has scheduled meetings in late July and in mid-September.The Fed has held interest rates at low levels since the Great Recession, to stimulate economic growth by encouraging borrowing and risk-taking. It started raising rates in December, seeking to reduce those incentives. But it paused as the economy appeared to weaken. Now it seems ready to continue.Ms. Yellen spoke during a question-and-answer session with N. Gregory Mankiw, a professor of economics at Harvard who was an economic adviser to President George W. Bush. Professor Mankiw asked if Ms. Yellen had any message for investors, whom he described as eager to begin their holiday weekend. He added that she could simply decline and move on.But Ms. Yellen did not want to avoid the question.\u201cLet me say a few sentences, so I won\u2019t delay them very long,\u201d she began, before describing her view that the economy appeared to be gaining strength. She said that the Fed wanted to \u201cgradually and cautiously\u201d increase its benchmark rate, and that \u201cprobably in the coming months such a move would be appropriate.\u201dSome of Ms. Yellen\u2019s colleagues have suggested they do not expect to wait until September.\u201cThe June-July time frame is a reasonable expectation,\u201d William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said early this month.Ms. Yellen\u2019s remarks on current policy were a brief interlude in an event largely devoted to celebrating her career. Ben S. Bernanke, the former Fed chairman, introduced Ms. Yellen, lauding her as \u201cconsistently prescient\u201d in her economic analysis and \u201cforceful\u201d in her advocacy for the Fed\u2019s stimulus campaign after the financial crisis.He also teased Ms. Yellen for her habit of arriving very early at airports. Caution was a desirable quality in a central banker, he said. But he joked that Ms. Yellen\u2019s security detail had been unable to convince her that sirens and flashing lights and the ability to skip security meant she no longer needed to arrive quite so early.Ms. Yellen responded that America owed Mr. Bernanke \u201can enormous debt of gratitude\u201d for leading the Fed\u2019s response to the financial crisis, which she called \u201cnothing short of magnificent.\u201dBut in a panel discussion before Ms. Yellen\u2019s appearance, several leading academics painted a fairly bleak picture of the economy as it has emerged from the crisis.Lower-income Americans have seen \u201clittle improvement in income, little improvement in health, little improvement in life expectancy,\u201d said Louise Sheiner, a fellow at the Brookings Institution. \u201cNo wonder there\u2019s so much anger out there.\u201dDouglas W. Elmendorf, dean of Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School, said policy makers had a responsibility not only to spur growth but to reduce economic inequality.\u201cWe tend to talk in this country about the importance of overall economic growth,\u201d he said. \u201cThat logic, that focus on overall growth, worked best in the period when a rising tide lifted all boats.\u201dIn an era of yawning inequalities, he said, \u201cWe need to be more explicit about our distributional concerns.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Robert Bennett, Former Senator from Utah and Tea Party Casualty, Dies at 82", "Date": "2016-05-04", "News": "Supported byFormer Senator Robert F. Bennett, a conservative Republican from Utah who played a central role in shaping the bank bailout legislation during the 2008 financial crisis, an act of compromise that made him a stunning casualty of the Tea Party movement, died on Wednesday in Arlington, Va. He was 82.The cause was complications of a stroke, said a spokeswoman, Tara Tanner, who added that he also had pancreatic cancer.In his three terms in the Senate, Mr. Bennett, though a stalwart conservative, sometimes sought compromises on major issues like immigration, health care and the 2008 economic downturn.Mr. Bennett, a scion of a prominent Utah family \u2014 a grandfather had been president of the Mormon Church, and his father had been a four-term United States senator from the state \u2014 left the convention in tears as delegates cheered and shouted, \u201cHe\u2019s gone, he\u2019s gone.\u201dHis defeat was the first major success of the Tea Party movement, and it influenced many conservative officeholders to move even farther to the right to avoid or defeat intraparty challenges.A successful businessman before entering politics, Mr. Bennett operated quietly in the Senate. He worked closely with Republican leaders like Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who praised him as a \u201cstaunch conservative with a track record of finding common ground on some of the toughest issues.\u201dMr. Bennett compiled an 84 percent conservative voting record in his 18 years in the Senate, according to the American Conservative Union. But the biggest blow to his career was the fallout from his vote on the bank bailout, which was condemned by the union and by conservative broadcasters.In shaping the bill, which was intended to preserve the country\u2019s financial system, Mr. Bennett had worked closely with Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the liberal Connecticut Democrat. The legislation\u2019s centerpiece was the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, created to shore up or bail out failing banks with an infusion of $700 billion in federal funds.Acknowledging widespread objections to the bill by conservatives, Mr. Bennett urged Republican colleagues to rise above the clamor, warning that if the economy collapsed, \u201cSome will feel very virtuous about having voted against Wall Street and then turn around and find that their constituents, generally, paid a huge price for that vote.\u201dBacked by President George W. Bush, the bill passed with the support of 34 of 49 Republican senators.\u201cHe paid the price for it,\u201d said Mr. Dodd, who called Mr. Bennett \u201ca kindred soul, very deliberative, easy to work with.\u201dMr. Bennett aroused anger on the right with two other stands, although neither became law. In 2007, he supported President Bush on comprehensive immigration legislation, leading one conservative radio host to urge Utahns to kill Mr. Bennett. The other was his collaboration with Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, in 2009 on a compromise health care alternative to President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.Mr. Bennett said his willingness to compromise had been instilled in him by his father, Senator Wallace Foster Bennett. He taught him, he said, that \u201cyou have to be willing to reach out and not just say, \u2018I alone am going to solve this problem.\u2019 \u201dRobert Foster Bennett was born on Sept. 18, 1933, in Salt Lake City. His mother was the former Frances Marion Grant. His father operated several businesses, including Bennett Paint and Glass, and was first elected to the Senate in 1950. His mother\u2019s father, Heber J. Grant, was the seventh president of the Mormon Church.Robert Bennett attended local schools, graduated from the University of Utah and served as a chaplain in the Utah National Guard. In an interview for this obituary in 2014, he said he had always been a \u201cpolitical junkie\u201d but had no political ambitions early on. \u201cIt was always understood that I would work at the family paint company,\u201d he said.It was his father who brought him into politics to help him in his Senate duties in Washington while he ran for re-election in 1962. (Wallace Bennett served in the Senate until December 1974.) After working on Capitol Hill, he became a lobbyist and, in 1969, congressional liaison for the Nixon administration\u2019s Department of Transportation.He left in 1971 and bought the Robert Mullen Company, a public relations firm that once employed E. Howard Hunt, a C.I.A. veteran and writer who led the Watergate burglars.Mr. Bennett said at the time and in the 2014 interview that he had known nothing about the break-in at Democratic headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington. He did say, however, that he had agreed to a White House request for Mr. Hunt to help the 1972 Nixon campaign \u201cmostly on nights and weekends.\u201d The request should have made him suspicious, he said ruefully in the interview.After the family company closed in 1974, Mr. Bennett moved to California to work for Howard Hughes and later for other companies. His greatest success, he said, was as head of the Franklin Covey Company, which produced the Franklin Day Planner and conducted business-oriented time management seminars. He held that job from 1984 to 1990.Mr. Bennett was, with others at Franklin, an author of \u201cGaining Control\u201d (1987), which deals with time management, and the author of \u201cLeap of Faith: Confronting the Origins of the Book of Mormon\u201d (2009). \u201cLeap of Faith\u201d discusses how Mormons, through faith, can believe the church\u2019s foundational account by Joseph Smith, a farmer with little formal education, who said he had translated the Book of Mormon from golden plates revealed to him by an angel.Mr. Bennett is survived by his wife, the former Joyce McKay, a flutist and teacher at the Levine School of Music in Washington (and also a grandchild of a Mormon Church president). They married in 1962. He is also survived by a brother, Wallace G. Bennett; a sister, Frances Jeppson; four daughters, Julie Newton, Wendy Prawitt, Heather Oman and Heidi Knighton; two sons, Robert and James; and 20 grandchildren.Advertisement"}

We do not suffer from a lack of good ideas but rather from a lack of sufficient funding. Alzheimer\u2019s research is very expensive, but it is a bargain compared with the long-term costs of skimping.In fact, the entire budget of the two agencies at the National Institutes of Health responsible for Alzheimer\u2019s research is only about $3 billion a year, less than 10 percent of the aggregate N.I.H. budget and a tiny fraction of the $236 billion that Alzheimer\u2019s costs our country each year.Alzheimer\u2019s might be cured in the next decade, but only if we commit additional billions of dollars a year. As promising research is being delayed because of insufficient financial resources, Alzheimer\u2019s strikes an American every 67 seconds.CHRISTOPHER G. JANSONChicagoThe writer is an assistant professor of neurology at the University of Illinois at Chicago.To the Editor:Alzheimer\u2019s disease is only one of a number of causes of dementia. Most dementia is not pure Alzheimer\u2019s disease but a combination of vascular disease and Alzheimer\u2019s.Mild pathologic changes of Alzheimer\u2019s disease would be asymptomatic in the absence of mini-strokes and/or white matter disease of the brain, which probably results from damage to small vessels in the brain; both conditions are known consequences of hypertension.The report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says about 50 percent of Americans with hypertension are either not treated or undertreated. Treatment of hypertension is a direct way to prevent vascular disease of the brain and thus dementia.While we search for the magic bullet to prevent or cure Alzheimer\u2019s disease, we can take a major and effective step by treating one of the root causes of dementia, high blood pressure, for which we have myriad effective and usually inexpensive medication. JOHN ROBBINSDavis, Calif.The writer is a professor of medicine at the University of California Davis.To the Editor:The very moving story of Geri Taylor\u2019s life with Alzheimer\u2019s includes a nugget that should not be overlooked.The head of the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Unit at Yale, Dr. Christopher H. van Dyck, tells Ms. Taylor that \u201cthe cost to society is much greater from Alzheimer\u2019s\u201d than from cancer and heart disease. He\u2019s right. Economists at University of Southern California\u2019s Schaeffer Center estimate that the national costs of dealing with Alzheimer\u2019s will rise to $1.5 trillion a year by 2050.We do not need to hit a home run to improve lives and our fiscal outlook. A new therapy that can delay onset for even five years would reduce the number of Americans with the disease in 2050 by 41 percent or more, probably rescuing Medicare and Medicaid in the process.Let\u2019s hope that Ms. Taylor\u2019s clinical trial gives her more and better years. At the same time we must dramatically increase Alzheimer\u2019s funding at the National Institutes of Health.

The constant drive to find a single solution in a drug will continue to result in failure.Yet there is a new field of medicine that doctors have been slow to embrace.

{"Headline": "Nicholas Guyatt\u2019s \u2018Bind Us Apart\u2019", "Date": "2016-04-29", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Half a century ago, inspired by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Brown v. Board of Education, historians embarked on an effort to identify the origins of racial segregation. C. Vann Woodward insisted that rather than existing from time immemorial, as the ruling\u2019s opponents claimed, segregation emerged in the 1890s. Others located its genesis in Reconstruction or the pre-Civil War North.Eventually, the debate faded. Now, Nicholas Guyatt offers a new interpretation. Segregation and its ideological justification \u201cseparate but equal,\u201d he argues, originated in the early Republic in the efforts of \u201cenlightened Americans\u201d to uplift and protect Indians and African-\u00adAmericans. After trying and abandoning other policies, these reformers and policy makers concluded that only separation from whites \u2014 removal of Indians to the trans-Mississippi West and blacks to Africa \u2014 would enable these groups to enjoy their natural rights and achieve economic and cultural advancement. Thus, almost from the outset, the idea of separating the races was built into the DNA of the United States.Guyatt, who teaches at the University of Cambridge, is the author of a well-\u00adregarded book on the history of the idea (still very much alive today) that God has chosen this country for a special mission. In \u201cBind Us Apart\u201d he addresses another theme central to our national identity: Who is an American? To find an answer he offers a detailed account of early national policies toward Indians and blacks.By the somewhat anachronistic label \u201cliberal\u201d \u2014 usually applied, when referring to the 19th century, to believers in limited government, free trade and individual liberty \u2014 Guyatt means adherents of Enlightenment values, including the repudiation of prejudice against others. These people realized that the presence of subordinate racial populations could not be reconciled with the affirmation that \u201call men are created equal\u201d in the Declaration of Independence. They assumed that what appeared to be black and Indian inferiority resulted from oppressive circumstances, not innate incapacity. With proper education and training, these groups could become equal members of American society.This belief led to a \u201ccivilizing agenda\u201d whereby the federal government encouraged Native Americans to form compact communities where they would take up settled farming and abandon communal land holding for the benefits of private ownership. The ultimate aim was that whites and Indians would \u201cbecome one people,\u201d in the words of Thomas Jefferson.One of Guyatt\u2019s surprising findings is how many liberals believed that the Indian population should be assimilated through intermarriage. \u201cYou will mix with us by marriage,\u201d Jefferson told an Indian delegation in 1808. \u201cWe shall all be Americans.\u201d Not all whites agreed, of course. In the 1820s \u201call hell broke loose\u201d in Cornwall, Conn., when two young Indian men who arrived to study at a religious school ended up marrying local white women.Despite the liberals\u2019 vision of harmony, conflict reigned on the frontier. After the War of 1812 broke the power of Indian nations east of the Mississippi River, hundreds of thousands of white settlers poured across the Appalachians, eyeing Native American land. Reformers feared the Indians were destined for extinction. The only alternative, they concluded, was for them to be transported far from the white presence. In this interpretation, Andrew Jackson\u2019s policy of Indian removal, which produced the infamous Trail of Tears, reflected not so much a hatred of Indians but a desire to ensure their survival.When it came to African-Americans, the liberals\u2019 preferred approach was removal to Africa, a policy known as \u201ccolonization.\u201d Guyatt is correct to insist that historians have not taken the idea of colonization seriously enough. It was hardly a fringe movement; statesmen from Thomas Jefferson to Henry Clay and, as late as 1862, Abraham Lincoln saw colonization as the only way to end slavery peacefully and with the consent of slaveholders. It also attracted some support among blacks. Most, however, strongly resisted; indeed their opposition to colonization was a crucial catalyst for the emergence of radical abolitionism, which demanded equal rights for blacks within the United States.Like Indian removal, Guyatt argues, colonization emerged after reformers abandoned the idea that blacks could be assimilated into American society. The first emancipation \u2014 gradual abolition in the Northern states \u2014 was not coupled with colonization. Reformers assumed that children born to slaves would find a place as free Americans after serving apprenticeships that helped them overcome the \u201cdegradation\u201d caused by slavery (not by innate inferiority).Guyatt makes clear that rather than being fixed, racial attitudes evolve historically. The initial status of free blacks in the new nation was, to say the least, confusing. The Naturalization Act of 1790, which barred nonwhite immigrants from becoming citizens, envisioned a racially exclusive Republic. Yet in the same decade the federal government issued certificates of citizenship to black sailors as well as white to protect them from impressment by the British Navy. Black men could vote in most of the original 13 states. As the 19th century progressed, however, prejudice steadily increased and free blacks\u2019 rights were stripped away. And intermarriage was even less of an option than with Indians. The charge that abolitionists were promoting racial \u201camalgamation\u201d helped to spark anti-black riots, including one in New York City in 1834. With racism becoming more and more intractable, many critics of slavery (Lincoln among them) came to believe that the only way to rid the country of the institution and secure blacks\u2019 rights was by separating the races.Guyatt\u2019s juxtaposition of attitudes and policies relating to Indians and blacks yields important insights. But the book is not entirely persuasive. For one thing, its structure seems at odds with its argument. Chapters on Native Americans alternate with those on blacks, creating a disjointed narrative that makes it difficult to find the links between the two stories. Like many writers with a bold thesis, Guyatt is prone to exaggeration. Given the fact that only a few thousand black Americans ended up in Liberia, established in Africa by the American Colonization Society, can we really say that \u201cseparate but equal\u201d was a \u201cfounding principle of the United States\u201d?Guyatt may be guilty of taking too seriously the claims by proponents of separation that they were motivated by the best interests of blacks and Indians. As recent studies suggest, colonizationists seemed remarkably indifferent to the fate of those they sent to Africa. Long after it was apparent that emigrants had a better chance of survival if they settled at sites on higher ground, the society continued to deposit them at Monrovia, Liberia\u2019s low-lying, malaria-infested capital.It is difficult to assess Guyatt\u2019s claim that those he calls \u201cliberal\u201d invented segregation. Many advocates of racial separation were hardly free from prejudice. Some colonizationists seemed more interested in ridding the country of free blacks than ending slavery or improving the black condition. Indeed, the Colonization Society relentlessly opposed efforts to uplift blacks in this country for fear of making them reluctant to depart. Indian removal owed a great deal not to liberals but to outright racists, including Southern planters who coveted Native American land for the rapidly expanding Cotton Kingdom. Many reformers strongly opposed the policy. Was Andrew Jackson an \u201cenlightened American\u201d when it came to relations with the Indians?Viewing the story fundamentally as a problem of race relations obscures the crucial difference between the place of Native Americans and blacks in the emerging national economy. The bottom line is this: To fulfill their own aspirations, white Americans needed Indian land and black labor. That is why Indian removal took place but black colonization \u2014 apart from a few thousand souls \u2014 never did.Eric Foner is the DeWitt Clinton professor of history at Columbia University and the author, most recently, of \u201cGateway to Freedom: The Hidden History of the Underground Railroad.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fewer Americans Strike Out for New Jobs, Crimping the Recovery", "Date": "2016-05-24", "News": "Supported byBy covered wagon and jetliner, from East Coast to West, Rust Belt to Sun Belt, Americans\u2019 propensity to be on the move \u2013 to new jobs and new places \u2013 has historically provided the economy with a critical dose of oomph.But as fewer and fewer Americans are loading up the moving van in search of opportunity, that advantage may be slipping away. In recent years, economists have become increasingly worried that a slide in job turnover and relocation rates is undermining the economy\u2019s dynamism, damping productivity and wages while making it more difficult for sidelined workers to find their way back into the labor force.Staying put can mean that workers are not moving to jobs where they would be more productive. At the same time, many are forgoing the raises and ascents on the career ladder that often come with a job switch. Fewer openings can also have a ripple effect, shrinking the bargaining power of workers in general, making it tougher to ask for a bump up in pay.\u201cIt also stinks if you lose your job,\u201d Ms. Stevenson said of reduced turnover. \u201cIt\u2019s like a game of musical chairs where only half the people get up.\u201dSuch road-testing of jobs was once very common, particularly for young workers. But now, \u201cquick turnover jobs are declining across the board,\u201d Ms. Wozniak said. \u201cIt\u2019s not as easy to try things out.\u201dWhat they found was a drop of 10 to 15 percent between 1980 and 2013. Some individual measures showed starker declines: The proportion of workers who jumped from one job to another plunged by nearly a quarter.Mobility normally drops during downturns, and that was the case during the Great Recession. Millions of jobs vanished, and those fortunate enough to be working were less inclined to give up the one they had.But even as much of the wreckage wrought by the crash has been cleared, fluidity has not bounced back to prerecession levels. Although there was a common perception that the mortgage crisis had stranded many Americans in place, economists found scant evidence to support that notion. Moving declined similarly among both renters and homeowners. Something else appears to be going on.Moreover, when it comes to mobility, figuring out which is the chicken and which is the egg is not so easy. Is a less fluid labor market causing the economy to be more sluggish or is a sluggish economy causing the labor market to be less fluid?Certainly, movement has declined as the population ages. Older people are less likely to switch jobs and resettle than younger people. The addition of career-minded women into the work force may also make it harder for couples and families to move if only one spouse can find a new job. In addition, fewer new companies are being created over all, and the ones that exist are growing more slowly on average.Still, those explanations don\u2019t account for the steep drops in mobility and job turnover found across every age group, educational level and industry.One of the more intriguing findings was the role of declining social trust and what is known as social capital \u2014 the web of family, friends and professional contacts. For example, the proportion of people who agree with the statement, \u201cMost people can be trusted,\u201d has been shrinking for more than three decades. Researchers found that states with larger declines in social trust also had larger declines in labor market fluidity. The lack of trust may increase the cost of job-hunting and make both employees and employers more risk-averse.Ms. Wozniak added that the benefits of LinkedIn and Facebook friends may not replace the personal connections that still remain the best way to find a job.For some, the information revolution has a decided downside. Employers can use easily accessible information about criminal records and credit histories, not to mention embarrassing tweets, photos, social media postings and more to screen out a wider range of candidates.\u201cYou get fewer second chances now,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cIf you screwed up in a way that\u2019s out there, it follows you around for life.\u201dMr. Davis also argued that an increase in government regulations, including varying licensing requirements that prevent workers from setting up shop in another state, have made the labor market more static, though the evidence is mixed.Fluidity rates varied widely throughout the country, but the Brookings paper found that they declined in every state. Most of the largest drops occurred in the West: Oregon, Wyoming, Washington, Oregon, South Dakota, Montana, Idaho and Alaska were all in the bottom 10.States with the most activity included North Carolina, South Carolina, New York, New Jersey and Illinois \u2013 but even these were not as fluid as they used to be.Of course, high rates of job turnover are not necessarily good. Some states have tumult in the labor market because thousands of workers lost manufacturing, clerical or construction jobs. They might have found new positions at lower levels that don\u2019t pay as much.On the flip side, rootedness can also have other types of payoffs, including stronger communities and support, help with a babysitting emergency, a shared beer after work or a loan when a job is lost. As social trust diminishes, people may feel more comfortable sticking closer to home where the faces are familiar even if job opportunities are scarcer, researchers suggested.Over all, \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone has a good answer yet\u201d to the decline in mobility, Ms. Stevenson of the University of Michigan said. \u201cIt\u2019s a puzzle and it\u2019s the one I wish politicians and policy makers were more concerned about.\u201dFollow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Experts Warn of Backlash in Donald Trump\u2019s China Trade Policies", "Date": "2016-05-02", "News": "Supported byThe bottom line, some experts say, is that Mr. Trump might well be able to squeeze China.That does not mean, however, that his punitive approach would ease America\u2019s economic pains. In fact, a range of experts agree that Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals are more likely to deepen those problems, particularly if China or other targeted nations retaliate, rather than accept his demands.Starting a trade war might be cathartic for workers who have lost jobs, but it is unlikely to create a lot of factory work.\u201cThere\u2019s no way a tariff of this kind could deliver the kind of benefits that he\u2019s talking about, and it\u2019s quite wrong to think that the big problem for American workers has been foreign trade,\u201d said J .W. Mason, a professor of economics at John Jay College and a fellow at the Roosevelt Institute, a liberal think tank. \u201cBut I think it could be very destructive for the rest of the world.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s views on trade are among his oldest and steadiest public policy positions. He has long maintained that other countries are taking advantage of the United States because Americans spend more money on foreign goods than the rest of the world spends on American goods. And he has long argued for slapping higher tariffs on those foreign goods in order to fortify the American economy.Trade was the first policy issue Mr. Trump mentioned last Tuesday in a speech after his latest round of victories in five northeastern primaries.\u201cOur jobs are being sucked away from our country, and we\u2019re not going to let it happen anymore, folks,\u201d he said at a victory party in New York that night.It emerged again Wednesday in Washington during what was billed as a major foreign policy speech.This Tuesday, Mr. Trump hopes to sweep the delegates in Indiana and all but sew up the Republican nomination. Nowhere has trade figured more centrally than in the Hoosier State, where the air-conditioner maker Carrier opted to move operations to Mexico, becoming a recurrent feature in Mr. Trump\u2019s anti-free-trade litanies.In the current campaign, Mr. Trump has proposed a 45 percent tax on Chinese imports and a 35 percent tax on Mexican imports. He has also proposed tariffs on goods that specific American companies produce in foreign countries, including Carrier air-conditioners and Ford cars.Mr. Trump has said the threat of such tariffs would persuade China, for example, to modify the economic policies that he describes as providing unfair advantages to Chinese companies. Rather than incur his wrath, he says, American companies would be persuaded to keep more of their factories close to home.He added: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be 45; it could be less. But it has to be something because our country and our trade and our deals and most importantly our jobs are going to hell.\u201dAs president, Mr. Trump would have some latitude to reverse a course that the nation has pursued for decades. But the results could be troublesome on multiple fronts. The removal of trade barriers has played a significant role in reducing global poverty and encouraging peace between nations, achievements that could be eroded by tit-for-tat backsliding.\u201cThe basic principle is that a sovereign state enters trade agreements of its free will, and it can get back out,\u201d said Robert Howse, the Lloyd C. Nelson professor of international law at N.Y.U. School of Law. \u201cBut that\u2019s the easy part.\u201dUnder existing laws, Mr. Trump could impose tariffs only on specific categories of imports, not whole countries, and only by demonstrating specific violations of trade rules, such as export subsidies.\u201cThere are at least 50 sets of laws and regulations that exist that China has, at least in spirit, crossed the boundaries,\u201d Sam Clovis, an adviser to Mr. Trump, said in an interview.But Mr. Trump would have the difficult task of proving that China is breaking the rules before the World Trade Organization, which polices global commerce. International trade laws limit the type of help governments can provide to companies, but the role of the Chinese government is particularly opaque, said Mark Wu, a professor of law at Harvard and a former United States trade negotiator in the administration of President George W. Bush.\u201cChina\u2019s economy is its own beast, and it has a form that was not envisioned at the time these rules were created 20 years ago,\u201d Mr. Wu said. \u201cW.T.O. rules are not necessarily equipped to address all of the problematic aspects of that China Inc. system as far as American exporters are concerned.\u201dAccording to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.In fact, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s favorite charges, that China and other nations are suppressing the value of their currencies, is actually not a violation of existing trade agreements.A central problem is defining currency manipulation in a way that excludes the United States \u2014 in particular, the Federal Reserve\u2019s post-recession stimulus campaign, which had the effect of weakening the dollar much in the same way that other countries do to their currency.Alternatively, Mr. Trump could pursue the radical option of seeking legislation to impose a broad China tariff, in effect demolishing the rules of global trade.\u201cIt would be a flagrant violation,\u201d said Alan O. Sykes, a professor of law at Stanford and an expert on international economic relations. \u201cThere is no prior violation of W.T.O. law that would be even close.\u201dThe impact of such legislation would touch almost every aisle at Walmart.In 2015, Americans bought $14.2 billion worth of Chinese shoes, $2.5 billion of Chinese jewelry and $593 million of Chinese rugs. And, most of all, cellphones \u2014 $64 billion worth, according to the Commerce Department.For the same reasons, however, economists see little chance that a tariff would achieve Mr. Trump\u2019s goal of encouraging domestic production. They say it is even less likely to create large numbers of new factory jobs. American manufacturing output is at the highest level in history and employment has fallen because of large gains in efficiency, a trend that is unlikely to reverse.China could retaliate by imposing its own tariffs. China responded to the tire tariff, for example, by imposing a tariff on American chicken parts.The United States sold $116.2 billion in goods to China in 2015, including aircraft parts, automobiles and semiconductors \u2014 high-value industries in which workers earn high wages. Losing China\u2019s market could mean sacrificing better jobs for less desirable ones.Doug Oberhelman, chairman and chief executive of Caterpillar, described higher tariffs as \u201cvery dangerous\u201d in February. \u201cWe\u2019re 5 percent of the world population,\u201d said Mr. Oberhelman, who spoke in his capacity as president of the Business Roundtable, a pro-trade lobby. \u201cNinety-five percent of our potential customers are elsewhere. We\u2019ve got to learn and figure out how to deal with that.\u201dThe damage to international trade agreements could also have deep and enduring consequences.One of the central benefits of the current system is that it separates trade disputes from other kinds of conflict. The global effort to reduce tariffs after World War II \u201cwas dreamed up as a way to prevent world wars,\u201d said Mr. Howse, the N.Y.U. professor.\u201cThat should not be forgotten.\u201dMaggie Haberman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Populist Policies Let Brazil\u2019s Tomorrow Slip Away", "Date": "2016-05-03", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneNot too long ago, Brazilians might have been counted as the most optimistic people in the world. From 2008 to 2013, as the United States and Europe grappled with the aftermath of a crisis wrought by blind trust in unfettered finance, Brazil\u2019s income per person grew 12 percent after inflation. Wages soared. The poverty rate plummeted. Even income inequality narrowed.Brazil remained only a high-middle-income country, in the technospeak of the International Monetary Fund. But for the first time in forever, the eternal \u201ccountry of tomorrow,\u201d as Brazilians often ruefully described their nation, saw itself instead as a rampant member of the emerging cohort of BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) \u2014 maybe even closer than China to making the jump into the ranks of the world\u2019s richest nations.And then it didn\u2019t happen.Between 2015 and 2017, the Brazilian economy is expected to shrink 8 percent, in the I.M.F.\u2019s estimation. That is deeper than the contraction of the early 1980s, which began what in Brazil and much of Latin America is still known as the \u201clost decade.\u201dWhat gives?Mistaken hopes inspired by high commodity prices are common in Latin America. With China insatiably buying Brazilian iron and soybeans, it was hard for policy makers not to feel invincible as rock-bottom interest rates in the United States pushed a wave of money into Brazilian bonds.\u201cLula thought he was an economic genius,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 A. Scheinkman, a noted Brazilian economist now at Columbia University, about Brazil\u2019s previous president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who stepped down in January 2011.The commodity boom, however, did not a new economic paradigm make. The hubristic belief that it had led to critical policy mistakes.\u201cThe boom delayed other policies that were costly to implement: judicial reforms, tax reforms, education reforms, labor market reforms, opening up to foreign trade,\u201d said Alejandro Werner, who heads the Western Hemisphere department at the I.M.F.When Dilma Rousseff succeeded Mr. da Silva as president, she doubled down on the populist alternative. Markets are overrated, she concluded. The kind of politically painful but economically beneficial reforms the I.M.F. likes are pointless. Better to develop the economy by the hand of the state.Brazil\u2019s economy has long been notably closed to the world. Its average applied tariff of 10 percent, according to the World Trade Organization, is the highest among the BRICS. But that did not stop the Brazilian government from further increasing subsidies and protection for favored sectors, like the auto industry. The three federal development banks did so much subsidized lending that by last year they accounted for well over half of all lending in Brazil.There is nothing inherently wrong with government action to spur the economy. Yet the Brazilian government did not know when to stop. Often, interventions smacked more of political opportunism than ideological resolve. Increases in the minimum wage \u2014 a critical benchmark used to index wages, pensions and a host of prices \u2014 were extremely popular. So were caps on regulated prices for gasoline and electricity, which kept the inflation rate from rising way past its official target.\u201cIt was a classical mistake of political economy,\u201d said Rubens Ric\u00fapero, a Brazilian economist and diplomat who was minister of finance in the mid-1990s. \u201cThey wanted to stay in power.\u201dMonica de Bolle, a Brazilian economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, dates the populist shift to 2006, when President da Silva was hit with a vote-buying scandal known as \u201cmensal\u00e3o.\u201d\u201cAfter that he became much more populist,\u201d she said. \u201cHe needed support not to be ousted from office.\u201dEven without the scandals and mistakes, Brazil would be facing rocky times. China\u2019s cooling appetite for Brazil\u2019s commodities and the gradual tightening of monetary policy in the United States were bound to slow the economy. But what turned the downturn into a crisis was bad policy making. When the foreign outlook dimmed, Brazil\u2019s economy was strangled by fast-rising public debt fed by billions in loans gone bad to former national champions.Revelations of rampant corruption were hardly surprising, given the cozy relationship between corporate Brazil and a government dispensing contracts, subsidies, preferred loans and other protections.What is the rest of the world to learn from Brazil\u2019s troubles?\u201cLula walked back slowly to the old closed economic model,\u201d said Arm\u00ednio Fraga, who headed the central bank in the 1990s, during Brazil\u2019s fairly brief flirtation with opening up its economy. \u201cIt worked while commodities and financial conditions were doing well but became unsustainable when that was over.\u201dBrazil was not alone. Until the 1980s, governments all over Latin America flirted with similar policies of state control. More recently, Venezuela and Argentina spent much of the last 10 years increasing the government\u2019s hold on the economy.One important lesson is that the choices faced by governments in Latin America and developing nations around the world do not necessarily pit free markets against policies to combat poverty and foster social inclusion. Brazil\u2019s anti-poverty strategy started in the 1990s, well before its turn toward state control. And most of Brazil\u2019s enormous subsidies over the last few years went to large corporations, not the poor.\u201cBusinessmen all supported the interventions with the exchange rate and interest rates, the subsidized credit and the interventions in prices of electricity and gasoline,\u201d said Marcos Lisboa, who heads Insper, an educational and research institute in S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cThey didn\u2019t support opening the country to trade.\u201dNor do Brazil\u2019s misfortunes amount to a wholesale indictment of the Latin American left. Mr. Ric\u00fapero, the former finance minister, notes that Bolivia and Ecuador, run by left-leaning governments, exhibited more cautious economic management and avoided Brazil\u2019s fate.\u201cNot every government with a social inclination will necessarily do the same as Brazil,\u201d he said.Brazil\u2019s downfall offers a more complicated lesson: Development is hard. And if Brazil\u2019s rise and fall offer lessons about government\u2019s inherent limitations, the Great American Meltdown of 2008 similarly offers a cautionary tale about allowing markets to run wild.But there are other common-sense recommendations to come out of such experiences: Invest in human capital, manage commodity bonanzas with caution, recognize that openness to foreign competition is necessary to develop.As President Obama might put it, don\u2019t do stupid stuff. Easy, feel-good recipes \u2014 especially those found wanting in the past \u2014 will probably fail if you try them again. That goes for the United States, too. America\u2019s very own populist, Donald Trump \u2014 offering walls and tariff barriers to his aggrieved supporters \u2014 could learn something from the Brazilian experience. He probably won\u2019t.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Swipes at Trump, but Doesn\u2019t Name Him, in Speech at Rutgers", "Date": "2016-05-15", "News": "Supported byPresident Obama took several sharp swipes at Donald J. Trump on Sunday during a commencement address that could be the beginning of a forceful effort to help elect a Democratic successor as president.Addressing Rutgers University\u2019s class of 2016 at the school\u2019s 250th anniversary commencement, Mr. Obama never mentioned Mr. Trump by name. But his target was clear, and his assessments earned raucous cheers from the graduates.\u201cThe world is more interconnected than ever before, and it\u2019s becoming more connected every day,\u201d Mr. Obama told the graduates. \u201cBuilding walls won\u2019t change that.\u201dMr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has proposed building a wall between the United States and Mexico and forcing Mexico to pay for its potential multibillion dollar construction costs. Mr. Trump has also denounced much of the modern international trading and economic system, and he has proposed banning Muslim visitors and immigrants from the country, at least temporarily \u2014 all ideas Mr. Obama condemned on Sunday.But Mr. Obama is altering his stump speech in important ways to go after Mr. Trump. As his remaining time in office draws to less than a school year, Mr. Obama has alternated between mild and mock horror, pointed humor and a touch of disbelief in his attacks on the Republican front-runner.\u201cWe live in an age of global supply chains, and a lot of folks have legitimate concerns with the way globalization has progressed,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cBut the answer isn\u2019t to stop trading with other countries. In this global economy, that\u2019s not even possible.\u201dMr. Obama said that isolating and disparaging Muslims was not only a betrayal of American values but \u201cwould alienate the very communities at home and abroad who are our most important partners in combating violent extremism.\u201dWearing a crimson robe with black sashes and a purple doctoral hood that a fierce wind kept blowing off his shoulders, Mr. Obama told the graduates that the knowledge they had earned through years of studying was something they should insist political leaders value and possess themselves.\u201cFacts, evidence, reason, logic, an understanding of science \u2014 these are good things. These are qualities you want in people making policy,\u201d Mr. Obama said, adding later, \u201cIn politics and in life, ignorance is not a virtue.\u201dMr. Obama seemed to especially take pleasure in advocating the use of facts in politics while speaking to an academic audience. His point with such arguments is usually to press for action against climate change, one of the signature policies of his administration and one that nearly all climate scientists support.But while Mr. Obama mentioned climate change, he also used his points about facts and experience to take yet another swipe at an unnamed Mr. Trump.He noted that when people get sick, they want an experienced doctor to treat them; when they fly, they want experienced pilots.\u201cAnd yet in our public lives, we suddenly say, \u2018I don\u2019t want somebody who\u2019s done it before\u2019?\u201d he asked in derision.Mr. Trump has no experience as a politician, a quality that has been viewed as one of the most important reasons for his success as a presidential candidate.Mr. Obama came to Rutgers after students, faculty members and even relatives of students spent the past three years lobbying the White House for him to speak on this anniversary for the school.\u201cThe truth is, Rutgers, I came here because you asked. You are the first to launch a three-year campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cEmails, letters, tweets, YouTube videos. I even got three notes from the grandmother of your student body president,\u201d Mr. Obama said, drawing laughter. \u201cAnd I have to say that really sealed the deal. That was smart because I have a soft spot for grandmas.\u201dRutgers, one of the first nine government-chartered institutions in the American colonies, \u201ccould be the most diverse student body in America,\u201d he said. And he likened Rutgers\u2019 long history of success with that of the country as a whole.And while he celebrated that history, he made clear to the graduates that no period in history was as prosperous as this one.\u201cThe good old days weren\u2019t all that good,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cIn fact, by almost every measure, America is better and the world is better than it was 50 years ago or 30 years ago or even eight years ago.\u201dHe cited those accomplishments and many others, including declining rates of crime, teenage pregnancy and poverty, as well as improvements in life expectancy, the status of blacks and Latinos and clean energy.\u201cMarriage equality is the law of the land,\u201d he added, to robust cheers.As he often does in such speeches, Mr. Obama told the graduates that they needed to participate in the political process and be satisfied with incremental change. Democrats generally fare better than Republicans in high-turnout elections, and while young people overwhelmingly support Democrats, they rarely vote. So Mr. Obama and Michelle Obama, the first lady, always urge student audiences to show up at the polls on Election Day.\u201cBecause apathy has consequences,\u201d the president said.He said changes, even small ones, were worth fighting for.\u201cI always tell my daughters, \u2018Better is good,\u2019\u201d Mr. Obama said near the end of his speech, adding, \u201cDon\u2019t waste your time waiting.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Aspiring Novelist Who Became Obama\u2019s Foreign-Policy Guru", "Date": "2016-05-05", "News": "FeatureHow Ben Rhodes rewrote the rules of diplomacy for the digital age.Supported byEverything changed that day. But the way it changed Ben Rhodes\u2019s life is still unique, and perhaps not strictly believable, even as fiction. He was in the second year of the M.F.A. program at N.Y.U., writing short stories about losers in garden apartments and imagining that soon he would be published in literary magazines, acquire an agent and produce a novel by the time he turned 26. He saw the first tower go down, and after that he walked around for a while, until he ran into someone he knew, and they went back to her shared Williamsburg apartment and tried to find a television that worked, and when he came back outside, everyone was taking pictures of the towers in flames. He saw an Arab guy sobbing on the subway. \u201cThat image has always stayed with me,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause I think he knew more than we did about what was going to happen.\u201d Writing Frederick Barthelme knockoffs suddenly seemed like a waste of time.\u201cI immediately developed this idea that, you know, maybe I want to try to write about international affairs,\u201d he explained. \u201cIn retrospect, I had no idea what that meant.\u201d His mother\u2019s closest friend growing up ran the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, which then published Foreign Policy. He sent her a letter and included what would wind up being his only piece of published fiction, a short story that appeared in The Beloit Fiction Journal. It was titled \u201cThe Goldfish Smiles, You Smile Back.\u201d The story still haunts him, he says, because \u201cit foreshadowed my entire life.\u201d\u201cBlitzer!\u201d a man calls out. A small figure in a long navy cashmere overcoat turns around, in mock surprise.\u201cYou don\u2019t write, you don\u2019t call,\u201d Wolf Blitzer, the CNN anchorman, parries.Unnoticed by the reporters, Ben Rhodes walks through the room, a half-beat behind a woman in leopard-print heels. He is holding a phone to his ear, repeating his mantra: \u201cI\u2019m not important. You\u2019re important.\u201dThe Boy Wonder of the Obama White House is now 38. He heads downstairs to his windowless basement office, which is divided into two parts. In the front office, his assistant, Rumana Ahmed, and his deputy, Ned Price, are squeezed behind desks, which face a large television screen, from which CNN blares nonstop. Large pictures of Obama adorn the walls. Here is the president adjusting Rhodes\u2019s tie; presenting his darling baby daughter, Ella, with a flower; and smiling wide while playing with Ella on a giant rug that says \u201cE Pluribus Unum.\u201dAs the deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, Rhodes writes the president\u2019s speeches, plans his trips abroad and runs communications strategy across the White House, tasks that, taken individually, give little sense of the importance of his role. He is, according to the consensus of the two dozen current and former White House insiders I talked to, the single most influential voice shaping American foreign policy aside from Potus himself. The president and Rhodes communicate \u201cregularly, several times a day,\u201d according to Denis McDonough, Obama\u2019s chief of staff, who is known for captaining a tight ship. \u201cI see it throughout the day in person,\u201d he says, adding that he is sure that in addition to the two to three hours that Rhodes might spend with Obama daily, the two men communicate remotely throughout the day via email and phone calls. Rhodes strategized and ran the successful Iran-deal messaging campaign, helped negotiate the opening of American relations with Cuba after a hiatus of more than 50 years and has been a co-writer of all of Obama\u2019s major foreign-policy speeches. \u201cEvery day he does 12 jobs, and he does them better than the other people who have those jobs,\u201d Terry Szuplat, the longest-tenured member of the National Security Council speechwriting corps, told me. On the largest and smallest questions alike, the voice in which America speaks to the world is that of Ben Rhodes.Like Obama, Rhodes is a storyteller who uses a writer\u2019s tools to advance an agenda that is packaged as politics but is often quite personal. He is adept at constructing overarching plotlines with heroes and villains, their conflicts and motivations supported by flurries of carefully chosen adjectives, quotations and leaks from named and unnamed senior officials. He is the master shaper and retailer of Obama\u2019s foreign-policy narratives, at a time when the killer wave of social media has washed away the sand castles of the traditional press. His ability to navigate and shape this new environment makes him a more effective and powerful extension of the president\u2019s will than any number of policy advisers or diplomats or spies. His lack of conventional real-world experience of the kind that normally precedes responsibility for the fate of nations \u2014 like military or diplomatic service, or even a master\u2019s degree in international relations, rather than creative writing \u2014 is still startling.Part of what accounts for Rhodes\u2019s influence is his \u201cmind meld\u201d with the president. Nearly everyone I spoke to about Rhodes used the phrase \u201cmind meld\u201d verbatim, some with casual assurance and others in the hushed tones that are usually reserved for special insights. He doesn\u2019t think for the president, but he knows what the president is thinking, which is a source of tremendous power. One day, when Rhodes and I were sitting in his boiler-room office, he confessed, with a touch of bafflement, \u201cI don\u2019t know anymore where I begin and Obama ends.\u201dStanding in his front office before the State of the Union, Rhodes quickly does the political math on the breaking Iran story. \u201cNow they\u2019ll show scary pictures of people praying to the supreme leader,\u201d he predicts, looking at the screen. Three beats more, and his brain has spun a story line to stanch the bleeding. He turns to Price. \u201cWe\u2019re resolving this, because we have relationships,\u201d he says.Price turns to his computer and begins tapping away at the administration\u2019s well-cultivated network of officials, talking heads, columnists and newspaper reporters, web jockeys and outside advocates who can tweet at critics and tweak their stories backed up by quotations from \u201csenior White House officials\u201d and \u201cspokespeople.\u201d I watch the message bounce from Rhodes\u2019s brain to Price\u2019s keyboard to the three big briefing podiums \u2014 the White House, the State Department and the Pentagon \u2014 and across the Twitterverse, where it springs to life in dozens of insta-stories, which over the next five hours don formal dress for mainstream outlets. It\u2019s a tutorial in the making of a digital news microclimate \u2014 a storm that is easy to mistake these days for a fact of nature, but whose author is sitting next to me right now.Rhodes logs into his computer. \u201cIt\u2019s the middle of the [expletive] night in Iran,\u201d he grumbles. Price looks up from his keyboard to provide a messaging update: \u201cConsidering that they have 10 of our guys in custody, we\u2019re doing O.K.\u201dWith three hours to go until the president\u2019s address to Congress, Rhodes grabs a big Gatorade and starts combing through the text of the State of the Union address. I peek over his shoulder, to get a sense of the meta-narrative that will shape dozens of thumb-suckers in the days and weeks to follow. One sentence reads: \u201cBut as we focus on destroying ISIL, over-the-top claims that this is World War III just play into their hands.\u201d He retypes a word, then changes it back, before continuing with his edit. \u201cMasses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks, twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages \u2014 they pose an enormous danger to civilians; they have to be stopped. But they do not threaten our national existence.\u201dWatching Rhodes work, I remember that he is still, chiefly, a writer, who is using a new set of tools \u2014 along with the traditional arts of narrative and spin \u2014 to create stories of great consequence on the biggest page imaginable. The narratives he frames, the voices of senior officials, the columnists and reporters whose work he skillfully shapes and ventriloquizes, and even the president\u2019s own speeches and talking points, are the only dots of color in a much larger vision about who Americans are and where we are going that Rhodes and the president have been formulating together over the past seven years. When I asked Jon Favreau, Obama\u2019s lead speechwriter in the 2008 campaign, and a close friend of Rhodes\u2019s, whether he or Rhodes or the president had ever thought of their individual speeches and bits of policy making as part of some larger restructuring of the American narrative, he replied, \u201cWe saw that as our entire job.\u201dHaving recently spent time working in Hollywood, I realize during our conversations that the role Rhodes plays in the White House bears less resemblance to any specific character on Beltway-insider TV shows like \u201cThe West Wing\u201d or \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d than it does to the people who create those shows. And like most TV writers, Rhodes clearly prefers to imagine himself in the company of novelists.\u201cWhat novel is this that you are living in now and will exit from in eight months and be like, \u2018Oh, my God\u2019?\u201d I ask him.\u201cWho would be the author of this novel?\u201d he asks.\u201cThe one you are a character in now?\u201d\u201cDon DeLillo, I think,\u201d Rhodes answers. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you feel about Don DeLillo.\u201d\u201cI love Don DeLillo,\u201d I answer.\u201cYeah,\u201d Rhodes answers. \u201cThat\u2019s the only person I can think of who has confronted these questions of, you know, the individual who finds himself negotiating both vast currents of history and a very specific kind of power dynamics. That\u2019s his milieu. And that\u2019s what it\u2019s like to work in the U.S. foreign-policy apparatus in 2016.\u201dRhodes\u2019s mother and father are not interested in talking about Rhodes. Neither is his older brother, David, who is president of CBS News, an organization that recently revived the effort to declassify the contents of the redacted 28 pages of the Sept. 11 report on the eve of Obama\u2019s visit to Saudi Arabia, on which Rhodes, as usual, accompanied the president. The brothers are close, but they often go months without seeing each other. \u201cHe was like the kid who carried the briefcase to school,\u201d Ben says of his brother, who worked at Fox News and Bloomberg before moving to CBS. \u201cI actually didn\u2019t do that great in high school because I was drinking and smoking pot and hanging out in Central Park.\u201dRhodes\u2019s impassioned yet depressive vibe, which I feel in his stray remarks and in the strangeness of his decision to allow me to roam around the White House, stems in part from feeling overloaded; he wishes he had more time to think and write. His mother is Jewish from the Upper East Side, and worships John Updike, and reads The New Yorker. His father is a Texan lawyer who took his sons to St. Thomas Episcopal Church once a month, where Rhodes felt like the Jewish kid in church, the same way he felt like a \u201cJewish Christian\u201d at Passover Seders. His New York City prep-school-kid combination of vulnerability, brattiness and passionate hatred for phonies suggests an only slightly updated version of what Holden Caulfield might have been like if he grew up to work in the West Wing.Rhodes\u2019s windowless back office, which doesn\u2019t have a TV screen, is an oasis of late-night calm in a building devoted to the performance of power. The walls are painted a soft creamy color, which gives it the feel of an upscale hotel room with the drapes closed. He arrives here every morning between 8 and 9 from a modest two-bedroom apartment in a grad-student-type building in an unpretentious Washington neighborhood around the corner from his favorite post-collegiate bar. Before coming to work, he walks his 1-year-old daughter to day care. Then he drives to work in his Beamer, which appears to be the one grown-up luxury he and his wife, Ann Norris, who works in the State Department and longs to return to her childhood home of California, can afford. When his wife takes the car, he rides the bus, which offers him a touch of the anonymity he craves. His days at the White House start with the president\u2019s daily briefing, which usually includes the vice president, National Security Adviser Susan Rice, Deputy National Security Adviser Avril Haines and Homeland Security Adviser Lisa Monaco.The books on his shelves are a mix of DeLillo novels, history books, recondite tomes on Cuba and Burma and adventure-wonk stuff like Mark Mazzetti\u2019s \u201cThe Way of the Knife.\u201d C. S. Lewis makes an appearance here, alongside a volume of Lincoln speeches (Obama tells all his speechwriters to read Lincoln) and George Orwell\u2019s \u201cAll Art Is Propaganda.\u201d I have seen the same books on the shelves of plenty of Brooklyn apartments. Yet some large part of the recent history of America and its role in the world turns on the fact that the entirely familiar person sitting at the desk in front of me, who seems not unlike other weed-smokers I know who write Frederick Barthelme-type short stories, has achieved a \u201cmind meld\u201d with President Obama and used his skills to help execute a radical shift in American foreign policy.So I wonder: How did he get from there to here?The editor at Foreign Policy who read \u201cGoldfish,\u201d which Rhodes attached with his query letter, said that the young M.F.A. would be bored with fact-checking. Instead, he suggested that he apply for a job with Lee Hamilton, the onetime congressman from Indiana, who was looking for a speechwriter.\u201cI was surprised,\u201d Hamilton remembered. \u201cWhat the hell does a guy who wanted to write fiction come to me for?\u201d But he had always found writers useful, and Rhodes\u2019s writing sample was the best in the pile. So he hired him on at the Wilson Center, a nonpartisan think tank. Though Rhodes never said a word in meetings, Hamilton says, he had a keen understanding of what was going on and a talent for putting the positions of distinguished participants down on paper. \u201cI immediately understood that it\u2019s a very important quality for a staffer,\u201d Hamilton explained, \u201cthat he could come into a meeting and decide what was decided.\u201d I suggested that the phrase \u201cdecide what was decided\u201d is suggestive of the enormous power that might accrue to someone with Rhodes\u2019s gifts. Hamilton nodded. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he said.The notes go on and on. They have ideas with subsets of ideas and reactions to ideas indented beneath the original ideas. The handwriting is perfect. The representation of what happened in the meetings immaculate, like a mirror\u2019s reflection after it has been scrubbed clean. I have a reputation for my notes.Rhodes served as Hamilton\u2019s staff member on the 9/11 Commission, where he met Denis McDonough, another Hamilton prot\u00e9g\u00e9, who had gone on to work for Tom Daschle in the Senate. Rhodes then became the chief note-taker for the Iraq Study Group, the bipartisan commission that excoriated George Bush\u2019s war in Iraq. He accompanied Hamilton and his Republican counterpart on the group, former secretary of state and Bush family intimate James Baker, to their meetings with Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice, Stephen Hadley, David Petraeus and many others (Vice President Dick Cheney met with the group but didn\u2019t say a word). According to both Hamilton and Edward Djerejian, Baker\u2019s second on the I.S.G., Rhodes\u2019s opinions were helpful in shaping the group\u2019s conclusions \u2014 a scathing indictment of the policy makers responsible for invading Iraq. For Rhodes, who wrote much of the I.S.G. report, the Iraq war was proof, in black and white, not of the complexity of international affairs or the many perils attendant on political decision-making but of the fact that the decision-makers were morons.One result of this experience was that when Rhodes joined the Obama campaign in 2007, he arguably knew more about the Iraq war than the candidate himself, or any of his advisers. He had also developed a healthy contempt for the American foreign-policy establishment, including editors and reporters at The New York Times, The Washington Post, The New Yorker and elsewhere, who at first applauded the Iraq war and then sought to pin all the blame on Bush and his merry band of neocons when it quickly turned sour. If anything, that anger has grown fiercer during Rhodes\u2019s time in the White House. He referred to the American foreign-policy establishment as the Blob. According to Rhodes, the Blob includes Hillary Clinton, Robert Gates and other Iraq-war promoters from both parties who now whine incessantly about the collapse of the American security order in Europe and the Middle East.Boost thinks very highly of me. My notes are so impressive that they have taken on the form of ideas, he feels. I capture other people\u2019s words in a manner that not only organizes them, but inserts a clarity and purpose that was not present in the original idea. Connections are made between two opposing ideas that were not apparent in the meeting. I have gotten at not only the representation of things, but the way that the mind actually works.Jon Favreau, then the campaign\u2019s lead speechwriter, felt as if he could use a foreign-affairs expert who could write. \u201cForeign-policy advisers kept changing all the language that made Obama sound like he wasn\u2019t part of the Democratic foreign-policy establishment,\u201d he remembers. \u201cThe idea of someone with a masters in fiction who had also co-authored the Iraq Study Group and 9/11 Commission reports seemed perfect for a candidate who put so much emphasis on storytelling.\u201d The two young speechwriters quickly found themselves to be in sync. \u201cHe truly gives zero [expletive] about what most people in Washington think,\u201d Favreau says admiringly of Rhodes. \u201cI think he\u2019s always seen his time there as temporary and won\u2019t care if he\u2019s never again invited to a cocktail party, or asked to appear on \u2018Morning Joe,\u2019 or inducted into the Council on Foreign Relations hall of fame or whatever the hell they do there.\u201dI sit next to Boost in the meetings. The ideas fly like radio waves. I am silent in these meetings, taking notes.\u201cHe was easily underestimatable,\u201d Samantha Power recalls, of Rhodes\u2019s arrival on the Obama campaign in 2007. Herself a writer, whose history of America\u2019s responses to genocide, \u201cA Problem From Hell,\u201d won the Pulitzer Prize, Power went to work in Obama\u2019s Senate office in 2005. Power is now the American ambassador to the United Nations. Her attire suggests a disingenuous ambivalence about her role in government that appears to be common among her cohort in the Obama administration, with a cardigan made of thick, expensive-looking cashmere worn over a simple frock, along with silver spray-painted rock \u2019n\u2019 roll sneakers. See, I\u2019m sympatico, the sneakers proclaim.Early on, what struck her about Rhodes was how strategic he was. \u201cHe was leading quietly, initially, and mainly just through track changes, like what to accept and reject,\u201d she says. When I ask her where Rhodes\u2019s control over drafts of the candidate\u2019s speeches came from, she immediately answers, \u201cObama,\u201d but then qualifies her answer. \u201cBut it was Hobbesian,\u201d she adds. \u201cHe had the pen. And he understood intuitively that having the pen gave him that control.\u201d His judgment was superior to that of his rivals, and he refused to ever back down. \u201cHe was just defiant,\u201d she recalls. \u201cHe was like: \u2018No, I\u2019m not. That\u2019s bad. Obama wouldn\u2019t want that.\u2019\u2009\u201dObama relies on Rhodes for \u201can unvarnished take,\u201d in part, she says, because \u201cBen just has no poker face,\u201d and so it\u2019s easy to see when he is feeling uncomfortable. \u201cThe president will be like, \u2018Ben, something on your mind?\u2019 And then Ben will have this incredibly precise lay-down of why the previous half-hour has been an utter waste of time, because there\u2019s a structural flaw to the entire direction of the conversation.\u201dThe literary character that Rhodes most closely resembles, Power volunteers, is Holden Caulfield. \u201cHe hates the idea of being phony, and he\u2019s impetuous, and he has very strong views.\u201dIn Afghanistan the Taliban dynamites enormous statues of Buddha, the ancient material imploding and crumbling to the ground, small specks of men can be seen watching in the foreground. This is somewhere else. Far away.The job he was hired to do, namely to help the president of the United States communicate with the public, was changing in equally significant ways, thanks to the impact of digital technologies that people in Washington were just beginning to wrap their minds around. It is hard for many to absorb the true magnitude of the change in the news business \u2014 40 percent of newspaper-industry professionals have lost their jobs over the past decade \u2014 in part because readers can absorb all the news they want from social-media platforms like Facebook, which are valued in the tens and hundreds of billions of dollars and pay nothing for the \u201ccontent\u201d they provide to their readers. You have to have skin in the game \u2014 to be in the news business, or depend in a life-or-death way on its products \u2014 to understand the radical and qualitative ways in which words that appear in familiar typefaces have changed. Rhodes singled out a key example to me one day, laced with the brutal contempt that is a hallmark of his private utterances. \u201cAll these newspapers used to have foreign bureaus,\u201d he said. \u201cNow they don\u2019t. They call us to explain to them what\u2019s happening in Moscow and Cairo. Most of the outlets are reporting on world events from Washington. The average reporter we talk to is 27 years old, and their only reporting experience consists of being around political campaigns. That\u2019s a sea change. They literally know nothing.\u201dIn this environment, Rhodes has become adept at ventriloquizing many people at once. Ned Price, Rhodes\u2019s assistant, gave me a primer on how it\u2019s done. The easiest way for the White House to shape the news, he explained, is from the briefing podiums, each of which has its own dedicated press corps. \u201cBut then there are sort of these force multipliers,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe have our compadres, I will reach out to a couple people, and you know I wouldn\u2019t want to name them \u2014 \u201d\u201cI can name them,\u201d I said, ticking off a few names of prominent Washington reporters and columnists who often tweet in sync with White House messaging.Price laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll say, \u2018Hey, look, some people are spinning this narrative that this is a sign of American weakness,\u2019\u2009\u201d he continued, \u201cbut \u2014 \u201d\u201cIn fact it\u2019s a sign of strength!\u201d I said, chuckling.\u201cAnd I\u2019ll give them some color,\u201d Price continued, \u201cand the next thing I know, lots of these guys are in the dot-com publishing space, and have huge Twitter followings, and they\u2019ll be putting this message out on their own.\u201dThis is something different from old-fashioned spin, which tended to be an art best practiced in person. In a world where experienced reporters competed for scoops and where carrying water for the White House was a cause for shame, no matter which party was in power, it was much harder to sustain a \u201cnarrative\u201d over any serious period of time. Now the most effectively weaponized 140-character idea or quote will almost always carry the day, and it is very difficult for even good reporters to necessarily know where the spin is coming from or why.When I later visited Obama\u2019s former campaign mastermind David Axelrod in Chicago, I brought up the soft Orwellian vibe of an information space where old media structures and hierarchies have been erased by Silicon Valley billionaires who convinced the suckers that information was \u201cfree\u201d and everyone with access to Google was now a reporter. Axelrod, a former newspaperman, sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s not as easy as standing in front of a press conference and speaking to 70 million people like past presidents have been able to do,\u201d he said. The bully pulpit by and large doesn\u2019t exist anymore, he explained. \u201cSo more and more, over the last couple of years, there\u2019s been an investment in alternative means of communication: using digital more effectively, going to nontraditional sources, understanding where on each issue your constituencies are going to be found,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they\u2019ve approached these major foreign-policy challenges as campaign challenges, and they\u2019ve run campaigns, and those campaigns have been very sophisticated.\u201dIn the narrative that Rhodes shaped, the \u201cstory\u201d of the Iran deal began in 2013, when a \u201cmoderate\u201d faction inside the Iranian regime led by Hassan Rouhani beat regime \u201chard-liners\u201d in an election and then began to pursue a policy of \u201copenness,\u201d which included a newfound willingness to negotiate the dismantling of its illicit nuclear-weapons program. The president set out the timeline himself in his speech announcing the nuclear deal on July 14, 2015: \u201cToday, after two years of negotiations, the United States, together with our international partners, has achieved something that decades of animosity has not.\u201d While the president\u2019s statement was technically accurate \u2014 there had in fact been two years of formal negotiations leading up to the signing of the J.C.P.O.A. \u2014 it was also actively misleading, because the most meaningful part of the negotiations with Iran had begun in mid-2012, many months before Rouhani and the \u201cmoderate\u201d camp were chosen in an election among candidates handpicked by Iran\u2019s supreme leader, the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The idea that there was a new reality in Iran was politically useful to the Obama administration. By obtaining broad public currency for the thought that there was a significant split in the regime, and that the administration was reaching out to moderate-minded Iranians who wanted peaceful relations with their neighbors and with America, Obama was able to evade what might have otherwise been a divisive but clarifying debate over the actual policy choices that his administration was making. By eliminating the fuss about Iran\u2019s nuclear program, the administration hoped to eliminate a source of structural tension between the two countries, which would create the space for America to disentangle itself from its established system of alliances with countries like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Israel and Turkey. With one bold move, the administration would effectively begin the process of a large-scale disengagement from the Middle East.The nerve center for the selling of the Iran deal to Congress, which took place in a concentrated three-month period between July and September of last year, was located inside the White House, and is referred to by its former denizens as \u201cthe war room.\u201d Chad Kreikemeier, a Nebraskan who had worked in the White House Office of Legislative Affairs, helped run the team, which included three to six people from each of several agencies, he says, which were the State Department, Treasury, the American delegation to the United Nations (i.e., Samantha Power), \u201cat times D.O.D.\u201d (the Department of Defense) and also the Department of Energy and the National Security Council. Rhodes \u201cwas kind of like the quarterback,\u201d running the daily video conferences and coming up with lines of attack and parry. \u201cHe was extremely good about immediately getting to a phrase or a way of getting the message out that just made more sense,\u201d Kreikemeier remembers. Framing the deal as a choice between peace and war was Rhodes\u2019s go-to move \u2014 and proved to be a winning argument.The person whom Kreikemeier credits with running the digital side of the campaign was Tanya Somanader, 31, the director of digital response for the White House Office of Digital Strategy, who became known in the war room and on Twitter as @TheIranDeal. Early on, Rhodes asked her to create a rapid-response account that fact-checked everything related to the Iran deal. \u201cSo, we developed a plan that was like: The Iran deal is literally going to be the tip of everything that we stand up online,\u201d Somanader says. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to map it onto what we know about the different audiences we\u2019re dealing with: the public, pundits, experts, the right wing, Congress.\u201d By applying 21st-century data and networking tools to the white-glove world of foreign affairs, the White House was able to track what United States senators and the people who worked for them, and influenced them, were seeing online \u2014 and make sure that no potential negative comment passed without a tweet.As she explained how the process worked, I was struck by how na\u00efve the assumption of a \u201cstate of nature\u201d must seem in an information environment that is mediated less and less by experienced editors and reporters with any real prior knowledge of the subjects they write about. \u201cPeople construct their own sense of source and credibility now,\u201d she said. \u201cThey elect who they\u2019re going to believe.\u201d For those in need of more traditional-seeming forms of validation, handpicked Beltway insiders like Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic and Laura Rozen of Al-Monitor helped retail the administration\u2019s narrative. \u201cLaura Rozen was my RSS feed,\u201d Somanader offered. \u201cShe would just find everything and retweet it.\u201dRhodes\u2019s messaging campaign was so effective not simply because it was a perfectly planned and executed example of digital strategy, but also because he was personally involved in guiding the deal itself. In July 2012, Jake Sullivan, a close aide to Hillary Clinton, traveled to Muscat, Oman, for the first meeting with the Iranians, taking a message from the White House. \u201cIt was, \u2018We\u2019re prepared to open a direct channel to resolve the nuclear agreement if you are prepared to do the same thing and authorize it at the highest levels and engage in a serious discussion on these issues,\u2019\u2009\u201d Sullivan remembers. \u201cOnce that was agreed to, it was quickly decided that we resolve the nuclear agreement in two steps, the interim agreement and the final agreement.\u201d Subsequent meetings with the Iranians followed, during which he was joined by Deputy Secretary of State Bill Burns. \u201cBill and I had a huge amount of license to explore what the terms would look like, within the negotiating parameters,\u201d Sullivan says. \u201cWhat the precise trade-offs would be, between forms of sanctions relief and forms of restraints on their programs, that was left to us to feel out.\u201dThe fact that the president largely let his surrogates do the talking and the selling of the Iran deal \u2014 and even now, rarely talks about it in public \u2014 does not reflect his level of direct engagement. Sullivan and Burns spent hours before and after every session in Oman with the president and his closest advisers in the White House. When the president wasn\u2019t present, Rhodes always was. \u201cBen and I, in particular, the two of us, spent a lot of time thinking through all the angles,\u201d Sullivan says. \u201cWe spent three, four, five hours together in Washington talking things through before the meetings.\u201d In March 2013, a full three months before the elections that elevated Hassan Rouhani to the office of president, Sullivan and Burns finalized their proposal for an interim agreement, which became the basis for the J.C.P.O.A.The White House point person during the later stage of the negotiations was Rob Malley, a favored troubleshooter who is currently running negotiations that could keep the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in power. During the course of the Iran talks, Malley told me, he always kept in close contact with Rhodes. \u201cI would often just call him and say, \u2018Give me a reality check,\u2019\u2009\u201d Malley explained. \u201cHe could say, \u2018Here is where I think the president is, and here is where I think he will be.\u2019\u2009\u201d He continued, \u201cBen would try to anticipate: Does it make sense policywise? But then he would also ask himself: How do we sell it to Congress? How do we sell it to the public? What is it going to do to our narrative?\u201dMalley is a particularly keen observer of the changing art of political communication; his father, Simon Malley, who was born in Cairo, edited the politics magazine Afrique Asie and proudly provided a platform for Fidel Castro and Yasir Arafat, in the days when the leaders\u2019 words might take weeks to travel from Cuba or Cairo to Paris. \u201cThe Iran experience was the place where I saw firsthand how policy, politics and messaging all had to be brought together, and I think that Ben is really at the intersection of all three,\u201d Malley says. \u201cHe reflects and he shapes at the same time.\u201dAs Malley and representatives of the State Department, including Wendy Sherman and Secretary of State John Kerry, engaged in formal negotiations with the Iranians, to ratify details of a framework that had already been agreed upon, Rhodes\u2019s war room did its work on Capitol Hill and with reporters. In the spring of last year, legions of arms-control experts began popping up at think tanks and on social media, and then became key sources for hundreds of often-clueless reporters. \u201cWe created an echo chamber,\u201d he admitted, when I asked him to explain the onslaught of freshly minted experts cheerleading for the deal. \u201cThey were saying things that validated what we had given them to say.\u201dWhen I suggested that all this dark metafictional play seemed a bit removed from rational debate over America\u2019s future role in the world, Rhodes nodded. \u201cIn the absence of rational discourse, we are going to discourse the [expletive] out of this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had test drives to know who was going to be able to carry our message effectively, and how to use outside groups like Ploughshares, the Iran Project and whomever else. So we knew the tactics that worked.\u201d He is proud of the way he sold the Iran deal. \u201cWe drove them crazy,\u201d he said of the deal\u2019s opponents.Yet Rhodes bridled at the suggestion that there has been anything deceptive about the way that the agreement itself was sold. \u201cLook, with Iran, in a weird way, these are state-to-state issues. They\u2019re agreements between governments. Yes, I would prefer that it turns out that Rouhani and Zarif\u201d \u2014 Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran\u2019s foreign minister \u2014 \u201care real reformers who are going to be steering this country into the direction that I believe it can go in, because their public is educated and, in some respects, pro-American. But we are not betting on that.\u201dIn fact, Rhodes\u2019s passion seems to derive not from any investment in the technical specifics of sanctions or centrifuge arrays, or any particular optimism about the future course of Iranian politics and society. Those are matters for the negotiators and area specialists. Rather, it derived from his own sense of the urgency of radically reorienting American policy in the Middle East in order to make the prospect of American involvement in the region\u2019s future wars a lot less likely. When I asked whether the prospect of this same kind of far-reaching spin campaign being run by a different administration is something that scares him, he admitted that it does. \u201cI mean, I\u2019d prefer a sober, reasoned public debate, after which members of Congress reflect and take a vote,\u201d he said, shrugging. \u201cBut that\u2019s impossible.\u201dObama\u2019s particular revulsion against a certain kind of global power politics is a product, Rhodes suggests, of his having been raised in Southeast Asia. \u201cIndonesia was a place where your interaction at that time with power was very intimate, right?\u201d Rhodes asks. \u201cTens or hundreds of thousands of people had just been killed. Power was not some abstract thing,\u201d he muses. \u201cWhen we sit in Washington and debate foreign policy, it\u2019s like a Risk game, or it\u2019s all about us, or the human beings disappear from the decisions. But he lived in a place where he was surrounded by people who had either perpetrated those acts \u2014 and by the way, may not have felt great about that \u2014 or else knew someone who was a victim. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been an American president who had an experience like that at a young age of what power is.\u201dThe parts of Obama\u2019s foreign policy that disturb some of his friends on the left, like drone strikes, Rhodes says, are a result of Obama\u2019s particular kind of globalism, which understands the hard and at times absolute necessity of killing. Yet, at the same time, they are also ways of avoiding more deadly uses of force \u2014 a kind of low-body-count spin move.He leans back and opens a drawer in the file cabinet behind his desk, and removes a folder. \u201cI was going to show you something,\u201d he says, removing a sheaf of yellow legal paper covered in longhand. \u201cJust to confirm for you that he really is a writer.\u201d He shows me the president\u2019s copy of his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech, a revision of an original draft by Favreau and Rhodes whose defining tension was accepting a prize awarded before he had actually accomplished anything. In his longhand notes, Obama relocated the speech\u2019s tension in the fact that he was accepting a peace prize a week after ordering 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan. King and Gandhi were the author\u2019s heroes, yet he couldn\u2019t act as they did, because he runs a state. The reason that the author had to exercise power was because not everyone in the world is rational.We sit for a while, and I examine the president\u2019s thoughts unfolding on the page, and the lawyerly, abstract nature of his writing process. \u201cMoral imagination, spheres of identity, but also move beyond cheap lazy pronouncements,\u201d one note reads. Here was the new American self \u2014 rational, moral, not self-indulgent. No longer one thing but multiple overlapping spheres or circles. Who is described here? As usual, the author is describing himself.Valerie Jarrett has been called the president\u2019s work wife and is the only member of the West Wing staff who knew Obama before he began contemplating a run for the presidency. What I want to understand better, I tell her, are the swirls of the president\u2019s emotional fingerprint, which I saw in the longhand draft of his Nobel speech. We talk for a while about being American and at the same time being from somewhere else, and the split-screen experience of reality that experience allows. Jarrett was born in Iran and spent her early childhood there.\u201cWas it a point of connection between you and the president that you had each spent some substantial part of your childhoods living in another country?\u201d I ask. Her face lights up.\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she answers. The question is important to her. \u201cThe first conversation we had over dinner, when we first met, was about what it was like for both of us to live in countries that were predominantly Muslim countries at formative parts of our childhood and the perspective it gave us about the United States and how uniquely excellent it is,\u201d she says. \u201cWe talked about what it was like to be children, and how we played with children who had totally different backgrounds than our own but you would find something in common.\u201d She recalls her very first dinner together with the new fianc\u00e9 of her prot\u00e9g\u00e9e Michelle Robinson. \u201cI remember him asking me questions that I felt like no one else has ever asked me before,\u201d she says, \u201cand he asked me from a perspective of someone who knew the same experience that I had. So it felt really good. I was like, \u2018Oh, finally someone who gets it.\u2019\u2009\u201d\u201cHe is a brilliant guy, but he has a real problem with what I call the assignment of bad faith,\u201d one former senior official told me of the president. \u201cHe regards everyone on the other side at this point as being a bunch of bloodthirsty know-nothings from a different era who play by the old book. He hears arguments like, \u2018We should be punching Iran in the nose on its shipments of arms, and do it publicly,\u2019 or \u2018We should sanction the crap out of them for their ballistic-missile test and tell them that if they do it again we\u2019re going to do this or we\u2019re going to do that,\u2019 and he hears Dick Cheney in those arguments.\u201dAnother official I spoke to put the same point more succinctly: \u201cClearly the world has disappointed him.\u201d When I asked whether he believed that the Oval Office debate over Syria policy in 2012 \u2014 resulting in a decision not to support the uprising against Assad in any meaningful way \u2014 had been an honest and open one, he said that he had believed that it was, but has since changed his mind. \u201cInstead of adjusting his policies to the reality, and adjusting his perception of reality to the changing realities on the ground, the conclusions he draws are exactly the same, no matter what the costs have been to our strategic interests,\u201d he says. \u201cIn an odd way, he reminds me of Bush.\u201d The comparison is a startling one \u2014 and yet, questions of tone aside, it is uncomfortably easy to see the similarities between the two men, American presidents who projected their own ideas of the good onto an indifferent world.One of the few charter members of the Blob willing to speak on the record is Leon Panetta, who was Obama\u2019s head of the C.I.A. and secretary of defense and also enough of a product of a different culture to give honest answers to what he understands to be questions of consequence. At his institute at the old Fort Ord in Seaside, Calif., where, in the days before he wore Mr. Rogers sweaters, he served as a young Army intelligence officer, I ask him about a crucial component of the administration\u2019s public narrative on Iran: whether it was ever a salient feature of the C.I.A.\u2019s analysis when he ran the agency that the Iranian regime was meaningfully divided between \u201chard-line\u201d and \u201cmoderate\u201d camps.\u201cNo,\u201d Panetta answers. \u201cThere was not much question that the Quds Force and the supreme leader ran that country with a strong arm, and there was not much question that this kind of opposing view could somehow gain any traction.\u201dI ask Panetta whether, as head of the C.I.A., or later on, as secretary of defense, he ever saw the letters that Obama covertly sent to Khamenei, in 2009 and in 2012, which were only reported on by the press weeks later.\u201cNo,\u201d he answers, before saying he would \u201clike to believe\u201d that Tom Donilon, national security adviser since 2010, and Hillary Clinton, then secretary of state, had a chance to work on the offer they presented.As secretary of defense, he tells me, one of his most important jobs was keeping Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his defense minister, Ehud Barak, from launching a pre-emptive attack on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities. \u201cThey were both interested in the answer to the question, \u2018Is the president serious?\u2019\u2009\u201d Panetta recalls. \u201cAnd you know my view, talking with the president, was: If brought to the point where we had evidence that they\u2019re developing an atomic weapon, I think the president is serious that he is not going to allow that to happen.\u201dPanetta stops.\u201cBut would you make that same assessment now?\u201d I ask him.\u201cWould I make that same assessment now?\u201d he asks. \u201cProbably not.\u201dHe understands the president\u2019s pivot toward Iran as the logical result of a deeply held premise about the negative effects of use of American military force on a scale much larger than drone strikes or Special Forces raids. \u201cI think the whole legacy that he was working on was, \u2018I\u2019m the guy who\u2019s going to bring these wars to an end, and the last goddamn thing I need is to start another war,\u2019\u2009\u201d he explains of Obama. \u201cIf you ratchet up sanctions, it could cause a war. If you start opposing their interest in Syria, well, that could start a war, too.\u201dIn Panetta\u2019s telling, his own experience at the Pentagon under Obama sometimes resembled being installed in the driver\u2019s seat of a car and finding that the steering wheel and brakes had been disconnected from the engine. Obama and his aides used political elders like him, Robert Gates and Hillary Clinton as cover to end the Iraq war, and then decided to steer their own course, he suggests. While Panetta pointedly never mentions Rhodes\u2019s name, it is clear whom he is talking about.\u201cThere were staff people who put themselves in a position where they kind of assumed where the president\u2019s head was on a particular issue, and they thought their job was not to go through this open process of having people present all these different options, but to try to force the process to where they thought the president wanted to be,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019d say, \u2018Well, this is where we want you to come out.\u2019 And I\u2019d say \u2018[expletive], that\u2019s not the way it works. We\u2019ll present a plan, and then the president can make a decision.\u2019 I mean, Jesus Christ, it is the president of the United States, you\u2019re making some big decisions here, he ought to be entitled to hear all of those viewpoints and not to be driven down a certain path.\u201dBut that can\u2019t be true, I tell Panetta, because the aides he is talking about had no independent power aside from the authority that the president himself gave them.\u201cWell, that\u2019s a good question,\u201d Panetta allows. \u201cHe\u2019s a smart guy, he\u2019s not dumb.\u201d It\u2019s all part of the Washington blame game. Just as Panetta can blame young aides in order to avoid blaming the president for his actual choices, the president used his aides to tell Panetta to take a hike. Perhaps the president and his aides were continually unable to predict the consequences of their actions in Syria, and made mistake after mistake, while imagining that it was going to come out right the next time. \u201cAnother read, which isn\u2019t necessarily opposed to that,\u201d I continue, \u201cis that their actual picture is entirely coherent. But if they put it in blunt, unnuanced terms \u2014 \u201dPanetta completes my sentence: \u201c \u2014 they\u2019d get the [expletive] kicked out of them.\u201d He looks at me curiously. \u201cLet me ask you something,\u201d he says. \u201cDid you present this theory to Ben Rhodes?\u201dThere is something dangerously na\u00efve about this kind of talk, in which words like \u201cbalance,\u201d \u201cstakeholders\u201d and \u201cinterests\u201d are endlessly reshuffled like word tiles in a magnetic-poetry set, with little regard for the immutable contingencies that shaped America\u2019s role in the world. But that\u2019s hardly fair. Ben Rhodes wanted to do right, and maybe, when the arc of history lands, it will turn out that he did. At least, he tried. Something scared him, and made him feel as if the grown-ups in Washington didn\u2019t know what they were talking about, and it\u2019s hard to argue that he was wrong.What has interested me most about watching him and his cohort in the White House over the past seven years, I tell him, is the evolution of their ability to get comfortable with tragedy. I am thinking specifically about Syria, I add, where more than 450,000 people have been slaughtered.\u201cYeah, I admit very much to that reality,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a numbing element to Syria in particular. But I will tell you this,\u201d he continues. \u201cI profoundly do not believe that the United States could make things better in Syria by being there. And we have an evidentiary record of what happens when we\u2019re there \u2014 nearly a decade in Iraq.\u201dIraq is his one-word answer to any and all criticism. I was against the Iraq war from the beginning, I tell Rhodes, so I understand why he perpetually returns to it. I also understand why Obama pulled the plug on America\u2019s engagement with the Middle East, I say, but it was also true as a result that more people are dying there on his watch than died during the Bush presidency, even if very few of them are Americans. What I don\u2019t understand is why, if America is getting out of the Middle East, we are apparently spending so much time and energy trying to strong-arm Syrian rebels into surrendering to the dictator who murdered their families, or why it is so important for Iran to maintain its supply lines to Hezbollah. He mutters something about John Kerry, and then goes off the record, to suggest, in effect, that the world of the Sunni Arabs that the American establishment built has collapsed. The buck stops with the establishment, not with Obama, who was left to clean up their mess.It is clearly time for me to go. Rhodes walks me out into the sunlight of the West Wing parking lot, where we are treated to the sight of the aged Henry Kissinger, who has come to pay a visit. I ask Rhodes if he has ever met the famous diplomat before, and he tells me about the time they were seated together at a state dinner for the president of China. It was an interesting encounter to imagine, between Kissinger, who made peace with Mao\u2019s China while bombing Laos to bits, and Rhodes, who helped effect a similar diplomatic volte-face with Iran but kept the United States out of a civil war in Syria, which has caused more than four million people to become refugees. I ask Rhodes how it felt being seated next to the embodiment of American realpolitik. \u201cIt was surreal,\u201d he says, looking off into the middle distance. \u201cI told him I was going to Laos,\u201d he continues. \u201cHe got a weird look in his eye.\u201dThere is nothing snarky about his delivery. Rhodes just was bothered by seeing legless kids and unexploded cluster bombs in the jungle. He is not Henry Kissinger, or so his logic runs, even as the underlying realist suspicion \u2014 or contempt \u2014 for the idea of America as a moral actor is eerily similar. He is torn. As the president himself once asked, how are we supposed to weigh the tens of thousands who have died in Syria against the tens of thousands who have died in Congo? What power means is that the choice is yours, no matter who is telling the story.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump vs. the Disappearing Tie", "Date": "2016-05-11", "News": "Supported byUnbuttonedDonald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, is a political outlier not only when it comes to immigration policy, Twitter and marital history, but also when it comes to image.This isn\u2019t, of course, a coincidence. But it is notable. I am not speaking here of his much discussed hair, or even his somewhat florid skin color. I am speaking of his ties.But, rather, because of the sheer fact that he actually wears a tie. Almost all the time. If in the early days of his campaign \u2014 while attending, say, the Iowa State Fair \u2014 Mr. Trump occasionally lost the neckwear, those days seem increasingly rare.The pretty much constant presence of the tie has served to highlight another, less discussed but no less pointed gulf between the candidate and those he would call peers: For many politicians, the tie is no longer considered a necessary part of the uniform.As it happens, neither did Mr. Xi, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Secretary of State John Kerry, Secretary of the Treasury Jacob J. Lew or Max Baucus, the ambassador to China. Nor did Jeb Bush when he announced his candidacy for president.And this is not simply an American development. On Saturday, Sadiq Khan took his oath of office as the new mayor of London in Southwark Cathedral \u2014 in a navy suit, white shirt and no tie. The previous week, he and his opponent, Zac Goldsmith, were each pictured on the cover of The London Evening Standard going to vote \u2014 in blue suits, white shirts and no ties. In an often contentious campaign, it seemed one of the few tactics both men agreed on. Indeed, the campaign itself was labeled by various Britons as \u201cthe most informal in memory.\u201dIf the decision on what tie to wear is so complicated, imagine the conversation about not wearing one at all. Such choices are not made by accident, or without an agenda.Call it Phase 3 of political dress evolution.Phase 1 was John F. Kennedy going hatless for his inaugural address in 1961, signaling to all watchers that a new, breezier generation was in charge. Phase 2 was the lose-the-jacket, roll-up-your-sleeves look, adopted by politicians at the end of the 20th century in multiple in-the-office photo ops, the better to demonstrate their work ethic. And now we are here.Ties have not disappeared from the political arena, of course. The rules of the House of Representatives demand that men wear a coat and tie on the floor when Congress is in session. (Former Speaker John Boehner was known for rebuking his colleagues if he thought they were showing disrespect to the institution by dressing too casually.) Ditto the Senate. President Obama often wears a tie; so does Mr. Cameron.World leaders in other hemispheres, of course, have traditionally had a different kind of uniform, one that can involve cultural, often indigenous, garment tropes.But in the West, there is no question that the tie has become a variable in the political calculation, instead of a constant. Though it is easy to chalk it up to generational change, a more accurate interpretation probably has to do with ideology, opportunism and spin-doctoring. After all, this is a time when social media has meant that the optics of a message \u2014 or how it is delivered \u2014 are increasingly important. And ubiquitous.As it happens, Stewart Pearson was inspired by Mr. Hilton, who was widely credited with persuading Mr. Cameron to ditch his tie, the better to sway voters to \u201ctake another look at the Conservative party,\u201d as Mr. Hilton said in a phone call from California, where he lives now. It wasn\u2019t the same old, same old \u2014 at least when it came to wardrobe. (You have to start somewhere.)The decision to play hide-and-seek with the tie is \u201ca reflection of the current cultural environment, and an effort to seem like a part of that,\u201d Mr. Ratcliff, the consultant, said, adding: \u201cThe leaders are just following the voters. Thank God they haven\u2019t all started wearing black turtlenecks like one unnamed entrepreneur, though it will come to that eventually.\u201dThe Steve Jobs allusion is a reflection of the new economic power structure, one that celebrates the technical entrepreneurial class and the shadow banking sector, both of whose casual style has had a creeping influence on professional dress code, redefining what future success looks like in the popular imagination.Thus the tie divide, like many others in this particular election, gets ever wider.The Unbuttoned column last Thursday, about politicians who dress more informally at official events, referred imprecisely to John F. Kennedy\u2019s inaugural attire in 1961. While the president was hatless for his inaugural address, he wore a top hat to the ceremony.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Child Care Gap in the R\u00e9sum\u00e9: Whether to Explain or Not", "Date": "2016-05-19", "News": "Supported byWhen Brooke Bleyl started job hunting after taking 10 years off to care for her children, her interviews did not go well.\u201cThey even said they typically don\u2019t hire people with such a gap,\u201d said Ms. Bleyl, who lives outside Cleveland and has three children, ages 7, 10 and 12.Ms. Bleyl, who worked as an employment recruiter before taking time off, said she tried to fill in gaps on her r\u00e9sum\u00e9, including online selling to earn extra money. \u201cBut when you see eBay on someone\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9, you know that\u2019s a stay-at-home job,\u201d she said, \u201cand that you\u2019re just selling stuff out of your basement.\u201dAfter receiving \u201crejection after rejection after rejection,\u201d Ms. Bleyl said, \u201cI was very defeated.\u201d She eventually found a job as an account manager at a staffing service, but only with the help of a personal connection.For women hoping to return to the workplace after caring for their children, the advice is often \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell.\u201d Many women who described themselves as stay-at-home mothers can attest to receiving denigrating nods and hasty rebuffs. Researchers have repeatedly found ample evidence of discrimination against mothers in the hiring process and the workplace.But, Professor Hersch said, \u201cwomen who conceal personal information dramatically lower their hiring prospects.\u201dMs. Bleyl, despite her own experience, shares that view. \u201cIt\u2019s better to be upfront, because it\u2019s who you are,\u201d she said. \u201cI was so hungry to get in there and work, work, work.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t apologize for it,\u201d Ms. Cohen said. \u201cSay, \u2018Yes, I took a career break for child care reasons, and now I can\u2019t wait to get back to work.\u2019\u201dNot everybody will be open to such an approach. But many will.\u201cI think it comes down to the hiring manager,\u201d Ms. Cohen said. \u201cIf the individual has someone in their own personal orbit who has taken a career break, they are much more likely to be interested in the caliber and potential of that population than someone who has not had the experience.\u201dPlaying up volunteer and freelance work is important, she said, but it\u2019s a mistake to emphasize \u201cmom skills\u201d that are required for managing family life. The interviewer could be doing all that and working as well.Some experts were skeptical of the experiment Professor Hersch and her co-author, Jennifer Bennett Shinall, an assistant law professor at Vanderbilt, conducted for their study. They said it was too far removed from the actual job-hunting experience.Instead, they asked more than 3,000 people recruited online to act as potential employers and choose one of two candidates with similar experience.One applicant provided an explanation for a 10-year gap in her job history \u2014 such as taking time off to raise children and then going through a divorce \u2014 while the other provided no explanation at all. Those who revealed the personal information were 30 to 40 percent more likely to be chosen than those without.\u201cThe number of people who preferred the woman who explained her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 gap was staggering,\u201d Professor Hersch said. \u201cI was shocked.\u201dThe commission, for example, warns employers, \u201cQuestions about marital status and number and ages of children are frequently used to discriminate against women and may violate Title VII if used to deny or limit employment opportunities.\u201dProfessor Hersch says that more neutral language that invites employers to broach the issue of family with all candidates \u2014 both men and women \u2014 would be preferable.A lot of the interview process is about ensuring a good fit, she said, but now there is \u201can environment where you\u2019re dancing around the elephant in the room.\u201dOfer Sharone, a sociologist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, who researches career transitions and hiring, disagrees. He said that changing the E.E.O.C. guidelines would be disastrous.Marriage and children tend to hurt women much more than men in the workplace, he said, and Professor Hersch\u2019s and Professor Shinall\u2019s recommendation \u201cwould greatly exacerbate that discrimination.\u201dEmployers often wrongly assume that mothers will not be able to commit to their jobs as much if they\u2019re committed to their families. Saying a candidate is the wrong fit can be code for discrimination, Professor Sharone said.Reducing the choice to one woman who explains a gap and another who doesn\u2019t, he said, misses the more likely reality: that both would probably be screened out before they got to the interview stage. Employers are looking to filter through a huge number of applications in the quickest way possible. \u201cIf there\u2019s a gap,\u201d Professor Sharone said recruiters had consistently told him, they are \u201cgoing to go with someone without a gap.\u201dProfessor Sharone and other researchers did agree that if a candidate made it to the interview stage, then explaining a gap was better than leaving it to the employers\u2019 imagination.When Stephanie Bond decided to re-enter the work force after taking off a couple of years to care for her two sons in 2012, she ended up getting hired by a recruiter she had contacted. \u201cI said I was a road warrior and took the opportunity to reconnect with my family,\u201d said Ms. Bond, who was also able to list consulting work on her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to cover any gap.During the interview, she said, \u201cI was very upfront about the flexibility I needed to have,\u201d which included working from home at times.Her own experience as a hiring manager has taught her what to look for in candidates with a career gap. But for some employers, she said, a gap is \u201ca complete red flag and you wouldn\u2019t get an opportunity to explain.\u201dFollow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "I.M.F. Takes Firmer Stand Favoring Relief for Greek Debt", "Date": "2016-05-17", "News": "Supported byBRUSSELS \u2014 The International Monetary Fund is increasing demands for Greek debt relief, setting up another potential standoff with creditors over the country\u2019s bailout, and threatening to create more political and economic uncertainty at an already tumultuous time for Europe.This I.M.F.\u2019s position opens the next act in the long-running Greek debt crisis, casting the fund against Germany and many of the other eurozone creditors.The fund is playing the role of the financial police, adamant that Greece will never return to growth if its debt burden is not sustainable. And Germany is the political pragmatist, leaning on Greece to stick with its austerity commitments lest it set a bad precedent for future bailouts and provoke unrest at home.The tenor of the debate, while echoing the recent rhetoric, has changed in this latest run. The I.M.F. is now taking a firmer stand ahead of a meeting of eurozone finance ministers next week, by outlining specific demands on the cost and the timing of the debt payments, according to three people who spoke on condition of anonymity.Whether they represent the fund\u2019s absolute position or a starting point for negotiations, the demands leave Germany in a difficult spot.If Germany gives too much, Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s government will face pressure from the political far right for forcing taxpayers to bear an even bigger burden of Greece\u2019s past profligacy. If it gives too little, the government might not receive the support of the I.M.F. for the bailout, which many German lawmakers have made a condition of further support for Greece. Those lawmakers see the I.M.F. as a guarantor of fiscal rigor.Unless the two sides find common ground \u2014 or agree to further delay the I.M.F.\u2019s participation in the latest bailout \u2014 the situation could soon come to a head. Greece needs the next disbursement of bailout money to make billions of dollars of debt payments through July. And the stakes are even higher now, as the region grapples with a renewed wave of terrorism, a migrant crisis and the uncertainty created by a vote in Britain over whether to leave the European Union.The I.M.F. publicly sounded the alarms on Greece\u2019s debt load last summer, as creditors developed a plan for the bailout of 86 billion euros ($97 billion), the country\u2019s third lifeline since the crisis began seven years ago. Without debt relief, the fund said, it would not participate in the latest rescue. To the fund, Greece\u2019s debt, about 300 billion euros ($340 billion), is simply unsustainable.As the economic and political challenges intensify, the I.M.F. is staking out more specific turf.The restructuring plan will be a tough sell. There is a sense among the eurozone creditors that the I.M.F. is being overly pessimistic about Greece\u2019s outlook, to help drum up support for debt relief. While European officials have been playing up signs that Greece is bottoming out, the I.M.F. has been more skeptical about the country\u2019s potential to raise revenue, shore up its budget and overhaul its economy.European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.There is a wide gap on the economic picture. Europeans estimate that Greece will hit a primary surplus \u2014 a budget in the black, before debt repayments \u2014 of 3.5 percent by 2018. The fund figures it would be closer to 1.5 percent at that point.\u201cThere is a very strong belief in Europe that the I.M.F. is essentially cooking the numbers by being overly pessimistic about political and economic developments in Greece in order to strong-arm Northern Europe into providing more generous debt relief,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, the Europe director for the Eurasia Group.Germany, and the rest of Europe, cannot afford to let Greece\u2019s economic crisis implode right now. As one of the main entry points for asylum seekers, Greece is an important piece of Europe\u2019s efforts to manage the influx of migrants, so the country\u2019s stability is especially crucial.Tens of thousands of migrants have become stranded in Greece, their plans to travel farther north blocked by border shutdowns throughout the Balkans. That already has forced Athens to ask for emergency financing and supplies, including tents, blankets, sleeping bags and ambulances. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has frequently asserted that Greece is struggling with the burden of the migration crisis at the same time that it is putting austerity measures in place.Publicly, Germany has stayed away from linking the bailout to the migrant crisis even as Ms. Merkel\u2019s leadership has come under threat from a surge in popularity for the Alternative for Germany, a right-wing populist party that has opposed her open-door refugee policies.Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Germany\u2019s finance minister, has said he sees \u201cno argument\u201d for acceding to the I.M.F.\u2019s demands.But privately, Germany and the European creditors appear to be open to negotiation, given the current environment. When eurozone finance ministers discussed the bailout terms last week, they formally debated, for the first time, ways to ease Greece\u2019s giant debt burden.While they have ruled out cutting the value of Greece\u2019s debt, more palatable measures like lower interest rates and longer repayment periods are on the table. In that way, they don\u2019t look that far apart from the I.M.F., even if they don\u2019t agree on the specifics and differ sharply on Greece\u2019s outlook.Eurozone officials are also trying to provide confidence to the I.M.F. that Greece won\u2019t go fiscally off course. Last week, the finance ministers agreed to a mechanism that is supposed to kick into effect with additional austerity measures if Greece doesn\u2019t meet its fiscal targets from now until 2018.Greek lawmakers are expected to vote on Sunday on that mechanism, along with another set of austerity measures. They are widely expected to pass.But, as ever in the seemingly unending crisis in Greece, much is likely to be left unresolved.\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is another muddling through by the creditors, and that means the I.M.F.\u2019s future role in the program and the related question of debt relief aren\u2019t going to be settled any time soon \u2014 and certainly not by next week,\u201d said Carsten Nickel, the deputy director of research at Teneo Intelligence, a political risk consulting firm.Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about the International Monetary Fund\u2019s push for debt relief for Greece misstated the dollar equivalent of 300 billion euros, the nation\u2019s current debt. It is $340 billion, not $340 million.Niki Kitsantonis contributed reporting from Athens.Advertisement"}

Ren\u00c3\u00a9e Soto is expected to continue consulting for Valeant, the pharmaceuticals company. Other less senior employees have quit to join Mr. Gasthalter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new company. Under the proposed agreement, Golden Gate would value Sard Verbinnen at about $150 million. Golden Gate has agreed to invest up to $50 million more. The investment would allow the company to expand, potentially opening new offices in Washington, Hong Kong and Houston. The move would affect asset managers, hedge funds and insurance companies that do business regularly with banks through contracts known as qualified financial contracts.  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "It\u2019s a Tough Job Market for the Young Without College Degrees", "Date": "2016-05-10", "News": "Supported byFor seniors graduating from the University of Michigan this month, employers have been lining up since the fall to offer interviews and boast of their companies\u2019 benefits. Recruiters would ask when their competitors were coming, said Geni Harclerode, the university\u2019s assistant director of employer development, and then they\u2019d say: \u201cWell, we want to come the week before.\u201d\u201cThis has been one of our largest seasons of hiring,\u201d she said. \u201cThe job market has been very good.\u201d\u201cThat is something I don\u2019t have,\u201d said Mr. Brown, who says he cannot afford to go to college now. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest struggle I\u2019ve had.\u201dAnd for young high school graduates, the unemployment rate is disturbingly high: 17.8 percent. Add in those who are underemployed, either because they would like a full-time job but can only find part-time work, or they are so discouraged that they\u2019ve given up actively searching, and the share jumps to more than 33 percent.Younger workers have always had a tougher time finding a job than their older, more experienced counterparts. Even so, the economic recovery has progressed more slowly for young high school graduates than for those coming out of college.\u201cIt\u2019s improved since the recession, but it\u2019s still pretty poor,\u201d said Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, who noted the average hourly wage for high school graduates had declined since 2000 despite increases in the minimum wage in some places.Ms. Gould is part of a growing chorus of economists, employers and educators who argue more effort needs to be put into improving job prospects for people without college degrees.\u201cWithout question we have failed to pay attention to and invest in opportunities for young people who are not on a path to go to four years of college,\u201d said Chauncy Lennon, the head of work force initiatives at JPMorgan Chase, which has started a $75 million program to design and deliver career-focused education in high schools and community colleges.For high school students, a four-year college education is frequently held out as the only viable option, precisely because job opportunities and wages are so much better upon graduation. But many who sign up never finish. \u201cThe most common reason they fail to complete is that they need to start earning a living to support their families,\u201d Mr. Lennon said.Vocational, career and technical high schools have often been stigmatized as a last resort for underachievers. At the same time, educators and administrators in some places have been criticized for steering minority students toward them in lieu of academic programs.The initiative sponsored by Chase is aimed at repairing that reputation. Although some traditional middle-skills opportunities for construction and clerical workers are shrinking, Mr. Lennon said, others are growing. In health care, for instance, radiology and phlebotomy technicians are needed; in advanced manufacturing and aviation, mechanical maintenance workers are in demand.He added that vocational schools should no longer be thought of as dead ends, since they can serve as steppingstones to associate degrees at community colleges or to enrollment at four-year institutions.\u201cI went into vocational school with my heart set on the automotive program, but I fell in love with electrical and saw a bigger future for myself,\u201d Mr. Cardoso, 17, said.He is also applying for a coveted spot as an apprentice with the local electrical union, where the starting pay is $18.25 an hour. As an apprentice, he could work while training to become a journeyman, a position with an hourly wage of $28. Most of Mr. Cardoso\u2019s classmates also have jobs waiting for them, he said.\u201cThey\u2019re looking for jobs,\u201d Dr. DeLuca said of the youths she interviewed. \u201cThey want a quick launch.\u201dStill, low wages combined with rising housing costs make it tough to get ahead. \u201cThey\u2019re juggling a job at Potbelly and a security job and working 60 hours a week and it\u2019s still not enough,\u201d she said.\u201cThe size of that population was bigger than I expected,\u201d said Ms. Ross, who is the co-author of a paper on youth employment across the country. Although metropolitan areas can vary widely, the report found, in some communities, young blacks and Latinos are three to five times more likely than whites to fall into this group.If things are tough for high school graduates, for those without a high school diploma, the job hunt can be grim. Adam McKinley, 18, said he dropped out of his high school in Baltimore last year because he needed to work full time. He worked briefly at Dunkin\u2019 Donuts and has searched for jobs at coffee bars and restaurants, hotels and warehouses. Because many of the applications were online, Mr. McKinley said he did not know why he never heard back.\u201cIt\u2019s extremely frustrating,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have no idea what\u2019s going on.\u201dAn article on Thursday about job market challenges for young people without college degrees misspelled the surname of a Massachusetts teenager who is graduating from a vocational school next month. He is Issac Cardoso, not Cordoso. The error was repeated in an accompanying picture caption.Follow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Putin Took Credit for the Boom. Now There\u2019s a Bust.", "Date": "2016-05-02", "News": "Supported by\u201cIt all happened here. This is where he solved the future of our factory,\u201d Sergey Lyakhov, a manager at the sprawling plant, said, proudly showing off the tidy third-floor conference room.But that was nearly seven years ago, when Mr. Putin, now president, was prime minister. Today, the economic troubles that Mr. Putin came here to make a big show of solving are back, only worse and involving far more intractable problems than just the \u201ctrivial greed\u201d of tycoons that Mr. Putin blamed for Pikalevo\u2019s tumult in 2009.Pikalevo, about three hours east of St. Petersburg, and the rest of Russia are now mired in the country\u2019s longest recession since Mr. Putin came to power at the end of 1999, with the World Bank warning last month that the nation\u2019s poverty rate would increase this year to 14.2 percent of the population, \u201cundoing nearly a decade\u2019s worth of gains.\u201dA recent rebound in oil prices has lifted hopes in the Kremlin that the worst of Russia\u2019s economic storm has passed, but it has also highlighted just how much Mr. Putin\u2019s fortunes depend on unpredictable and uncontrollable outside forces like the energy market or the economic sanctions imposed by Europe and the United States.Mr. Putin\u2019s power, for example, does not touch the torrent of slurry, a muddy sludge used to make cement, that now flows uselessly into an overflowing storage pit. The sludge is a byproduct of alumina production at Pikalevo\u2019s biggest industrial plant, and it used to feed production at an adjacent cement factory. But that factory, hammered by slumping demand as a result of Russia\u2019s recession, has slashed production and takes only 20 percent or less of the brown muck it used to buy.Nor does it touch Pikalevo\u2019s only hotel, a dowdy Soviet-era hostelry where the staff members, all middle-aged women, were recently told that their services were no longer needed as the owner, the alumina factory, had other, unspecified plans for their workplace.Mr. Putin\u2019s power has not even protected one of his most ardent local supporters, the town\u2019s mayor, Dmitry Nikolaev, who was suspended from his post on April 19 amid a criminal investigation into corrupt payments involving the alumina factory and a construction company.As the leader of the world\u2019s biggest country, a nuclear power intent on asserting itself on the world stage, Mr. Putin has far more pressing concerns than Pikalevo\u2019s myriad troubles. But throughout his 16 years in power, whether as president or prime minister, Mr. Putin has presented an image of an omniscient and omnipresent leader interested in and capable of addressing his country\u2019s most microscopic concerns.Russia has been operating at a deficit since 2012, and its Reserve Fund is slated to run out by 2017.\u201cHe is ultimately responsible for everything that happens in Russia,\u201d said Maxim Volkov, the chief executive of the Pikalevo factory visited in 2009 by Mr. Putin, the largest of three interdependent but, since the collapse of the Soviet Union, separately owned plants. \u201cThis is very good but also very bad.\u201d\u201cThe government simply cannot resolve every dispute in this country,\u201d he said.\u201cIt is difficult to say exactly where the bottom lies,\u201d he conceded. Russia, Mr. Putin said, \u201cis going through a gray period.\u201dNina Suslova, a veteran worker at the cement factory, sees it in hues closer to black. She was informed on a recent morning that her job was being split between three people, meaning that she would work only a few hours a day and would have her salary slashed accordingly. \u201cWe need to eat. We need to pay our bills. We can only think about surviving now, not about the future,\u201d Ms. Suslova said during a visit to her trade union representative to appeal for help.Such cost-cutting maneuvers, which keep workers off the unemployment register but in some cases reduce their income to almost nothing, are increasingly popular with Russian businesses hit hard by the downturn. But they are deeply unpopular with a population that had grown accustomed to rising salaries under Mr. Putin.\u201cThey don\u2019t like the word \u2018cuts\u2019 and prefer to say they are optimizing workplaces,\u201d said Elena Petrova, the trade union representative for Ms. Suslova\u2019s cement factory, her office wall adorned with portraits of Mr. Putin.The downturn seems to be taking a toll on Mr. Putin\u2019s standing, or at least on faith in his policies, as Russians\u2019 fascination and delight with his foreign ventures wanes and pocketbook issues increasingly dominate public worries. Around half of those polled this year by the independent Levada Center said they thought Russia was moving in the \u201cright direction,\u201d compared with 64 percent last summer.Ms. Suslova, the disenchanted worker, said she had always voted for Mr. Putin, had cheered his 2009 visit to Pikalevo as offering salvation and had believed his rule would steadily make her life better. But she said she now realized that \u201cone man can\u2019t do everything.\u201dFor 16 years, however, the Kremlin, aided by hagiographic reports on television, has been telling and, to a large degree, convincing Russians that, in the case of their leader, one man could do just about anything and everything.His visit to Pikalevo in 2009 helped construct this image. But the problem he solved then was relatively simple: The three separate private owners of a once-unified industrial combine could not agree on the price of the products they supplied to one another and which each needed to keep going. Starved of vital supplies, they halted production, leaving workers without work and Pikalevo\u2019s 22,000 residents without heat and hot water. Angry residents blocked a nearby federal highway in protest.In just a few minutes, during a televised meeting in June 2009 with the owners, including Oleg V. Deripaska, a billionaire aluminum magnate who owns the biggest of the three factories, Mr. Putin put everything right. Describing the owners as \u201ccockroaches,\u201d he accused them of making \u201cthousands of people hostages to your own ambitions, your nonprofessionalism and maybe simply your trivial greed; it is absolutely unacceptable.\u201dThe owners, fearful of losing their assets, swiftly ended their quarrel. Behind the scenes, the Kremlin leaned on Gazprom, the state-controlled gas giant, to cut the price of energy to the Pikalevo plants and on state-owned banks to provide cheap credit.The factory at the center of those troubles, Mr. Deripaska\u2019s alumina plant, is now pumping out its primary product, a chemical compound used in aluminum smelting, as well as hot water for the whole town and a tide of slurry for the adjacent cement factory that no longer wants it.On a recent day, only one of six kilns at the cement plant was operating. Managers at the plant, owned by a Russian building materials group called Eurocement, declined to be interviewed. Mr. Volkov, who runs the alumina plant, said the cement factory\u2019s antiquated equipment and plummeting demand for its products left it no hope of recovery.\u201cThere is no solution,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if they get their materials for free, they still could not compete.\u201dAnd this, in a nutshell, is the Kremlin\u2019s current nightmare: With low global energy prices and Western sanctions over the Ukraine conflict crimping Russia\u2019s prospects of recovery, the economy has hit a wall. It simply cannot compete with China, the United States or even the European nations that Russian state media constantly portray as fading has-beens. The easy and popular fixes the Kremlin used in the past to resuscitate the economy \u2014 or at least to placate the public \u2014 have all been exhausted.There are few signs, however, that Russians will take to the streets in protest or flock to the banner of a divided and feeble opposition. Svetlana Antropova, a local trade union leader who helped organize the highway blockade in 2009, cursed what she called the \u201ctorture\u201d inflicted on Pikalevo workers, but she said she saw no point in street protests and has instead filed a raft of lawsuits over alleged violations of the labor code. She also quit Mr. Putin\u2019s political party, United Russia.She said she had received a call recently from a trade union colleague in Moscow who asked about setting up a Pikalevo branch of Yabloko, a pro-Western liberal party critical of the Kremlin. She said she told him not to bother even trying.Asked who is at fault for Russia\u2019s economic troubles, she shrugged and said: \u201cThe world market? The Chinese? The Europeans? Frankly, I don\u2019t know.\u201d All she knows for sure, she said, is that ordinary people are suffering.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Rebuild a Neighborhood, Philadelphia Goes Beyond Housing", "Date": "2016-05-03", "News": "Supported bySquare Feet6 PhotosPHILADELPHIA \u2014 Seeking to do more than provide basic homes for its residents, this city\u2019s public housing agency is taking a new approach to neighborhood revitalization. In its latest project, it is adding commercial and educational development to its main role of home building, aiming to address the underlying causes of urban distress.In the northern part of the city, the Philadelphia Housing Authority is razing part of the Norman Blumberg Apartments in the Sharswood neighborhood, which has had especially high rates of poverty, crime and urban blight. The agency plans to bring in shops, offices and schools, along with housing, in an ambitious program to breathe new life into a struggling community.The $500 million project, just two and a half miles from downtown Philadelphia, aims to recreate a middle-class community that never recovered after being ravaged by rioting in the 1960s, agency officials say.Two high-rise apartment buildings from the late 1960s that had become symbols of urban decay were imploded in mid-March in the most conspicuous stage so far of the project. Other dilapidated housing has also been removed.\u201cWe never really came up with a comprehensive approach that went beyond housing,\u201d Mr. Jeremiah said. \u201cIf you only focus on housing, what about the crime issues? What about amenities? What about the education?\u201dUnder the plan, the destroyed towers, as well as some other low-rise apartment buildings on the eight-acre site, will be replaced by 1,200 new housing units. Most will be for rent or sale at below-market prices. The first phase of the new construction, containing 57 units, is underway and is due for completion this fall.Central to the new vision will be the creation of a new commercial corridor along Ridge Avenue, the neighborhood\u2019s main street, which lost businesses as the local economy declined.In all, the plan projects 400,000 square feet of commercial space. The agency said it was close to making a deal for a drugstore and a supermarket. It is also seeking agreements with other businesses like banks, Mr. Jeremiah said.The housing authority plans to move its headquarters to the street from downtown, bringing around 1,100 employees, who will bolster demand for businesses.Mr. Jeremiah said the agency was in talks with some private developers who were attracted to the project because of its proximity to adjoining neighborhoods like Brewerytown to the west and Francisville to the southeast. In those neighborhoods, new construction is popping up and property prices are rising as a real estate boom ripples outward from downtown, or Center City, Philadelphia, with residents seeking more affordable options.The Michaels Development Company, a developer of affordable housing, plans to build 42 affordable rental units in Sharswood. The company\u2019s senior vice president, Milton R. Pratt Jr., said the neighborhood was well positioned to turn itself around given the buoyant market nearby and its proximity to Center City.\u201cThis is one of the most attractive neighborhoods in the city for redevelopment,\u201d Mr. Pratt said.Similar efforts to involve private developers in public housing projects have taken place in Chicago. Molly Sullivan, a spokeswoman for the Chicago Housing Authority, said the agency had redeveloped several neighborhoods by combining public and market-rate housing with commercial development.The project has attracted support from the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, which awarded it a $500,000 planning grant under its Choice Neighborhoods program. Jane Vincent, an administrator for the federal agency, said the grant reflected the project\u2019s potential and federal, state and local involvement.\u201cIt really is transforming the neighborhood,\u201d she said.While other Philadelphia neighborhoods are plagued by poverty and crime, the problems are especially acute in Sharswood, Mr. Jeremiah said.\u201cYou\u2019re looking at a neighborhood that is severely distressed,\u201d he said, noting that the poverty rate in the predominantly black Sharswood community is 53 percent, or twice the rate for Philadelphia as a whole.Mr. Jeremiah said that during an evening trip to the neighborhood in 2013, soon after he became head of the housing agency, he encountered a man who threatened him with a gun when he refused to buy drugs. After hearing residents\u2019 stories of crime in the area, he thought the housing authority ought to focus on the neighborhood.\u201cWe have to do better by these families,\u201d he said.About 500 families were temporarily relocated to low-income housing elsewhere in the city while the project takes shape.To create space for the new housing, the agency has been buying property from residents, but it has met resistance from some who say it has offered prices far below market value. In some cases, the agency has used eminent domain to acquire parcels.Michael Scott, a resident of Sharswood since 1969, said the agency offered him around $60,000 for a house, a commercial building and a vacant lot that he said together were worth about $300,000. He rejected the offer.Sitting on a wooden fence bordering one of the neighborhood\u2019s 1,300 vacant lots, Mr. Scott, 49, said he welcomed the revival plan because \u201cit\u2019s time for the neighborhood,\u201d but he is waiting for a higher offer for his property.A neighbor, Kim Wong, 69, said the housing authority offered him $28,000 for his house, one of only three still standing on his block. He said the property was worth $105,000.Ms. Tillman said that the housing agency was committed to giving residents fair prices for their properties and that owners were entitled to a reappraisal at the agency\u2019s expense if they were dissatisfied with an offer.David Scolnic, a real estate lawyer with the Philadelphia firm Hangley Aronchick Segal Pudlin & Schiller, said the redevelopment plan had great potential to improve one of Philadelphia\u2019s poorest neighborhoods. But its success, he added, hinges on whether new businesses can be persuaded to open there.\u201cThe key to the whole development is how quickly can you get people back into the neighborhood, and that will give the retailers a chance to succeed if there are sufficient residents there,\u201d Mr. Scolnic said. \u201cIf it works, it could be a model for similar developments nationwide.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Lesson of a Discouraging Jobs Report", "Date": "2016-05-06", "News": "When recent data showed real economic weakness in the first quarter, there were two main reactions:Either way, the implication was that conditions were probably not as bad as they appeared.No one who is not already rich is making any money to speak of. Wage growth held steady in April, up 2.5 percent over the past year. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better than inflation, but not enough to propel the free-spending ways that the economy thrives on. For most people, modest wage gains are eaten up by rent and other expenses that tend to rise faster than the overall cost of living.The economy is not going off a cliff. It is huffing and puffing along as it has since the end of the recession in mid-2009, at about 2 percent economic growth, and, of late, 2 percent to 2.5 percent wage growth.Such figures are not unusual for a late-stage economic recovery. The problem is that they are the best the economy has been able to achieve throughout the recovery. What the economy needed after the recession \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and never got \u00e2\u0080\u0093 was a few quarters, or years, of stellar growth to get out of the hole and begin to scale new heights.As it is, it will be another year, optimistically estimated, before the economy returns to pre-recession employment levels. That estimate, which accounts for the jobs that are needed to employ new workers entering the job market, assumes that the economy will add 200,000 jobs a month between now and next May, which is the average job creation tally for the last three months, but is considerably higher than April\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tally.The main reason for the prolonged shortfall in jobs is Congress\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lack of cooperation on virtually all the policies President Obama has put forward in the past nearly 8 years to try to improve conditions. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still not too late to deepen and speed up the recovery. But doing so will take a Congress that is willing to invest in the economy and the American people, including federal spending on infrastructure, manufacturing, science, education, health care and social services. Otherwise, a more-of-the-same economy will be the best that anyone can hope for.Advertisement"}

She has the most intense psychological acuity, as if she\u2019s always carrying a scalpel. I\u2019ve also been reading Zadie Smith\u2019s essays.

I look at artists and find that they connect to the marrow of writing. The tender humor of Gabriel Orozco. The pathos of Richard Serra. John Currin; Lisa Yuskavage; Cindy Sherman; Sarah Sze; Olafur Eliasson. Or Diane Arbus \u2014 Chekhov behind a lens.What are your favorite books about medicine?

And Ian McEwan\u2019s \u201cEnduring Love,\u201d a novel spun out of an obsessive psychiatric syndrome.Was there any book that influenced your decision to become a writer?Without a doubt: Primo Levi\u2019s \u201cSurvival in Auschwitz.\u201d Levi, notably, defined himself first as a chemist and then as a writer. He has a particularly charming essay about why scientists can be good writers because they distill and clarify, because they boil questions down to their tar, because they understand the Silly Putty-ness of language. If chemists can write like Levi, then God help the writers.What was the most interesting book you read while researching \u201cThe Gene\u201d? And what was the best book you read for \u201cThe Emperor of All Maladies\u201d?I read a wide and bizarre collection of books for \u201cThe Gene,\u201d including comics from the 1950s that fantasized about future human mutants, and a popular genre from the 1930s \u2014 I guess we might call it Eugenics Lite \u2014 that advocated the measurement and breeding of the best babies (blue-eyed, white) to improve the national gene pool. Perhaps the most interesting was Eugen Bleuler\u2019s first case description of schizophrenia from 1911 that reads like the most incredible novel.For \u201cEmperor of All Maladies,\u201d the one book that I particularly scoured for inspiration was Richard Rhodes\u2019s \u201cThe Making of the Atomic Bomb\u201d \u2014 an epic account of the Manhattan Project. I cannot think of another book that makes scientific history more riveting.What genres do you especially enjoy reading?

I\u2019m not sure I avoid any particular genre, but political memoirs can stretch me thin.What moves you most in a work of literature?There\u2019s no formula. There\u2019s a moment in McEwan\u2019s \u201cEnduring Love\u201d in which a middle-aged science writer on a picnic, about to pop open a bottle of Chablis (or something similar), witnesses a child in mortal danger and sprints to rescue the child \u2014 a decision that we later learn will pitch the writer into a vortex of delusion and danger. He writes: \u201cWhat idiocy, to be racing into this story and its labyrinths, sprinting away from our happiness.\u201d Stories are like that: They can move you by moving you \u2014 by forcing you to race into their labyrinths, without caution. When you read a story like that, you are actually pitched into something that is unavoidable \u2014 moved.What\u2019s the last book that made you cry?Several of Lydia Davis\u2019s short stories in her collection. And Alice Munro \u2014 out of envy \u2014 for the pitch-perfect economy of every word, every sentence.The last book that made you laugh?Several of Lydia Davis\u2019s short stories in her collection.

{"Headline": "Surveying Fire-Ravaged Fort McMurray, Justin Trudeau Praises Responders", "Date": "2016-05-13", "News": "Supported byOTTAWA \u2014 After taking a helicopter tour of fire-ravaged Fort McMurray, Alberta, on Friday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau credited firefighters for saving much of the city.An official count found that 2,432 buildings were destroyed and 500 were damaged. About 25,000 buildings are \u201cstill standing\u201d but may have smoke damage.\u201cI don\u2019t think Canadians yet understand what happened here,\u201d Mr. Trudeau told firefighters and rescue workers after touring the city. \u201cThey know there was a fire. They\u2019re beginning to hear the wonderful news that so much of the town was safe. They don\u2019t yet understand that this wasn\u2019t a fluke of wind or rain or luck, that this was the extraordinary response by people such as yourselves \u2014 the work you did to save so much of this community.\u201dIt was Mr. Trudeau\u2019s first visit to Fort McMurray since 88,000 people were forced to evacuate the area on May 3 when a wildfire, which continues to burn, swept into the city, which is the hub of Canada\u2019s oil sands region.Accompanied by Rachel Notley, Alberta\u2019s premier, Darby Allen, the regional fire chief, and others, Mr. Trudeau viewed from a military helicopter the wide blackened trail left around and through the city by the wildfire. Later, while walking through one of the residential neighborhoods leveled by the fire, he paused and picked up a Mason jar from rubble near the ruins of one house. The heat of the fire had melted it into a surrealistic shape.At a news conference later in Edmonton, Mr. Trudeau talked about seeing a child\u2019s abandoned scooter looking \u201csad and forlorn\u201d on a sidewalk in an otherwise burned-out neighborhood.\u201cThat little plastic scooter, whatever little boy or girl was using that before the evacuation, they\u2019re safe, they\u2019re alive,\u201d he said. No one is known to have died directly because of the fire.Because firefighting is primarily a provincial and municipal responsibility in Canada, the federal government\u2019s role in dealing with the disaster has been comparatively limited so far. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police is Fort McMurray\u2019s law enforcement service, under a contract with Alberta. The military has provided logistical support, including helicopters and a heavy-lift airplane.A special emergency response team from the Canadian Forces is helping the province\u2019s health ministry open a temporary medical center. While firefighters were able to divert the blaze away from the city\u2019s hospital, it has extensive smoke damage and problems with its heating and air-conditioning.But while the province has not needed to call on many federal resources, Mr. Trudeau\u2019s government is likely to take on an increasingly important role as the fire threat recedes and officials move toward allowing residents to re-enter the city \u2014 something that is probably still weeks away \u2014 and planning Fort McMurray\u2019s reconstruction.Figures vary wildly about the cost of the fire but it will certainly be in the billions of dollars and far beyond the means of Alberta, which has been struggling financially because of the collapse of oil prices.The federal government will reimburse Alberta for 90 percent of its costs. But after other recent Alberta disasters, including floods three years ago, the province and the federal government became mired in protracted negotiations over what costs were eligible.Mr. Trudeau said that his government would move more quickly than the previous Conservative government to provide \u201csignificant federal moneys\u201d to Alberta.The federal government has already accelerated the process for making unemployment insurance claims for Fort McMurray residents left jobless by the fire.The bulk of the oil sands projects, which provide the basis of Fort McMurray\u2019s economy, lay north of the city. While operations were shut down or severely curtailed at the height of the blaze, most are now slowly resuming. The police have reopened the only highway through Fort McMurray to allow workers to travel to company work camps. The government is also inviting store and business owners to return to the city to assess their ability to reopen.About 1,000 workers are also in the Fort McMurray area, repairing damage to electrical wires and components, and aboveground equipment for pipelines.The fire has prompted an exceptionally large flow of donations from Canadians. The Canadian Red Cross, which governments have designated as the primary relief agency, had raised 86 million Canadian dollars, or about $67 million, from a population of 36 million as of Friday afternoon.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Would a Donald Trump Presidency Affect Your 401(k)?", "Date": "2016-05-26", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceWould President Donald J. Trump be good or bad for your stocks?The stock market is a nervous animal that can easily find a reason to sell off sharply, but so far it has taken the rise of Mr. Trump in stride.The relatively high valuation of the stock market \u2014 it\u2019s trading at 20 times historical earnings \u2014 indicates that investors don\u2019t see any big threats from his stated policies.\u201cHow much do you think he will get enacted?\u201d said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, who isn\u2019t showing signs of worry. \u201cPoliticians are great at telling you they are very important.\u201dSo why is Wall Street not more worried? And should ordinary investors be worried that Wall Street is not worried?Then there is a belief on Wall Street that a President Trump would end up being no more than a rougher-edged version of Mitt Romney when it comes to policy. In other words, Mr. Trump would dial down his combative policies \u2014 like blocking imports from China and Mexico \u2014 once those views got him the votes needed to win the presidency. The other way this theory works: Congress and the courts prevent him from pursuing goals that could create instability, like the mass deportation of illegal immigrants.Even if Mr. Trump ended up compromising on many of his antagonistic positions, the residual tension could cause harm. The global economy has been vulnerable to political and economic shocks emanating out of one region (Europe) or country (China). The stock market dropped more than 10 percent last year after China devalued its currency by a small amount, for instance.Wall Street\u2019s apparently laid-back reaction to Mr. Trump\u2019s rise is a twist on the notion that gridlock is good for stocks. Much money has been made over the years betting that politicians don\u2019t need to be feared because they can\u2019t do much \u2014 or won\u2019t. But Mr. Trump could test this consensus view. He didn\u2019t adopt confrontational trade policies all of a sudden; he has pushed them for many years. And he has shown little appetite for compromise or bridge-building in his campaign, so why expect it if he were in the White House?It\u2019s too soon for the election to move the stock market by much. But if Mr. Trump were ahead in the fall, it wouldn\u2019t be shocking if the herd suddenly turned.Advertisement"}

Ever since, he has hoped for answers, and waited for the students who killed his father to turn up, older and contrite, and say they were sorry. No one has.Mr. Chen is still waiting for a frank reckoning with the legacy of Mao\u2019s Cultural Revolution, and so is China.\u201cJust before he died, my father wasn\u2019t even allowed a mouthful of water,\u201d said Mr. Chen, 72, a retired teacher who lives in northwest Beijing, a few minutes\u2019 walk from where his father lived. \u201cIt\u2019s something I don\u2019t like to think about even now, but also I want to hear from those who did this.\u201cWhy did they pick him out? Where did his ashes end up?\u201dBut China has yet to squarely face up to the era. The party has lately become even more hostile to scrutiny of Mao, unwilling to confront touchy questions about his and the party\u2019s unbridled power, or to dredge up contested memories of a time when perpetrators often became victims themselves.The suppression of memory has blocked the kind of airing out of the episode \u2014 much less the assigning of legal culpability \u2014 that many who endured it believe could help the country move forward.\u201cThe Communist Party holds power, and this is a dark mark against it,\u201d said Chen Bing, a student at the time at the school where Mr. Chen\u2019s father was killed. \u201cIf it publicizes this too much, that\u2019s like staining its own reputation.\u201dMany survivors, former Red Guards and historians said the official reticence had permitted a dangerous nostalgia for Mao\u2019s time.They see no risk of a full-scale repeat of the Cultural Revolution. President Xi Jinping has none of Mao\u2019s appetite for upheaval, and Chinese society is far less rigid and isolated now. But many said they worried about a return of the harsh political tactics, ideological zealotry and absolutist pronouncements that fed the fury of the Red Guards, Mao\u2019s teenage political shock troops.The Cultural Revolution was Mao\u2019s campaign to root out internal enemies who, he said, had been seduced by capitalism and the \u201crevisionist\u201d compromises of the Soviet Union. Students formed Red Guard groups to enforce Mao\u2019s will, he gave them his blessing, and the tumult escalated, especially in schools, where students condemned teachers and officials.Before retiring, Mr. Chen was an instructor at the prestigious Tsinghua University High School, the birthplace of the first Red Guard group. But even as students there moved from tirades against teachers to physical humiliation, with witch hats and parades, to beatings, Mr. Chen thought that his family was safe.His father was solidly working class, a barely educated boiler operator whose own father had done the same humble job. His mother washed clothes for extra cash. Mr. Chen, the eldest of seven children, had given up hopes of entering a university so that he could help support his siblings. He found a job as an instructor at the same high school where he had studied.But on the evening of Aug. 27, 1966, as he turned the corner to his family\u2019s home, he saw more than a dozen youths in green uniforms with red armbands, the favored uniform of Red Guards, Mr. Chen said. A neighbor spotted Mr. Chen and waved him away.When he crept back that night, the home was a shambles. His brothers and sisters were bawling; the dumplings his mother had been preparing for dinner were squashed on the walls and floor; his parents were missing.The next morning, his mother, Liu Wancai, stumbled home, barely able to talk, her clothes torn, her face covered in blood.\u201cWhat about Dad?\u201d Mr. Chen asked, according to his privately published memoir.\u201cHe was killed,\u201d his mother said. \u201cIt\u2019s true. He died beside me.\u201dMs. Liu and her husband had been taken by Red Guards, and he was accused of being a \u201cclass enemy,\u201d she told Mr. Chen. The family of Mr. Chen\u2019s father had once owned about three acres of land, enough to label the father a landlord, anathema to the revolution.The teenage mob threw the couple into the back of a truck and took them to a school where they were beaten with military-style leather belts, the favorite punishment tool of Red Guards; a jump-rope twisted into a whip; and shoes with nails jutting out, Ms. Liu later said. The mob then drove the couple to another school where the beating continued, including with iron rods.The father, Chen Yanrong, 37, insisted that the landlord label was wrong; his family had long given up the property. But back then, the younger Mr. Chen said, \u201cthe more you denied something, the more you were beaten.\u201dAs he lay in his own blood, Chen Yanrong begged for water. The students said no, and he stopped breathing soon after.By later official accounts, 1,772 people were killed in the tumult across Beijing in August and September 1966. There were probably more, including suicides and people killed after being expelled from the city.The Red Guards who took Mr. Chen\u2019s parents came from one of the city\u2019s top schools, Peking University High School, according to his mother as well as later official documents.They were among the first wave of Red Guards, who were usually the offspring of party officials. Later Mao turned on his own political elite, and the first wave fell from grace, giving way to new \u201crebel\u201d Red Guard factions that then waged bloody battles against other Red Guard factions.The day after his father was seized, Mr. Chen asked Red Guards from his school to write a note allowing him to go to Peking University High School to pay the Red Guards there for the cremation. But at the school gate, he heard people say that there had been ruthless beatings there overnight and that two corpses had been taken away.Afraid, Mr. Chen left without entering or seeing his father\u2019s body. He still has the note, tucked away in the back of a picture frame.His mother died in 2011, and was never able to identify her attackers. The family left space at her grave for her husband\u2019s remains, should they ever be found.After Mao died in 1976, the family received 2,500 renminbi, equal to about $380 at current exchange rates but a more generous sum back then, in compensation for the father\u2019s death. Peking University High School also gave the family a statement acknowledging that the school\u2019s Red Guards, who called themselves the Red Flag Struggle Group, had killed him.But no one has ever come forward to take responsibility for the death, Mr. Chen said.Peng Xiaomeng, a former leader of the Red Flag group who is now in her late 60s, has worked under a different name as an editor for an economic policy journal in Beijing. Reached by telephone, she seemed startled to be asked about events 50 years ago but said she did not recall the episode.\u201cI really don\u2019t know whether it was the Red Flag group,\u201d she said. \u201cI have nothing else to say.\u201dMr. Chen stood by his mother\u2019s recollections, which were corroborated by official documents.\u201cEven now, these people are all like this, all evading responsibility,\u201d he said, his voice choking. \u201cThey say: \u2018I wasn\u2019t at the school. I wasn\u2019t at the meeting. I didn\u2019t know.\u2019 \u201d\u201cAfter 50 years,\u201d he said, \u201cthey still haven\u2019t gained any understanding.\u201dVanessa Piao and Adam Wu contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Top C.E.O. Pay Fell \u2014 Yes, Fell \u2014 in 2015", "Date": "2016-05-27", "News": "Supported byA mere $19.3 million.That\u2019s how much compensation Wells Fargo\u2019s chief executive, John G. Stumpf, was awarded last year, making him perfectly representative of the best-paid chief executives in the country.Among the 200 highest-paid chief executives at American companies with annual revenue of at least $1 billion that filed proxies by April 30, the average pay was, give or take a few thousand dollars, equivalent to Mr. Stumpf\u2019s own: a cool $19.3 million.Yet by the topsy-turvy standards of corporate pay, what\u2019s remarkable is not how big that number is, but how small.By other measures, too, chief executive compensation declined. Cash and stock awards, the main components of pay packages, fell last year. Among the companies in the Equilar 200, the biggest pay package, worth $94.6 million, went to Dara Khosrowshahi of Expedia. That meant that for the first time since 2012 no company in the rankings awarded its chief more than $100 million.All of which raises a tantalizing prospect: Has executive pay finally peaked? Have the C.E.O.s and the compensation committees that set their pay discovered something approaching modesty?Some experts say that is the case. \u201cWe\u2019re hearing a great deal more concern from compensation committee chairs about absolute pay,\u201d said Kenneth Daly, chief executive of the National Association of Corporate Directors, a trade group for board members. \u201cThey seem to have a lot more steel in their backs.\u201dMaybe. What is certain is that last year\u2019s weak stock market pulled down the value of executive pay packages. After posting fairly consistent gains for years, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average each fell slightly in 2015. Because the average compensation package was 69 percent stock, lower share prices meant less pay for C.E.O.s.But the relation between pay and performance remains tenuous at best. Some executives\u2019 pay fell, despite gains in the price of shares of their companies. And several C.E.O.s reaped huge windfalls, even while presiding over precipitous declines in total shareholder return.Take Philippe Dauman, the embattled chief of the media conglomerate Viacom. Mr. Dauman was awarded $54.1 million last year, a 22 percent raise from 2014. Over the year, Viacom shares plunged 43 percent.Or consider Stephen A. Wynn, the Las Vegas casino magnate. Using the Equilar criteria, he made $20.7 million as C.E.O. of Wynn Resorts last year, down 19 percent from 2014. That may seem like an appropriate haircut in a difficult year, but his shareholders fared even worse. Shares of Wynn Resorts plunged 54 percent, wiping out half the company\u2019s value. Total shareholder return, which includes dividends, was down almost as much, at 51 percent.Such flagrant disparities \u2014 chief executives are paid tens of millions of dollars for running troubled companies \u2014 rile critics.\u201cMoral outrage is the right term,\u201d said Heather Slavkin Corzo, director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.\u2019s investment office. \u201cThe rules of our economy have been written to allow the rich and powerful to keep getting richer and more powerful, while the rest of us are fighting for the scraps. It\u2019s reprehensible.\u201dPresidential candidates are talking about high C.E.O. pay in equally charged terms. For Democrats and Republicans alike, stagnant wages and income inequality have emerged as reliable rallying cries. The sentiments that fueled the Occupy Wall Street movement and were given academic heft through the work of the French economist Thomas Piketty have become talking points for Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.\u201cThe inequality movement has created a whole backlash against C.E.O. pay,\u201d said Alan Johnson, managing director of Johnson Associates, a compensation consulting firm.Weighing in on Verizon\u2019s labor dispute, Senator Sanders, an avowed socialist, took a shot at the company\u2019s chief executive, Lowell McAdam, who made $18.3 million last year.\u201cWhen the C.E.O. of a company makes almost $20 million a year but then tries to outsource jobs, reduce wages and cut health benefits \u2014 that\u2019s the kind of corporate greed we need to get rid of in America,\u201d Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign wrote in an email to supporters recently. \u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly what Verizon is doing right now.\u201dStarting her campaign last year, Mrs. Clinton contrasted working Americans with chief executives. \u201cFamilies have fought their way back from tough economic times,\u201d she wrote in a campaign email. \u201cBut it\u2019s not enough \u2014 not when the average C.E.O. makes about 300 times what the average worker makes.\u201dNo less than Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee and a wealthy businessman himself, suggested that executive pay was, in some instances, excessive. \u201cYou see these guys making these enormous amounts of money,\u201d Mr. Trump said on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d last year. \u201cIt\u2019s a total and complete joke.\u201dThe presidential contenders are responding to a sense of outrage among many working-class men and women.\u201cIn the wealthiest country in the history of the world, it should be a no-brainer that someone who works full time should be able to support their family and send their children to school,\u201d Ms. Slavkin Corzo said. \u201cThis type of wealth inequality has dangerous ramifications for our economy over all. It\u2019s immoral.\u201dThat sentiment resonates beyond the picket lines. Even Mr. Johnson, who is paid to advise companies on pay, said things had gotten out of hand. \u201cI wish all C.E.O.s were paid less money,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they\u2019re paid too much from a moral standpoint, but it is a competitive market.\u201dHere are 200 of the highest-paid chief executives in American business.Several factors account for big paydays at the highest reaches of corporate America, among them the ease with which companies can give away stock, and chummy board members who reward their friends.But another driver of high pay is the practice of benchmarking a chief executive\u2019s compensation against that of others in a so-called peer group.\u201cCompanies are accustomed to benchmarking against other companies in their industries,\u201d said Andrew Goldstein, leader of the North American executive compensation practice at Willis Towers Watson, a consultancy. \u201cYou tend to get these clusters of compensation in these industry groups.\u201d And companies are prone to benchmark themselves against larger companies and set pay at the high end of any range.At First Data, a payments processor with a market value of about $11 billion that went public last year, the chief executive, Frank J. Bisignano, was awarded $51.6 million in 2015, some of it tied to long-term performance. The board benchmarked his pay against 21 other companies it determined made up First Data\u2019s peer group.But those companies tended to be much larger than First Data, with average market values of about $37 billion. The peer group included Visa ($188 billion market cap), MasterCard ($104 billion market cap) and Accenture ($77 billion market cap).Yet despite First Data\u2019s relatively small size, Mr. Bisignano, who joined the company in 2013 after working at JPMorgan Chase, was awarded more than any chief of the companies in his peer group. The closest was Kenneth Chenault of American Express, who made $21.7 million, less than half of Mr. Bisignano\u2019s package. First Data declined to comment.\u201cNobody wants to be in the bottom half,\u201d Mr. Daly said. \u201cSo over time, the average compensation in any group goes up.\u201dFirst Data may be an outlier in the payments industry. In other sectors of the economy, however, specifically media and technology, enormous pay packages have become the norm.In 2014, the four chief executives reporting to the media mogul John Malone were awarded a combined $358 million. Last year, those four men \u2014 David M. Zaslav, Michael T. Fries, Gregory B. Maffei and Thomas M. Rutledge \u2014 were still awarded $103.4 million.Other media and technology chiefs picked up the slack. Sumner M. Redstone has routinely bestowed great riches upon his lieutenants, Mr. Dauman of Viacom, and Leslie Moonves, chief executive of CBS. Last year was no exception.Mr. Moonves was the second-highest-paid executive on the Equilar list, with a package worth $56.4 million. Mr. Dauman was right behind him, with a $54.1 million package that included a contract extension. They received this compensation although CBS shares fell 16 percent last year, and Viacom\u2019s share performance was dismal.It\u2019s not clear how much longer Mr. Redstone\u2019s largess will endure. He is ailing, has publicly split with Mr. Dauman, and the futures of CBS and Viacom are the subject of enormous speculation.\u201cEvery year they get paid more than they should due to that unusual governance situation,\u201d said Steven N. Kaplan, a professor of finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, referring to Mr. Moonves and Mr. Dauman. \u201cThose guys may be going down once Sumner is gone.\u201dShould the pay of Mr. Dauman and Mr. Moonves fall in the coming years, plenty of other media chiefs will still reap big rewards. Robert A. Iger of Walt Disney was awarded $43.5 million last year, Jeffrey L. Bewkes of Time Warner received $31.5 million, James E. Meyer of Sirius XM made $29.2 million, and Brian L. Roberts of Comcast took in $27.5 million.Technology company chiefs also did well. Marissa A. Mayer of Yahoo was awarded $36 million. Marc Benioff, founder and chief executive of Salesforce, received a $33.4 million package. And Mr. Khosrowshahi of Expedia, the lucky high earner of 2015 according to Equilar, had compensation of $94.6 million. (Mr. Khosrowshahi is a director of The New York Times Company.) His package, reflecting a new five-and-a-half-year contract, was almost exclusively stock that vests over time, so much of its value is closely linked to Expedia\u2019s share price.Defenders of executive pay cite factors like those as evidence that seemingly astronomical rewards really don\u2019t add up to that much money. In a statement, Sarah Gavin, an Expedia spokeswoman, said Mr. Khosrowshahi \u201chas been a transformational C.E.O. for Expedia,\u201d adding that much of his compensation was structured to give him \u201can additional incentive to create long-term shareholder value.\u201dAll told, tech and media C.E.O.s made up 17 of the highest-paid 30 spots on Equilar\u2019s list last year.According to Bureau of Labor Statistics data compiled by the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the average worker in the United States who doesn\u2019t have management responsibility earns $36,875 a year. By that measure, the average chief executive on the Equilar list makes roughly 523 times the average worker salary.It\u2019s not a perfect comparison. Executive pay includes stock grants, often with multiyear payouts and performance targets, while low-paid workers rarely receive stock, let alone long-term incentive packages. Nonetheless, the discrepancy is stark. A bank teller at Wells Fargo making that average wage would have to work more than half a millennium, until 2539, to earn what that company\u2019s chief executive, Mr. Stumpf, who made the average among chiefs on the Equilar list, earned last year.Incomplete as such ratios may be, chief executives will have to get used to them. Starting in 2018, companies will be required to disclose the ratio of their C.E.O.s\u2019 pay to the median compensation of their employees. The Securities and Exchange Commission will allow companies significant leeway when interpreting their own data, which could keep ratios down.In the interim, data from other sources offers a hint of what to expect. PayScale, a company that makes enterprise software, has surveyed more than 80,000 workers about their pay. Using that data, it is possible to roughly approximate ratios of the sort that the S.E.C. will soon require.The biggest gap between C.E.O. and worker pay was at Expedia, where Mr. Khosrowshahi made 993 times the median pay of his employees, as reported to PayScale. That is not so surprising given Mr. Khosrowshahi\u2019s enormous multiyear contract. But it held true even with Expedia\u2019s high median salary of $95,300.Perhaps more glaring was the discrepancy between the Walmart chief executive, C. Douglas McMillon, who made $19.4 million, nearly the average among the Equilar 200, and his workers, who reported a median salary of just $24,600. Mr. McMillon thus made 789 times the income of his median employee, using PayScale and Equilar data.Walmart said it had raised wages for more than 1.2 million employees in February. Mr. McMillon himself started as an hourly worker at Walmart and the company said that most of his compensation was based on company performance.\u201cIt\u2019s an eye-popping number,\u201d said Ms. Slavkin Corzo. \u201cThat means the typical worker would have to work for hundreds of years to make what a C.E.O. makes in one year.\u201dEye-popping as such numbers may be, compensation specialists don\u2019t expect the S.E.C.\u2019s ratio rule to change these disparities very much. But Mr. Johnson said it might embarrass retailers like Walmart. \u201cIt will throw another log on the fire, but I don\u2019t think it will have a huge impact,\u201d he said.Being the chief executive of a big publicly traded company isn\u2019t the only way to get paid these days.Masimo, a small medical device company with a market value of just $2.4 billion and annual sales of about $630 million, saw fit to award its chief executive, Joe Kiani, $119.2 million in cash and stock. Palo Alto Networks, an enterprise technology company with just under $1 billion in sales, awarded its chief executive, Mark D. McLaughlin, $66.6 million. And Paul J. Taubman, an investment banker who recently took his firm, PJT Partners, public, received a package composed almost entirely of stock worth $75.5 million. Because their companies didn\u2019t have $1 billion in sales, they were not included in the Equilar 200.A business leader does not even have to be a C.E.O. to make a fortune. Lowly chief financial officers, chief operating officers and division heads are also hauling in staggering pay packages.When Google reorganized last yearto become Alphabet, it placed Sundar Pichai in charge of its search business. For taking control of the subsidiary, called Google, he was awarded stock and cash worth $100.6 million.Alphabet\u2019s chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, who was recruited from Morgan Stanley, was awarded $31.1 million. And Patrick Pichette, the company\u2019s departing chief financial officer, received a golden parachute worth $56.6 million.Among companies that gave lavish packages to chief executives, other senior executives were also richly rewarded. At Viacom, Thomas E. Dooley, the chief operating officer, was awarded $29.4 million. At Comcast, Michael J. Cavanagh, the chief financial officer, received $40.6 million.And at First Data, where Mr. Bisignano received the sixth-highest total compensation among chief executives last year, his deputies fared well, too.Daniel Charron, executive vice president of global business solutions, was awarded $24.8 million, while the total for Guy Chiarello, the company\u2019s president, was $20.6 million.\u201cThese are very high numbers. Some people think it\u2019s too much,\u201d Mr. Kaplan said. \u201cBut if you look at what people are making in the market \u2014 technology and globalization have played into this \u2014 these are market rates.\u201dThree other hedge fund managers \u2014 Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates, David Tepper of Appaloosa Management and Israel Englander of Millennium Management \u2014 each made more than $1 billion. Another three men made $500 million or more.The figures for hedge fund managers, compiled by Institutional Investor\u2019s Alpha magazine, take into account the money they have invested in their funds as well as the fees they charge.Together, the top 25 best-paid hedge fund managers took in a combined $13 billion last year.On a case-by-case basis, large executive pay packages are easy to understand. Big companies employ thousands of people and generate billions in sales. Competition for top executive talent is intense, especially in today\u2019s global marketplace. From that perspective, Mr. Kaplan said: \u201cIn this day and age, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re particularly overpaid.\u201dAnd chief executive pay declined in 2015, according to the Equilar 200, which included companies with $1 billion in revenue, not $1 billion in market capitalization, as was the case last year. Cash compensation fell to $6 million on average, compared with $6.9 million in 2014, while stock and option awards slumped to $13.3 million, down from $15.7 million in 2014. Some executives with large stock holdings felt a twinge when their company\u2019s share price fell.But it is too soon to call this decline a trend. In 2012, after years of steady increases, average pay dipped 10 percent. What followed were two years of strong gains, until last year. And for all the talk about measures designed to incentivize long-term performance, many chief executives took home enormous cash bonuses, which do little to promote foresight. Mr. Moonves got $23.7 million in cash, while Mr. Dauman received $18.3 million.What is more, when executive compensation is compared with worker salaries, today\u2019s pay packages seem gargantuan.Seen in this light, the compensation committees that set C.E.O. pay are orchestrating a large-scale transfer of wealth to a few hundred individuals \u2014 most of them men, most of them white.Previous efforts to rein in executive pay haven\u2019t yielded many results. So-called \u201csay on pay measures,\u201d which let investors voice their opinions on executive pay, have had little effect. The S.E.C.\u2019s pay ratio rule may make some companies look bad, yet many analysts predict executive pay will continue the trajectory it has followed for decades, climbing ever higher.\u201cThe amount of power that we\u2019ve allowed to be concentrated in the hands of C.E.O.s is worrisome,\u201d Ms. Slavkin Corzo said. \u201cThere is nobody out there that has the power to put their thumb on the scale on the other direction. There are lots of ways you can tweak around the edges, but at the end of the day if you want change, it\u2019s about changing the power structures in corporate America.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tricky Timing for the Class of 2016", "Date": "2016-05-14", "News": "Supported byEditorialThis year\u2019s high school graduates were 10 years old when the economy hit the skids in 2008. Many college graduates in the class of 2016 were 14. Yet, their economic prospects remain darkened by the enduring effects of the Great Recession.The situation for new high school graduates is far bleaker, in part because many lower-wage jobs are being filled by college graduates. Among high school graduates ages 17 to 20, unemployment is nearly 18 percent, compared with 12 percent in 2000. One in three are underemployed, compared with roughly one in five in 2000.The soft labor market has depressed wages, with average hourly pay for young college graduates, recently $18.53, barely higher than it was in 2000, adjusted for inflation. Young high school graduates are averaging only $10.66, lower than in 2000, adjusted for inflation.Without full employment to help push up pay, wages and salaries for all workers lag even as corporate profits rise. But the consequences for young people are particularly severe, because early bouts of unemployment, underemployment and low pay can continue to harm job prospects and earnings over a long period. One\u2019s pay and position starting out has a big impact on subsequent raises and promotions, and thus on accumulated wealth over a career.This trap is especially dangerous for racial minorities and women, who even in the best of times have to combat bias in hiring and pay. For young black college graduates, the recent unemployment rate, at well over 9 percent, is double that of young white graduates. Young female college graduates earn 79 cents for every dollar earned by their male peers, a gap that is bound to get worse as men at the very top of the wage ladder capture an increasing share of total pay.These persistent problems are the result of political failure. Job growth and pay growth were weak and largely ignored as policy issues for most of the 2000s, even before the Great Recession. To restore full employment after the crash would have required sustained government investment in many areas, including infrastructure, education, health care and energy technologies.More public spending could have raised demand at a time of diminished private-sector spending. But Republicans in Congress have rejected that approach and have embraced budget cuts that have hampered broader recovery and growth, at times with the support or acquiescence of Democrats and administration officials.In the meantime, the class of 2016, like many before it, will graduate into a tough economy in which even the college educated are not assured a toehold.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Humane Revolution", "Date": "2016-05-14", "News": "Supported byIN 1903, New Yorkers executed an elephant on Coney Island, effectively torturing her to death.So maybe there is an arc of moral progress. After many allegations of mistreatment of animals, Ringling Brothers this month retired its circus elephants, sending them off to a life of leisure in Florida. SeaWorld said this spring that it would stop breeding orcas and would invest millions of dollars in rescuing and rehabilitating marine animals.There is also a lesson, I think, for many other causes, from the environment to women\u2019s empowerment to global health: The best way for nonprofits to get large-scale results is sometimes to work with corporations to change behavior and supply lines \u2014 while whacking them when they resist.The Environmental Defense Fund and Conservation International do something similar in the environmental space, CARE works with corporations to fight global poverty, and the Human Rights Campaign partners with companies on L.G.B.T. issues.Critics sometimes see this as moral compromise, negotiating with evil rather than defeating it; I see it as pragmatism. Likewise, Pacelle has been a vegan for 31 years but cooperates with fast-food companies to improve conditions in which animals are raised for meat.\u201cAnimals jammed into cages and crates cannot wait for the world to go vegan,\u201d Pacelle told me. \u201cI\u2019m quite sure they want out of this unyielding life of privation right now, and once that question is settled, then sensible people can debate whether they should be raised for the plate at all.\u201dAt a time when the world is a mess, Pacelle outlines a hopeful vision. The public has always had some impact with charitable donations, and there have always been occasional boycotts, but sometimes its greatest influence comes by leveraging daily consumer purchasing power.\u201cAs the humane economy asserts its own power, its own logic and its essential decency, an older order is passing away,\u201d Pacelle writes in his book. \u201cBy every measure, life will be better when human satisfaction and need are no longer built upon the foundation of animal cruelty. Indefensible practices will no longer need defending.\u201dIt\u2019s true that atrocities continue and that the slaughter of animals like elephants persists. There were some 130,000 elephants in Sudan 25 years ago, while now there may be only 5,000 in Sudan and the country that broke off from it, South Sudan, Pacelle writes.It\u2019s also astonishing how sensitive companies are becoming to public opinion about animals. After Cecil the lion was shot dead in Zimbabwe, animal protection groups lobbied airlines to ban the shipment of such trophies. Delta, American, United, Air Canada and other companies promptly obliged.In the pet store business, two chains \u2014 PetSmart and Petco \u2014 have prospered without accepting the industry\u2019s norm of selling dogs and cats from puppy mills and other mass breeders. Instead, since the 1990s they have made space available to rescue groups offering animals for adoption. PetSmart and Petco don\u2019t make money off these adoptions, but they win customer loyalty forever, and they have helped transfer 11 million dogs and cats to new homes.I believe that mistreatment of animals, particularly in agriculture, remains a moral blind spot for us humans, yet it\u2019s heartening to see the consumer-driven revolution that is underway.\u201cJust about every enterprise built on harming animals today is ripe for disruption,\u201d Pacelle writes. In a world of grim tidings, that\u2019s a welcome reminder that there is progress as well. We\u2019ve gone in a bit more than a century from making a movie about torturing an elephant to sending circus elephants off to a Florida retirement home. But, boy, there\u2019s so much more work to do.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Life as a North Korean Refugee", "Date": "2016-05-13", "News": "Supported byOpinionSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 FOR years, thousands of North Koreans have been sneaking across the border into China to escape oppression. The Chinese authorities routinely hunt down defectors and return them to North Korea, where they face torture, forced labor, life in a prison camp or even public execution.This past year much has been written about the people fleeing the Middle East for Europe. The world should also pay attention to the North Korean refugee crisis, and to the desperation that drives it. North Koreans are forced to work at state jobs in a moribund economy. Countless parents watch their children go to bed hungry. Many North Korean families feel they have no option but to try to escape.In 1997, I defected as a na\u00efve 17-year-old girl who simply wanted to explore the world. I was fortunate to live on the border with China and could pick up Chinese TV channels, which opened my eyes. I stole into China, where I remained in hiding for more than 10 years, and eventually found my way to South Korea.This led to a terrifying incident during my time in China. Plainclothes officers arrested me after someone revealed my identity. But since I had quickly learned Chinese, I was able to convince the police that I was a Korean-Chinese citizen. After a few tense hours, they let me go.I am one of the lucky North Koreans who made it out of China. North Korean defectors in the country are terrified of trying to leave because they are often caught at the borders as they attempt to cross into Mongolia or Laos.Defectors have to pay brokers to guide them out of China, and they are relatively expensive, sometimes untrustworthy and not easy to find. Reaching Mongolia usually requires several bus rides and then a long journey through the Gobi Desert on foot, while crossing into Laos is a much longer trip, with a high risk of capture by Chinese or Laotian authorities.I eventually managed to buy a fake Chinese passport and flew to South Korea in 2008, something few defectors are able to do. The next year, after establishing contact with my family in North Korea through a cellphone I had sent them, I returned to China using my new South Korean passport to guide my mom and brother on a 2,000-mile journey from North Korea to Laos, and eventually to freedom in South Korea.Even though some heartless North Korean, Korean-Chinese and Chinese citizens have exploited vulnerable defectors for money, I witnessed many acts of kindness by the Chinese.On a bus ride through China, my family and I had talked for hours before a police officer boarded to conduct an inspection. My mother and brother couldn\u2019t speak Chinese, so they pretended to be deaf and mute, and none of the Chinese passengers said anything, sparing us.In addition to helping North Korea find defectors, the Chinese government gives the regime fuel, technology, economic assistance and political support, but receives little in return.The only rationale for China\u2019s policy of repatriating defectors is that allowing them to stay would prompt a huge wave of North Koreans into China \u2014 creating what the government calls \u201cchaos.\u201d This exaggeration is widely accepted, even though the reality is that most North Koreans cannot even dream of reaching the border because travel is so tightly restricted, and most points on the border are heavily guarded.In China, the defectors have no rights and cannot legally find jobs, so they must scrape by on the margins of society \u2014 which is still less risky than trying to get out of China. Hundreds of thousands of North Koreans should not be forced to live like this. They should be allowed to leave China safely.China should repeal its policy on repatriating defectors and distance itself from such a brutal regime. This would send a positive message to the international community and a stern warning to North Korea that liberalization and other domestic reforms are needed to resolve the refugee crisis.In the way that many Europeans want to turn away the migrants landing on their shores, some Chinese people argue that their country is simply not obligated to help defectors. That\u2019s a morally dubious position, and, more important, China does not have to prop up the North Korean regime.In the 1960s, during the chaotic years of famine and the Cultural Revolution in China, many Chinese people sought refuge in North Korea. Beginning in the late 1990s, the situation was reversed, and North Koreans have been fleeing their oppressive government ever since. The Chinese authorities should remember the hospitality their compatriots received in North Korea and treat desperate escapees with dignity and respect.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Warren Buffett Holds Forth on Sharing the Wealth", "Date": "2016-05-02", "News": "Supported byDealBookOMAHA \u2014 Priyanka Bodalia, a 24-year-old from Cincinnati who works in accounting, was roaming the convention center here where Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s annual meeting was taking place Saturday afternoon. She couldn\u2019t have been more excited to hear from Warren E. Buffett, the company\u2019s chief executive, and his partner, Charlie Munger, as well as to see the parade of boldface names that made the pilgrimage.\u201cAll my friends are jealous that I\u2019m here,\u201d she said, beaming, as she stood with her father near the Dairy Queen booth. \u201cI took a snap of Bill Gates and they were, like, \u2018Are you kidding me? You\u2019re in the same room as Bill Gates!\u2019\u201dIn Nebraska, where Bernie Sanders beat Hillary Clinton by a wide margin in the Democratic caucuses, the juxtaposition between this weekend-long tribute to capitalism and the skepticism expressed by a generation that questions the very premise of the system, was stark.It is an issue that Mr. Buffett said he was well aware of. \u201cYou should be questioning it at that age,\u201d he said in an interview. Mr. Buffett, perhaps surprisingly, spoke positively about Mr. Sanders \u2014 who rails against income inequality and the corrupting influence of money, and he praised him for being \u201cdirect\u201d and \u201cauthentic.\u201d But Mr. Buffett, a Hillary Clinton supporter, said Mr. Sanders\u2019s solutions \u201care very off base.\u201d\u201cWe have a system that has built abundance,\u201d Mr. Buffett said, and yet he acknowledged that \u201cit left too many people behind.\u201d His answer for the next generation: \u201cThe conclusion shouldn\u2019t be to kill the golden goose,\u201d he said. Instead, he said we \u201cneed to make more eggs\u201d and \u201cdistribute them better.\u201dThat is a message that should translate broadly, but it is not often articulated or championed effectively by the business community.Ms. Bodalia said that some of her friends \u2014 most likely the ones who were unimpressed that she had seen Mr. Gates, and who might have been captured by Harvard\u2019s poll numbers \u2014 would benefit from a visit to Omaha. Indeed, underneath all the talk about investing, mostly to a wealthy, older crowd, was a more profound message about the businesses that power much of the economy and spur employment. It\u2019s a message that perhaps could use a wider audience.While Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger mostly sidestepped questions about politics over the weekend (I was one of three journalists who posed questions to them, along with three analysts and some shareholders), they have long communicated a philosophy of about creating a fairer, better version of capitalism.Still, Mr. Munger, who unlike Mr. Buffett leans conservative, suggested that socialism could lead to much worse results. \u201cPeople passionate about egality gave us the Soviet Union and all those murders, and Communist China and the starvation, and lovely North Korea. I am suspicious of all this passion that brings about such bad examples.\u201dHe added, \u201cInequality is the natural outcome of a successful, advancing civilization. What the hell is the guy at the top 1 percent to do? Is he the main problem? When you get rich, you finally realize how little power the rich really have \u2014 they will spend a lot and get practically nowhere.\u201dThat economic worldview runs counter to the one Mr. Sanders has traded on so successfully this primary season, the one so many young people seem to believe.As for Mr. Buffett, he has mostly managed to avoid becoming a political target, in part because he is often described as a compassionate capitalist. He regularly criticizes Wall Street rent-seekers, supports raising taxes on the rich and promotes the earned-income tax credit, for example. And yet his critics say his folksy image is for show, citing his stakes in Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo and his partnership with 3G Capital, a firm known for running an extremely lean organization. They also cite the wealth he has tied up in Berkshire, which itself is run to limit his tax bill, and his plans to give it all away to charity, so Uncle Sam won\u2019t be getting much.I\u2019m not so sure all those positions are at odds. But for a new generation entering the workplace that has reasonable questions about whether the current system gives them enough opportunity, studying the ideas of Mr. Buffett could at least provide another perspective.\u201cTwenty years from now, there\u2019ll be far more output per capita in the United States in real terms than there is now,\u201d Mr. Buffett said. \u201cIn 50 years, it\u2019ll be far more. No presidential candidate or president is going to end that. They can shape it in ways that are good or bad, but they can\u2019t end it.\u201dAn earlier version of a home page headline for this column misspelled the surname of the chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway. He is Warren E. Buffett, not Buffet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Workers Are Getting a Bit More of the Economic Pie (and Shareholders Less)", "Date": "2016-05-03", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsAmerican workers are reaping fewer of the gains of a growing economy in the form of pay and benefits. Shareholders are reaping more in the form of corporate profits. That shift has been one of the most important economic stories of the last several decades, and it is the key to understanding stagnant wages for middle-class workers and a soaring stock market in the last quarter-century.Here is what is less widely understood: That trend appears to be reversing itself.It is early and the reversal may not last. And it certainly hasn\u2019t fully undone the shift underway since the 1980s. But the numbers are quite clear that in the last couple of years workers have claimed a bigger piece of the economic pie and shareholders a smaller one.The evidence available so far in 2016 \u2014 steady growth in wages and weak earnings for publicly traded companies \u2014 suggests that the reversal is continuing this year.At the start of 2013, for example, 61 percent of national income went to pay and benefits for workers. But by the end of 2015, that had risen to 62.6 percent. (That said, in the early 1990s, that figure was around 66 percent.)If the proportion of national income going to workers in early 2013 had stayed constant, there would now be $251 billion a year less flowing into Americans\u2019 paychecks than is the case. That is about $1,900 a year per household.At the same time, corporate profits\u2019 share of national income has fallen, from 14.2 percent in the middle of 2014 to 12.1 percent by the end of 2015. That translates to $328 billion less in annual corporate profits than there would be if the earlier proportion had held.You can pick different numerators and denominators to get at the same concept \u2014 using just wages and salaries instead of total compensation, for example, or dividing by gross domestic product instead of the related concept of national income \u2014 but the same basic pattern reveals itself.A big part of the story is a steep decline in the profitability of the energy sector, reflecting a much lower price of oil and natural gas. Total corporate profits were $64 billion lower in 2015 than in 2014. A fall in the profitability of the petroleum and coal products sector accounted for $40 billion of that.There may be something broader going on that is holding back corporate profits beyond simply cheap oil. You might expect that the hit to profits in the energy sector caused by cheaper fuel would be counterbalanced by higher profits in sectors that use fuel, like airlines and trucking firms.That is where the other side of the equation \u2014 higher worker compensation \u2014 comes into play. Part of the reason corporate profits are falling appears to be that companies are having to pay their employees more.Hiring has been quite strong over three years, with millions of Americans getting jobs. That has pushed the unemployment rate steadily downward, to about 5 percent. Very gradually, a labor market that was very much tilted in favor of employers is tilting the other way.That means companies are having to work harder to attract good employees. They do that by paying higher wages and salaries (up 10 percent in 2015 compared with 2013) and more generous benefits package (up 6 percent over the two-year period).It is worth noting that this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that pay is rising by that much for the typical worker. After all, the pay for chief executives and other highly paid people counts in those compensation numbers.Still, paired with other evidence, it doesn\u2019t look as if this is solely a phenomenon of the highest-paid workers making more. For example, average hourly earnings for nonmanagerial private sector workers rose 2.56 percent in 2015 in a year of very low inflation. That number was only 1.69 percent in 2012, when inflation was higher.It is hard to say definitively what has driven these trends, but here\u2019s a try:The shift of national income toward shareholders and away from workers since the 1980s was driven in part by a decline in union power and a rise in shareholder-driven capitalism that made managers more ruthless than their predecessors in seeking to minimize salary expense. (That includes refusing to give raises and laying off employees.)That long-term trend, along with a cyclical downturn during the 2008 recession and its aftermath, left workers with very little bargaining power and shareholders with the upper hand.In the last two or three years, as the economy has firmed up, workers have regained some of that bargaining power they lost in the recession. But they have not, at this point at least, gained the power they lost over the last three decades.In the meantime, workers celebrate getting a little bit bigger piece of the economic pie, and shareholders bemoan their smaller piece.It would be better if the pie were bigger to begin with. If overall national income were rising rapidly (it decidedly isn\u2019t), there would be room for both workers and shareholders to be fat and happy. One of the great questions for the economic future is what it would take to make that happen.An earlier version of this article misstated the 2015 proportion of national income that went to pay and benefits for American workers. It was 62.6 percent, not 63.9 percentAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Refugees Shouldn\u2019t Be Bargaining Chips", "Date": "2016-05-17", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorTALGARTH, Wales \u2014 IN March, the European Union and Turkey struck a deal: Turkey would build camps to house refugees who were refused entry to Europe, and the European Union would pay for them \u2014 3 billion euros (about $3.4 billion) in the first instance, with another 3 billion euros to follow. Other countries were watching closely, and we are now beginning to see the repercussions.On May 3, the West African country of Niger demanded 1.1 billion euros (about $1.2 billion) from the European Union to stop migrants on their way to Libya and the Mediterranean. Then, last week, Kenya\u2019s government announced that it planned to close the world\u2019s largest refugee camp, Dadaab, citing Europe\u2019s example of turning away Syrians to justify its plan to forcibly return nearly 600,000 Somali refugees to Somalia.Refugee camps are chronically underfunded. But Kenya\u2019s proposal is not about the needs of the refugees \u2014 it is a demand for ransom. Kenya has threatened to close the camps twice already, citing security concerns following terrorist attacks on the Westgate mall in Nairobi in 2013 and Garissa University in 2015. In response, Secretary of State John Kerry promised $45 million in extra aid for Kenya \u2014 aid that is unlikely to go anywhere near the camps, which are entirely paid for by the United Nations.Having cried wolf before, Kenya has had to work harder to gain international attention. To prove its seriousness, last week it disbanded its Department of Refugee Affairs and revoked prima facie refugee status for Somalis seeking asylum, which ensures that future arrivals will be undocumented and at immediate risk of deportation. Kenya has also relentlessly scapegoated refugees for terrorism, undeterred by the lack of any evidence linking the camps to attacks.The truth is more cynical still. Kenyan forces that had invaded Somalia to combat the Shabab, extremists affiliated with Al Qaeda, were last year revealed to be collaborating with the very same group in smuggling charcoal and sugar to the tune of up to $400 million. In response, the Somali government passed a motion calling for the withdrawal of Kenyan troops from Somalia. Going on the offensive against refugees means international energy will be focused on persuading Kenya not to close the refugee camps, rather than on making it behave itself in Somalia.Against the backdrop of the Turkey deal, refugees are a good currency to hold: a hedge against foreign criticism, a liability for which to blame domestic problems, and a bargaining chip for special favors from abroad. In its vulgar attempt to buy itself out of its international obligations, the European Union has started a bidding war.This is dangerous. Eighty percent of displaced people in the world are hosted in developing nations. The world is moving toward a situation in which the rights of refugees are enumerated not in international laws and treaties but in dollars and euros. Earlier this month, the European Union agreed to a change to its common asylum policy that allowed member states to refuse to accept their quota of refugees resettled from front-line countries, like Greece and Italy, for a \u201csolidarity contribution\u201d of 250,000 euros (about $283,000) per head.This is madness for many reasons, but most of all because in refusing to accept a refugee, a country is refusing to admit an employable human being who will, most economic studies show, make a positive contribution to economic growth in the long run. This was, partly, the basis of the German chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s argument for accepting such a large influx of asylum seekers into Germany in 2015.Along similar lines, David Miliband, head of the International Rescue Committee and a former British foreign secretary, called on Saturday for a huge international effort to resettle in rich countries the most vulnerable refugees currently living in camps, and for the rest to be accepted as productive residents with the right to work in their host countries.It is a sound idea. As Dadaab\u2019s 400,000 residents have done, refugees build economies and communities whether you allow them to or not. Despite Kenya\u2019s attempts to keep Dadaab temporary, forbidding permanent structures, roads, sanitation and power, the camp is a full-fledged city. Denying Dadaab\u2019s permanence wastes international funds and forgoes tax revenues and refugee talent. The United Nations has paid to educate three generations of people who are forbidden to work.The choice facing host nations is actually between informal and formal economies. With a little more vision, 25 years of humanitarian funding for Dadaab could have been spent on investing in a city and a population that could, eventually, employ refugees and Kenyans alike, contributing millions in taxes and providing a bridgehead into Somalia for peace and development.Despite the obvious common sense of the Miliband approach, the gap between such a generous global vision and the harsh realities of a xenophobic politics from Nairobi to New Hampshire is wide. Dadaab has survived as an isolated slum precisely because Kenya does not want to swell the Somali vote by up to one million refugees, or 2 percent of Kenya\u2019s population.It seems that most countries would prefer to deport potential taxpayers and pay huge fines in order to deny themselves economic growth. The World Humanitarian Summit, a United Nations-sponsored conference that will be held later this month in Istanbul, is an opportunity to shift the global discussion about refugees toward the potential benefits for all. But I fear it will simply turn into an auction.Ben Rawlence is the author of \u201cCity of Thorns: Nine Lives in the World\u2019s Largest Refugee Camp.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Indiana Economy Offers Caution and Inspiration as Primary Nears", "Date": "2016-05-01", "News": "Supported byINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 As the presidential race came to Indiana, candidates of both parties seized on a fresh example in this industrial state of factory jobs being shipped abroad.The picture of manufacturing decline and middle-class retreat has become a driving narrative of the presidential race, spawning economic populism on both the left and the right.Yet Indiana, which holds its primary on Tuesday, defies an easy picture of Rust Belt decline. By many measures, the state is humming economically, offering a contrarian reality to the gloomy scenario that the presidential candidates are presenting to motivate voters.With nearly one in five jobs in manufacturing, the highest share of any state, Indiana\u2019s gross domestic product is accelerating faster than any of its Great Lakes neighbors, according to the latest figures from the Commerce Department.The Indianapolis region is growing faster than Chicago, Cleveland or Detroit, and personal income statewide rose 3.6 percent last year, faster than the national average.\u201cThe economy here in terms of the data is as good as it\u2019s been in a generation,\u201d said Michael J. Hicks, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University in Muncie, Ind.Mr. Hicks said that if measured by the value of goods produced, manufacturing has never been stronger in Indiana. The boom in the auto industry has played a big role in this because of the many parts factories in the state.Factory jobs have declined, he added, but not because of trade deals with other countries as Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders assert, but because Indiana factories are increasingly efficient and fewer workers are needed.\u201cManufacturing employment peaked in 1973,\u201d he said, adding that since then the productivity of Indiana factory workers has climbed 250 percent. \u201cWe need far fewer workers, and a very different type of worker, too.\u201dIn Warsaw, Ind., for example, a global center for manufacturing orthopedic devices, the workers are highly specialized.Despite increases in productivity, wages have stagnated in step with national trends, feeding widespread anxiety about the future. Candidates in both parties have channeled these fears at targets ranging from immigration to trade deals to the government.And Indiana economists point to pockets of weakness within the state. Like other Midwestern states, Indiana\u2019s rural counties are emptying: Of the state\u2019s 92 counties, 54 lost population in 2015, according to the Business Research Center at Indiana University.\u201cConnersville in Fayette County, which was once called Little Detroit, they had close to 2,000 manufacturing jobs and now are down to about 400,\u201d said Timothy Slaper, an economist at Indiana University\u2019s Kelley School of Business.Patti and Richard Schwalm, owners of a machine shop in rural Henry County, an hour\u2019s drive east of Indianapolis, said they had to cut their staff to three employees in recent years. They blamed President Obama for hurting the manufacturers that are their clients.The Schwalms plan to vote for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in the Republican primary. Pressed for details about Obama administration policies that hurt manufacturing, Ms. Schwalm acknowledged, \u201cThe problems we have are 50 years in the making.\u201dTodd Witte, who works in a factory in Fort Wayne, Ind., plans to vote on Tuesday for Mr. Sanders because of the senator\u2019s opposition to trade deals and his history of walking union picket lines. If Mr. Sanders is not the Democratic nominee, Mr. Witte said, he will probably vote for Mr. Trump if he is nominated. \u201cI like his views on the Second Amendment,\u201d he said. \u201cIn our local, they\u2019re either Bernie Sanders or Trump supporters.\u201dA guide to following the remaining Republican primary contests like a political pro.Mr. Witte was in attendance on Friday when Mr. Sanders addressed members of his union, the United Steelworkers, who were protesting the Carrier layoffs.Even as Mr. Sanders delivered a stem-winding speech about the cost of trade deals, many union members in the crowd who did not work for Carrier said they were personally doing fine.Mr. Trump took to criticizing the company and threatening high tariffs that he promised would force Carrier to reverse itself. \u201cThey\u2019re going to call me and say, \u2018Mr. President, Carrier has decided to stay in Indiana,\u2019\u201d he told the crowd.His protectionist policies, which go against decades of Republican orthodoxy, have brought the issue of trade and its potential costs to workers to the fore of the presidential race. Hillary Clinton has backed off her earlier support of the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, and during a visit here she vowed to take on China for dumping steel.Because the loss of manufacturing jobs has many factors and predates the latest international trade deals and the rise of China, economists say that steep new tariffs, such as those promised by Mr. Trump, will not restore jobs.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Arriving in Vietnam, Obama Aims to Lure It Away From China", "Date": "2016-05-22", "News": "Supported byHe was greeted on the tarmac by a young woman in a long yellow dress who handed him a bouquet of flowers. Several second-tier Vietnamese officials shook the president\u2019s hand before he climbed into his limousine for a quick trip to his hotel after nearly 24 hours of travel. Quiet clusters of people on the dark streets watched his motorcade pass. Except for the small groups, the streets seemed to have been completely cleared.Since Air Force One had been scheduled to land after midnight, or about three hours later, the official arrival ceremony with high officials in attendance was postponed until Monday morning.Maybe then Mr. Obama will see the kind of emotional outpouring that greeted President Bill Clinton in 2000, when he became the first United States president to visit the country since the Vietnam War. But it is possible that relations between the two countries have reached a stage that the arrival of an American head of state no longer seems so unusual.Mr. Obama will meet with the country\u2019s newly installed prime minister and president on Monday, then get together with the country\u2019s real power \u2014 Nguyen Phu Trong, the general secretary of the Communist Party.Mr. Obama\u2019s visit is an important step in a complex dance that Vietnam has carried on with China for centuries. Most of Vietnam\u2019s illustrious historical figures made their reputations by battling Chinese invaders. The population here is deeply nationalistic and anti-Chinese sentiment is visceral. The American War, as it is known here, is mostly forgotten, particularly since half of the population is under 30.Vietnam relies on China for trade, investment and even the water that feeds the vast Mekong Delta, so the leadership knows it can poke the dragon only so much.Indeed, Vietnam had mostly sought to appease China since a brief and bloody war between the countries in 1979, and had shrugged off a series of provocations as China sought in recent years to assert its dominance over the South China Sea, which extends the length of Vietnam\u2019s 2,000-mile coast.Since then, Vietnam has stepped up its contacts with the United States. Neither the United States nor Vietnam is ready for a formal alliance, but Vietnam may grant American warships access to its ports, and Washington seems certain at least to widen exceptions to its longtime arms embargo and may end it altogether.Human rights remain a barrier to closer ties. Government-backed thugs routinely attack dissidents, and recent protests over a toxic spill that killed vast numbers of fish led to beatings and arrests by the police. While the country does have elections \u2014 polling places were packed Sunday for a parliamentary election \u2014 candidates must be approved by the Communist Party.Mr. Obama plans to meet with some dissidents and civil society leaders on Tuesday before making a speech. Brad Adams, the Asia director at Human Rights Watch, suggested that the president \u201cshould start by calling for the right of all people to stand for election, voice critical views of government, associate with others and freely choose candidates.\u201dAmerican help in reforming Vietnam\u2019s economy is also high on the agenda for leaders of both countries.While Vietnam has grown robustly \u2014 the transformation of this city\u2019s airport and skyline over the past two decades is astonishing \u2014 the country remains saddled with a bloated state sector that dominates telecommunications and other crucial parts of the economy, and reliance on low-wage manufacturing that will be increasingly difficult to sustain as the country prospers.Widespread corruption undermines economic growth; government officials with modest salaries can be seen touring the countryside in expensive European automobiles.Vietnam is the only developing country in the Trans-Pacific pact, and it had to make major concessions on issues like allowing independent labor unions and ensuring environmental compliance.\u201cVietnam has agreed to allow independent unions that can control their own finances, elect their own leaders, conduct strikes, affiliate as they wish, get assistance from outside labor organizations,\u201d the United States trade representative, Michael Froman, said in a briefing.Still, innovation incubators, technology start-ups and a focus on small and medium-size companies are now all the rage among development agencies and government officials. Mr. Obama intends to address attendees at an entrepreneurship event on Tuesday afternoon in Ho Chi Minh City.Advertisement"}

Cape Verde, a tiny archipelago about 385 miles off the west coast of Senegal, has music, and it is betting on that resource to help bolster its fragile economy.\u201cIt\u2019s essential to see people perform live before you book them, and there is nothing better than experiencing a music culture where it\u2019s actually from,\u201d said Paula Abreu, the director of programming for SummerStage, an annual New York City music festival. \u201cYou immediately know if an artist has what it takes to entertain a public of thousands.\u201dMs. Abreu booked the musicians Mayra Andrade, Dino D\u2019Santiago and the Ces\u00e1ria \u00c9vora Orchestra for last year\u2019s SummerStage after seeing them at the Atlantic expo.The model for many Cape Verdean artists is the international star Ces\u00e1ria \u00c9vora, who put Cape Verde on the map of the music world with her renditions of mornas, the islands\u2019 ballads of love and longing.\u201cHere, from the rural areas to the breezy beach towns, everyone sings and has a beautiful voice,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Da Silva, who developed the Kriol festival and is the producer of the Atlantic Music Expo. \u201cWhat matters is who works hard enough to be discovered.\u201dMr. Da Silva, a music producer who helped to relaunch the career of Ms. \u00c9vora in the 1980s, worked with the Cape Verde Ministry of Culture to create the Atlantic Music Expo, now in its fourth year. This year, the government spent about $227,000 to finance the expo, which also had corporate sponsors.Together, the two events attract thousands of fans and music professionals each year and pump more than $1 million into the islands\u2019 economy each year, officials said.That is no small amount in Cape Verde, which became independent from Portugal in 1975. The youth unemployment rate is 36 percent, according to the national statistics office, and it is one of the few countries that has more diaspora citizens than locals: a population of about 500,000 on the islands but more than 700,000 abroad.\u201cWhen we became independent, all we had was people,\u201d said Abra\u00e3o Vicente, the newly appointed culture minister and an artist and poet himself.\u201cToday, all we export is music, maybe because it was always the easiest art,\u201d added Mr. Vicente, whose wife is a prominent Cape Verdean singer who uses the name Lura. \u201cYou don\u2019t need any material to sing.\u201dMr. Vincente said one of his goals was to attract tourist dollars by staging musical events like the Atlantic expo across the islands. To finance these, Mr. Vicente plans to collaborate with international producers by offering space for their own festivals.\u201cBut of course,\u201d he said, \u201cCape Verdeans should be the ones involved, for those who don\u2019t have a stage to find one.\u201dLast year\u2019s breakout star was Elida Almeida. Scouted by programmers from France, the United States and Africa at the music expo, the 23-year-old from a mountainous village on the main island of Santiago has since toured the United States, Canada and is now performing in major African cities.Ms. Almeida\u2019s song \u201cNta Konsigui\u201d has been used as the soundtrack for a Portuguese telenovela and her videos have received almost two million views on YouTube.\u201cI feel privileged to have gone so far in so little time,\u201d Ms. Almeida said in a Skype interview from Cotonou, Benin, where she was performing. \u201cMy objective is now to take Cape Verdean music as far as possible.\u201dEmpty of human life before their discovery by the Portuguese during the 15th century, the Cape Verdean islands were an early center for the shipment of slaves from the West African coast to the Americas.\u201cWe are positioned in the middle of the Atlantic, right between the African continent and the Americas, so we were at the cross point, both culturally and physically,\u201d said Charles Akibod\u00e9, a historian who was instrumental in getting Cidade Velha, one of the first settlements for transcontinental slavery, designated as a Unesco World Heritage Site.For Helio Batalha, a 27-year-old hip-hop artist who performed at the music expo, that blending of cultures and history has led to a form of identity crisis for young Cape Verdeans. \u201cWe are told we are African, but we don\u2019t know much about the continent,\u201d Mr. Batalha said, sitting outside his uncle\u2019s tiny storefront in Ponta d\u2019Agua, one of the poorest neighborhoods in Praia.He said the music expo had allowed him to meet producers and programmers, but nothing is booked for now. \u201cThere is a fantasy that after A.M.E., you get handed a plane ticket,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s wait and see.\u201dNot every Cape Verdean thinks the festivals are a worthy investment.\u201cThere are problems that could be solved with those amounts of money,\u201d said Mirto Cesar, a 40-year-old unemployed electrician in Praia with two children. \u201cThere is real misery here, drugs, crimes, hunger. Misery music can\u2019t solve.\u201dNonetheless, Mr. Cesar said he would still take his children to hear afternoon performances on the town\u2019s main square.\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, it is part of their culture,\u201d he said.At 4 a.m. on the Saturday of the Kriol festival, Praia was still resonating with music. The crowd had moved to a seaside stage overlooking the Kebra Kanela beach. Up to play was a Cape Verde jazz veteran, Teofilo Chantre, known for having been a composer and musician with Cesaria Evora many years ago. He had never played so late, he admitted, and for this concert he had decided to ask musicians from the younger generation to accompany him.On stage, Mr. Chantre\u2019s languid, nostalgic voice seemed ignited by a different energy. Afterward, he seemed pleased with the collaboration, conceding he probably now had more to learn from the young players than they could from him.\u201cMusic matters so much because we were always isolated here,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s what reconnected us, it put us on the map.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They are raising unusually harsh \u2014 albeit anonymous, for fear of reprisal \u2014 criticism of Hamas, the militant Islamist group that rules Gaza, for putting people at risk. (They also sought anonymity to avoid their neighborhoods being targeted for Israeli strikes.)\u201cDear God \u2014 we will be torn apart,\u201d said a 42-year-old woman in Khuzaa, a village near the fence. She spoke on the condition she be identified only as Umm Nidal \u2014 Arabic for mother of Nidal, her eldest son \u2014 for fear of reprisal by Hamas.Gesturing at the lumpy sand lot where she believes a tunnel entry point is hidden next to the shelter of tin, tarp and wood where her family members have lived since their home was destroyed in the 2014 war between Israel and Hamas, she said, \u201cI am sure, one million percent, that those with tunnels under their houses cannot sleep, or taste the joy of life.\u201dThe fears of Umm Nidal and her neighbors only intensified over the past month as Israeli officials announced that they had located two tunnels about 100 feet underground \u2014 the first since the August 2014 cease-fire that ended 50 days of fighting in which more than 2,100 Palestinians and 70 Israelis were killed.One, the Israelis said, was equipped with electricity, communications lines and a rail to help clear rubble. The Shin Bet, Israel\u2019s domestic intelligence agency, also reported that a captured Hamas fighter had revealed the routes of tunnels in northern Gaza and said some included rooms for resting, showers and dining areas.\u201cEvery tunnel that appeared on that map will be hit in the day before the night,\u201d said a woman who lives with her extended family in a small shack on the edge of the northern border town of Beit Hanoun.Israel\u2019s leaders say they destroyed 32 tunnels during the 2014 operation, including 14 that penetrated into Israeli territory. During the conflict, Hamas fighters killed five Israeli soldiers after infiltrating their base through a tunnel, and at least 23 Palestinian militants were killed after invading Israel through tunnels on four separate occasions.Israeli officials have said recently that Hamas has most likely rebuilt much of its underground network. At least 18 Hamas members have been killed in tunnel accidents since the end of the war, according to death notices posted on the website of its military wing.After the announcement of the second tunnel discovery this month, Hamas fighters clashed with Israeli forces near the fence for two days, leading to Israeli airstrikes that, according to Palestinian news reports, killed a 55-year-old woman.Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, an Israeli military spokesman, said on Friday that Hamas deliberately put civilians in harm\u2019s way by digging tunnels underneath homes, which he called \u201can insidious plan\u201d to attack Israelis \u201cwhile concealing Hamas activities behind the people of Gaza.\u201dTaher el-Nounou, a Hamas spokesman in Gaza, said tunnels \u201ccreate a sense of a balance of power\u201d against an enemy with far more sophisticated equipment, including drones. \u201cThe Israelis can watch our fighters on the ground, but can they say what is inside a tunnel?\u201d Mr. Nounou said. \u201cAs long as there is Israeli aggression against us, the tunnels will be our priority.\u201dSari Bashi, a spokeswoman for Human Rights Watch and expert on international law regarding warfare, said that building tunnels in residential neighborhoods was not explicitly prohibited. But she said militant groups had \u201can obligation to take all feasible measures to protect civilians, including not taking the armed conflict to civilian areas, to the extent possible.\u201dMs. Bashi said that while Gaza\u2019s density makes that difficult, \u201cit also seems as if armed groups are choosing to dig tunnels in populated areas because it provides cover, and that raises questions.\u201dIn April, Israel suspended the delivery of cement to Gaza for private individuals intending to reconstruct homes destroyed in the 2014 war, accusing an official in Gaza\u2019s economy ministry of siphoning construction materials for other purposes. The ministry denied the allegations.About 4,065 of the 17,800 destroyed homes, or 23 percent, have been reconstructed, according to data from the United Nations, which is overseeing the mechanism for importing construction materials. An additional 5,095 homes were in the process of being rebuilt but the work has been halted because of the Israeli suspension.Among those are the home of a woman from Beit Hanoun, who is 42 and said that when she received her first voucher to buy cement from an approved vendor, he had nothing to sell her. At the same time, the woman \u2014 who, like a dozen border residents interviewed spoke on the condition of anonymity so they could speak frankly about Hamas and to avoid tipping off the Israeli military \u2014 and her relatives have been jolted awake over the past year by trucks rolling by at night, she said.Residents said they had heard thudding noises below an incongruous-looking nearby shack that they think covers a tunnel entrance. They said they were too afraid to ask the truck drivers or other men they see around the shack what was going on.\u201cHow can we say they are helping when they are building tunnels?\u201d a woman asked of Hamas, tapping the rubble under her feet.Naji Sarhan, the deputy housing minister in Gaza, denied that Hamas was taking construction material, particularly cement, intended for reconstruction, instead accusing vendors of illegally selling their supplies on the black market. He said Hamas had \u201cits own ways\u201d to obtain building materials.In Beit Hanoun\u2019s \u201cCaravan Quarter,\u201d a cluster of donated mobile homes where hundreds have been camped since the war\u2019s end as they wait to rebuild, the anger was palpable.\u201cWe have a Gaza City under the ground, and we have nothing up here,\u201d said one 23-year-old in the camp, who spoke on the condition he be identified only as Akram, and said he made a living delivering groceries.A neighbor who is 29 and goes by the name Abu Mohammad, said that the danger of nearby tunnels made him reluctant to rebuild. \u201cI give it 99.5 percent that our house will be destroyed again,\u201d he said. \u201cI go crazy thinking about it.\u201dInstead, Abu Mohammad said he was trying to sell his plot of land on the fringe of Beit Hanoun and move to the relatively safer confines inside town. But the only offer he has gotten was for the equivalent of $140 a square meter \u2014 less than half the $310 he paid in 2013.In Johor al-Deek, another town along Gaza\u2019s 32-mile edge, one mother who goes by the name Umm Fadi said she had sold four sheep and her gold jewelry, used her savings and then borrowed money to scrape together $8,750 to buy a quarter of an acre in sight of the fence. A similar plot farther inland would have cost more than $20,000, she said.\u201cYou stretch your legs to the size of your mattress,\u201d Umm Fadi said, using a Palestinian saying for living within your means.She knows there are probably tunnels under the property. Her sister-in-law, who declined to give her name, noted that Israeli airstrikes during the 2014 conflict exposed tunnels in the area. \u201cThe land was pounded, and everything showed,\u201d she said.A few months ago, a relative of theirs slipped into a tunnel in the area during heavy rains, and had to be pulled out by passers-by.\u201cWe lost our home last time,\u201d Umm Fadi said, shaking her head. \u201cThis time we fear for the souls of our children.\u201dAn article on May 21 about Gaza residents\u2019 fears that the rebuilding of attack tunnels to Israel puts Palestinians at risk referred incompletely to Israel\u2019s suspension of cement deliveries to Gaza for reconstruction of homes destroyed in the 2014 war. The suspension affected only homes being rebuilt by private individuals; cement continued to flow to housing projects handled by foreign governments and international aid groups.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Election Years Are Steeped in Markets\u2019 Least Favorite Thing: Uncertainty", "Date": "2016-05-16", "News": "Supported byDealBookMergers and acquisitions activity is down. Initial public offerings are practically dead. Companies are cutting spending. The stock market is increasingly volatile. Gross domestic product is stalling.What explains it all?Perhaps Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.A growing body of research shows that during presidential election years \u2014 particularly ones like this when there is such uncertainty about the nation\u2019s future \u2014 industry becomes almost paralyzed. A look at the last several dozen election cycles shows that during the final year of a presidential term, big corporate investments are routinely postponed, and big deals are put on the back burner.The research is even more persuasive on the final year of an eight-year presidential term, when a new candidate inevitably will become president.The trend is already playing out that way this year: Verizon is slimming its capital spending; so are Dupont and Union Pacific. McDonald\u2019s and Delta Air Lines are in standstill mode, and Exxon Mobil is cutting back drastically. (Admittedly, the energy complex has its own issues, with the price of oil remaining at low levels.)Of course, there are many factors in play beyond the election, from the possibility of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates to the potential \u201cBrexit\u201d \u2014 Britain seceding from the European Union \u2014 to a slowdown in China and emerging markets.But the circus that is the United States presidential election may be playing an even bigger role, consciously or subconsciously, than most executives may want to admit.If history is any guide, from now till Nov. 8, the stock market is likely to trend down, putting a psychological damper on deal-making and initial public offerings. According to research by Stephen Suttmeier, a technical analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has fallen an average of 2.8 percent since 1928 during election years like this one, in which the incumbent \u2014 in this case, President Obama \u2014 is not seeking re-election. The final year of an incumbent\u2019s eight-year term is the only year that averaged negative returns, Mr. Suttmeier\u2019s research said.It is a favorite epithet of C.E.O.s: \u201cuncertainty.\u201d The word is routinely used as a catchall for why things aren\u2019t going as well as they should. Sometimes the uncertainty is economic, but these days it is mostly political.Mr. Julio, together with his co-author, Youngsuk Yook of the Federal Reserve, examined not just elections in the United States but in 48 other countries from 1980 to 2005. They found a clear pattern: \u201cDuring election years, firms reduce investment expenditures by an average of 4.8 percent relative to nonelection years,\u201d their study said.Strikingly, Mr. Suttmeier\u2019s finding that the final year of an incumbent\u2019s eight-year term was the only year that averaged negative returns in the United States may have an explanation, albeit one that involves a bit of conspiracy theorizing. \u201cThere has been much debate over whether incumbents manipulate fiscal and monetary policy instruments to influence the level of economic activity prior to an election in order to maximize the probability of re-election,\u201d Mr. Julio said in his own study.Critics of the Democratic Party have suggested that Janet L. Yellen, chairwoman of the Federal Reserve and an Obama appointee, will be hard pressed to raise interest rates significantly in an election year, out of fear that such a move might slow the economy and give the Republicans a stronger position.Particularly pronounced is the flight from deals that could have antitrust implications or potential tax consequences. Tax inversion deals, for example, in which companies move their headquarters outside the United States to enjoy lower tax rates, have fallen out of favor in part because a change in leadership could lead to changes in the way such deals are treated in the future; both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump have talked about their ambitions for corporate tax reform. And deals in the defense industry and others that rely on government contracts are also likely to slow, analysts said.The big question \u2014 bigger than what the rest of the year will look like \u2014 is whether the economy will pick up once the issue of the next president is decided. All the data says it should \u2014 indeed, much of the economic activity may just be delayed. But in an increasingly polarized country, the pain of electoral strife could linger on Wall Street far longer than anyone would wish.Because of an editing error, the DealBook column on Tuesday, about stock market uncertainties in a presidential election year, misstated the date of the 2016 presidential election. It will be Nov. 8, not Nov. 3.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "MetLife Suit Raises Questions of Extent of Corporate Liability", "Date": "2016-05-30", "News": "Supported byWhen Christine Ramirez signed over that first check in April 2008, she had no idea that the decision would eventually upend her life.A broker offered a tempting deal. If she invested in a real estate fund called the Diversified Lending Group, which was managed by someone named Bruce Friedman, she would be eligible for a \u201cguaranteed\u201d return of 12 percent. She could use the proceeds to pay the premium on a new MetLife life insurance policy.Ms. Ramirez chose not to buy the insurance policy, but she did invest in Mr. Friedman\u2019s fund, a total of $279,769 including her personal savings, a retirement account and proceeds from a line of credit on her home in Simi Valley, Calif.D.L.G. came crashing down months later, when the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Mr. Friedman, accusing him of misappropriating millions of dollars in investor funds. According to court documents, he operated a Ponzi scheme that defrauded hundreds of investors, including a sitting congressman, of more than $200 million. The money was gone.\u201cI think I cried every day for a year,\u201d said Ms. Ramirez, 75. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t do my homework. I was told it was approved by MetLife and that it was guaranteed.\u201dNow, Ms. Ramirez and some others who lost their money are suing MetLife, claiming that the insurer ignored or failed to notice signs that agents and brokers were peddling Mr. Friedman\u2019s financing program to retirees and others. Litigation has been winding its way through the courts for years, and MetLife is fighting back.But last month, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge cleared Ms. Ramirez\u2019s case to move to trial in July. Her lawyers represent 98 people in seven cases, and hers is the first of this group to move forward. She is being given preference because she is battling late-stage breast cancer.MetLife has settled some cases with its own customers who were duped by the D.L.G. offer, but the current batch of lawsuits involves people who did not buy its insurance. Ms. Ramirez was never a customer of MetLife. Instead, these people only put their money in the D.L.G. investment that was pitched to them by sales people, some who were affiliated with MetLife and some who were independent contractors approved to sell its products. As such, the legal fight raises questions about how far a large company\u2019s liability should extend.\u201cBig companies, like MetLife, are run by people, and when they fall below the standard of care or engage in improper conduct, our clients, who are also real people, get hurt \u2013 and that\u2019s what happened here,\u201d said Richard E. Donahoo, founder of Donahoo & Associates, one of the lawyers representing Ms. Ramirez.MetLife has argued in court documents that it \u201chad no relationship with D.L.G.\u201d and that it \u201cdid not sell, or materially assist in the sale\u201d of the D.L.G. financing program. Neither was it legally obligated to supervise the broker who made the sale to Ms. Ramirez, MetLife said, because he was a contractor and licensed through another, unaffiliated broker-dealer, even though he was authorized to sell MetLife insurance products. The company has added that it did not \u201ctake or receive anything from\u201d Ms. Ramirez, and so it is not liable for any damages. A MetLife spokesman, Christopher Stern, said the company does not comment on continuing litigation.Tony Russon, at the time a managing partner at a MetLife insurance subsidiary and a registered principal for a related broker-dealer, introduced Mr. Friedman and his fund to the agents in about 2004, the lawsuit says. The agents were also given D.L.G. \u201cwelcome packets\u201d to use in making sales that discussed the \u201cguaranteed\u201d returns promised to Ms. Ramirez and others. Mr. Russon is named in the lawsuit, along with MetLife and the subsidiaries.It turns out, according to the lawsuit and related filings, that Mr. Friedman owed Mr. Russon about $750,000 from an unrelated side deal and had an agreement to send half of his future income to Mr. Russon until that debt was paid off, all of this unknown to MetLife. Mr. Friedman also bought millions of dollars of life insurance in several policies from MetLife, with the commissions going to Mr. Russon, according to legal documents.In 2006, a senior fraud investigator at MetLife raised questions with executives about the D.L.G. program. MetLife has said in court documents regarding that 2006 investigation that its underwriting department declined a policy application that disclosed that its premiums would be paid with returns on D.L.G. promissory notes, emphasizing that MetLife did not permit such programs. Mr. Russon was fired in May 2009, soon after Mr. Friedman\u2019s fraud collapsed.A lawyer for Mr. Russon said Ms. Ramirez had never met Mr. Russon, and that she did not buy any insurance products through him or his agency, nor did she buy into D.L.G. through his office. \u201cWe intend on defending Mr. Russon\u2019s interests vigorously at trial,\u201d the lawyer said.Mr. Friedman used a significant portion of the investor money to support an \u201cextravagant lifestyle,\u201d including expensive vacations, jewelry and a $6.5 million home in Malibu, the government said. He also pledged millions of dollars to charity, including the Dodgers Dream Foundation.\u201cThis case is about aiding and abetting,\u201d Mr. Donahoo said. \u201cMr. Friedman, who was a felon, likely could never have obtained the millions from the hundreds of people that he cheated without the legitimacy that a company like MetLife provided.\u201dFew at the time knew that he had been convicted decades earlier of stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from an employer. He was eventually charged in the D.L.G. matter. But Mr. Friedman fled the country as the investigation progressed, and he died in a French prison in March 2012 while awaiting extradition. His victims received a fraction of every dollar they had invested. MetLife paid $10 million of life insurance from his policies to the receiver who was tasked with recovering money.The court battle comes as policy makers in Washington decide whether large financial institutions are \u201ctoo big to manage\u201d \u2013 an outgrowth of the fight over \u201ctoo big to fail,\u201d the idea that a large financial institution can damage the whole economy in times of distress.MetLife, the largest American life insurer, fought the government\u2019s labeling of it as a systemically important financial institution, which would have subjected it to extra regulation. A Federal District Court judge in Washington ruled in favor of the insurer in March, allowing it to shed that label. But concerns remain about whether the country\u2019s biggest financial institutions have adequate controls to manage the host of assets and employees, including outside contractors.\u201c\u2018Too big to manage\u2019 is really the next frontier of regulatory challenges in the financial industry,\u201d said Robert J. Jackson Jr., a professor of law at Columbia University. \u201cEven the best senior managers will tell you that running an organization of this size and scope well, and keeping an eye on all of his employees, is an enormous challenge that we\u2019re not yet prepared for.\u201dA number of large financial institutions, including MetLife, have already shed significant assets. In January, MetLife announced its intention to spin off its American retail life insurance business, which would include the subsidiaries involved in Ms. Ramirez\u2019s lawsuit. The sale will reduce the company\u2019s total assets by more than 25 percent.Without a safety net, Ms. Ramirez said, she had to rethink her entire plan for retirement \u2013 trips to New York to see family and a vacation to Europe. She now rents out a room in her two-bedroom home to help make ends meet. \u201cI had to give up my privacy, along with losing all of my savings,\u201d Ms. Ramirez said.Paul Walker, 71, another reported victim of the scheme who is part of the pending litigation and will serve as a witness in her case, said he was ready to go to court to tell his story.\u201cWhen you lose all your money, that\u2019s like your blood and sweat and tears,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m mad as hell.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "After Etsy, Scratching an Itch", "Date": "2016-05-05", "News": "Supported by13 PhotosCATSKILL, N.Y. \u2014 Rob Kalin made the bed he sleeps on, the cob oven for the bread he bakes with near religious fervor, the progressive preschool his twin daughters, Zia and Kora, attend on the onetime dairy farm he bought three years ago and his own underwear.Whether he and they can make a living doing so, and at the same time raise the fortunes of their adopted town, is still being debated, he said.\u201cThere\u2019s two very different versions of value,\u201d Mr. Kalin said. \u201cThere\u2019s the Walmart and McDonald\u2019s version, which is price and convenience, and then there\u2019s values, and that part is really hard. We\u2019re not purists. We are trying to be practical. But this is a challenge.\u201dMr. Kalin, 36, is still the soft-spoken D.I.Y. evangelist he was 11 years ago when he and two friends, Chris Maguire and Haim Schoppik, created their handmade community in his Brooklyn apartment. (By the time he left Etsy in 2011, it was a venture capital darling with revenues over $40 million.) The other day, he was standing in the storefront of the mill buildings he bought out of foreclosure a few years ago, the fallout of a failed condominium project, without knowing exactly what he may do with them.\u201cWhat\u2019s a good use for buildings like this in a town like this?\u201d he asked himself. \u201cI\u2019m still figuring it out.\u201dMr. Babb and Mr. Kalin are kindred spirits. Mr. Babb, 38, makes cunning Old World \u201cdisaster kits\u201d \u2014 steamer trunks and wooden boxes filled with supplies, tools and materials, like seed libraries \u2014 for the end times; he calls them \u201cfantastical provisions for the post-apocalyptic homestead.\u201d In 2009, when he had a show of this work in Red Hook, Brooklyn, Mr. Kalin bought a piece called \u201cShelter,\u201d a sculptural object made from a large hunk of wood embedded with axes, picks and machetes, and they became friends. Mr. Babb also makes exquisite leather luggage.\u201cJeffrey is one of a half-dozen people who understands this stuff,\u201d said Mr. Kalin, introducing Mr. Jackson, a lanky man with a shock of curly brown hair.Mr. Kalin can seemingly make anything. (Well, knitting still confounds him, he said, as do bagels.) Not too long ago, he made a unisex tunic he colored with cochineal \u2014 a carmine dye yielded by insects that live on cactuses, a favorite of the Aztecs \u2014 in shades from bubble-gum pink to a dark royal purple.He made the tunics for friends, enjoying the intimacy of fitting a garment to a loved one, and he made one for himself, hoping it would give him a more Roman silhouette, he said. \u201cBut it ended up looking like a shift dress.\u201d (Photos he sent prove otherwise: In purple knee socks and scuffed leather boots with straps and buckles, he looked rather like an extra from \u201cBen-Hur.\u201d)Mr. Kalin has had a foothold here since 2008, when he began renting a 1920s duck hunter\u2019s camp on a finger of land overlooking the Hudson as a weekend place. Not that he got up here much. In Brooklyn, he was sleeping on the floor of the unheated warehouse that was Etsy\u2019s office. In 2009, when he was first able to sell his stock in Etsy, he bought the house with the proceeds. By then, he was dating Layla Delridge, who was working on a D.I.Y. sewing website in the same building as the Etsy office.Mr. Kalin has been on his own since he was 16, when he left home to work in a photo shop (he wanted to be a photographer) and live in an artist\u2019s squat with an uncle in Boston. His parents were divorcing, and he was bullied in school. He did return to high school and is proud to tell you he graduated with a D average.Afterward, he spent a year at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, while sneaking into art and design courses at M.I.T. using fake ID cards he and a friend had made for themselves. (He crashed classes at Harvard, too, because there was a girl there he was interested in, but found them too boring to continue.)He later moved to New York and worked at the Strand bookstore and for a construction company, among other jobs, while sneaking into night classes at the New School. Eventually, he graduated from N.Y.U.\u2019s Gallatin School of Individualized Studies with a concentration in classics. When he and a classmate, Mr. Maguire, made a website for the founder of Getcrafty, a how-to site for the booming indie-craft movement, Mr. Kalin had an idea to create a digital marketplace for these new makers.As for the name Etsy, its origins are still a mystery. It has been reported that Fellini\u2019s \u201c8\u00bd\u201d will yield a clue, or that the name is a play on the Latin for \u201cWhat if?\u201d (Et si?) Mr. Kalin remains mischievously closemouthed. \u201cGee, I plumb forgot,\u201d he said.Either way, Etsy was perfectly tailored to the movement at the time: an agora for the whimsical and the twee (crocheted toilet paper, anyone?), as well as for the useful and the beautiful, like handmade clothing, ceramics and furniture. (Perhaps inevitably, Regretsy, a blog parodying its most out-there wares, like felted vulva necklaces, appeared.) Along with a virtual storefront, Etsy offered its sellers skill- and community-building workshops and residencies.While its community grew exponentially each year, and Mr. Kalin and Mr. Maguire were joined by Mr. Schoppik and Jared Tarbell, Etsy soon struggled under the ambitious idealism of Mr. Kalin, always an eccentric chief executive. In 2008, he hired Maria Thomas, a senior vice president for digital media at National Public Radio, to help focus the business; he then stepped aside and offered her his job.Two years later, he stepped back into the role, only to be fired by his board in 2011.\u201cRob is more of an artist than an entrepreneur, but the two are similar and related,\u201d said Fred Wilson, a founder of Union Square Ventures and an early investor in Etsy. \u201cThey both require risk taking and doing things differently.\u201dFive years ago, Mr. Kalin said, he could have talked about being \u201csacked for days.\u201d \u201cNow, I\u2019m just really grateful for my experiences with Etsy, and I\u2019m so glad I\u2019m not the C.E.O. of a publicly traded company,\u201d he said. \u201cI got off the ride not when I thought I would, but I take a very karmic view of things. If the universe gives you a hint and you don\u2019t listen, it gives you a kick.\u201dMr. Male and an associate, Michele Saunders, have been selling Main Street properties to artists relocating from SoHo, Brooklyn and Beijing, he said, with prices about half what they are in nearby Hudson. \u201cMy clients who want to be \u2018over there\u2019 don\u2019t want to be in the hubbub of Hudson,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople who could live anywhere they want choose to live in Catskill, because it\u2019s still under the radar. It also has a great food truck.\u201dNot anymore. In 2013, Mr. Kalin bought a food truck and hired a chef to create a Vietnamese menu for it, as a way of sticking his toe into the waters of food service.\u201cBut it was hard to make money,\u201d Mr. Babb said. \u201cWe had all these limitations. We need to use locally sourced materials. We need the packaging to be compostable. We need to pay everyone a living wage, and we need to keep the prices low so everyone in Catskill can afford it. Which is basically impossible economics.\u201dThey ran the truck for two seasons, a humbling experience, Mr. Kalin said, recalling mishaps like the night the truck broke down minutes before a benefit. \u201cWe made amazing food and fed a lot of people we cared about, but even in its best month, it lost about two grand,\u201d he said.All during this time, Mr. Kalin, Mr. Babb and others were working to clean and stabilize the mill areas. They were trying various scenarios: Could they make and sell local products under one house brand \u2014 clay, leather, textiles and wood, for example?\u201cWe had a metal shop for about a minute,\u201d Mr. Kalin said, but it was too noisy, and metal is tricky to source locally.\u201cI went into foreclosure while I was doing Rob\u2019s kitchen,\u201d he said. \u201cI was picking up side jobs, but I couldn\u2019t make enough to pay my taxes, so I just gave up on paying my mortgage. When Rob found out, he was just setting up the mill and said, \u2018Let\u2019s invite Kurt.\u2019 I had $200 when I came in. I do feel very lucky to be here, because at my age, he\u2019s giving me a chance to not worry about making money for a few years.\u201cRob is a patron, in a sense. This has been like going back to college, but I\u2019m the old fart.\u201dThree years ago, Mr. Kalin bought a former dairy farm on 300 acres near his property. With a group of parents, he created a preschool there. In the cathedral-like Dutch barn he is restoring, he hoped to put an elementary school, but adhering to building codes would have meant destroying the character of the old timber framing, so he is searching for other options.In 2014, he bought another property, a ravishing but derelict 1812 brick townhouse that\u2019s nestled behind Main Street and across from the warehouse on the creek.\u201cWe went through 18 different possibilities,\u201d Mr. Babb said of the house. \u201cIt\u2019s a bakery! No, it\u2019s a bakery and a cafe and a fine-dining restaurant. No, it\u2019s none of those things. It\u2019s an elementary school. No, it can\u2019t be that because it\u2019s too close to a local bar. O.K., it\u2019s just a house, but who\u2019s going to live there? O.K., I\u2019ll live there! But Rob\u2019s like, \u2018You can\u2019t live there; you can\u2019t be a plantation owner. It can be a guesthouse. No, you can\u2019t have an empty guesthouse, you can\u2019t not rent it out. O.K., it\u2019s a B&B, and oh, it\u2019ll be like a showroom, too. Wait, it can\u2019t just be a retail setting, that\u2019s too tacky. \u2026\u2019 This is how we think.\u201dMr. Kalin commissioned these pieces \u2014 furniture and towels and rugs and ceramics \u2014 from their makers and may commission more, he said, though the present arrangement has the artisans concentrating on their own work in studios set up throughout the Main Street warehouse.On a recent afternoon, Mr. Kalin had made enough bread to send a few loaves home with a photographer and a reporter, who were eating handfuls of it and standing around an elegant butternut dining table and benches. The furniture was made by Mr. Holsapple and Mr. Kalin, and set in the mill\u2019s storefront.Mr. Kalin disappeared to find wrapping for the bread and was gone a bit longer than you would expect it to take to find a suitable container. As it happened, he was making bread bags, which he sewed from muslin scraps and then signed, faintly, with his initials.\u201cAt one point, I created too much here,\u201d Mr. Kalin said, noting his habit of stretching himself too thin. \u201cA friend said, \u2018When the phone rings, you always answer it.\u2019 But if you aim too high and try to come in a little bit lower, you\u2019re still way up in the clouds.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And Broadway, once again, broke a record: The theater season that just ended attracted more people, and more money, than any before.Broadway seems to be defying the cultural odds: An ancient art form in the digital age, it is strengthening thanks to an ever-increasing influx of tourists and a resurgent enthusiasm for musical theater.The season that ended on Sunday included 13,317,980 visitors to Broadway shows \u2014 a record number, up 1.6 percent over the previous season, according to figures released on Monday by the Broadway League. Theaters grossed $1.373 billion, also a record, up 0.6 percent over the previous season, although the grosses are not adjusted for inflation.Once again, Simba ruled supreme: \u201cThe Lion King,\u201d still mighty more than 18 years after it opened, grossed $102.7 million on Broadway last season, far outpacing any other show. The musical, which has multiple productions running simultaneously around the globe, has grossed more than $6.2 billion worldwide, and has been seen by 85 million people over its history, according to Disney; by contrast, 478,605 people have seen the Broadway production of \u201cHamilton\u201d thus far.\u201cHamilton\u201d (featuring a onetime Simba, Christopher Jackson, in the role of George Washington) offered an enormous jolt of energy to the Broadway season.

Many Broadway leaders believe the show has helped the industry as a whole, bringing attention from corners of the culture that have long preferred to mock jazz hands and dream ballets.Case in point: Jeremy St. Louis, a 44-year-old sports anchor for the station beIN in Miami, who had never been to Broadway before seeing \u201cHamilton\u201d last week.\u201cI detest musicals, but I was in town on business, and had the opportunity to get some tickets, and heard it\u2019s such a great play that I couldn\u2019t miss it,\u201d he said on Monday. \u201cNow we\u2019re planning to go back to New York later this year, and we\u2019re going to try to get tickets to \u2018The Lion King\u2019 and maybe something else.\u201d\u201cHamilton\u201d is doing unusually well financially \u2014 it is the only new musical that is consistently among the top five highest-grossing shows, and it now has the highest average ticket price on Broadway. But because \u201cHamilton\u201d began performances seven weeks into the season, and is in a midsize (1,321 seats) theater, it was only the fifth-highest grossing show, bringing in $74 million, behind not only \u201cThe Lion King,\u201d but also \u201cWicked,\u201d \u201cAladdin,\u201d and \u201cThe Book of Mormon.\u201dAmong plays, \u201cThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\u201d was, by far, the highest grosser, pulling in $32.9 million. \u201cCurious Incident,\u201d which last year won the Tony Award for best new play, is a rarity for modern Broadway \u2014 a long-running play \u2014 and is planning to close Labor Day weekend after 823 performances.Two poorly reviewed star vehicles were the next-highest-grossing plays: \u201cChina Doll,\u201d with Al Pacino ($12.6 million), and \u201cMisery,\u201d with Bruce Willis ($12.5 million); plays without stars did much less well. Of the $1.373 billion grossed on Broadway last season, 13 percent went to plays.\u201cI continue to be really worried about the plays,\u201d said Victoria Bailey, executive director of Theater Development Fund, the organization that runs the TKTS booths. \u201cWhen people are going to the theater, either as a tourist or for a celebratory event, they tend to go to musicals, and so I think it\u2019s even harder for plays to make a go of it. In the short run, we\u2019re holding even, but what is five years from now going to look like?\u201dCharlotte St. Martin, the president of the Broadway League, attributed the industry\u2019s continued growth to tourism (about 67 percent of the Broadway audience comes from beyond New York City and its suburbs) and to the mix of offerings during a season of unusually diverse programming.Tourism has grown in New York for six years in a row \u2014 this year there are expected to be 59.7 million visitors to the city, according to Fred Dixon, the president of NYC & Company, the city\u2019s official tourism agency. Although Broadway\u2019s growth rate this past season was lower than it had been the previous season, Ms. St. Martin said she was pleased.\u201cWe have more million-dollar-a-week shows, and more shows with strong attendance, than we used to,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve become a much bigger part of pop culture, with \u2018Glee\u2019 and \u2018Smash\u2019 and live television shows like \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 and \u2018The Wiz,\u2019 and more people are aware that Broadway isn\u2019t just something for the 1-percenter.\u201dNonetheless, there are reasons for concern. For the first time since the Broadway League began releasing records, the average ticket price actually declined, albeit only slightly, to $103.11, from $104.18. That might be good news for consumers, many of whom complain about the high cost of tickets to shows at the 40 large theaters in and around Times Square that make up Broadway, but it is worrisome for producers, whose costs for mounting and marketing shows seem to grow ever larger.There are other indicators that the industry\u2019s success is enjoyed by a relative few. Including long-running hits, short-lived holdovers from the previous season, and new shows, there were 72 productions on Broadway last season \u2014 41 musicals, 28 plays, two magic shows and one dance spectacle. About half of all the grosses were earned by just 10 of those productions. And, as is true every season, a vast majority of new productions flopped.\u201cThe Broadway economy is mirroring the U.S. economy, with the rich getting richer and the poor struggling,\u201d said Ken Davenport, a producer who produced a Deaf West Theater revival of \u201cSpring Awakening\u201d on Broadway last season. \u201cThe air is being sucked out of the room by big hits, and people are no longer seeking to discover new things, but are going to monster brands that they know and are comfortable with.\u201dMitchell Ross, 22, from Blairsville, Pa., had just graduated from college when he visited New York last week. He had seen many of the big sights on previous trips, so he decided for the first time to see a Broadway show, and chose one that he knew from the movies: \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables.\u201d\u201cWhen you hear Broadway, you expect a good quality show, but it really was phenomenal \u2014 so much talent in acting and singing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe next time I\u2019m back, I\u2019d like to see more. \u2018Fiddler on the Roof\u2019 and \u2018Phantom of the Opera\u2019 are on my list.\u201dBroadway is bracing for a tough season ahead: The quadrennial confluence of the Summer Olympics and the presidential election is often bad news for theaters, because, hard as it is to believe, some people prioritize politics or sports over theatergoing.Also, unlike this season, when the much-anticipated \u201cHamilton\u201d seemed to be a guaranteed hit even before it opened, next season does not yet have anything quite so surefire.A revival of \u201cHello, Dolly!\u201d, starring Bette Midler and David Hyde Pierce, seems to be the most likely hit, but it isn\u2019t opening until the final days of the new season; \u201cThe SpongeBob Musical\u201d has the potential to be big, given the popularity of the animated series on which it is based, but that show still needs to prove itself to audiences in Chicago before booking a transfer.Advertisement"}

In its score, the creators of this sung-through show, Randy Sharp and Paul Carbonara, have made something beautiful and delicate.They\u2019re billing this piece as a musical, though, and I wouldn\u2019t call it that. Directed by Ms. Sharp for Axis Company at the Axis Theater, \u201cEvening \u2014 1910\u201d looks good, with period dress (by Karl Ruckdeschel) and extra-dim lighting (by David Zeffren) that\u2019s atmospherically apropos. But the story \u2014 ostensibly concerning a theater on the Bowery in 1910, as motion pictures begin to threaten live performance \u2014 is a murk of confusion that only grows.Amid its plentiful dance (choreographed by Lynn Mancinelli) and swift traversal of dozens of songs, it may take a while to notice that you\u2019re still not sure who all of the characters are. Or what the location is meant to be at any given moment. Or what\u2019s supposed to be happening there. The staging, on a mostly bare set (by Chad Yarborough), offers few narrative markers, and the lyrics on their own aren\u2019t enough.It begins promisingly, like a sepia-tone memory, with immigrants making their way to New York. Among them is the scruffy, camera-toting Henry (Michael Sheehy), who smells opportunity when he meets the dapper, cocky George Spencer Jr. (James Scheider). A wealthy landlord on the Bowery, George wants to replace the theater and its showgirls with kinetoscopes \u2014 little motion-picture machines for individual viewing \u2014 and Henry wants to make the pictures.That strand of the story isn\u2019t developed any more fully than the one about the showgirls, or the bits about factory life, or the glimmers of romance \u2014 though a gorgeous, tiny song called \u201cHi, Hello,\u201d sung by Henry and a showgirl named Louise (Shira Averbuch, in beguiling voice), manages to capture, with astonishing economy, all the charged awkwardness of meeting cute.The band is excellent, the sound is full and the show is fast and fluid. But \u201cEvening \u2014 1910\u201d is more a song cycle than a piece of theater.An earlier version of the picture caption with this review misspelled the surname of one of the actors. As the review correctly notes, she is Shira Averbuch, not Aberbuch.\u201cEvening \u2014 1910\u201d runs through May 28 at the Axis Theater, 1 Sheridan Square, Manhattan; 212-807-9300; axiscompany.org.

The markets aren\u2019t even that scary.\u201d That\u2019s true. And it\u2019s also true that I can\u2019t predict when the next bad market is coming.But I can predict that another bad market will come again, eventually. And when it does, you\u2019ll want to have a plan. That\u2019s precisely why now is such a good time to hash this out. Because you don\u2019t wait until your house is in flames to buy a fire extinguisher, right?Let me set the stage for you. It\u2019s sometime in the near future. The market just got really scary, like 2008 or 2009 scary. You and I are sitting down together for lunch to talk about what you should do. We\u2019re going to start with a couple of assumptions. First, you have a portfolio that was built specifically and intentionally to give you the greatest likelihood of reaching your goals. Second, your portfolio is down 20 percent or more, and you want to sell all of your investments and go to cash because that feels safest.But before you do that, before you make this huge, drastic decision, I will have a little conversation with you. Here\u2019s how that conversation would go.Me: \u201cWhy are you invested the way you are?\u201dYou: \u201cBecause this portfolio gives me the greatest chance of meeting my goals.\u201dMe: \u201cAre your goals still the same?\u201dYou: \u201cYes, they\u2019re still the same.\u201dMe: \u201cO.K., great. Step one, you own the right portfolio. Check.\u201dYou: \u201cBut I just can\u2019t take it anymore! I\u2019ve got to sell everything.\u201dMe: \u201cGot it. Now, just so I understand, if you do that, is that going to be a permanent decision? In other words, are you getting out of the stock market forever?\u201dYou: \u201cWell, no...\u201dMe: \u201cO.K., then. So when do you think you are likely to get back in?\u201dYou: \u201cWhen things settle down!\u201dLet\u2019s hit pause again.Now we know three very important things.\u25a0 You have the right portfolio.\u25a0 You\u2019re not going to abandon the stock market permanently.\u25a0 You\u2019re going to reinvest when things clear up.Let\u2019s flesh this out a bit. I want you to imagine what it will be like when things clear up. So why don\u2019t you go ahead and answer just a few more questions from your Scary Markets Drill Sergeant:\u25a0 When the market clears up, will it be less scary than it is now?\u25a0 When the market clears up, will the economy be better?\u25a0 When the market clears up, will that guy on the financial pornography network be telling everyone and their mother to buy more stocks?\u25a0 When the market clears up, will all your neighbors and friends be sitting around the barbecue grill again chatting about investing?We all know the answers to those questions: yes, yes, yes and yes.But one last question. Drum roll please: If the market isn\u2019t scary, the economy is better, the guy on the financial pornography network is yelling \u201cbuy, buy, buy!\u201d and everyone you know is planning to invest, how do you think the market then will compare to the market now?It\u2019ll be much higher, of course!So, to review: Your plan is to sell your perfectly tailored portfolio, right now while your investments are down. Then, you\u2019re going to wait until the market improves. When it does, you\u2019re going to buy back Plan A at a much higher price.To which I say: Seriously?I hate to be annoying, but I really want to hammer this conversation home. It doesn\u2019t make a lick of sense to sell a portfolio tailored for you when the market is low, and then buy it back when the market is higher. It makes infinitely more sense to simply keep your portfolio through the scary times and tough it out. Right, soldier?Instead of doing what fear is making you want to do, just think back to your Scary Markets Drill Sergeant and remember these three things:\u25a0 You made your portfolio based on your goals.\u25a0 It still matches your goals.\u25a0 If you sell that portfolio now and buy it back later when the markets are better, all you will do is lose money.It\u2019s that simple. Just. Don\u2019t. Do it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Venezuela, God Does Not Provide", "Date": "2016-05-21", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorVenezuelans of my generation, born in the 1980s and 1990s, were raised to believe some important things: that we are a rich nation, that we had the most stable democracy in South America. Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the president from 1999 until his death in 2013, made his followers believe that his brand of Bolivarian socialism was the road to dignity. He channeled billions of dollars in oil revenues to the poor, creating \u2014 for a while, at least \u2014 an illusion of growth and inclusion. Five years ago, none of us would have believed that hunger would become a part of daily life for most Venezuelans. Today, all it takes to confirm this hunger is looking out my window.There is a milk vendor who delivers to restaurants in my neighborhood. When he has leftover milk, he sells it from his parked truck to a gloomy congregation of elderly neighbors, who begin to line up while it\u2019s still dark out. These days, the truck shows up less often. The sad scene ends with frail customers walking away empty-handed after hours of waiting. I\u2019m able to identify them by their solemn retreat and their tears of anger.Recently, a woman who works at a nearby beauty parlor decided to start her commute earlier than usual to join the line in hopes of finding milk. As per the government-mandated schedule, her turn to shop for basic goods is every Friday. She gave up on her weekly trips to the local supermarket, not only because she has to work on Fridays, but also because she is terrified of being held at gunpoint by the robbers who wait to pounce on shoppers if they emerge with anything inside their grocery bags. Her 8-month-old granddaughter hasn\u2019t had formula in months, she told me. She worries about the breast milk her mother feeds her, since she has only bread and noodle soup to eat.Our mayor recently noted that stray dogs had all but disappeared from our neighborhood, and people are hunting pigeons in the main square.I\u2019m fortunate enough to go to bed at night without a grumbling belly. I have access to hard currency, which I use to buy black-market goods at jacked-up prices. I fill a suitcase with bags of rice and other grains whenever I travel abroad. Most Venezuelans cannot find the food they\u2019re looking for, and when they do, they cannot afford it. But these daily episodes of despair make me dread the next morning, and the stories of suffering keep me up at night.Emiliana Duarte is the managing editor of Caracas Chronicles, a website for Venezuelan news.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lured by Seattle\u2019s Tech Boom, but Being Left Behind", "Date": "2016-05-03", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Look outside almost any window at the Guest Rooms homeless shelter here, and the view speaks of wealth and power that the residents inside all lack. Construction cranes claw the sky. Trucks hauling steel or concrete rubble shake the streets. Amazon, the giant online retailer, is building out its headquarters campus in every direction as it and other tech companies, in a scramble for real estate and highly educated talent, reshape the city and its work force.But as tens of thousands of newcomers and longtime residents are finding, the allure of the tech economy comes with big risks and dangers, too, in the rapidly climbing housing and rent prices that have shocked them. The boom has brought with it a crisis of homelessness that the mayor has declared an emergency.\u201cWe knew it was going to be expensive,\u201d said Mary Delp, who arrived here last month with her partner, J.D. Cox, and her extended family, after a job loss and then an eviction in Las Vegas. They considered and rejected the idea of a move to Texas. Seattle, Ms. Delp said, felt like the place with the rawest, roaring economic boom.But the costs of moving and rent \u201cwere more than we expected,\u201d she said, \u201cso we ended up homeless.\u201dThey and their two children are settling for now into the Guest Rooms, a former TraveLodge hotel owned by Amazon, which offered it last month to a local nonprofit group called Mary\u2019s Place to run as a 200-bed shelter for families. The old hotel is now one of Seattle\u2019s largest but most temporary of homeless refuges \u2014 doomed to destruction next year as Amazon continues to build.\u201cWe can make it work here,\u201d Ms. Delp said with crisp resolve, sitting in a brightly painted recreation room, as her children, Krystallynn, 7, and Elijah, 6, played nearby. \u201cThere are job signs everywhere you look out there.\u201dMs. Delp, 26, is pregnant, due in September. She spoke vividly of the trip north, full of hopes and plans but also pain, in condensing the contents of a three-bedroom house into her father\u2019s van and a small U-Haul trailer pulled behind.\u201cMy dad would sleep in the driver\u2019s seat, and at first we were sleeping in the middle seat, and the kids had the back. But then it got too uncomfortable for me to sleep, being pregnant sitting up and everything, so we took over the back and the kids would sleep in the middle seat. My dad was still in the front seat. He raised me as a single father, so I\u2019ve got to make sure he\u2019s O.K. He never gave up on me.\u201dJoe Dopp, 39, a former roofer and surgical scrub tech, took his family of five to Seattle this year from a small town on Washington\u2019s Pacific coast where second homes and tourism defined the economy, and it was even harder, he said, to earn a decent wage and afford a home. He spoke fast, sitting on a mattress in the family\u2019s room, words tumbling out.\u201cI made $12 an hour. For two years, I didn\u2019t get a raise. I asked for one. I was told no, when other people had gotten them. I still don\u2019t understand that. I did everything I was supposed to do, but that\u2019s one of the main reasons I said, well, if we\u2019re out, we can go to Seattle or somewhere else and actually have an opportunity.\u201d The tech boom, Mr. Dopp said, is clearly making some people very rich, but that does not bother him a bit, because it is also creating construction jobs that he is qualified for and ready to take. \u201cI never got a job from a poor man in my life,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t mind people making their money.\u201dChelsie Brown, 32, Mr. Dopp\u2019s partner, talked about the things left behind.\u201cWhen we had an apartment, we could take showers, cook dinner whenever you wanted to, could eat whenever we wanted to, could have groceries in the house, we had furniture, beds to lay in, blankets \u2013 we had security, you know. We actually had stuff that we loved.\u201dOn the road, it was all so different.\u201cI did a lot of meal planning: This is what we\u2019re having. But when it came down to meats, I would have to get it that day because refrigeration was nonexistent. Anything we had, foodwise, we had to put it in our car.\u201dThere were stories of hope and light. Laura Long\u2019s son, Gio\u2019moni Caro, 6, has multiple disabilities. He has had five heart operations already. She and her partner, Angel Caro, 34, a former locksmith, have moved repeatedly and left jobs behind to give him the care he needs. They came here so he could be treated at Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital, which anchors a corner of the city\u2019s biotech corridor and recently expanded its cardiac specialty care.\u201cIt\u2019s just been a struggle,\u201d Ms. Long said. \u201cAs soon as you start climbing the stairs, boom! \u2014 another medical issue happens, another hospital stay, another something you can\u2019t overcome. That last step that gets us over the top, it just keeps getting knocked back down.\u201dTyrus Gilbertson, 39, came to Seattle last fall to take care of his two children, ages 7 and 14, after their mother vanished. He had been involved in his children\u2019s lives, he said, living in a city half an hour north. But the crash course as a single father has pushed him to places he never imagined.\u201cI was a wrestler in high school, and my coach was always, like, \u2018Never give up,\u2019 so I\u2019ve always been a fighter, always been. Quitting is not in my vocabulary.\u201dHe sat with his palms flat on the table, soft-spoken but resolute in talking about how he has made ends meet. He plans to enroll in a welding course this fall.\u201cI even panhandled a couple of times. I\u2019ve always been a shy person so panhandling was like the worst thing in the world for me to do. I hope I\u2019ll never have to do that again.\u201d Joe Dopp and Chelsie Brown said being homeless can\u2019t help but make you more empathetic.\u201cYou recognize the things that other people have gone through \u2014 you see the world through other people\u2019s eyes a little bit,\u201d Mr. Dopp said.\u201cEven still, right now,\u201d Ms. Brown replied, \u201cyou can\u2019t judge a book by its cover until you read it. That\u2019s what I look at it as. You can\u2019t judge people, just because they\u2019re sitting in the street.\u201dMr. Dopp: \u201cYou don\u2019t know their story at all.\u201dMs. Brown: \u201cNo, you don\u2019t know their story.\u201dAs they spoke, near sunset, the Guest Rooms was quieting for the night \u2014 doors closing, common room lights clicking out \u2014 sheltering the people within.Advertisement"}

Ms. D\u2019Orsi had managed security during Mr. Xi\u2019s visit in October. At the party, the queen, widely considered a paragon of decorum, was expressing sympathy with Ms. D\u2019Orsi over difficulties the policewoman had experienced, saying it was \u201cbad luck\u201d that she had had to deal with the officials.Ms. D\u2019Orsi said that Chinese officials at one point stormed out of a meeting in London with her and Barbara Woodward, the British ambassador to China, and threatened to cancel Mr. Xi\u2019s visit.The queen\u2019s words resonated online. Among hundreds of comments on The New York Times article, one reader from Michigan wrote: \u201cHats off to the queen for telling it like it is. The Chinese government is a rude bully, as it demonstrates repeatedly by its actions around the world.\u201dA reader from New Hampshire asked: \u201cWasn\u2019t the imposition of opium on the Chinese by the British just a bit rude also?\u201dAnd then there were these words from a reader in upstate New York: \u201cRude? Walking around with a crown and a pedigree is an affront to the human race. Monarchs are ridiculous, when stripped of the thugs who keep them in power.\u201dGlobal Times, a state-run newspaper with a strong streak of nationalism, published an editorial on Thursday that said ties between the two nations would not be affected by the queen\u2019s remarks. It also criticized British journalists for reporting on the comments.The Foreign Ministry usually censors questions on delicate matters from its transcripts of the briefings. And some officials certainly considered the queen\u2019s remarks objectionable \u2014 a televised BBC report about the exchange was blacked out in China on Wednesday. Yet, in its transcript of the Wednesday session, the ministry retained nearly all the questions about the comments, with minor changes to the wording of a few queries.There was one exception. A question from Felicia Sonmez of The Wall Street Journal and Mr. Lu\u2019s answer were excised entirely. She asked, \u201cDoes China think that the video of the queen\u2019s comments was released on purpose?\u201dMr. Lu replied, \u201cI think you should refer your question to those who put the footage on the website.\u201dFour of the questions about the remarks came from Tom Phillips of The Guardian, who appeared eager to pin down whether relations between Britain and China were still in a \u201cgolden era,\u201d as leaders of both countries have asserted for months.The third question in the news conference was the first to tackle the queen\u2019s comments, after queries about Afghanistan and the United States Navy. The following questions and answers are from the official English-language transcript.[The next two questions addressed Taiwan and the Philippines.][Then came three questions: on China\u2019s \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d economic development plan, on a coming China-United States diplomatic meeting and President Obama\u2019s planned trip to Hiroshima.][Then came questions on Morocco and the issue of sovereign immunity for Chinese state-owned enterprises. The question afterward, from Ms. Sonmez of The Journal, about the queen, was redacted from the official transcript. The next questions on the queen\u2019s remarks, from Mr. Phillips of The Guardian, remained in the transcript.]The dispute has been in existence for over four decades. But that did not get in the way of regional peace, stability and security as well as commercial navigation freedom before 2010 when the so-called Rebalance to Asia strategy was introduced.

{"Headline": "When the Billionaire Next Door Moves Out", "Date": "2016-05-14", "News": "Supported byEditorialA budget official in New Jersey recently told the Legislature that the state\u2019s wealthiest resident had moved to Florida, taking a big chunk of future tax revenue with him.For starters, most families decide where to live based on work, family and lifestyle, not tax rates. New Jersey proves the point. Tax data show that more people who left the state in 2014 went to New York, which also has a high top rate, than to Florida, which has no income tax.The issue is that hedge fund partners like Mr. Tepper will soon have to report the compensation they have in tax-deferred, offshore accounts, and pay federal and state income taxes on it. In 2008, Congress blocked hedge funds with overseas operations from sheltering partner compensation going forward \u2014 but allowed income already parked offshore to remain untaxed through 2017.Federal estimates said that as much as $8 billion in extra taxes would come due, not counting state income taxes. About the only way for hedge fund partners to minimize the tax bill on the offshore money would be to move to a state with lower or no income taxes.States should not forget that the incomes of the extremely rich, which reflect widening inequality, tend to rise and fall with the financial markets. Lowering the top tax rates would only worsen inequality by making taxes less progressive. It would also mean less revenue in good times and bad.More broadly, income taxes cannot efficiently raise enough revenue in today\u2019s globalized economy. Other forms of taxation must be added to the mix, including energy taxes and financial transaction taxes, that are tied to activities, not places. Then there would be less reason to fret when a billionaire chooses to move.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "EgyptAir Crash Blindsides a Nation That Thought It Was Recovering", "Date": "2016-05-19", "News": "Supported byCAIRO \u2014 Egypt seemed poised for a modest comeback. After years of cascading crises that had devastated the lifeblood of its economy, tourism, there were signs of a turnaround.Then the United Nations World Tourism Organization chose Luxor, home to the famed Valley of the Kings archaeological site, as its world tourism capital for 2016.For years now, Egyptians have barely had a chance to recover from one crisis before being hit by another: a damaged economy, a diminished currency, a repressive president and a dangerous insurgency waged by a franchise of the Islamic State militant group.This latest setback was such a shock to the nation that Egypt\u2019s leaders abandoned their typical approach to crisis management: obfuscation. Instead, they offered what appeared to be a candid assessment, acknowledging that the disaster might well have been a result of terrorism. And that was even before there was hard evidence of terrorism.Although visibly strained, Egypt\u2019s civil aviation minister, Sherif Fathi, admitted that some Egyptian officials had made errors in dealing with the loss of the plane, EgyptAir Flight 804, and conceded that it might be linked to Islamist militants.The possibility of a terrorist attack, he said, was \u201chigher than the possibility\u201d of a technical failure.\u201cThe initial response has been different this time,\u201d said Michael Wahid Hanna, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation in New York. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the kind of obfuscation that was typical of Egypt before.\u201dThat about-face was typical of Egyptian official reactions that have often looked like defensive crouches, and that have quietly infuriated some allies and led them to question Egypt\u2019s ability to carry out transparent investigations.Instead, Egypt has offered what are widely considered implausible accounts of how Mr. Regeni was killed.Visibly frustrated, she dismissed official explanations about the fate of the plane as \u201cjust propaganda.\u201dConspiracy theories about the crash floated in the news media, including an interview in the state-run Al Ahram paper with a self-declared expert who claimed the plane had been brought down by an electromagnetic pulse.Tourist numbers have fallen more than 40 percent this year, and a further drop would most likely further weaken the Egyptian currency. This, in turn, would increase inflation and put new pressure on Mr. Sisi, who has responded to criticism with an iron fist this year, silencing critics and street protests through mass arrests and convictions.Still, analysts say, the EgyptAir crash could also give Mr. Sisi\u2019s government a chance to capitalize on international sympathy \u2014 provided it does not engage in the sort of defensive behavior that has alienated allies in the past. As the search for wreckage continued Thursday evening, Mr. Sisi\u2019s office issued a stream of statements describing calls of sympathy he had received from the leaders of Italy, Greece, Saudi Arabia and France.Mr. Hanna, the analyst, said there could be a more cynical explanation for the seemingly more candid approach of Egyptian officials: that they see an opportunity to blame another country, France, for the security lapses that led to the disaster. On social media on Thursday, some Egyptians, anticipating a terrorist link, called for Paris\u2019s Charles de Gaulle Airport to be shut down on security grounds, much as Sharm el Sheikh\u2019s airport was in the fall.Blaming France, though, could alienate one of Egypt\u2019s diminishing number of European friends. The French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, visited Egypt last month to sign a $1 billion weapons contract and a slew of other investment deals with Mr. Sisi.Paradoxically, the proliferation of challenges facing Egypt may cause Western countries to strengthen their support for Mr. Sisi, despite his harsh policies, Mr. Hanna said.\u201cIt solidifies the status quo,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause the country faces serious security threats with the potential to spill over into the rest of the world, other countries are loath to make a drastic change and to focus on things like human rights, politics and other freedoms.\u201dAn earlier version of the reporting credit with this article misspelled the surname of one of the contributing reporters.

{"Headline": "Why a B-Minus Economy May Be Causing a Turbulent Election", "Date": "2016-05-24", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceThe boring economy seems to be making this presidential race even more exciting. And uncertain.The economy has reliably been one of the most important factors influencing a presidential election. A strong economy helps to keep the party in power in power. A weak economy tends to cause voters to want to change the residents of the White House.But right now, the economy could be best described as moderately, perhaps deceptively, successful.Growth is lukewarm, but it has been consistent enough to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs. Wages have not risen by much, and the uneven recovery has left segments of the population behind. But the overall unemployment rate is down to 5 percent. That\u2019s unusual for a presidential election season \u2014 it has been at 5 percent or lower in only three of the 14 contests that have taken place since 1960.The quiet strength of the economy appears to be affecting the campaign. It\u2019s far easier for candidates to make economic policy messages resonate when the economy is roaring: the elections of 1996 (Dole vs. Clinton) and 2004 (Bush vs. Kerry). Or when the economy is in the doldrums: 1992 (Bush vs. Clinton). Or when it\u2019s facing threats: (high inflation for Reagan vs. Carter in 1980 and a global financial meltdown for McCain vs. Obama in 2008). But when it\u2019s middling?Indeed, the lack of stark economic problems may have allowed Mr. Trump to push unconventional policies. If the economy were repeating the plunge of 2008, fewer voters might be prepared to support a candidate whose policies would disrupt world trade and whose tax cuts would almost certainly lead to a far bigger budget deficit. And the advances in the economy make it harder for Mr. Sanders to further tap discontent over issues like income inequality.The B-minus economy will also pose a challenge to whomever wins the White House in November.Still, if the economy holds, campaign analysts will be scraping around for precedents.George H.W. Bush won in 1988 against Michael Dukakis by promising to take the country on much the same course as President Reagan did. But while the economy has achieved steady gains under President Obama, Mrs. Clinton might not gain a big advantage by portraying herself as his economic standard-bearer. The economy just hasn\u2019t been growing fast enough. Economists expect the economy to grow at around 2 percent this year. In the second half of 1988, it grew at nearly double that rate.The only years since 1960 when the economy was growing at more than 2 percent and unemployment was at 5 percent or lower at the time of the election are 1964 (Goldwater vs. Johnson), 1968 (Nixon vs. Humphrey) and 2000 (Bush vs. Gore). But the contests of 1964 (the perception that Barry Goldwater was extreme) and 1968 (Vietnam and social disruption) were heavily influenced by noneconomic factors. The 2000 election, which occurred as a big speculative bubble in the stock market and the technology sector was deflating, also lacks strong parallels to today.Jobs and economic growth will always matter to voters. Whipsaw boom-bust economic cycles of the postwar years played a part in deciding who was president, and the American business cycle hasn\u2019t suddenly gone away. But nowadays there are no big wars to finance, just a few long, grinding commitments; inflation is under control; and the recent overhaul of the financial sector appears to have promoted steady credit growth without creating widespread losses. We may be in an era when politicians cannot make much hay out of the economy.If Mrs. Clinton becomes the Democratic nominee and wins in November, it could show that a cautious candidate can do well in a composed economy. True, the lack of drama in the economy may also be helping Mr. Trump run a wrecking-ball campaign by stirring up other issues. But think about it: If there is one force that can derail him, or restrain him, it\u2019s the threat that the economy won\u2019t tolerate his more unconventional policies.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Brexit\u2019 Could Spell More Austerity for Britain, Study Warns", "Date": "2016-05-25", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s campaign to keep Britain in the European Union was bolstered on Wednesday by a report from one of the country\u2019s most authoritative economic research bodies, which concluded that a withdrawal from the bloc would lead to up to two more years of public spending cuts or tax increases.Voters in Britain are to decide in a referendum on June 23 whether to remain in the 28-nation European Union. The economic risks of a departure have been highlighted repeatedly by those who want to remain, while supporters of a withdrawal have focused increasingly on issues such as the need to curtail immigration and regain national sovereignty.The verdict of the Institute for Fiscal Studies is significant because the body has a track record of contradicting government claims on the economy, and its intervention provoked an angry response from campaigners for an exit, who sought to question the institute\u2019s independence on the issue.The report joins a chorus of analysis that has warned of the economic risks of leaving the bloc, including from the International Monetary Fund; from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development; and from the Bank of England, Britain\u2019s central bank.In its report, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said that a British departure would have a negative impact on public finances worth 20 billion pounds to 40 billion pounds, or $29 billion to $58 billion, in 2019\u201320, more than enough to wipe out the government\u2019s plans to create a surplus.\u201cDealing with the public finance effect would require at least an additional one or two years of \u2018austerity\u2019 \u2014 spending cuts or tax rises \u2014 at the same rate as we have experienced recently to get the public finances back to balance (should that remain the government\u2019s priority),\u201d the institute said.The study dealt another blow to the campaign to leave the European Union. Supporters of the push have claimed that a withdrawal would benefit Britain by \u00a3350 million a week, through the cancellation of its financial contribution to the bloc.But the institute\u2019s report pointed out that this figure excluded money sent back to London under a rebate plan, and that it was also based on Britain\u2019s gross contribution and did not take account of European Union spending in Britain, for example to support farmers.If both of those factors were accounted for, the institute said, Britain would gain around \u00a38 billion a year \u2014 or about \u00a3150 million a week \u2014 from quitting, less than half the sum claimed by campaigners for a withdrawal. Such a figure would be easily outweighed by the negative impact on the economy, the report concluded.\u201cIf leaving the E.U. were to reduce national income by just 0.6 percent, that would be enough to outweigh the positive effect on the public finances,\u201d the document said.Britain will hold a referendum on Thursday on whether to leave the European Union, a decision nicknamed \u201cBrexit.\u201dSupporters of an exit, however, criticized the study. Vote Leave, the campaign that is pushing for a British withdrawal, said that the authors of a particular study on which the institute had based many of its assumptions had been proved \u201cwrong time and again.\u201d The campaign also said that the institute was \u201cnot a neutral organization\u201d because it received European Research Council funding. \u201cIt would face an \u00a3800,000 deficit\u201d if Britain votes to leave, the group said in a statement.Douglas Carswell, a lawmaker who supports leaving the bloc, wrote on Twitter that the institute had a \u201cclose symbiotic relationship\u201d with George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, who is campaigning to remain in the European Union. John Redwood, who backs a withdrawal and is a former Conservative minister, told the BBC that the institute was part of the \u201ccozy establishment\u201d consensus determined to prevent a British exit.Responding to the claims, Paul Johnson, director of the institute, said that \u201cfor the last 30 years, the I.F.S. has really built its reputation on the independence and integrity of our work, and actually there is no sum of money from anywhere in the world which would influence what we said.\u201dAs the referendum campaign has progressed, those campaigning for a withdrawal have struggled to describe what kind of economic relationship they would want Britain to have with the European Union after a separation.Access to the bloc\u2019s single market of around 500 million people generally entails making some financial contribution and accepting the free movement of workers across national boundaries.That idea is anathema to many campaigners seeking to leave the bloc, who argue that Britain can only control immigration if it can prevent free movement of people.Those campaigners will hope to gain more traction on Thursday, when new statistics on migration are expected, highlighting an issue that has become increasingly central to their case.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ending Tax Break for Ultrawealthy May Not Take Act of Congress", "Date": "2016-05-06", "News": "Supported byFair GameMr. Obama expressed frustration that many middle-class Americans feel they\u2019ve been left behind during his time in office. The wealthiest Americans, meanwhile, have become richer during the Obama years.There is a lot about this problem of income inequality \u2014 and about the economy over all \u2014 that Mr. Obama cannot control. Still, there is something he could do right now to help narrow the widening gulf between rich and poor.In one deft move, Mr. Obama could instruct officials at his Treasury Department to close the so-called carried interest tax loophole that allows managers of private equity and hedge funds to pay a substantially lower federal tax rate on much of their income.Forcing these managers to pay ordinary income taxes on the gains they reap in their funds would accomplish two things. It would take away an enormous benefit enjoyed almost exclusively by some of the country\u2019s wealthiest people. And, tax experts say, it would generate billions in revenue to the government each year, though there are wide differences over exactly how much.Alan J. Wilensky is among those urging such a change. He was a deputy assistant Treasury secretary in charge of tax policy in the early 1990s when the carried interest loophole came about.\u201cThis is something President Obama can do and should do,\u201d Mr. Wilensky said in an interview. \u201cThis is not an impossible thing to get done.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s something that Obama could accomplish and, to be honest, I\u2019m not entirely sure why the Treasury hasn\u2019t taken an interest in it,\u201d Mr. Fleischer said in an interview. \u201cIn fact, there is quite a bit of revenue at stake. And doing this on carried interest would cement Obama\u2019s legacy in substance as well as symbolically.\u201dRachel McCleery, a Treasury spokeswoman, said in a statement that closing the carried interest loophole has been a priority for the Obama administration from the outset and that the department is continuing to explore its existing authority for ways to address the loophole.But the department cannot eliminate the carried interest tax benefit by itself, she contended.\u201cThe president\u2019s first budget in 2009 \u2014 and every one since \u2014 has included a proposal to close this unfair loophole and we\u2019ve been pushing Congress to get it done,\u201d she added. \u201cNo one should be able to play by a different set of rules, so it\u2019s time for Congress to act to close the carried interest loophole once and for all.\u201dBut a lobbying campaign by the financial industry, supported by a number of influential Republican lawmakers who argued that carried interest should be ended only as part of a broader tax overhaul, put a stop to the effort.The Treasury\u2019s recent action on corporate inversions is encouraging, Mr. Wilensky said. But he acknowledged that it was easier to get rid of a tax rule that benefits faceless corporations than it was to abolish a regulation that enriches a small group of extremely powerful and vocal people.\u201cHedge fund and private equity managers are really the one-tenth of the 1 percent, and the carried interest rule hits their pocketbooks directly,\u201d Mr. Wilensky said. \u201cIt\u2019s much easier to implement regulations that have an adverse effect on anonymous shareholders and institutions.\u201dManagers of hedge funds and private equity funds receive two types of payments. One, paid annually, represents a percentage of assets under management, usually around 2 percent. Those earnings are taxed as ordinary income.But these managers also receive 20 percent of gains that their funds generate over time, known as carried interest. These profits are taxed at the lower capital gains rate, thanks to a 1993 ruling by the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service.Closing the loophole, tax experts say, would involve characterizing both the 20 percent and the 2 percent as income from services rendered.It is odd, he argued, to treat such partnership profits more favorably than \u201cother economically similar methods of compensation, such as partnership capital interests, restricted stock or at-the-money nonqualified stock options (the corporate equivalent of a partnership profits interest).\u201dMr. Fleischer\u2019s solution would be to tax carried interest at ordinary income rates \u201cif the amount of capital contributed to a partnership by tax-exempt entities exceeds the amount of capital contributed by the service provider,\u201d or manager. Tax-exempt entities, such as public pension plans and college endowments, are big investors in private equity and hedge funds.In last year\u2019s paper, Mr. Fleischer noted that a close reading of legislative history from 1984 \u201cshows that Congress expected that the managers of an arrangement like a modern private equity fund would be taxed at ordinary rates.\u201d In addition, Congress allowed the Treasury Department broad discretion on such matters and directed it to write regulations, Mr. Fleischer said.Financial officials in Britain have already started to trim beneficial treatment for carried interest. They have cut back on what qualifies for the lower, long-term tax rate.Beyond fairness, there\u2019s another compelling reason for Mr. Obama to act on this inequity: It could generate $150 billion in revenue over 10 years, by Mr. Fleischer\u2019s estimate. Two-thirds of that would come from the financial industry; the rest would be generated by real estate, oil and gas partnerships and mining companies, he said.(Mr. Fleischer\u2019s prediction, though, is far larger than the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s official estimate, which is close to $18 billion over 10 years.)Whatever the correct amount, the best reason to eliminate this tax break for the wealthy is that it would help narrow the gap between rich and poor in America. The carried interest loophole contributes substantially to the increase in top-end inequality in the United States, Mr. Fleischer has concluded.If these experts are right, Mr. Obama can direct the Treasury to end what is an enormous subsidy for the wealthiest Americans. The Treasury disagrees. But punting this task to Congress means nothing is likely to be done. And that\u2019s too bad.Twitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Two-Hour Marathon. Can It Be Done?", "Date": "2016-05-11", "News": "Part 2Trying to understand what it takes to break the barrier, and to identify the athlete who might be able to do it.Supported byBEKOJI, Ethiopia \u2014 Dressed in a soccer jersey and gray pants, Chala Tulu, 14, began walking in his bare feet and then gradually increased his pace around a grass track at Bekoji Elementary School.Tulu wore a mask and a harness fitted with a small battery pack and a device known as a gas analyzer. He had volunteered for a VO2 max test, which measures the maximum amount of oxygen a runner can use.A plow had furrowed the track with lane markers. Eucalyptus trees provided a wind break. Hills of barley and wheat rose in the distance, brown and tan in the weeks after the harvest. As Tulu picked up his speed with an elegant stride, children clapped and chanted his name.Pacing him on a bicycle was the physiologist Yannis Pitsiladis. He had begun testing young athletes, trying to identify promising talent for an audacious plan: to use science to facilitate a sub-two-hour marathon by 2019, a decade or two sooner than many experts think possible.The current record of 2 hours 2 minutes 57 seconds was set in 2014 by Dennis Kimetto of Kenya. Pitsiladis believed that the first runner to break two hours \u2014 and transform the limits of human endurance \u2014 would not be a current star but would fit a certain profile: someone who had grown up in a rural East African village at altitude, enhancing his oxygen-carrying capacity, and who was accustomed to hours of daily activity, like walking or running to school, hauling water and herding cattle.\u201cThe issue which is unknown for a sub-two marathon is age,\u201d said Pitsiladis, an antidoping expert with the International Olympic Committee and a professor of sport and exercise science at the University of Brighton in England.\u201cIs age a limiting factor?\u201d Pitsiladis said. \u201cNineteen, 20, 21, is that a negative? Maybe 21 will be even better than 29. Twenty-nine might be a wealthy guy; he\u2019s not as a hungry. A 17-year-old could be fearless and hungry, ready to run on coals if it makes him better.\u201dSo Pitsiladis closely observed Chala Tulu.A Westerner, Pitsiladis had become sensitive to the challenges of imposing his ideas on East African runners. Ethiopia\u2019s own traditions and techniques had produced Olympic gold medals for more than half a century. And Ethiopians had a particular and evident pride, derived in part from their never having been colonized by Europeans.For the VO2 max testing, Pitsiladis received ethical clearance from Addis Ababa University in the Ethiopian capital, where he is a visiting professor. And he sought permission from Bekoji Elementary\u2019s principal, vice principal and renowned coach, Sentayehu Eshetu.The men gathered in a small office as Pitsiladis explained his enterprise, the Sub2 Project. He introduced his altitude expert, Zeru Bekele, an Ethiopian, clarifying that this was not an endeavor wholly by outsiders.On this late morning in February, Pitsiladis explained that he wanted \u201cto produce the next Kenenisa,\u201d a reference to Kenenisa Bekele, a native of Bekoji who is an 11-time world cross-country champion, a three-time Olympic gold medalist on the track, and the world-record holder at 5,000 and 10,000 meters.Bekele and a fellow Ethiopian, Haile Gebrselassie, are widely considered the greatest distance runners in history, and Pitsiladis had enlisted Bekele for his project, not for him to break the two-hour barrier himself but, through training and tests, to better understand what it might take.Pitsiladis spoke respectfully of Eshetu, the coach, who had discovered Bekele and other Olympic champions, choosing potential stars by their body type: short torsos and long legs.\u201cHis eyes are good, but he cannot see inside,\u201d Pitsiladis told the principal. \u201cMy machine can look inside.\u201dThe soft-spoken Eshetu consented, saying he welcomed the input of science to help mitigate against trial and error in identifying top athletes.\u201cIt\u2019s necessary,\u201d he said, \u201cso we can guess who can be fruitful.\u201dThe vast success of its distance runners has given Ethiopia, one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, a chance to boast on the world stage. Its top stars can make hundreds of thousands of dollars in prize money and appearance fees, a fortune in a nation where the per capita income is $550, according to the World Bank.Yet Ethiopia\u2019s pre-eminence has faced stiff competition from Kenya and, recently, from Mo Farah, a native of neighboring Somalia and a British citizen who won the 5,000 meters and the 10,000 meters at the 2012 London Olympics \u2014 distances once dominated by Gebrselassie and Bekele.\u201cIn Ethiopia, we have the talent, but what we are doing is by chance,\u201d said Gebrselassie, who is now retired. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the right coach. We don\u2019t have the right nutritionist. We don\u2019t have psychologist. No doctor. Since Mo Farah, they start to think about the science.\u201dBekoji seemed an ideal place for Pitsiladis to start his talent search. A highlands farming village of about 17,000 nearly 9,200 feet above sea level, it is one of the world capitals of distance running, having produced 10 Olympic gold medals.Before Tulu was chosen for the VO2 max test, Pitsiladis asked him a few questions. What did he want to become? How far did he travel to school?About three miles, Tulu said. He walked and ran along the main road and a rural path that sliced through barley fields and cut across a riverbed.\u201cVery good, very good,\u201d Pitsiladis called out as Tulu began to circle the track. Tulu ran in a relaxed manner, his stride long and fluid. His heels nearly kicked his backside in a manner similar to that of Bekele, whose likeness, along with the Olympic rings, was painted on the side of a school building.\u201cI want to be a famous runner, like Kenenisa,\u201d Tulu said.Particularly intriguing to Pitsiladis was that Tulu preferred to run without his shoes and had removed them for the test.For more than 30 years, researchers had quantified how the weight of running shoes affected performance. Less weight on the extremities translated into greater running economy, meaning less oxygen was needed to run at a given speed.The aerobic cost of running increases 1 percent per three and a half ounces of shoe weight, which could amount to a minute in a marathon, research showed. Pitsiladis wanted his Sub2 Project to experiment with a minimalist shoe, which might consist only of a film that covered the bottom of the foot.Pitsiladis thought that the runner who first broke two hours might be a young, barefoot athlete who would continue to run without shoes, as Abebe Bikila of Ethiopia did through the cobblestone streets of Rome in winning the 1960 Olympic marathon. (He won again in 1964, this time in shoes.)Forefoot landings tended to be more gentle, avoiding the large shock waves that travel up the legs of heel strikers, the study found. Thus, barefoot runners, using the foot\u2019s natural architecture, could run comfortably even on the hardest surfaces.\u201cBarefoot is a quick solution that could go wrong, but it could go bloody right,\u201d Pitsiladis said. \u201cIf you said I\u2019m only allowing you to choose one thing, which would it be? Because I\u2019m a risky person, I\u2019d say, \u2018Let\u2019s do it barefoot.\u2019\u201dRelatively little scientific research has been conducted on the world\u2019s fastest marathon runners. For one thing, East Africa is not the easiest place to work.The biomedical lab at Addis Ababa University contains hundreds of thousands of dollars of equipment acquired over the years \u2014 ultra-low-temperature freezers and sophisticated machines, resembling high-tech bread makers, that analyze genes and blood. But because of insufficient funding and a lack of available experts to operate the equipment, much of it was unplugged and covered by tablecloths when Pitsiladis toured the lab with graduate students.\u201cIt\u2019s like having a cake shop,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the best sweets in the world, and you can only look at them.\u201dFor his testing in Bekoji, Pitsiladis had haggled for a bicycle a day earlier in a bazaar in Addis Ababa. Eventually, he ventured down an alley, where wet clothes hung on a line, and made a deal. Then he had to make six withdrawals from a cash machine to circumvent its limits.That was a minor inconvenience compared with retrieving a cylinder of oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen from the Ethiopian Revenues and Customs Authority. The canister, needed to calibrate the VO2 max tests, had been shipped from Italy in November because none were available in Ethiopia. Nearly three months later, it had not cleared customs.Before heading to Bekoji, Pitsiladis and Zeru Bekele, his altitude expert, spent a maddening five hours extricating the cylinder from the authorities at Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa. They paid a 100 percent tax on the container and one fee after another. At the last minute, customs officials refused to release the canister to anyone but the purchasing agent from Addis Ababa University. Bekele spent an hour picking up the agent and driving her to the airport.\u201cCome on,\u201d Pitsiladis said in exasperation before leaving for his hotel. \u201cThis is ridiculous.\u201dRidiculous became surreal when a Charlie Chaplin movie, \u201cThe Gold Rush,\u201d began playing in a waiting area at customs. Finally, Bekele secured the canister and took it to Pitsiladis at his hotel. Pitsiladis cradled it like a baby.\u201cNo one in their right mind would do this job,\u201d he said with a laugh.A software glitch left the results of Tulu\u2019s VO2 max test unclear. Still, he did not appear to Pitsiladis to be a candidate to eventually break the two-hour barrier. Perhaps no one at the school was.Earlier, as Pitsiladis had arrived and children had gathered around his van, he had said with disbelief and mild disappointment, \u201cThey\u2019re all wearing something on their feet!\u201d But Kenenisa Bekele had arranged for the trip with a phone call to Eshetu, his former coach, so Pitsiladis proceeded with the testing.Zeru Bekele, the altitude expert, who is not related to Kenenisa, said he worried that as more schools were built in the countryside, Ethiopian children might lose something athletically by not having to run so far to class.\u201cIt could be in Bekoji that we\u2019re 20 years too late,\u201d Pitsiladis said. \u201cThese are city kids.\u201dPerhaps he would have to go to a more remote area to find the next marathon star \u2014 higher, to 11,500 feet or 13,000 feet, where a promising barefoot teenager might live.\u201cMaybe the next Abebe Bikila is someone who doesn\u2019t know about athletics and has never heard of the Olympic Games,\u201d Pitsiladis said.He had more immediate concerns. Pitsiladis needed a current star to give legitimacy to his provocative theories and to pique sponsor interest in the Sub2 Project, which he estimated would cost $30 million. One of Pitsiladis\u2019s former doctoral students, Barry Fudge, had found his own willing science subject on the track in Farah, the British Olympic champion.\u201cYannis would bite his right arm off to find somebody like that,\u201d said Fudge, the head of endurance for the British track and field federation.Pitsiladis had hoped Kenenisa Bekele would be that athlete, but months of dealing with him suggested serious obstacles might still lie ahead as Pitsiladis applied his science to elite runners in Ethiopia.They had worked together before, as Bekele won the 10,000 meters at the 2007 world track and field championships in Osaka, Japan, and took double gold in the 5,000 and the 10,000 at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.Even then, Pitsiladis showed a knack for experimenting in training.To mimic the sticky summer conditions in Asia, Pitsiladis devised a thermal chamber in a home in Addis Ababa, employing heaters and kettles of boiling water while Bekele trained on a treadmill. Bekele then won his races with a punishing kick and regal eyes that seemed to intimidate others with their commanding intent.\u201cI really like the guy,\u201d Pitsiladis said. \u201cHe\u2019s the greatest athlete we\u2019ve seen.\u201dBekele made his marathon debut in Paris in 2014, finishing first and setting a course record in 2:05:04 \u2014 the sixth-fastest debut ever. But injury sideswiped him. At last year\u2019s Dubai Marathon in the United Arab Emirates, he dropped out after 18 \u00bd miles, and he withdrew from the London Marathon three months later.In July, Bekele arrived at Pitsiladis\u2019s lab in England about 25 pounds above his competitive weight of 123. He limped when he walked. His right calf was nearly an inch smaller around than his left calf.\u201cI thought it was over,\u201d Pitsiladis said. \u201cHe looked like a broken man.\u201dInjuries had piled up. A stress fracture in his ankle. A torn calf muscle. Strained Achilles\u2019 tendons. It was as if a string had been pulled, yanking Bekele\u2019s back and legs and feet, leaving his muscles out of balance.Bekele was 33. He surely would not be the marathoner to break two hours. (\u201cI\u2019m very close to old,\u201d he said.) Still, he hoped to make a comeback, to win a gold medal in the marathon or the 10,000 meters at this year\u2019s Olympics in Rio de Janeiro and, later, to beat the world record in the marathon.\u201cI have that vision,\u201d Bekele said.If Pitsiladis could restore Bekele, Pitsiladis believed, sponsors would find the Sub2 Project a worthwhile investment.\u201cThe whole world will believe in what I\u2019m doing,\u201d Pitsiladis said.His words were hopeful, if not a sure bet.The two men needed each other but had a complicated relationship. They seem opposites in perhaps every way but their willful determination. Pitsiladis is an extroverted scientist, Bekele a reserved and proud athlete, wary of science, or at least reluctant to change the training that brought him so much success.So although Pitsiladis and Bekele agreed to renew their partnership, it was full of operatic uncertainty. Again and again, Pitsiladis would say, \u201cWe\u2019re five minutes from disaster.\u201d They could not even agree on what foods were good for runners to eat.After a workout in September, Pitsiladis had Bekele stop his sport utility vehicle at a roadside stand in Addis Ababa and climbed out to buy bananas.Bekele took a bite and said, \u201cBananas are not good sometimes.\u201dPitsiladis told him: \u201cThey\u2019re good all the time. They refuel the muscles.\u201dBekele did not mean he disliked the taste.\u201cHe thinks bananas make you fat,\u201d Pitsiladis said.When he visited Addis Ababa in September, Pitsiladis found that Bekele had bought into some of the prescribed rehab program but not all of it. For the first time, he was working regularly with weights and using exercise balls to strengthen his core muscles. He agreed to quit eating cakes and to adhere to a traditional, carbohydrate-rich Ethiopian diet of stews and a spongy flatbread called injera.By late September, Bekele had dropped 11 pounds. Pitsiladis planned each meal, restricting Bekele\u2019s calorie intake to about 1,785 per day.\u201cJust enough to keep you alive,\u201d Pitsiladis told Bekele.Yet Bekele resisted the professional techniques employed by physiotherapists for the Sub2 Project. He preferred a simple massage from a friend.He was not the only Ethiopian runner sensitive about who worked on his legs.\u201cIf I treat five or six athletes in a day, they believe I can\u2019t help them anymore because I\u2019ve taken all the bad energy from the other athletes and it will affect them in a negative way,\u201d said Jonathan Schaible, a physiotherapist who worked with Bekele.Part of this distrust stems from beliefs in the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, athletic officials said. Religious figures known as debteras are considered fortune tellers and magical healers but are also said to summon spirits that bring misfortune and sickness. Some athletes carry protective amulets and sprinkle holy water into their workout bags, fearing that competitors could put a hex on them, Zeru Bekele said.In late September, on his way to train at Entoto, a eucalyptus forest above Addis Ababa, Kenenisa Bekele stopped to pray at a shrine outside the octagonal, brightly painted St. Mary\u2019s Church. He referred to debteras as priests and said he considered them \u201cvery clever.\u201d\u201cIf they want to make someone crazy, they can,\u201d Bekele said. \u201cIf they want to kill you, they kill you indirectly. You can\u2019t see, but they send some powers, some evil, to you.\u201dThis subject had been one of intense discussion between Bekele and Pitsiladis. Last summer, when Bekele went to England for treatment, the two sat in a car and talked for hours. According to Pitsiladis, Bekele told him: \u201cI don\u2019t need this treatment. All I need is for the priests to O.K. me.\u201dIf that was what he believed, Pitsiladis said he replied, perhaps Bekele should return to Ethiopia. He stayed. Pitsiladis, who is Greek Orthodox, gave him a painting of St. Raphael, who was martyred on the Greek island Lesbos.\u201cI wanted to demonstrate that, while religion may be important, don\u2019t let people use religion to take over your mind,\u201d Pitsiladis said. \u201cYou are in control of your destiny, not these people around you.\u201dWhen he left Addis Ababa in September, Pitsiladis seemed more encouraged. Bekele had agreed to regular physiotherapy. He was sticking to his diet.In early November, the tentative assurance evaporated.Bekele wore an unfamiliar pair of shoes on a long run and strained his left Achilles\u2019 tendon. His training became irregular. He put on weight and sometimes resisted physiotherapy.Plans for any exotic training methods affiliated with the Sub2 Project faltered. There would be only a desperate attempt to get Bekele to the starting line of the London Marathon on April 24, a race in which he would have to give an encouraging performance to qualify for Ethiopia\u2019s Olympic marathon team.In January, Bekele traveled to Munich to visit a popular and controversial doctor, Hans-Wilhelm M\u00fcller-Wohlfahrt. His supporters, including the Jamaican sprint star Usain Bolt, swear by him and call him Healing Hans.Pitsiladis accompanied Bekele to Munich, wary of the treatments. At least M\u00fcller-Wohlfahrt admonished Bekele to follow the rehab program the Sub2 Project had prescribed, Pitsiladis said. (M\u00fcller-Wohlfahrt declined a request for an interview.)When Pitsiladis returned to Addis Ababa in February, he placed Bekele on an even stricter diet, 1,000 to 1,500 calories a day. As his weight declined, so would the pain in his heel. That was the hope, anyway. The London Marathon was only 10 weeks away.In March, Bekele turned inward, secretive, as he sometimes had at the height of his career. He declined to tell Pitsiladis about his training regimen. He would not allow his physiotherapist to weigh him.\u201cHe likes to make history when no one is watching,\u201d said Mersha Asrat, Bekele\u2019s coach.Pitsiladis grew exasperated. But he had gotten Bekele in sufficient shape to run the London Marathon. Bekele was no longer the broken runner he had been. In an instant message, he told Pitsiladis, \u201cThank you for believing in me.\u201dPitsiladis replied: \u201cI believe in you 100 percent. And you need to trust me 100 percent. Then we can do it together.\u201dEliud Kipchoge of Kenya eventually won in 2:03:05, the second-fastest marathon ever. While Bekele was left to run alone in the final miles, he gamely finished third in 2:06:36. The running world buzzed about his comeback. If chosen for Ethiopia\u2019s marathon team for the Rio Olympics, he was expected to be a medal contender.\u201cIt was nice because I come back from injury,\u201d Bekele said. \u201cNot bad.\u201dPitsiladis hugged Bekele. Perhaps now, Bekele would more readily buy into a scientific approach to training. \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d Pitsiladis said.In any case, the Sub2 Project would continue. Pitsiladis planned to open a training center in Kenya and hoped to enlist Kipchoge. The International Olympic Committee had pledged funding to his lab for antidoping research, Pitsiladis said. The money could also be used for altitude research in the Sub2 Project. An American biotech firm had also shown interest, Pitsiladis said.\u201cI want to impact a life,\u201d he said of his desire to break the two-hour barrier. \u201cYou\u2019re here once. You want to do something that matters. I wanted to be an athlete in the Olympics. I didn\u2019t do it. So how else can you make a mark that you were here? I think it\u2019s important.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Runners-Up From Our Third Annual Student Editorial Contest", "Date": "2016-05-23", "News": "In November of 2009, President Obama launched the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEducate to Innovate\u00e2\u0080\u009d campaign, an initiative meant to elevate American students from the \u00e2\u0080\u009cmiddle to the top of the pack\u00e2\u0080\u009d on an international level. Since then, \u00e2\u0080\u009cEducate to Innovate\u00e2\u0080\u009d has raised a billion dollars for U.S. education. Notably absent from the deal, however, are English programs. In fact, a recent wave of neglect, disinterest and doubt seems ready to sweep English from its central position in high schools and universities. Why?In American schools today, STEM learning \u2014 science, technology, engineering, and math \u2014 is often given priority over everything else. The U.S. is scrambling to compete with foreign education systems, namely China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (which excels in STEM). But America is now producing three times the amount of university graduates majoring in STEM fields than there are jobs in those fields \u2014 clearly the promotion of STEM subjects over others has gone too far.Students have also come to regard English as an unimportant subject. I frequently hear other students remark: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only English class,\u00e2\u0080\u009d when they hand in a perfunctory essay or a slapped-together poem. But can students be blamed for their lack of interest? College English professors complain that freshmen who enter their courses have pitiful grammar skills, and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand proper sentence structure. They attribute this to increasingly inadequate high school English programs. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m lucky to be in a class where I can learn to write a formal essay.Meanwhile, the number of English majors nationwide is declining at a precipitous rate, giving many universities cause to reexamine the necessity of their English departments.Which raises the question: If young people are uninterested in English as a subject, and the government is going to lend its attention to STEM subjects, why spend time and money on increasingly superfluous English programs?Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why! In almost every profession, and certainly in every intellectual one, clear, concise, correct communication is key to success. No matter how brilliant a physicist, mathematician, engineer or biologist may be, he or she will find it impossible to share ideas without a firm grasp of the English language.Furthermore, there are, and always will be, endless questions pertaining to humanity, nature and all the intricacies of our lives that can never be answered in scientific terms. There is no other medium more devoted to these questions than literature. In literature, people are able to address and ponder massive, vital ideas. For the sake of literature, English has to remain an invulnerable part of education.Educators, students, those who care about American society \u2014 let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s revitalize our English departments nationwide. If we lose them, we lose not only our ability to communicate effectively, but our best means of exploring what makes us human.Works CitedConcussions are undoubtedly a serious issue in contact sports and the safety protocol regarding concussions should and is being improved. However, today when a coach, teammate or parent asks if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had concussions, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like admitting you have the plague. After expressing their pity for your perilous condition, many people question your decision to play contact sports and whether you understand the \u00e2\u0080\u009clong term effects.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Suddenly, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not only crippled but are uneducated about your terrible affliction and deserve a lecture on your decision to participate in the sports you love.Ironically, the concussed community is extremely knowledgeable on the effects of concussions and exactly what has happened to our brain. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard speeches from the doctors, parents and concerned relatives, and even our beloved ESPN has reported tirelessly on the negative effects of concussions. The last thing we need or want is another speech about why we should take our injuries seriously, as if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ignored the information that has been constantly presented to us.The constant reiteration and possible dramatization of concussions\u00e2\u0080\u0099 damage has caused the vilification of contact sports, particularly football. A New York Times article titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cYouth Tackle Program Is Being Eliminated in a Football Hotbed\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Ben Kelson covers how the town of Marshall, Texas, traditionally a town full of football talent, has disbanded its Pee Wee football program because of concern for the lasting effects of head trauma.Despite the overwhelming concern from parents and communities about concussions in contact sports, some scientists are preaching a message of calmness when discussing the current concussion issue. A STAT article titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Sky Is not Falling : Congress Looks at the Science of Concussions\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Dylan Scott, highlights Dr. David Cifu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comments during a congressional panel meant to review the dangers of concussions. Dr. Cifu stated, \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe sky is not falling\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Later adding, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe advances we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made in treatment are significant. I would suggest that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never been safer to have a concussion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Throughout the panel, Dr. Cifu claimed that people where overreacting to concussions and prematurely pulling athletes from sports.Dr. Cifu gives me hope that people can begin to look at concussions rationally. Rather than fearing concussions, people should be well educated on them and aware of how well concussions are dealt with medically. The process of reducing concussions and their effects is still maturing but is making rapid progress. By taking a serious but fearless approach, we can balance our society\u00e2\u0080\u0099s love of contact sports with the safety and longevity of our athletes.Works CitedIn 1960, a brand-new car cost $2,600, literacy tests were required to vote throughout the South, homosexuality was considered a mental illness, and the United States imposed a trade embargo on Cuba. Only one of those antiquated aspects of 1960 remains, and the time has come to update this d\u00c3\u00a9mod\u00c3\u00a9 policy.President Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Cuba policy, which would eliminate the embargo, would improve relations between the two countries, relieve the suffering of the Cuban people, and promote our economic interests.The original purpose of the embargo was to retaliate against Cuba for nationalizing U.S.-owned properties and trading with the Soviet Union. The embargo, we believed, would force Cuba to change its regime and improve the conditions of its people. That didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen.\u00e2\u0080\u009cDecades of U.S. isolation of Cuba have failed to accomplish our objective of empowering Cubans to build an open and democratic country,\u00e2\u0080\u009d President Obama has said (Charting). Indeed, the people who have been harmed the most are the average Cubans, most of whom live in poverty. Meanwhile, American companies are prohibited from expanding into a new nearby market.We are long overdue for a fresh approach that will serve U.S. economic interests as well as uphold American values through support for better treatment of the Cuban people.As a 17-year-old high school junior, it makes no sense to me that Americans can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t easily travel to, or do business with, a country that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 90 miles away because of actions it took more than 50 years ago. We should shape our future in ways that help both countries, rather than remain imprisoned by the past.Thankfully, the two countries are working to re-establish diplomatic relations. The American embassy in Havana reopened since its closing in 1961, and President Obama just concluded the first trip to Cuba by an American president since 1928. While he was there, he pressed President Ra\u00c3\u00bal Castro on human rights for the Cuban people and discussed trade and travel reforms, among other topics. The two countries even played their first baseball game since the year I was born, in 1999. In fact, in March the Obama administration legalized the direct signing of Cuban players onto U.S. teams, along with other jobs (Strauss).Critics say lifting the embargo will reward the Castro regime rather than the Cuban people. We have had 50 years of this policy; it hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worked. The best way to bring about change in Cuba is to deal directly with its leaders. By working with the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s greatest democracy, the Cuban leaders can only bring about beneficial reforms for their people.I hope that in the future the Cuban embargo will seem as outdated as literacy tests do today.Works CitedThe death penalty: one of America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most barbaric practices. Within the last forty years, over one hundred leading nations have moved to abolish capital punishment in stride with their progressive policies \u00e2\u0080\u0094 yet America lags behind in this trend. Despite the eighth amendment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prohibition of \u00e2\u0080\u009ccruel and unusual punishment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the federal government has not abolished the death penalty. In 31 states, executions are considered neither \u00e2\u0080\u009ccruel\u00e2\u0080\u009d nor \u00e2\u0080\u009cunusual,\u00e2\u0080\u009d surviving in varying degrees of practice. While some contemplate the specifications under which to apply the death penalty, the fact remains that capital punishment is inhumane and unconstitutional. The United States must abolish this medieval practice in favor of sentencing convicts to life without parole.All humans have a fundamental right to life. This principle is enshrined in our nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s governing laws, which prohibit individuals from taking others\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lives. Murder in the American justice system is the vilest offense\u00e2\u0080\u0094so why does our government bear exception to this rule? As often satirized by anti-death penalty advocates: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur current system kills people who kill people because killing people is wrong.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The American justice system acknowledges that the infliction of death is an atrocity of the highest reprehensibility; so why is it neither \u00e2\u0080\u009ccruel\u00e2\u0080\u009d nor \u00e2\u0080\u009cunusual\u00e2\u0080\u009d when perpetrated by the government?The death penalty in the United States is also arbitrary and discriminatory. Out of the tens of thousands of cases eligible for death sentencing, only a select few receive this distinction based on arbitrary qualifications. Studies demonstrate that death sentencing varies based on regional, racial and economic factors. For example, Texas alone accounts for 536 of the 1431 nation-wide executions that have occurred since 1976 (Death Penalty Information). Additionally, juries are more likely to convict criminals of minority races such as African-Americans or Hispanics, or convict those with subpar legal representation as a result of economic disadvantage \u00e2\u0080\u0094 an extremely subjective, non-standardized component of a process quite literally determining life or death.Contrary to popular belief, research comparing the United States versus Europe (where most governments have abolished capital punishment) indicates that the death penalty does not deter crime. Furthermore, victims\u00e2\u0080\u0099 families demonstrate no increased satisfaction resulting from perpetrators\u00e2\u0080\u0099 deaths. By dragging on for years, conviction processes actually force families to remain invested in trials without any sense of closure or ability to move on.Life sentencing is the best alternative to the death penalty. By avoiding death altogether, it omits the possibility of committing a grievous mistake in the sentencing process and violating human rights. Because it is also economically cheaper, the funds saved from this option could be redirected to providing emotional support for victims\u00e2\u0080\u0099 families. Ultimately, Americans must choose between preserving an antiquated tradition and protecting human rights.Works CitedEver since my introduction to the world of Scouting, I have been 99 percent on board. Through the program I have met people, gotten opportunities, and learned lessons that I would have otherwise never been exposed to. Their ideals and moral code are mostly wonderful. Just one little thing bothers me: \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo my duty to God and my country.\u00e2\u0080\u009d God was never a part of my life before I learned this line. Why does he have to be now? Why does Scouting, and society in general, tag \u00e2\u0080\u009creverent\u00e2\u0080\u009d on to the end of their moral code? This is counterintuitive: Humans don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need religion to be moral.In fact, recent research suggests that on a psychological level \u00e2\u0080\u009cniceness\u00e2\u0080\u009d goes beyond religion and even humanity. According to The New York Times article \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood Without God?\u00e2\u0080\u009d, other mammals such as chimpanzees have been seen to act in kind ways benefiting society. The article describes instances such as younger monkeys bringing water to an older arthritic monkey, and primates refusing to take rewards greater than are offered to their cohorts. Chimps aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the only ones: Dogs and mammals in general have been shown to act in ways that benefit their communities as a whole. Prospect Magazine has quoted British psychologist Margaret Knight explaining how humans, like all mammals, \u00e2\u0080\u009care naturally social beings.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Thus, life is more positive and fulfilling for all if members of a community act in a friendly and cooperative manner.I can hear you now: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo what if animals are \u00e2\u0080\u0098nice,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make them moral.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Okay, true. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNice\u00e2\u0080\u009d is not synonymous with \u00e2\u0080\u009cmoral.\u00e2\u0080\u009d However, morality is derived almost directly from simple ideas of goodness. The Scout Law, a sort of definition of the ideal Scout\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personality, is based off of simple, one word traits: \u00e2\u0080\u009cfriendly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009chelpful,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009ccourteous.\u00e2\u0080\u009d These traits aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t divine commands from deities or inspired writings of prophets: They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re traits any old Joe would use to describe a neighbor or friend. Morals do not stem from the divine, they come from more basic things, such as a need for a society to be happy. If morals are indeed a basic lubricant of society, then existing without religion isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t existing without morals.Works CitedAntony, Louise M. \u201cGood Minus God.\u201d Opinionator Good Minus God Comments.

Web. 11 Mar. 2016.When I was young, I was raised with television and movies giving me an image of Native Americans, showing me that they always wore feathers, wore only loin cloths, couldn\u2019t comprehend English, and were barbaric savages. I am a Lipan Apache. I guess I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fit the \u00e2\u0080\u009cIndian\u00e2\u0080\u009d mold.Growing up, I have always watched sports, especially football. When I was very young, I remember watching a Washington Redskins game for the first time. That day will forever be engraved in my mind. I saw people with red paint smothered over their whole face, wielding tomahawks, and wearing fake headdresses. This is the modern \u00e2\u0080\u009cblack face,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the modern blind racism. And there needs to be an end to this.A problem that has silently plagued America for quite some time is the mistreatment of Native Americans. Native Americans are constantly mocked by media and shunned by the government. Written in the American Declaration of Independence, indigenous people are referred as \u00e2\u0080\u009cmerciless Indian Savages.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Teen suicide and infant mortality are rampant problems throughout the reservations. According to The New York Times, native youth have the highest suicide rate of any United States ethnic group and natives suffer from infant mortality 60 percent higher than Caucasians. According to the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice, indigenous people are more likely than any other racial groups in the United States to be killed by police. One case is the killing of John T. Williams of the Nuu-chah-nulth tribe. John was a mentally ill 50 year old man, deaf in one ear, who carved wood for a living. John was shot four times by a police officer within seconds of dropping a knife and a piece of cedar he was carving. He died; the folding knife was found closed on the ground.We have the power to unravel these dilemmas and to truly fix them. The main root of these problems is the lack of knowledge and recognition. The casual American most likely wouldn\u2019t know that the name \u00e2\u0080\u009cRedskin\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a term for native bounty gained. The casual American most likely wouldn\u2019t know that native people are calling for help from the ruins of the reservations. The casual American most likely wouldn\u2019t know that natives are second and third class citizens in their own lands. We have the power to solve this, but we haven\u2019t taken big enough steps yet. Nothing has ever started without someone acting upon it. If we could resolve these predicaments, we could make peace with the tribes and government. Natives are constantly calling for help, but are continuously overlooked. Indigenous people protest their spirits out onto the road, but they are quickly consumed by the hum of American traffic.Works Cited\u201cThe Declaration of Independence: A Transcription.\u201d National Archives and Records Administration.

However, it is time Americans realized that frisbee has become something far more formidable and new. Yes, Ultimate Frisbee has recently burgeoned into a fiercely competitive, physically demanding and increasingly popular sport. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDisc\u00e2\u0080\u009d has an official governing body, international championships and potential inclusion in future Olympic Games. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time for Americans to break out the bandanas and start feeling the love for Ultimate Frisbee.There was, admittedly, a time when Frisbee was not a legitimate sport. The first Wham-O Frisbees of the 1950s were, at the time, mere toys. Tossed at casual get-togethers and college campuses, Frisbees garnered little serious attention outside the canine community. This image has stuck. Many Americans view Frisbee as nothing more than a laid-back pastime \u2014 one primarily reserved for Starbucks baristas.Behind the scenes, however, a Frisbee Renaissance had begun. In 1968, a group of New Jersey high schoolers invented Ultimate Frisbee, a sport combining the strategy of football, the athleticism of soccer, and the whirlwind pace of basketball with the unique loftiness of the Wham-O Frisbee. Two teams of seven (usually men and women) compete to connect passes for as many \u00e2\u0080\u009ctouchdowns\u00e2\u0080\u009d as possible. Layouts, soaring grabs, exotic throws (\u00e2\u0080\u009cthe scoober\u00e2\u0080\u009d is my personal favorite), and screaming hipsters only add to the appeal. Indeed, the game has grown by leaps and bounds. Between 2004 and 2011 alone, USA Ultimate (America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s national Ultimate Frisbee organization) memberships grew from 10,000 to 16,000 players. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDisc\u00e2\u0080\u009d has also grown internationally, now played in forty-two countries worldwide. Frisbee is truly the ultimate new sport.Why, then, is Disc dissed? The answer lies in the nature of the game itself. Ultimate \u2014 a self-consciously pure sport \u2014 has only one piece of equipment, no referees, no advertising agencies, no glittery stadiums, and no commercial interests to distract players from the joy of the game. It is a sport that relies on sportsmanship and integrity instead of jock attitude and fancy gear. This gives Ultimate Disc its hippie-anti-capitalist reputation, but also leaves the game unfortunately under-appreciated. No fancy gear means no big-money interest, so no media attention \u2014 thus Ultimate Frisbee flies under the radar of most Americans.The ultimate question facing Disc enthusiasts is how to legitimize the game without corrupting it. Because corporate interest would undermine its counterculture core, Ultimate must rise to eminence through its players. Ultimate Frisbee is already soaring in popularity on college campuses and public parks across the globe. It is high time the American public caught on.Works CitedAvirgan, Jody. \u201cUltimate Frisbee at the Olympics?\u201d The New York Times. The New York Times, 11 Aug. 2015.

As ugly as sexual victimization of female soldiers is, the stigma around male sexual assault leaves people speechless. The idea that men can be dominated sexually by other men is uncomfortable to hear and difficult to process, mainly because the public is under the impression that these acts of violation are sexually driven crimes. The truth, which may be even more disturbing, is that male sexual assault is generated by an unnatural military culture of dominance and detachment.Greg Jeloudov has a Russian accent. Upon Jeloudov joining the military, his fellow soldiers decided to educate him about who really controlled America by gang raping him. His isolating attribute was used as a reason to violate him along with his recentness to the military. Usual victims of military male sexual assault tend to be similar to Jeloudov: low ranking, of outsider status, or presumed gay. These groups of men are viewed as submissive and weak, making them easier prey. Most male sexual attackers are straight men. They are not interested in the sexual aspect of the assault. The focus is on asserting dominance. To win wars soldiers must be stronger than their enemies. Soldiers violate other soldiers to feel powerful, to feel like winners.Servicemembers are trained to view enemies as objects, not people. If the men they shoot at are thought of as targets, emotions are less likely to complicate pulling the trigger. Useful on the battlefield, this perception is toxic in a servicemember\u2019s daily life. Aggression and violence towards fellow soldiers can be justified because of a soldier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s detachment. By dehumanizing their victims, attackers remove the psychological damage of assault from their mind. Assailants are not the only ones who continue to foster the culture generating male military sexual assault. Many military officers are not keen to report sexual assaults because they tarnish the military\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reputation along with their jobs. Choosing not to pass on reports is much easier if officers do not personalize. Such a decision would be harder to make when seen as failing to protect a victim. Instead officers practice self preservation, another valuable combat skill that does not necessarily transfer well outside of a warzone.Sexual assault of men in the military cannot be shortsighted as an issue that can be generalized across all sexual assault or pawned off as a consequence of a man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s natural sex drive. The issue at hand is strictly military. In order to stop the brutal violence on male servicemembers, the military must reflect within itself and the culture it has generated.Works CitedCongressional Testimony.

Web. 7 Mar. 2016.You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve probably heard of them. You might even own a pair yourself. I, too, own a pair of Toms. For me, part of its initial appeal was the one-for-one slogan the company employs; for every pair sold, a pair is donated to children in need. Why not look good while doing good too? The shoes enable you to feel as though you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re contributing positively to others without truly applying much effort.The shoes might not actually \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo good\u00e2\u0080\u009d after all. The company may be downright detrimental to the communities it claims to help. For one, Toms undermines local businesses, as they simply cannot compete with the free shoes. Studies have shown that large-scale foreign donations can have extremely harsh effects on local employment. A 2008 study found that clothing donations to Africa resulted in a 50 percent decline in the region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s apparel employment.Additionally, Laura Seay, a professor at Morehouse College, contends that by donating shoes, Toms is \u201cjust treating one symptom of a much deeper problem, and treating symptoms is not a cure.\u201d Poverty is the root cause of shoelessness. The people who receive footwear do have access to cheap shoes but not the money to purchase them, and Toms is not doing much to address this problem at all. The business itself actually needs impoverished children to thrive. The use of a poor, needy child in its image is a crucial aspect of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s marketing.The shoes are not sturdy either. They last three months on average, but this time can be stretched to seven or eight months if cared for properly. Shoe drops occur about every two years; this, in conjunction with the very limited life expectancy of the shoes, is clearly not enough to sustain the children, especially those who live in rockier regions.Toms has made steps in the right direction. It has launched an eyewear line that contributes to an increase in medical employees who provide support for people in need of improved vision. This allows them to become employable and break the cycle of poverty. Additionally, Toms has begun to manufacture shoes locally in places such as Haiti and Ethiopia, which opens up job opportunities for people living in the area. Due to the small numbers of people they benefit, these decisions don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t solve everything. However, they begin to address some of the criticism Toms has received over the years.A pair of Toms is expensive, costing a hefty 55 dollars for canvas slip-ons. Overall, despite Toms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 efforts, these 50 plus dollars would be much better off being donated to a charity that can work to make actual progress concerning poverty, in areas such as infrastructure, education or health.Works CitedChu, Jeff. \u00e2\u0080\u009cToms Sets Out to Sell a Lifestyle, Not Just Shoes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Fast Company. 17 Jun. 2013.Downtown Miami and Brickell: Chamber of Commerce. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHaiti to Begin Manufacturing Toms Shoes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Miami Herald. 29 Sept. 2013.Herrera, Adriana. \u00e2\u0080\u009cQuestioning the Toms Model for Social Enterprise.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The New York Times. 19 Mar. 2013.Otto, Isaac. \u00e2\u0080\u009cToms Shoes Responds to Critics, but It May Not Be Enough.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mercy Corps. 24 Jul. 2013.President Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria has done wonders to help defeat Boko Haram, but much more still needs to be done. President Buhari\u00e2\u0080\u0099s military has captured many of Boko Haram\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strongholds and they have been able to stop much of the open fighting, so Boko Haram is resorting more to raids and suicide bombings (using mostly women). The President has said the government needs to target the root of the problem, yet they aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.One of Boko Haram\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most useful \u00e2\u0080\u009cassets\u00e2\u0080\u009d are women. Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vulnerability, lack of education, and absence of protection makes them easy targets, and it makes it easier for them to be manipulated. Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s susceptibility is one of the roots of Nigeria\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficulty in fighting Boko Haram. The military is \u00e2\u0080\u009cvexed\u00e2\u0080\u009d about why female suicide bombers participate in these attacks, such as the one on the Dikwa refugee camp, which killed 58 people. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because women aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t educated, protected or treated in ways that would help them to be targeted less.There have been recent reforms but, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAccess to education is still low, especially in the northern parts of the country where withdrawal of girls for the purposes of marriage or for caregiving is still practiced\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Women can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be expected to fight this evil if they aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t taught about it; they can only live in constant fear. Education is the answer to many worldwide problems, this one without exception. Starting early, girls need to learn about Boko Haram and how they can resist their tactics. They need to learn about what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening to their fellow Nigerian women so that history doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t repeat itself.An unfortunate yet true fact is that, \u201cSection 55[12] of the Penal Code applicable in Northern Nigeria, permits wife battery as chastisement as long as grievous harm is not inflicted.\u201d Not only are some women not being protected, but also their husbands are beating them. If the government wants to end Boko Haram, they have to gain the full confidence and trust of Nigerian women. The women can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give them this when there are laws that persecute and harm them and when new laws to protect them are vetoed. (The National Assembly failed to pass the \u201cAbolition Of All Forms Of Discrimination Against Women In Nigeria And Other Related Matters Bill.\u201d) To them it seems as if the government may sometimes be another enemy, not a trustworthy ally. If the leadership can give women more say by giving them seats in the government or by passing laws in favor of their rights, they will be on track to gaining their trust and to eventually being able to defeat Boko Haram as a united country.Works CitedAdikema-Ajaegbo, Grace. \u201cThe Rights of Women in Nigeria.\u201d The Lawyers Chronicle.

Did you ever stop to think where these clothes are going to go when they no longer fit your style. The desire of buying fast fashion may seem tempting, but the reality is as first world countries fill their closets with cheap trends, we continue to fill our landfills and our planet with harmful pollutants.Every day consumers are bombarded with hypnotic advertisements, whether in a commercial or on social media. Social shopping is a main reason for wastefulness in the fashion industry because of how fast trends come and go. When your favorite celebrity is wearing the newest jumper on the market and you just have to get your paws on a knock-off version, it can be hard to resist the urge to buy. To add on, now it is easier than ever to purchase a quick impulse buy. As of the first quarter of 2015, one third of online fashion purchases have been made on mobile devices. Kate Davidson Hudson, co-founder and chief executive of Editorialist states, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut now, everybody sees what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on the runways on social media and on blogs, and everybody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a critic, and shoppers want it as soon as they see it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. Americans need to be smarter about their purchases and recognize that every garment contributes to landfills for up to a staggering 80 years for that rubber soled shoe that was so last season.Not only are clothes filling up our landfills, but the production process is also contributing to a series of unhealthy practices for our planet. Cotton alone consumes 10 percent of the world\u2019s agricultural chemicals and 25 percent of the world\u2019s pesticides. Annually, in the United States, the fashion industry contributes to around 25 billion pounds of textile waste, this is about 82 pounds per person.Companies like Levi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and American Eagle have taken action into changing the way the clothing industry works by endorsing recycling campaigns. These new contributions are helpful, but it is not enough. Americans need to become more consumer conscious and think before buying that cute get-up because sooner than later it will be in a landfill. I am not saying to stop shopping, I am saying that we should become aware of the chain reaction that our purchases contribute to, so we can become a less wasteful society as a whole.Works CitedThe correct answer is D.All around the United States, students of different learning capabilities and capacities are pressured into taking the same or similar tests to evaluate their worth in this calculating society. It is believed that these tests are helpful to teachers and can collect reliable information about a student\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to learn. On the contrary, standardized tests are detrimental to one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mental health and waste priceless hours that could be used as instructional time. Therefore, they are hurting students rather than helping them on their educational path.When looking at long term effects, these stressful tests can increase the chance of a child developing anxiety issues both inside and outside of a classroom setting. A great amount of pressure is placed on these students to perform well and accurately represent not only themselves, but their schools and teachers as well. An article from The Washington Post mentions specific situations and reports, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTeachers are reporting children throwing up, losing control of their bowels, and increased commitments for psychiatric and anxiety issues [due to the pressure of standardized tests].\u00e2\u0080\u009dAnother concern regarding this issue is that it cuts into valuable instructional time. Hours upon hours are wasted conducting these useless examinations, not to mention the countless days of preparation. In our limited experiences, teachers have confessed that a specific topic was being taught only because it would make an appearance on a standardized test and not for academic gain.Many would argue that standardized tests are a useful tool and can help students prepare for further education. However an article from The New York Times states, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe report found that more test time does not pay off in improved learning as measured by student performance on the rigorous, federally backed math and reading exam known as the National Assessment of Educational Progress,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and proves the tests\u00e2\u0080\u0099 worthlessness.To conclude, getting rid of standardized tests would take a great load of pressure off of future generations and allow for a better academic experience. Students would be able to learn in an environment where they are more comfortable with their capabilities and will not be constantly compared with their peers.Works CitedThe Editorial Board. \u201cDialing Back on School Testing.\u201d The New York Times.

The human cost is not coming from the Qatari people themselves, but from the migrant workers who have flocked to the country. Most of these laborers have immigrated from South Asia, specifically Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan. In fact, from 2010 to 2014, about 1,200 migrant workers died on the job preparing for this major event. According to projections, this number will increase to 4,000 deaths by the start of the World Cup. This human cost is simply unacceptable. While a few workplace accidents are tragic and perhaps inevitable, this number should not be so high. This speaks to the dreadfully unsafe conditions in which the migrant workers work and live. Many workers live in shacks without air conditioning that are housing twice as many people as they were constructed to house. Moreover, the workers have almost no facilities to wash or clean themselves. These workers should not have to live in such dehumanizing conditions.The tasks the migrant workers perform are incredibly dangerous as well. The workers are constructing the hotels and stadiums necessary for hosting the Cup. These jobs can be dangerous if the working conditions are not as safe as they could and should be. For example, one worker died after being run over by a road roller. Many also perish due to dehydration from extreme heat and lack of access to water. In addition to these unsafe conditions, many workers are working extraordinarily long hours. Several female migrant workers interviewed by Mirror said that they work for 16 hours as waitresses, then are taken across town in a van at double capacity to work cleaning jobs. By forcing them to work for so long, the workers are being violated as employees and as people.On top of dangerous working conditions, they often do not receive as much pay as promised. Many workers sign contracts for the job, then are forced to sign less favorable contracts once the job starts. One group of waitresses was promised $400 a month, but instead only makes $275 a month. The employers of these migrant workers are disrespecting their employees\u00e2\u0080\u0099 rights by violating the contracts that both of them signed. In conclusion, the Qatari migrant workers are being cruelly mistreated by their employers and the system that they live in. 2022 is a long way off. Before then, the thousands working to make the Cup possible deserve to have their labor and their human rights respected. Drastic change is needed, before any more unnecessary deaths occur.Works CitedAziz, Omer, and Murtaza Hussain. \u201cQatar\u2019s Showcase of Shame.\u201d The New York Times.

Women like Patricia Arquette and Emma Watson have been spotlighted for speaking out on women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s issues, however, rarely do women who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t share their white, upper-class experience receive the attention that is needed to manifest the true goal of feminism.Intersectionality acknowledges that feminism is not one-size-fits-all, that each aspect of a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s identity (what \u00e2\u0080\u009csections\u00e2\u0080\u009d she fits into) contribute to her experience. For example, race, ethnicity, religion, economic status, ability, and sexual orientation are all contributors to the privilege a person might or might not have. According to the ideas of Kimberl\u00c3\u00a9 Crenshaw, a black woman who introduced the intersectional theory, \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u2026the intersectional experience is greater than the sum of racism and sexism, any analysis that does not take intersectionality into account cannot sufficiently address the particular manner in which Black women are subordinated.\u00e2\u0080\u009dOne example of typical \u00e2\u0080\u009cone-size-fits-all\u00e2\u0080\u009d feminism or \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhite feminism\u00e2\u0080\u009d is the way the wage gap is discussed. The most common number heard in this discussion is that women make 78 cents to every white man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dollar. However, this number is only true for white women. In reality, the wage gap for women and all people of color is even greater. For African-American women that number lowers to 64 cents, and for Latina women 54 cents.According to Jarune Uwujaren and Jamie Utt for the website Everyday Feminism, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbetween 25 percent and 50 percent of women experience gender-based violence (sexual violence, intimate partner violence, street harassment or stalking) in their lifetime.\u00e2\u0080\u009d However, as further explained by Uwujaren and Utt, using an intersectional lens reveals the whole story.Similar to using 78 cents to represent the wage gap, limiting statistics about gender-based violence without considering other factors besides gender disguises important trends in the data to which we as a society need to pay attention. For instance, although all women are at risk, bisexual women are far more likely to experience sexual violence. Understanding the difference in frequency and risk will help us better protect and find more justice for women.Some may object to an intersectional approach because it preserves differences. Some feel that intersectionality divides women \u2014 comments like \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy do you have to bring up race?\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cdoesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t this pit women against each other?\u00e2\u0080\u009d are examples of this position. However, acknowledging real differences doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t create them. Instead, the recent popularization of intersectional feminism has offered a way for all women to be there for each other and to find strength through their own differences.Works CitedCrenshaw, Kimberl\u00c3\u00a9. \u201cDemarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory, and Antiracist Politics.\u201d (n.d.): n. pag.

Web. 22 Feb. 2016.The fifteenth of March of the year 2016 was the day my father finally set foot on American soil for the first time in eleven years. It has been eleven years since America had told him he had to go, leaving behind his wife and three children. Last Tuesday, on a cloudy evening, my sister and I traveled to John F. Kennedy International Airport to pick up the man America has kept from us for so long. He never asked for this trouble; he just wanted one child to be born in New York so that one child would one day pull the family out of generations of poverty. What had to be done was done, and six months later I was born.The current immigration system is broken, as it has been for many years, and denies many who want to become law-abiding the opportunity to do so. Deportation of the undocumented separates families and causes the loss of the prime workers of our economy, who are sent back to the places they wish to not be in anymore. Although many Americans have qualms about illegal immigration, there are about 12 million immigrants like my father who need immigration reform now.The idea to make the perilous journey across the border just seems sensible in those who need to leave their country immediately. The Council of Foreign Relations reports that many of the undocumented come from countries ravaged by poverty and violence, such as Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. All of those coming into the country need to preserve their livelihood, but have to live under the accusation from Americans stating that \u00e2\u0080\u009cimmigrants steal our jobs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In truth, as reported by The New York Times, immigrants enhance our economy. Therefore, America owes them for the taxes they pay with every purchase they make and the earned benefits they do not receive due to their status.In addition, Congress needs to improve legal immigration, by accelerating visas for immigrants who are sponsored by family members. CNN reports the testimony of a woman who waited more than 13 years after being sponsored by the rest of her family, already living in the US, to finally be considered to come into the country.Ironically, the resources that politicians suggest we can use to deport every illegal immigrant are the very resources that immigrants made possible for America to have. Families and children should not risk being deported and separated from each other. Congress should immediately pass immigration reform that reflects American family values. I lost my father for nearly my entire childhood and thankfully I have found him again. I hope other families will not have a similar experience.Works CitedUntil I lost several months of my life, I had not wanted to believe that video game addiction was real. It took me two months at a wilderness camp to recover and now a lifetime in which I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to carefully consider my media usage. Gaming dominated every hour of my life. Even when my teachers, parents and friends actively tried to intervene, I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop. I used exciting adventures and action-filled shooters to escape from a dull-by-contrast world. I was absolutely hooked.Gaming addiction is being increasingly recognized by medical professionals as a \u00e2\u0080\u0098process addiction\u00e2\u0080\u0099 akin to gambling. Scans of the pleasure centers of brains of game addicts \u00e2\u0080\u0098light up\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in the same ways as of those addicted to cocaine or heroin. Video games are designed to be \u00e2\u0080\u0094 by the gaming industry \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a very active experience that draws in and immerses a player in a world they are reluctant to leave.China has government-sponsored camps to treat young addicts. It recognizes and understands this problem. America does not. Here, gaming addiction gets scant media coverage, if any. This is a serious mistake with such a large population at risk. 81 percent of U.S. households own a gaming device. In an Iowa State University study of gamers, nine percent showed signs of gaming addiction, indicating that three million young people are at risk.Society has mechanisms to help those who cannot help themselves. Families stage interventions, legislators ban sales of drugs, and doctors provide emergency services without regard to insurance. Those who need outside intervention and support deserve the same assistance as a burn victim who can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bandage themselves. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders does not list compulsive gaming as a clinical disorder, suggesting that it might be caused by unrelated disorders like depression or ADHD and saying it \u00e2\u0080\u0098needs further study\u00e2\u0080\u0099. Completely ridiculous. As I know all too well, gaming addiction dominates a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life, provides an escape, and causes withdrawal just like a \u00e2\u0080\u009creal\u00e2\u0080\u009d addiction. It must be treated like one, too. To start, the American Psychiatric Association should add gaming addiction into the DSM as a clinical disorder. In addition, the government should both sponsor campaigns that educate the general public and add video game addiction to the topics covered by health and human development courses in high schools. Based on my experience, the best kinds of treatment facilities are those that place kids in an environment where they have the opportunity for self-reflection and healing, sans devices.If this problem remains unrecognized, we may soon have a \u00e2\u0080\u0098lost generation\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of teenagers and adults whose entire lives are consumed by video game and media addiction.Works CitedRich, Michael, MD. Personal interview. Feb. 2015.I walked into the obscure, dimly lit room at the hipster affiliated \u00e2\u0080\u009cThink Tank Gallery\u00e2\u0080\u009d in Downtown Los Angeles. I was amazed by the fascinating concepts and social statements made through different mediums. My eyes darted around the room, internalizing all of the work, and figuring out which piece to analyze next. The group of women I was with, however, seemed to look at the art through different lenses: the camera lenses on their cell phones.The gallery was like a scene from a dystopian horror film, plagued by cell phones, opened Snapchats and Instagram photos. Instead of walking freely through the gallery, I had to stop every five feet so that I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get in someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s picture. It was like dodging bullets in some high speed action adventure. Everywhere I turned, there was another camera out, snapping a photo for social media.Ironically, the gallery was called \u00e2\u0080\u009cThink Tank,\u00e2\u0080\u009d possibly because the creators wanted to provoke ideas from the viewer. Instead, there was only the absence of thought in that big, cellphone littered room. People didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think for themselves, they just followed the social media buzz and hoped for a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfollow back.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kyle McMahon, a positivity activist and blogger, also observes this overuse of technology: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe aren\u2019t experiencing life. We\u2019re losing moments with every tap\u2026 We may be physically present with our friends\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 but we\u2019re texting someone else\u00e2\u0080\u00a6,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says.I suggested to a friend that she put her phone away, and she retorted by saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m older, I want to remember this!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Yes, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to document our lives and take photos so that we can reminisce, but when taking photos for the memories becomes taking photos for speculation or attention on social media, we need to draw a line. When did taking pictures for the memories become taking pictures for the likes, retweets or followers? When did a photo that says \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re having a great time!\u00e2\u0080\u009d turn into one that says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cEveryone look at me because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m out and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not!\u00e2\u0080\u009d?Caroline Tell, an editorial consultant, offers a possible solution for the overuse of cellphones in our technological culture: \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u2026Maybe the best way to curb cell phone overuse is by preying on people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s social insecurities. In some circles, being inaccessible is a status symbol.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Maybe we need to glorify cellphone abstinence to create an environment where putting our phones down is celebrated. An easier approach to the problem is by just putting our phones down. Turning them off. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need some drastic, radical change to lessen the use of technology. The solution is easy, and it starts by pressing a simple button.Works CitedIn a world where just six percent of applicants are admitted to Harvard University, high school students are looking for any edge to add to their resumes. Between September 2012 and September 2013, over 16 million teens between the ages of 16 and 19 volunteered within the United States alone. Today, thousands of teens are trading in the uniforms of their local hospitals for intrepid trips abroad.Teens take these \u00e2\u0080\u009cvoluntourism\u00e2\u0080\u009d trips in the name of philanthropy, while their ulterior motive of a college acceptance letter lurks behind the curtain of goodwill.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe problem with voluntourism is that it treats receiving communities as passive objects of the visiting Westerner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quest for saviordom,\u00e2\u0080\u009d explains Rafia Zakaria, a writer for the Pakistan English-language newspaper Dawn. However, some programs do provide proper training and educational opportunities for their teenage volunteers; participants must understand the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history and how to care for the people they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to help.How much are teenagers even helping these developing nations? Pippa Biddle, an outspoken critic of voluntourism, goes so far as to say that unskilled volunteers are often \u00e2\u0080\u009cdetrimental\u00e2\u0080\u009d to the people they think they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re aiding. Biddle went to Tanzania in the late 2000\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as part of a school trip; she and her classmates attempted to build a library, but these private-school students were so bad at basic construction that their work had to be redone each night.I am not claiming that all charitable teens are taking advantage of the less fortunate; a lot of teenagers go on these trips expecting to make drastic improvements in foreign communities. But what could they accomplish in a week? Who can end poverty in a few days? Sometimes these teenagers can actually make a difference, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great! But was it worth the $4,000 to spend a week in Kenya?As a high school junior, I witness classmates signing up for voluntourism trips in part for altruistic reasons but mainly to pick up story-telling fodder for their Common Application. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time that teenagers recycle the brochures and delete the emails of voluntourism companies. Parents, stop opening your wallets to fund voluntourism vacations. Teenagers, stop looking to the unfortunate as opportunities for personal gain. Teens, if you are determined to go, research the specific program and country to understand if the program is taking care of a real community need. Please continue to volunteer (and this means me, too) only if you are coming from a place of genuine generosity; if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just looking to improve a college application, then get an SAT tutor instead.Works CitedI love music. I love listening to music, I love playing music, and I love writing music. Sadly, ever since fifth grade, I have had to get all my music playing and writing outside of school: My school doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t provide any music training after fourth grade. My school and all other schools without music programs should try their best to add music education to the curriculum for all ages, not just elementary school students.Research shows that music education boosts students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 academic success. One study found that when schools with different music programs were compared, on average, the schools with superior music programs score 20 percent higher on standardized English tests and 22 percent higher on standardized math tests, regardless of socioeconomic status. Another study showed that when one group of children were given piano training, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe group scored 27 percent higher on proportional math and fractions tests\u00e2\u0080\u009d then the group that did not have piano training (Rauscher et al.). This is because music is full of math. Even when students aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t consciously thinking about the math behind the music, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re constantly exercising mathematical thinking while playing music, from logarithmic scales on a guitar fretboard to fraction multiplication in a drumming polyrhythm. Take it from Pythagoras: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is geometry in the humming of the strings, there is music in the spacing of the spheres.\u00e2\u0080\u009d An analysis of U.S. Department of Education data found that \u00e2\u0080\u009cStudents who report consistent high levels of involvement in instrumental music over the middle and high school years show significantly higher levels of mathematics proficiency by grade 12.\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Catterall, Chapleau, and Iwanaga).But music\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benefits extend beyond school; teens busy playing music are less likely to get involved with drugs or gang violence. Teens also learn good work habits from practicing an instrument and collaboration from playing in ensembles. In the words of Lois Hetland and Ellen Winner of Project Zero according to The New York Times, \u00e2\u0080\u009cStudents who study the arts seriously are taught to see better, to envision, to persist, to be playful and learn from mistakes, to make critical judgments and justify such judgments.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Lastly, music is an enormous part of our culture. Music training is crucial to growth of adolescents.Despite these advantages, increasing funding for music (or any program) in a public school is easier said than done. However, I do believe that parents, teachers, school administrators and voters should do their best to put music in our schools. As Plato once said, \u201cI would teach children music, physics and philosophy; but most importantly music, for the patterns in music and all the arts are the keys to learning.\u201dWorks CitedBarbie Izquierdo was raising two kids as a single unemployed mom on food stamps in inner city Philadelphia. In the food documentary \u201cA Place at the Table,\u201d she explains what it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like to be stuck in the cycle of poverty. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dream is to go to college, but I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell my kids you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll eat in two years.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The difficulty of feeding her family kept her from going to college. Eventually, Barbie got a job, but that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean things were better for her family. By exceeding the the maximum income for food stamps she was no longer eligible for government assistance. Barbie was working full time, and still couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afford three meals a day for her children.Barbie is one of millions of Americans who struggle to feed their families while working full time. In a recent report by The New York Times, Patricia Cohen explained, when workers aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t paid enough, they are forced to rely on public assistance programs. But what happens to those who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t qualify public assistance programs and still can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afford food? Despite the limited choices that SNAP provides, it ensures families something to eat. However, a family of three can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exceed an income of $2,177 a month to qualify for SNAP. Exceeding this amount by even a dollar makes someone ineligible, and many of these families go hungry.Food is often the first thing to be cut from the budgets of families living week to week. Housing and health care costs are often non-negotiable, so food is the only expendable item. Millions of working Americans are forced to make these cuts every day. In their 2015 Annual Statement New York City Coalition Against Hunger stated that, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOf the adults between the ages of 15 and 65 in the state, who were food insecure, 47% were working.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Over 1.3 million food insecure New Yorkers aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t homeless, they are living in tiny apartments, skipping meals and overlooked by government programs.Hunger is not a distant problem. It is a reality that many of our neighbors face daily. The working poor are overlooked by the government due to minimum wages that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cover the cost of living and programs that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expand to all those who need them. The government must consider the needs of the working poor and help families break the cycle of poverty. SNAP and other programs must be expanded to the working poor. In our country that is able to send rovers to Mars and explore the depths of the ocean, we must also be able to ensure that nobody goes hungry.Works Cited\u201cBasic Facts About Homelessness: New York City.\u201d Coalition For The Homeless.

{"Headline": "Alibaba Sales Up 39% on Increased Consumer Spending in China", "Date": "2016-05-05", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 The Alibaba Group, which owns China\u2019s biggest online marketplaces, is squeezing more money out of slowing growth.The Chinese e-commerce giant, which lists shares on the New York Stock Exchange, reported on Thursday a surge in profit and revenue in the first three months of the year compared with the same period last year. The company made more money by charging retailers to use its platforms, which connect vendors small and large with China\u2019s growing ranks of connected consumers.But the figures, covering the fourth quarter of the company\u2019s fiscal year, also showed stalling growth in the volume of sales over its platforms. Gross merchandise volume, a closely watched measure of the transactions on the company\u2019s websites, grew 24 percent compared with the same period a year earlier, about the same pace in the prior quarter.\u201cChinese consumers, with their healthy balance sheets and ability to spend, will propel China\u2019s shift from an export- and investment-led economy to a consumption-driven economy,\u201d Mr. Tsai said.For American investors, Alibaba has become a proxy for the Chinese economy. Though a sizable portion of China\u2019s retail sales take place on Alibaba\u2019s marketplace websites \u2014 Chinese consumers spent almost $500 billion on Alibaba last year \u2014 the company\u2019s sales growth outperformed the rise in transactions on its site.The results also showed the growing toll that Alibaba\u2019s forays into hypercompetitive areas outside its core business are taking on its finances. It said that its Koubei business, which allows Chinese consumers to order food and other items and services on their smartphones, had generated $135 million in losses for its parent company in the quarter.In his post, Mr. Tsai pointed to the patience involved in creating the company\u2019s Taobao marketplace, now the major sales driver of the company. He said the company would take a similar long-term view and continue spending on new businesses it thinks can help it grow.Still, Alibaba has made progress making more money from its main business.Unlike Amazon.com in the United States, which keeps its own inventory and sells directly to customers, Alibaba serves as a middleman and makes money from getting vendors on its services to buy advertising and other services. Although the amount spent on Alibaba\u2019s marketplaces has grown about 20 percent this quarter and last, its revenue from ads and commissions on those sites has grown 30 percent or more. In the longer term, investors expect those numbers to align more closely, meaning slower sales growth.Still, Chi Tsang, an HSBC analyst in Hong Kong, pointed to its continued strong cash position and dominance in online shopping as advantages. \u201cPeople don\u2019t think about how much cash this company generates,\u201d he said.Alibaba said on Thursday that sales rose 39 percent in the fourth quarter, to $3.75 billion. Gross merchandise volume rose 24 percent, to $115 billion. Its profit rose more than 80 percent, to $832 million. Minus one-time items, the company posted a profit of 3.02 renminbi, or 46 cents, a share, lower than the 3.60 renminbi a share that analysts had expected.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "North Carolina Officials Say They\u2019ll Defy Federal Deadline on Bathroom Law", "Date": "2016-05-05", "News": "Supported byRALEIGH, N.C. \u2014 The Republican leaders of North Carolina\u2019s General Assembly defiantly announced Thursday that they would not meet a Monday deadline to suspend or repeal a state law limiting bathroom access for transgender people, setting up a potential legal showdown over what has become one of the nation\u2019s most explosive cultural issues.\u201cWe will take no action by Monday,\u201d said Tim Moore, the speaker of the State House of Representatives, referring to the deadline the Justice Department gave the state to tell federal officials whether the law would stand. \u201cThat deadline will come and go.\u201dThough Mr. Moore criticized the deadline as \u201cunreasonable,\u201d he also seemed to signal that Republicans might eventually agree to alter the law, which forbids people to use public building restrooms that do not match the gender listed on their birth certificates.\u201cThe legislative process doesn\u2019t work where a response can be given by just a few days,\u201d he said, \u201cso we\u2019re going to move at the speed that we\u2019re going to move at to look at what our options are at this point.\u201dHis comments, as well as a private meeting later with a leading critic of the law, Mayor Jennifer Roberts of Charlotte, were indications that lawmakers here may be concerned about the potentially damaging consequences of keeping the law intact and defying the Justice Department.The Obama administration contends that the law violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and its finding could push the federal government to withhold in federal aid.\u201cWe had a productive discussion, and we\u2019re looking for solutions, and I look forward to further dialogue,\u201d said Ms. Roberts, whose city\u2019s effort to protect transgender people spurred the legislative drive that produced the law. She made her comments after she huddled for more than an hour with Mr. Moore and Senator Phil Berger, the president pro tempore of the State Senate.Neither Ms. Roberts nor Mr. Berger, one of the most influential Republicans in the General Assembly, ruled out additional meetings. \u201cWe had a conversation,\u201d Mr. Berger said. \u201cEveryone had an opportunity to express where they are. I think everybody\u2019s looking for solutions and hope to continue to have further conversations.\u201dWednesday\u2019s letter from the Justice Department brought new urgency to a debate that has surrounded the General Assembly for more than a month. In a letter to Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican, the department\u2019s top civil rights lawyer warned that the law was a violation of the Civil Rights Act because North Carolina was \u201cengaging in a pattern or practice of discrimination against transgender state employees.\u201dThe letter notes pointedly that the Justice Department could seek a court order to ensure compliance with the Civil Rights Act when it has reason to believe that such a pattern exists.Mr. McCrory, who is in a tough re-election fight, signed the law hours after the Legislature approved it in a one-day special session in March, arguing that it was a common-sense matter of privacy and public safety.But the law, which also prohibits local governments from passing anti-discrimination ordinances, prompted a fierce outcry from gay rights activists, as well as several major corporate leaders, some of whom canceled plans to create jobs in the state.That has brought severe headaches for Mr. McCrory, allowing his Democratic rival this autumn, Attorney General Roy Cooper, who has said he will not defend the law in court, to argue that the governor has not been the good steward of the state economy that he claims to be. In local and national news media, the debate over the law has largely eclipsed Mr. McCrory\u2019s argument that he has engineered a \u201cCarolina Comeback\u201d by cutting corporate tax rates and enacting other pro-business policies.Mr. McCrory \u2014 who is not as conservative as the legislative leadership and has clashed with them in the past \u2014 remained silent on Thursday amid speculation that he might be considering some kind of unilateral action to stave off litigation by the Justice Department.But several legal experts, as well as some members of the General Assembly, said the governor did not have the ability to suspend or revoke the law. Gerry Cohen, a lawyer, lobbyist and former bill drafting director for the Legislature, said that the matter was settled by the North Carolina Constitution, which states that no authority may suspend a law without legislative consent.Norma Houston, a faculty member at the University of North Carolina School of Government, agreed. But she said that Mr. McCrory did have the ability to engage in settlement negotiations leading to the suspension or revocation of the law.Mr. McCrory could raise that option with the Justice Department, Ms. Houston said. He could also direct lawyers for the state to enter into a negotiated settlement of a pending federal lawsuit that challenged the bathroom law in late March, in hopes of arriving at an outcome that satisfies the plaintiffs and the Justice Department.If a protracted lawsuit cannot be avoided, the political effect would be \u201cmostly bad\u201d for Mr. McCrory, said Ferrel Guillory, the director of the Program on Public Life at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\u201cStuff like that just interrupts and creates static at the core of his campaign,\u201d Mr. Guillory said. \u201cIt again raises a question about whether the governing authorities in Raleigh are on top of things.\u201dAt a White House news briefing Thursday afternoon, the press secretary, Josh Earnest, was asked if the letter was \u201cmeant to send a signal to other states that pass similar legislation.\u201dMr. Earnest replied by saying the decision to inform Mr. McCrory that North Carolina had violated federal law was made by the Justice Department, and \u201cindependent of any sort of political interference or direction from the White House.\u201dAt the Legislative Building here on Thursday, Lt. Gov. Dan Forest, a Republican, accused the federal government of engaging in \u201cextortion\u201d by effectively threatening to withhold federal aid for education. And he said that he did not expect Mr. McCrory to do anything to block the law.\u201cI expect the governor to stand strong,\u201d he said.Alan Blinder reported from Raleigh, and Richard Fausset from Atlanta.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": " PAID FOR AND POSTED BY The data gap often starts early. Barriers to birth registrations can impede mobility later, as well as access to health care and other essential services for mothers and children. The gap continues with male-biased surveys that fail to capture women\u2019s perspectives, their needs and their economic value.\u201cWhen we don\u2019t count women or girls, they literally become invisible,\u201d says Sarah Hendriks, director of gender equality at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.The dearth of data makes it difficult to set policies and gauge progress, preventing governments and organizations from taking measurable steps to empower women and improve lives, says Mayra Buvinic, a U.N. Foundation senior fellow working on Data2X, an initiative aimed at closing the gender data gap.\u201cNot having data on a certain area, behavior or society means that you cannot design the right policies, you cannot track progress, you cannot evaluate,\u201d she says. \u201cYou are basically not accountable.\u201dIn 2015, the member states of the United Nations adopted 17 Sustainable Development Goals to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity over the next 15 years. But without accurate global data on women and girls, there\u2019s no way to measure progress toward achieving the goals for gender equality and the global ambition to \u201cleave no one behind.\u201dThat\u2019s fueling efforts to close the gender data gap, from setting international standards to re-evaluating old, gender-biased collection techniques. Organizations are already trying new ways to gather, analyze and act on data to improve the health, education, economic opportunity, political participation and security of women and girls around the world.Old methods of data collection and analysis are often inadequate or innately biased, designed in ways that fail to take into account the reality of women\u2019s lives.Traditionally, for example, household surveys are anchored around a \u201chead of household\u201d \u2014 defined generally as the adult male \u2014 and regard other household members only in relation to the \u201chead.\u201d As a result, female-led households may be undercounted and overlooked in the distribution of resources.What\u2019s more, Buvinic says, survey questions may be based on traditional views of gender roles and therefore yield \u201cbad data\u201d that paints an inaccurate picture.For instance, labor force studies designed to gauge economic participation often ask only about \u201cprimary activity.\u201d These surveys were conceived with a very particular view of how work takes place, defining work as a typical 9-to-5 paid job mostly done by men, while women's unpaid housework and care work is not counted, Buvinic says.When a woman answers that her \u201cprimary activity\u201d is a housewife, the surveyor often stops asking her questions. The reality, however, is that many women around the world who are primarily housewives are also engaged in economic activities outside the home \u2014 in farming or enterprise \u2014 and by failing to question them further, asking, for instance, about a \u201csecondary activity,\u201d those activities are not counted. As a result, household surveys currently capture 75 percent of men\u2019s economic activities but no more than 30 percent of women\u2019s activity. Once the work of women is accurately measured, governments can start shaping policy and deploying resources to better help women as economic producers, increasing their productivity and income. The changes will \u201chave a very favorable impact on economies and on the GDP,\u201d Buvinic says.Change can be as direct as training and providing new tools to the people who collect and analyze data, or as broad as finding new techniques for mining existing data sets to separate or disaggregate responses by gender and age. Sometimes, new ways of finding and engaging women and girls must be invented.One such innovation is the Girl Roster, a toolkit developed by the Population Council, a New York-based research organization, and its partners to reach adolescent girls, particularly those in the poorest communities and marginalized from society. The goal of the Girl Roster, which is being implemented in parts of Africa, the Middle East, Central America and Asia, is to help programs build structures and determine methodologies suited for this often overlooked group.In the field, local program staff go door-to-door within a defined geographic area to ask key adults about girls who reside there, including information about their schooling, marital and childbearing status, and living arrangements. Data is recorded on smartphones and quickly collated to create a picture of the young women\u2019s lives and needs. The program staff then engage the most off-track girls in support groups designed to connect them with needed services and community resources.\u201cThe Girl Roster has helped us identify who\u2019s there and who is able to access services and then see how to target these girls who are not being reached,\u201d says Kelly Hallman, a senior associate in the Poverty, Gender and Youth Program at the Population Council. \u201cThe girls left behind are really what the Girl Roster is designed to try to address.\u201dThe challenges of reaching adolescent girls are underscored by a 2014 Population Council study, in which groups of boys and girls in South Africa\u2019s KwaZulu-Natal province were asked to map areas in the community they could access, including where they felt safe and unsafe. The research found that the area defined as \u201ccommunity\u201d by girls \u2014 their access to the public sphere \u2014 shrunk dramatically at puberty, from 6.33 to 2.62 square miles, while the range of boys expanded, from 3.79 to 7.81 square miles.The findings not only indicate that interventions and safe spaces are needed to protect adolescent girls from sexual and other types of violence, but also flag that these girls are being disconnected from programs and services that aim to help them.\u201cIt\u2019s really that invisibility that comes over girls as they enter into puberty, because their parents are trying to protect them and keep them close to the house,\u201d says Hallman, who co-authored the study. Other innovative programs are creating a virtuous cycle in which programs designed to empower adolescent girls are generating new sets of data that inform existing or future services. This reflects the need for data to capture nuanced and complex information on girls\u2019 lives, such as shifts in social norms or the impact of girls\u2019 participation in decision-making. In South Africa, the Girls Achieve Power (GAP) Year program uses sports not only as a way to help participants feel good about themselves but also provide a safe space to mentor them on HIV, teen pregnancy, sexual violence and the value of education.\u201cWhile we\u2019re doing that, we\u2019ll gather scientific data that will help us build even better programs for girls,\u201d says Saiqa Mullick, the director of implementation science at Wits Reproductive Health & HIV Institute and leader of the GAP Year program.Data alone, however, doesn\u2019t set policy, says Buvinic of Data2X. \u201cWe have to get politicians and countries designing programs based on data,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in generating all this new data if it\u2019s not going to be used.\u201dAccess to more data, of better quality and greater frequency, provides governments with a \u201chuge opportunity to be responsive to their communities and to provide services that meet the needs of the people using those services,\u201d says Emily Sonneveldt, Track20\u2019s project director.The new data also creates \u201ca responsibility to be responsive and to make sure that you\u2019re listening and digesting the data and information and using it to improve programs,\u201d she says.In other words, it provides \u2014 and requires \u2014 accountability.Still, she says, the governments she works with are excited about the opportunity to use data to make progress in measurable ways. \u201cThey want information that helps inform their programs and tells them how to do better.\u201dData gaps are closing, simultaneously revealing the promise of gender equality \u2014 and exposing new challenges.Since 1995, for instance, the number of mothers dying during childbirth has dropped more than 40 percent worldwide, though parts of the world have seen less progress. And though data show improved access to primary education, parts of Asia and Africa lag especially at the secondary level while all countries struggle with a gender gap in science, technology, engineering and math studies. Additional data will not only help uncover the sources of inequality but also guide policy makers, said Melanne Verveer, then-U.S. ambassador-at-large for global women\u2019s issues, at a 2012 conference on the gender data gap. \u201cData not only measures progress, it inspires it,\u201d she said. \u201cTo achieve the progress we seek and to make the best decisions we can, we need to ensure that women are counted in all that we do. Nothing less than our collective prosperity and security is at stake.\u201dThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
{"Headline": "Congress to America: Drop Dead", "Date": "2016-05-12", "News": "Supported byIn a moment, we\u2019ll get to the Zika virus.First, remember how scathing Republicans were about President Obama\u2019s handling of Ebola in the fall of 2014? They lambasted his reluctance to ban travelers from affected nations, with Paul Broun, a House member from Georgia then, even wondering if Obama had a \u201cpurposeful\u201d plan to use Ebola to harm America.A Fox News contributor, Dr. Keith Ablow, suggested in a radio broadcast that Obama perhaps wanted America to suffer from Ebola because \u201chis affiliations\u201d are with Africa rather than with America.Trump added: \u201cPresident Obama, you are a complete and total disaster, but you have a chance to do something great and important: STOP THE FLIGHTS!\u201d That was a reference to what appeared to be the G.O.P. strategy at the time: Let Ebola destroy Africa and much of the rest of the world, but try to seal off the United States from infection.In contrast, Obama\u2019s approach was spectacularly successful. With crucial support from Britain and France, and heroic efforts by groups like Doctors Without Borders and Samaritan\u2019s Purse, Obama deployed troops to West Africa and was able to pretty much extinguish the virus there, averting a global humanitarian and economic catastrophe.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had calculated that without an intervention there might be 1.4 million cases of Ebola in Liberia and Sierra Leone by January 2015. From there it could have catapulted around the world, killing millions, entering the United States, devastating the global economy and becoming impossible to eradicate in some places.Hey, Mr. Trump, do you still think that President Obama should resign for his handling of Ebola?All of that is worth reviewing because congressional Republicans are now again trying to block a sensible effort to address a public health crisis, this time a Zika virus outbreak that is steadily moving to the continental U.S., bringing with it calamitous birth defects.In February, Obama urgently requested more than $1.8 billion to address Zika, and Congress since then has done nothing but talk. Republicans have protested that the administration doesn\u2019t need the money, that they have questions that haven\u2019t been answered or that the request is vague. These objections are absurd.Even Senator Marco Rubio laid into his fellow Republicans a few weeks ago, saying: \u201cThe money is going to be spent. And the question is, Do we do it now before this has become a crisis, or do we wait for it to become a crisis?\u201dRubio is right. It\u2019s always more cost-effective and lifesaving to tackle an epidemic early.\u201cI\u2019m very worried, especially for our U.S. Gulf Coast states,\u201d said Dr. Peter Jay Hotez, a tropical diseases expert at Baylor College of Medicine. \u201cI cannot understand why a member of Congress from a Gulf Coast state cannot see this train approaching. It\u2019s like refusing emergency preparedness funds for an approaching hurricane.\u201dThe larger mistake is that budget cutters have systematically cut public health budgets that address Zika, Ebola and other ailments. The best bargain in government may be public health, and Republicans have slashed funding for it while Democrats have shrugged.He added, \u201cWe will pay a steep price for this particular shortsightedness.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Narrative evaluations are infinitely better than grades for educating students and measuring academic progress.Without an arbitrary stopping point, students often push beyond what\u2019s needed for a grade, and surprise themselves with what they accomplish.Narrative evaluations also enable students to understand strengths and weaknesses in their work and how to improve it. And they are more like real-world assessments, since grades will not be part of students\u2019 lives after graduation, but detailed feedback on performance will.In our research with our students, we found that those who thrive in a program based on narrative evaluations also tend to be highly collaborative and empathetic.When students do not chase grades, but instead rigorously pursue the questions that drive them under the mentorship of faculty, they focus on inquiry and innovation.

{"Headline": "In China\u2019s Northeast, a Daily Jostle for Jobs Produces Mostly Despair", "Date": "2016-05-02", "News": "Supported byShenyang JournalSHENYANG, China \u2014 Not long past the break of dawn, after downing a bowl of hot porridge and dropping off his son at school, Zhang Yuzeng made his way to a street corner near the Nanyun River. There, under the poplar trees, he rummaged through his toolbox.Pliers, check. Club hammer, check. Cigarettes, check.Mr. Zhang hung a sign on his scooter \u2014 \u201cElectrician, carpenter, plumber\u201d \u2014 and pumped a techno mix through his headphones. Then he waited.\u201cThere is no other way,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t show up, you won\u2019t be able to make a penny.\u201dNearly every morning for the last two years, Mr. Zhang, 42, has advertised his skills and looked for work here at the Lu Yuan labor market in Shenyang, one of northeast China\u2019s largest cities. Not so long ago, his prospects were decent: A day of painting walls or fixing toilets could fetch $50 or more.But as the economy has slowed and parts of the northeast have fallen into recession, temporary jobs have grown scarce in Shenyang. Restaurants are cutting back, and construction companies are struggling to pay workers. For the few remaining positions, the daily rate has dropped below $30.At the Lu Yuan market, the days begin with muted promise, as hundreds of workers gather along the banks of the Nanyun before sunrise, smoking cigarettes, eating sunflower seeds and sharing jokes.There are cooks who were once famous for elaborate buffets but now go hungry at night, and maids who spend their days tidying closets but live in squalid rooms that cost $1.50 per night. The workers wave signs and show off their tools, and pounce at the sight of halting cars.By early afternoon, after the street cleaners have swept away the last of the morning\u2019s plastic wrappers and the construction vans have disappeared, the workers set out for home. Some wander the streets, depressed and defeated.Shenyang, with a population of over eight million, was once a boom town, with its economy growing by 10 percent as recently as 2012. But under the pressure of a property glut and a downturn in manufacturing, the economy has slowed; last year, it grew by 3.5 percent.Mr. Zhang moved to Shenyang from the countryside when he was 18. With his knack for laying electric cables, he had grown accustomed to working almost every day.Now, sometimes more than a week passes without work. He worries that his wife, a waitress, might leave him. They have a 10-year-old son and a 20-year-old daughter, and their savings of about $3,000 are dwindling.\u201cI\u2019m sad,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a man in my 40s, and I can\u2019t give my family happiness.\u201dAs Mr. Zhang spoke, a beggar named Wang Baocheng appeared. Mr. Wang hobbles through the Lu Yuan market each day carrying a black trash bag filled with clothes and a statue of a monkey that he keeps for good luck.This morning, his forehead was bruised and almost entirely purple. He tried to persuade a manager at a heat insulation factory that he was fit for work. The manager was dubious, accusing him of having a drinking problem.\u201cIf you don\u2019t hire me, I will lie underneath your car right now,\u201d Mr. Wang threatened.The man offered a 50-renminbi bill, about $8, and Mr. Wang took it and stumbled away.On another corner, Zhao Yan, 58, a widow, struggled to get attention from potential employers in passing cars. She was looking for painting work, but said it had become more difficult for older laborers, many of them illiterate, to land jobs. She wore a blue hat with a Superman shield to set herself apart.\u201cIt\u2019s like a war,\u201d she said. \u201cBosses are picky. They will choose younger people over me.\u201dMs. Zhao said she often did not have enough money for food, subsisting on pastries that cost a few cents. \u201cOther people can eat cooked rice, but I only get porridge,\u201d she said.On a sidewalk near a gazebo, a group of construction workers cracked open eggs that had been boiled in tea. They joked that they lived in \u201clantian l\u00fcguan,\u201d meaning \u201cthe blue sky hotel,\u201d or outdoors.Still, some were confident the economy would eventually rebound.\u201cIt can\u2019t always be like this,\u201d said Huang Wei, 58, an electrician. \u201cIt\u2019s just like the stock market. After it declines, it will bounce back. But you never know how long that will take, and it\u2019s hard for ordinary people to estimate. Fate is in the hands of the state.\u201dIn a nearby exhibition hall, dozens of cooks gathered with cards pinned to their shirts identifying their specialties: pancakes, noodles, dumplings. They dressed neatly but not too neatly, they said, so the bosses would know they had experience. Workers who exaggerate their skills are often chased out of kitchens, they added.Outside the hall, a bulletin board promoted a government buzzword, entrepreneurship, and urged residents to start their own businesses. The display offered brief biographies of an eclectic set of role models \u2014 including Walt Disney, the inventor James Watt and the radio pioneer Guglielmo Marconi \u2014 and explained how the toy manufacturer Mattel has turned Barbie dolls into valuable collector\u2019s items.\u201cInnovation is the inexhaustible source of the progress of a nation,\u201d read one slogan.Workers ignored the display, gathering by the nearby noodle stands to smoke instead.Mr. Zhang sat on a stool in his corner, passing the day listening to music and talking with friends. He had polished and organized his tools, tucking them away in towels and plastic bags.When a black BMW 740Li stopped on the street, Mr. Zhang and several electricians rushed to the passenger window. A man needed help hanging a light. After a few minutes of negotiations, the car sped away: The man had refused to pay more than $30, and the workers said the job was too far away to be worth taking.On days like this, Shenyang can seem especially gray. The river flows slowly. Arguments break out over jobs, sometimes turning violent. People talk about solving their problems by jumping into the river. Usually, they are joking.Mr. Zhang said he often felt frustrated by the uncertainty of the job market. As a child growing up in a village in the eastern province of Shandong, he had dreamed of becoming a soldier. But his family did not have the connections to get him into the military, and he did not attend high school.When he moved to Shenyang in 1991, his ambitions were revived, and he became a carpenter, thinking he could one day be a boss. \u201cI was like a newborn calf, unafraid of tigers,\u201d he said, invoking a Chinese proverb.Now, Mr. Zhang said, he had no choice but to return to the Lu Yuan market each morning, even if his prospects are dim. \u201cI have no other options,\u201d he said.A friend motioned to the water. \u201cThere\u2019s always the river,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "North Korea\u2019s Brazen Nuclear Moves", "Date": "2016-05-02", "News": "Supported byEditorialIn January, the North carried out its fourth nuclear test, and the following month it conducted a test of a long-range ballistic missile, the kind that could one day carry a nuclear weapon to hit the United States. It claimed to have tested a more powerful rocket engine and to have succeeded at shrinking the size of a nuclear weapon so it can fit on a missile.Though the four most recent tests failed in one way or another, North Korea\u2019s overall activity this year has raised regional tensions and highlighted the inability of the major powers, specifically the United States and China, to curb the North\u2019s dangerous ambitions.The launch failures are an embarrassment for Mr. Kim and have led to speculation that he might attempt another nuclear test \u2014 North Korea\u2019s fifth since 2006 \u2014 before the party congress, where he hopes to tighten his grip on power. That would inevitably lead to more sanctions and accelerate talks between the United States and South Korea on stationing missile defenses in South Korea.While sanctions are important and China, more than any other country, has the power to make North Korea feel their effects, sanctions alone are not enough to mitigate the threat. Backing an inexperienced and reckless leader like Mr. Kim into a corner is risky and might lead to even more dangerous responses, like aiming a weapon at South Korea or Japan, with potentially catastrophic results.At some point, the United States, along with China, South Korea, Japan and Russia, will have to find a way to revive negotiations aimed at curbing North Korea\u2019s nuclear program. The Obama administration earlier this year had secret contacts with the North that foundered over a disagreement on whether to focus on denuclearization (America\u2019s priority) or on replacing the current Korean War armistice with a formal peace treaty (North Korea\u2019s priority). But the idea of talking with the North is politically unpopular in America, and this is an election year.If something like that happens, the administration should be nimble and creative enough to work with such a proposal, despite the obvious difficulties of dealing with Mr. Kim. So far, though, President Obama has shown little interest in applying the approach that he pursued successfully with Iran \u2014 a combination of sanctions and negotiations \u2014 to North Korea.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "20 Years Later, Welfare Overhaul Resonates for Families and Candidates", "Date": "2016-05-01", "News": "Supported byRetro ReportIn a sense, this is a \u201cBack to the Future\u201d presidential campaign, with candidates revisiting a specific time in the past to explain \u2014 and often lament \u2014 where the country is today. That period is often the 1990s, during Bill Clinton\u2019s White House watch. It was when stricter anti-crime measures and looser financial regulations came into being, policies now attacked almost daily by contenders offering voters their visions and revisions.One \u201cBack to the Future\u201d issue from the \u201990s has received relatively scant attention, but the next president may have a hard time avoiding it, for it affects millions of Americans. It involves the welfare system, overhauled in 1996 by a Republican Congress and a Democratic president, Mr. Clinton, who had pledged to \u201cend welfare as we know it.\u201d He made good on that promise. Welfare as we knew it went away.In 1996, the political stars aligned to undo a welfare structure created in 1935 as part of the New Deal. Under that system, known in its final incarnation as Aid to Families With Dependent Children, government cash was an entitlement that the poor could claim, with no limits on the amount of available money or on how long payments would continue. But in the anti-welfare backlash that eventually developed, \u201centitlement\u201d became a dirty word, certainly among conservative Republicans but also among many centrist Democrats. Americans on welfare, hardly a powerful political force, found themselves routinely characterized as loafers and cheats.The 1996 law signed by President Clinton threw out that New Deal remnant and replaced it with Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF. The new program created work rules and time limits. Poor people could still receive government cash, but for no more than two consecutive years and for no more than a total of five years. Instead of receiving an unrestricted dollar flow from Washington, states were now given block grants, fixed sums totaling $16.5 billion a year. The states had plenty of leeway on how to spend the money. They could also tighten the five-year limit; some chose to let the clock run out on the poor after only a couple of years.For a while, the Jeremiahs seemed to be losing the argument. Welfare rolls shrank, and then shrank some more. Having once approached 14 million, the number of people benefiting from TANF\u2019s federal money and related state funds shriveled year by year, hovering around four million in 2015. In the first few years of TANF, hundreds of thousands of welfare mothers found jobs. Poverty rates declined. So did hunger among children. One year after signing the 1996 legislation, Mr. Clinton confidently told an audience that \u201cit\u2019s fair to say the debate is over \u2014 we now know that welfare reform works.\u201dBut did it?Things went swimmingly at first, principally because the American economy was humming in the late \u201990s. The long haul told a different story. An economic slump at the start of the 21st century cost many of those newly employed mothers their jobs. Times got much rougher in the severe recession of 2007 and 2008. The safety net that TANF was supposed to provide began to look highly porous.National poverty rates remain stubbornly high, staying in recent years at 15 percent. While initially effective in getting people off welfare, the system proved far less nimble at making them financially sound. Even when they found jobs, the wages tended to nudge them barely above the poverty line. And, all too often, they had a hard time staying employed when the economy soured. The poorest are usually ill prepared to flourish in a world where the technology and service industries are increasingly dominant.Those federal block grants did not bring salvation, either. For starters, the annual total, $16.5 billion, has remained frozen for 20 years, meaning they are worth one-third less than they were in 1996. States may use the money as they wish, even if it means straying far from the original intent. Instead of becoming cash subsidies to destitute families or underwriting job-training programs, the grants are commonly used to finance college scholarships or child care arrangements \u2014 or simply to plug holes in state budgets.For Arizona officials, the temptation to divert federal dollars to purposes other than welfare proved \u201cjust too great,\u201d said Jodi Liggett, a vice president of Planned Parenthood Arizona and a former senior policy adviser in the governor\u2019s office. \u201cThere is this big, fat bag of money with TANF written on the outside of it,\u201d Ms. Liggett told Retro Report.Clarence H. Carter, a former director of Arizona\u2019s Department of Economic Security, defended the diversion of funds. \u201cThey were used to support another important function of the safety net, and that\u2019s strengthening families,\u201d said Mr. Carter, who resigned last year amid controversy over how his agency had handled child abuse cases. \u201cSo the moneys were not hijacked.\u201dNationwide, the Census Bureau counts 46.7 million Americans as living in poverty, which for a family of three (typically a mother and two children) means annual earnings of less than $20,160. About 20 million people live in deep poverty, with earnings below $10,000 a year for a family of three. In 2014, the last year with full census figures, the poverty rate among children \u2014 people under 18 \u2014 was 21 percent.Plainly, government cash payments are not what they used to be. In 1996 they went to 68 percent of families with children that qualified as impoverished, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group in Washington. Now they go to 23 percent. In some states, the figure is minuscule: 8 percent in Arizona, 5 percent in Texas, 4 percent in Louisiana.Now some conservative lawmakers want to give control over food stamps to the states, just as was done with welfare. This time, they probably cannot count on an ally in Mr. Clinton, who acknowledges that ending welfare as we knew it was hardly synonymous with ending poverty as we knew it.\u201cIt did far more good than harm,\u201d Mr. Clinton said of the 1996 law in a speech two years ago. \u201cBut now, given the changed climate and the aftermath of the crash, the poorest welfare families, about 15 percent of the total, are worse off.

{"Headline": "A Universal Basic Income Is a Poor Tool to Fight Poverty", "Date": "2016-05-31", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneWhy doesn\u2019t the government just give everybody money?Figure out a reasonable amount \u2014 the official poverty line amounts to about $25,000 for a family of four; a full-time job at $15 an hour would provide about $30,000 a year \u2014 and hand every adult a monthly check. The minimum-wage worker stretching to make it to payday, the single mother balancing child care and a job \u2014 everybody would get the same thing.Poverty would be over, at a stroke.Being universal \u2014 that is, for the homeless and the masters of the universe alike \u2014 the program would be free of the cumbersome assessments required to determine eligibility. It would also escape the stigma typically attached to programs for the poor.In the United States, the idea has the support of thinkers on the left like Andrew Stern, former president of the Service Employees International Union. Some thinkers on the right, too, have managed to overcome their general distaste for government welfare to support the idea. This month, Charles Murray of the American Enterprise Institute will publish an updated version of his plan to replace welfare as we know it with a dollop of $10,000 in after-tax income for every American above the age of 21.Where would that money come from? It amounts to nearly all the tax revenue collected by the federal government. Nothing in the history of this country suggests Americans are ready to add that kind of burden to their current taxes. Cut it by half to $5,000? That wouldn\u2019t even clear the poverty line. And it would still cost as much as the entire federal budget except for Social Security, Medicare, defense and interest payments.As Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary and onetime top economic adviser to President Obama, told me, paying a $5,000 universal basic income to the 250 million nonpoor Americans would cost about $1.25 trillion a year. \u201cIt would be hard to finance that in a way that wouldn\u2019t burden the programs that help the poor,\u201d he said.The popularity of the universal basic income stems from a fanciful diagnosis born in Silicon Valley of the challenges faced by the working class across industrialized nations: one that sees declining employment rates and stagnant wages and concludes that robots are about to take over all the jobs in the world.That might lie in our future \u2014 I will devote my next column to discussion of such a universe. But it\u2019s certainly not our present. Men at their prime working ages, 25 to 54, have been falling out of the labor force since the 1960s. Still, today more than eight out of every 10 Americans in their prime are working.Work, as Lawrence Katz of Harvard once pointed out, is not just what people do for a living. It is a source of status. It organizes people\u2019s lives. It offers an opportunity for progress. None of this can be replaced by a check.A universal basic income has many undesirable features, starting with its non-negligible disincentive to work. Almost a quarter of American households make less than $25,000. It would be hardly surprising if a $10,000 check each for mom and dad sapped their desire to work.To libertarians this will sound more like a feature than a flaw, but replacing everything in the safety net with a check would limit the scope of government assistance in damaging ways. Say we know the choice of neighborhood makes a difference to the development of poor children. Housing vouchers might lead them to move into a better one. A monthly check would probably not.And those who think a universal benefit would be more politically resilient than a means-tested one might stop to ponder the unceasing chatter about trimming Social Security.It is undoubtedly true that the American safety net needs fixing. Fifty million Americans live in poverty. Sixteen million live on the equivalent of $8.60 a day. Providing more income security for the struggling working class would not only produce a more equitable society, it would also increase spending and improve economic growth.In this world, though, where work remains an important social, psychological and economic anchor, there are better tools to help than giving every American a monthly check.How about subsidized employment? The government could subsidize jobs as varied as school repairs and fixing potholes. \u201cThis would provide employment while doing things that improve productivity and improve people\u2019s lives,\u201d Mr. Greenstein said.Advertisement"}

His office sits on an unpaved road and experiences frequent power failures, so his employees have grown used to working in the dark.\u201cPeople are patient,\u201d Mr. Lokule said. \u201cBut of course we\u2019ve been frustrated because of a lack of this, a lack of that.\u201dSouth Sudan has, at least officially, just emerged from more than two years of a brutal civil war that killed tens of thousands of people and displaced over two million.Much of the damage remains. Even here in the capital, nearly 28,000 people are still sheltering in a United Nations camp on the outskirts of the city. Many of them fled their homes in December 2013 after troops loyal to President Salva Kiir clashed with those loyal to Riek Machar, who had been dismissed that year as vice president, and killed hundreds of civilians in the city during the early stages of the war.Since then, most of the war\u2019s atrocities, often perpetrated along ethnic lines, have occurred far from Juba, in the country\u2019s north and east. Civilians were killed deliberately. Child soldiers were recruited to fight. Women were raped en masse.In recent weeks, the country\u2019s top priority has been to form a transitional government that strikes a delicate peace between former warring rivals. But South Sudan\u2019s governing elite have done little to focus on something just as critical to the country\u2019s health: righting the devastated economy.\u201cYou cannot talk about improving the economic situation now, because peace and security are the cornerstones for whatever you do,\u201d Michael Makuei, the country\u2019s minister of information, said last month as the government was being formed.Both leaders claim membership in the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Movement, which began in 1983 as the political wing of an army fighting for autonomy from Sudan.But the party has always been divided by power struggles. Since South Sudan achieved independence in 2011, the movement has functioned less like a political party and more like a tenuous coalition of war veterans who have never quite been able to put down their weapons. Its members have been accused of committing war crimes, fanning the flames of ethnic tension and profiting from rampant corruption.\u201cOur apologies to the people of South Sudan for the situation we, the leaders, have created,\u201d Mr. Kiir said in a speech after Mr. Machar resumed his post. \u201cYou have been patient throughout the duration of the crisis.\u201dMore than half of South Sudan\u2019s roughly 12 million people live below the poverty line. Food prices have skyrocketed because of inflation. People are dying in hospitals where medical supplies are running low. Oil fields were damaged in the war, slashing production to less than half of peak levels.Now, saddled with fees and debt repayments totaling about $25 for every barrel of crude exported via Sudan \u2014 and facing low oil prices globally \u2014 South Sudan is desperately short on hard currency.Mr. Machar, who met with officials from the International Monetary Fund last week to discuss a much-needed economic recovery, insisted before his return to the capital that if the peace plan was followed, development would come.\u201cThe money spent by the government on perpetrating the war will be available for other things,\u201d he said.People in the capital are struggling to make ends meet. Abraham Matoch, 27, a laptop technician, said his workplace had not had a regular electricity supply for about two years. So he pays top dollar for power from privately owned generators, many of which run on fuel from the black market. His business is barely profitable, but he said his five siblings relied on him for support.\u201cAll I want is for the economy to be stable,\u201d he said.In order to secure the outside funding that South Sudan sorely needs, the country\u2019s leaders must prove their ability to govern. But high-level officials argue that the transitional government has much to accomplish before it can address the problems plaguing the population.To that end \u2014 and despite the lack of cash \u2014 South Sudan\u2019s government has expanded. A new cabinet of 30 ministers was appointed shortly after Mr. Machar\u2019s arrival, with former rebels leading 10 ministries, including those of the interior, mining and petroleum.Lam Akol, a veteran of the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Movement who now leads an opposition party, became the minister of agriculture \u2014 a sector about which, he admitted, he knows very little.During his first few hours in office, he greeted a parade of well-wishers from behind his huge desk, offering candy and cookies as the electricity supply sputtered.\u201cI don\u2019t deny that many of the problems have been personal,\u201d he said of the government\u2019s internal power struggles. \u201cBut now there are many centers in this government, ensuring that no one center is controlling everything.\u201dTroops from both sides of the conflict are undergoing a balancing act of their own. Leaders of the two armies have begun talks on how to enforce security in Juba. The plans include the formation of a police force with 1,500 recruits from each side.Col. William Gatjiath Deng, a spokesman for Mr. Machar\u2019s troops, said he was disappointed that the government had been slow to demilitarize the capital in accordance with the peace plan. He also acknowledged that some of his troops might have trouble adapting to the transition after two years of conflict.\u201cThey are still holding the violence in their minds,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we trained them. We told them we are here for peace.\u201dThe soldiers, who do not know when they will receive salaries, have settled in a garrison on the edge of Juba and have built small homes out of wood, straw and mud. During the day, civilians from the nearby displaced persons camp are welcomed into the makeshift barracks. Women have volunteered as cooks, preparing huge vats of beans to distribute to the troops.Nyakoang Doar, 54, who has been living in the United Nations camp since her husband and three of her six children were killed in December 2013, said the government had not stopped killing civilians in Mr. Machar\u2019s ethnic group, the Nuer, until his soldiers had begun to arrive here this year.\u201cWe women are really suffering,\u201d she said, pointing a finger at Colonel Gatjiath as she waited for a batch of beans to boil. \u201cYou men are not doing so well.\u201dSince the formation of the transitional government, reports of violent skirmishes across the country have raised fears that South Sudan will not be able to maintain peace in the buildup to national elections in 2018, in which Mr. Machar could square off with Mr. Kiir once again for control of the party.But technocrats like Mr. Lokule hope the country can put personal politics aside for now, and focus instead on a blueprint for development that will attract foreign investors. He said he was proud to be involved in the establishment of a new national tax revenue authority, which should come to fruition soon as part of the peace deal.\u201cWhen we split from Sudan, we came with the spirit to build a country,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope everything will be O.K., and this depends on keeping the peace.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Trump and Hillary Clinton became all but certain on Tuesday after Mr. Trump\u2019s decisive victory in Indiana.He would begin that matchup at a significant disadvantage.Mr. Trump\u2019s ratings are worst with the voters who made up the so-called Obama coalition of young, nonwhite and well-educated voters who propelled President Obama\u2019s re-election four years ago.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s strength among young, nonwhite and well-educated voters would be enough to make her a favorite. The G.O.P. path to victory without adding some of these voters is narrow. The Republicans would need to do nearly as well among white voters as Ronald Reagan did in his 18-point re-election landslide in 1984 merely to fight to a draw in today\u2019s far more diverse country. Nonwhite voters could make up nearly 30 percent of the electorate in 2016, up from 14 percent in 1984.But what raises the possibility of a more decisive defeat for Mr. Trump is that he is struggling to reunite the voters who supported Mr. Romney \u2014 especially white women and white college-educated voters.Mr. Trump has even trailed in a poll in strongly Republican Utah, which is one of the best-educated states in the country. It\u2019s unlikely that Mrs. Clinton could win Utah in the end, but it\u2019s nonetheless telling that Mr. Trump trails in a survey of a state where Democrats have not reached 35 percent of the vote in the last 11 presidential elections.The same NBC/Marist survey showed Mrs. Clinton leading in western Pennsylvania, where Mr. Obama lost many registered Democrats to Mr. Romney.Part of the problem for Mr. Trump is that the anger that has driven his success in the Republican primaries isn\u2019t seen at the same levels in the general electorate.By all of these measures, national political and economic conditions are more favorable to the president\u2019s party than they were at this time in 2012, when Mr. Obama won re-election. These indicators might make Mrs. Clinton a slight favorite even if she were facing a more typical Republican nominee. Instead, it seems she will be facing a nominee who has both defied expectations and created enormous challenges for himself.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York Is Not Houston: Readers Take Turn on Building a Better City", "Date": "2016-05-24", "News": "Supported byUrban FabricWe have collected some of their thoughts, in the hopes of continuing the conversation about the unexpected and inexplicable ways in which zoning has shaped New York \u2014 and the ways it will no doubt continue to do so.One big debate: Does the fact that 40 percent of buildings in Manhattan are out of compliance with current zoning rules mean the city should revise those rules? Many readers saw a need for an overhaul, while others feared the rampant development that could follow.Aurther Phleger of Sparks, NVI find it amusing to hear the same people who elect to live in the most dense city (NY) in the most dense borough (Manhattan) and even in the most dense neighborhoods (Village, Midtown, UWS etc.) then complain that it\u2019s too dense and crowded without realizing that the high density and buzz is why they decided to live there in the first place. For me, most zoning laws in places like NY and San Francisco with the emphasis on low-rise buildings and \u201clivable neighborhoods\u201d create the worst of both worlds. They lack the buzz of a Midtown or Hong Kong but also lack the convenience and peace of the suburbs. Things are too far to walk but you can\u2019t drive easily either. If you don\u2019t like the density of Manhattan, then move to Brooklyn or further out. Don\u2019t ruin a great city for the rest of us. Had NY been built with today\u2019s zoning, it would be a very boring place.Max Star of Murray Hill, ManhattanI live in a 19th-century townhouse and hate the thought of tearing down pre-WWII buildings in New York. But, if they do, they should build big, dense buildings. And ones that are not even with the buildings around them. That makes it boring. Tearing down a six-story old building and rebuilding a six-story modern building just because they could rent a modern building for more seems like a shame. The worst example of this is on Eighth Avenue, where they tore down a block of beautiful old building to build a short black box that, I guess, is supposed to be invisible like a stealth bomber. If people don\u2019t like tall, bulky buildings, why do they live in Manhattan? I think a lot of us like a very dense space. The Wall Street area is very popular now. If you like a lot of space and sunshine, people can move to Long Island.George of Jochnowitz New York City is underpopulated. Tall buildings make it possible for a higher percentage of people to be able to walk to work, and a still higher percentage to be able to use public transportation rather than cars. Suburbs necessarily have shopping areas with great big parking lots. Dense populations are good for the environment. Stores seem to be vanishing in this age of computers. Thickly populated areas can help to keep retail businesses alive.George\u2019s comment prompted a few incredulous responses:Lou Andrews of Portland, Ore.Are you serious? Even though I live in Portland, Ore., the stories I\u2019ve read lately tells the tale that there is serious overcrowding, not underpopulation. Who needs an overpopulated city anyway, whether Portland or New York?David Gottfried of New York City Higher levels of density might be comfortable for ants, or dead sardines in a sardine can. Not for people.Mr. Gottfried had more thoughts on this:The author, like the building code, does not place enough of an emphasis on the health and well-being of people who have to exist in NY apartments. Perhaps more people can be housed if we did not worry about giving people adequate space, light and ventilation. But without enough ventilation, we could see a return of tuberculosis. The author made general references to zoning laws. Let me be more specific: The NYC Dept. of Buildings operates by a building code which governs NYC. If I recall correctly, the preface or preamble of the code states that it should be interpreted in a manner that facilitates commercial development, that ambiguities shall be resolved in favor of commercial enterprises and that health concerns shall not unduly circumscribe business activity. The author feels the same way, alleging that governing health concerns preclude the development of many buildings. But many people are suffering from sick building syndrome; infections from vermin; respiratory infections that might be alleviated with better ventilation; mold and depression augmented or caused by living in minute apartments.Or, put more poetically...Zane of NY... and the sun ceased to shine; and the streets and alleys were cold; and no one could see beyond the next building; and the flora and fauna requiring full or partial sun began to die and all was replaced by shade plants that took a lifetime to take hold.It was interesting to see people extrapolate the findings for New York to other areas. Houston, which is generally regarded as having very limited land-use restrictions, drew special attention.Sally of Greenwich Village, NY New York City has to look to Houston as the model to help level out or bring down the city\u2019s lack of commercial and residential space. Houston has no zoning. People like to make all types of arguments for zoning; however the bottom line is that it causes massive market distortions to meet the demands of the city\u2019s population; it also makes sure to keep the \u201cgentrified\u201d landlord class in power. Why? Because through another form of overregulating the economy, in this example creating mini-oligopolies, there isn\u2019t market competition. China doesn\u2019t have zoning \u2014 they can get things done like the people of Houston do. New York is simply using an outdated philosophy that really helps to keep the people down. Bill de Blasio needs to wake up and create less land regulation than more.Testy of TX This is a pretty common misunderstanding of what \u201cno zoning\u201d in Houston actually means. There is no distinction between commercial and residential, so a house with a family can be right next door to a house with a business in it. However, Houston has extensive land-use regulation, which is part of what people usually mean when they discuss zoning. Houston absolutely has required setbacks, maximum height restrictions, maximum floor to area ratios, and parking minimums, and the buildings described here could not be built in Houston either. Increased density can definitely be good for the environment and affordability, but Houston is far from the best example of how to do it.Hguy NYCEverything I\u2019ve read has explained how much Houston is a mess because of this.Another popular example, with much more in common with New York, was San Francisco:Rick of San FranciscoReally interesting read. Here in SF the costs of residences (be they rentals or purchases) and zoning are daily discussions. NIMBY, neighborhood review, density bonus, variance, setback, micro unit, nonconforming, parking requirement vs. parking limit, infrastructure impact, open space, air, light, view, affordable housing; almost any angle is bandied about and used to support or argue against one project or another. Thanks for reminding us, or at least me, that our greatest city was the result of exceptions as much as rules.John King, the architecture critic for The San Francisco Chronicle, and Alex Bozikovic, who has the same job at Canada\u2019s Globe and Mail, were equally ambivalent:Who could forget our rivals to the north?And it\u2019s not just big cities:Jerry Gropp Architect AIA Mercer Island, Wash.Mercer Island is going through all this a lot earlier in the game. I\u2019ve sent this fine article to the City Council with the thought that this might help in their research. I\u2019m a Seattle native; my wife\u2019s Brooklyn born.JA of New YorkI wonder how this was done. I live in one of the buildings identified as having too many apartments. I wonder how three apartments in a four-story townhouse can be deemed as \u201ctoo many.\u201dOne landlord even made an interesting discovery:Dominic of Astoria, NY One of the most fascinating and inspiring aspects of our city is the architecture. It is diverse, quirky, both beautifully historic, and also innovative. We are truly fortunate to live in a city in which one can walk down nearly any block and find something interesting to look at. That is truly something to cherish. I recognize that progress always happens \u2014 it\u2019s fascinating and jarring to look at photographs of the city from the late 19th century and compare what used to exist, with what exists in those locations today. At the same time, we seem to have been going through a major building boom in the past 10 years or so. Sometimes, these buildings replace dilapidated and unsightly edifices, so no big loss. Other times, however, we lose a bit of our history. A walk down 57th Street is a perfect illustration. I was lucky enough to have my first job in a townhouse next door to Rizzoli bookstore. Both of these buildings are now dirt lots, no doubt awaiting yet another sleek and cold glass tower. The illustrations of the Jones Street and 720 Park buildings are good examples. Sure, they don\u2019t \u201cconform,\u201d but there is a certain unique vitality there, which adds to the dynamic and diverse nature of our city. You can have laws and guidelines without sacrificing artistry and soul.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Southeast Asia\u2019s Dance With China", "Date": "2016-05-26", "News": "Supported bySpecial Report: Global TrendsSoutheast Asia\u2019s economic promise is emerging as a global growth driver after years of being overshadowed by the China story.At the heart of the Asean Economic Community, the region\u2019s newly introduced single market, are three countries: Vietnam, the Philippines and Indonesia, home to nearly 450 of the region\u2019s 600 million people and with a combined gross domestic product of more than $1.3 trillion in 2014.These three countries have young populations, growing middle classes and projected growth of 5 percent to 7 percent this year. As they face their own developmental challenges, however, they must also contend with maritime friction with China, resulting in tricky political and economic choices.All three are also on the South China Sea, the majority of which is claimed by China, which has overlapping claims with Vietnam and the Philippines, as well as the fellow Asean members Malaysia and Brunei. Indonesia is a non-claimant. In 2014, Vietnam was the first to feel the economic sting of maritime disputes with China. Anti-Chinese riots that broke out after China parked an oil rig in waters claimed by both countries \u201cdid some damage to the Vietnamese reputation and investment environment,\u201d said Le Hong Hiep, a visiting fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore. The foreign-invested sector represents more than 70 percent of Vietnam\u2019s exports and the strongest part of the country\u2019s economy, he said.\u201cVietnam will be careful to not let similar incidents happen again,\u201d Mr. Hiep said.China is Vietnam\u2019s biggest trading partner, providing 29 percent of its imports and buying more than 10 percent of its exports, Mr. Hiep said. \u201cIf for some reason trade with China were to stop, the damage would be huge,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why Vietnam\u2019s trying to diversify its import sources and become less dependent on China.\u201dChina\u2019s importance to Vietnam\u2019s economy is a major factor behind Hanoi\u2019s decision to join the United States-led Trans-Pacific Partnership, which has yet to come into force. On his visit to Vietnam this week, President Obama conveyed American interest in deepening the economic relationship between the former adversaries.Ironically, although Vietnam\u2019s participation in the trade partnership is an attempt to diversify away from reliance on China, it is having the effect of increasing Chinese investment in Vietnam, said Brian Eyler, deputy director of the Stimson Center\u2019s Southeast Asia Program. \u201cChinese firms who seek to take part in the regional supply chain built by the TPP can only do so if they invest in TPP countries like Vietnam,\u201d Mr. Eyler said. While Vietnam is welcoming the Chinese investment, it is also concerned about China\u2019s decision to convert reefs that both countries claim in the Spratly Islands into military outposts.\u201cIt\u2019s safe to say that if China weren\u2019t in the business of reclaiming submerged reefs, trade and investment relations between China and Southeast Asian states on the whole would be much rosier,\u201d Mr. Eyler said.TPP membership reflects Vietnam\u2019s lack of leverage in its relationship with China, which is pushing it to use the rivalry between China and the United States and, to a lesser extent, China and Japan to lift its status, Mr. Hiep said.China has been feverishly piling sand onto reefs in the South China Sea, creating seven new islets in the region and straining already taut geopolitical tensions. \u201cVietnam is receiving great attention from these powers and may use that as leverage to enhance its bargaining power vis-\u00e0-vis China,\u201d he said. Across the South China Sea, the Philippines is awaiting the outcome of the case it has brought to a United Nations arbitration tribunal in The Hague regarding China\u2019s claims in the Spratlys. China has said it will refuse to participate in or accept the arbitration.Under former President Benigno S. Aquino III, the Philippines has been the Southeast Asian claimant to the Spratlys most willing to challenge China, through arbitration and increased military cooperation with the United States. But there are signs that it could be changing tack under President-elect Rodrigo Duterte, who takes office on June 30. Among the candidates in this year\u2019s election, Mr. Duterte most consistently advocated for an approach similar to the pre-Aquino days, favoring bilateral negotiations and joint development, said Malcolm Cook, a senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute. Mr. Duterte has repeatedly expressed interest in attracting Chinese rail investment to the Philippines.One major variable is whether China will build up and install an airstrip on Scarborough Shoal, less than 150 miles from Subic Bay. A source close to the Chinese Navy told The South China Morning Post that construction would begin this year, according to an April report. The reef was the center of a standoff between the Philippines and China in 2012, with China controlling it since.The suggested construction by China on Scarborough Shoal would be a red line for any Filipino president, Mr. Cook said. Moreover, unlike Vietnam, the Filipino economy would not suffer much from a downturn in relations with China. Relatively low economic engagement with China means \u201ceconomic pressure would be less effective than elsewhere in Asean,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen Aquino came to power in 2010 there was no sign at all that he and his administration wanted to take China to an arbitration tribunal,\u201d he said, noting that the ejection of the Philippines from Scarborough Shoal was the turning point. \u201cThe ball\u2019s really in China\u2019s court.\u201dMeanwhile, the Philippines requires major infrastructure investment, said Benjamin E. Diokno, a professorial lecturer at the University of the Philippines School of Economics and a former secretary of budget and management.\u201cTraffic congestion in metro Manila is horrible, its roads and bridges are crumbling,\u201d Mr. Diokno said. \u201cPorts which are critical for an archipelagic country like the Philippines need to be improved to facilitate the movement of people and goods.\u201dThe new China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank could provide much of the investment, but distrust of China in the Philippines makes that unlikely. \u201cOther development partners like Japan, South Korea and multilateral banks like ADB and World Bank can fill those gaps, likely with more efficiency than China can,\u201d Mr. Eyler said. \u201cThere is some evidence that this trend is beginning to play out in Indonesia too as Indonesia ups its maritime game in the South China Sea.\u201dLast March, in a rare maritime confrontation with Indonesia, a Chinese Coast Guard ship rammed a detained Chinese fishing boat to free it from Indonesian detention. The incident took place close to Indonesia\u2019s Natuna Islands, near the southern end of the South China Sea. China said the boat was in China\u2019s traditional fishing grounds.\u201c\u2018Traditional fishing ground\u2019 is an alien concept to international law of the sea\u201d as codified in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, said Arif Havas Oegroseno, Indonesia\u2019s deputy coordinating minister of maritime affairs and resources. \u201cIndonesia views that it is important for China to maintain its peaceful rise in accordance with international law.\u201dMr. Oegroseno said the growth of the Indonesian fishing industry reached 8.9 percent last year, outstripping national G.D.P. growth of 4.7 percent. Fisheries exports, not including seaweed, pearls and fish farming, totaled $4 billion. In order to deal with illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing activities, \u201cassets have been relocated and strengthened\u201d in the Natunas, he said.Sustained development will also require significant infrastructure investment. As Indonesia courts Chinese investment, it is also refining its approach to potential future incidents, said Evan Laksmana, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Indonesia. Since the March incident, he said, Jakarta now seems to consider the issue with China in the Natunas to be primarily about unauthorized fishing, rather than sovereign rights or exclusive economic zones.Advertisement"}

Despite what Mr. Mnuchin said was a personal friendship of 15 years, Mr. Trump has attacked both Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s investment company \u2014 suing it in 2008 over a building deal \u2014 as well as Goldman Sachs, the Democratic Party and other institutions Mr. Mnuchin has supported.In a telephone interview Monday, Mr. Mnuchin emphasized the friendship part of the equation. \u201cI was there at the beginning when he decided to run for president, and I\u2019ve been a supporter and quiet adviser behind the scenes to him,\u201d he explained. The day after Mr. Trump won the New York primary, Mr. Trump called Mr. Mnuchin and offered him the job. \u201cI told him on the spot I would,\u201d he said.Mr. Mnuchin was the chairman of OneWest and sold it to CIT Group in 2015. Along the way, OneWest was involved in a string of lawsuits over questionable foreclosures, and settled several cases for millions of dollars.Meanwhile, Mr. Mnuchin made his name in Hollywood: He teamed up with Brett Ratner, the producer and director, and James Packer, the financier \u2014 together, better known as the \u201cRatPac\u201d \u2014 to produce movies like \u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d and \u201cMad Max: Fury Road.\u201d He briefly was co-chairman of the movie company Relativity Media, but \u2014 happily for him \u2014 he left before it went bankrupt.Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s new job with Mr. Trump is filled with seeming contradictions. Mr. Trump spent much of his campaign attacking Goldman Sachs, using the bank to malign Ted Cruz\u2019s wife, Heidi, who is an investment manager there, and Mrs. Clinton, who famously received rich honorariums for giving speeches there. \u201cI know the guys at Goldman Sachs,\u201d Mr. Trump said during one debate, poking at Mr. Cruz. \u201cThey have total, total control over him. Just like they have total control over Hillary Clinton,\u201d he declared.Mr. Mnuchin supported Mr. Romney in 2012; Mr. Romney has denounced Mr. Trump.Both Mr. Mnuchin and his new boss have backed Mrs. Clinton\u2019s Democratic political aspirations in the past, though both now swear fealty to the other team.\u201cI\u2019m not a traditional fund-raiser \u2014 I think that was part of the appeal I had for Donald,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin told me on Monday. \u201cI have given to Democrats in the past. I\u2019ve always believed in supporting the best candidate at the time.\u201dWhat about Mr. Trump\u2019s broadsides against his former employer? Mr. Mnuchin emphasized that it was \u201cquite a while ago\u201d that he worked for Goldman, working there for 17 years but leaving in 2002. More recently, he said, \u201cI\u2019ve been focused on the West Coast economy and being a banker and lending in these markets.\u201dNo doubt his connections will work to the benefit of the Republican Party, even during an election cycle when all the remaining candidates seem to be trying to sling mud at so-called fat cats. Not so Mr. Mnuchin.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t in any way say I distanced myself from Wall Street,\u201d he said. \u201cI have very good friends on Wall Street.\u201dThe job could be considered high-risk for someone who hasn\u2019t lived in the glare of the public eye \u2014 and for someone backing as controversial a figure as Mr. Trump. With the exception of a handful of financiers like Carl Icahn, few big names on Wall Street have yet endorsed Mr. Trump.Indeed, many of the nation\u2019s largest banks \u2014 including Goldman Sachs \u2014 haven\u2019t done business with Mr. Trump in years. Among the lenders on Mr. Trump\u2019s disclosure form, only Merrill Lynch, among the country\u2019s largest lenders, is listed for a loan made in 1993 and 1994. Since then, smaller banks or foreign institutions like UBS and Deutsche Bank are listed as his biggest lenders. According to former Goldman Sachs executives, the firm doesn\u2019t solicit business from Mr. Trump and has declined at least one project; a spokesman for the firm declined to comment.Mr. Mnuchin said, \u201cI don\u2019t think it is true\u201d that Goldman refuses to work with Mr. Trump. He added: \u201cThere is a long, long list of some of the largest banks in the country that have done business with him. He has had no problem finding people who want to lend to his businesses.\u201dOne of the lenders that have extended credit to Mr. Trump is Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s Dune Capital. Dune was among a syndicate of lenders led by Deutsche Bank for the construction of his Trump International Hotel & Tower, a 92-story skyscraper in Chicago. Mr. Trump sued the lenders, including Dune, in 2008 to extend the terms of the loan on the basis of \u201cunprecedented financial crisis in the credit markets.\u201d The suit was later settled.Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s firm was also involved in investing in Trump Waikiki in Hawaii. \u201cI haven\u2019t really commented on what business we\u2019ve done together,\u201d he said. \u201cI would describe it as more of a personal relationship than a professional relationship.\u201dDespite Mr. Trump\u2019s changing rhetoric, Mr. Mnuchin is bullish: \u201cEven on Wall Street, notwithstanding certain comments he\u2019s made and things like that, I\u2019ve gotten hundreds of calls from people who want to support him.\u201dBecause of an editing error, the DealBook column on Tuesday, about the background of Steven Mnuchin, Donald J. Trump\u2019s national finance chairman, misstated the ownership of the bankrupt movie company Relativity Media. Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s movie company, Dune Entertainment, and RatPac Entertainment, the company of James Packer and Brett Ratner, were investors in Warner Bros. movies, and Mr. Mnuchin was briefly co-chairman of Relativity. Neither Mr. Ratner, Mr. Packer nor RatPac had any relationship with Relativity.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ousmane Semb\u00e8ne\u2019s \u2018Black Girl\u2019 Turns 50", "Date": "2016-05-17", "News": "Supported byCritic's NotebookThe Senegalese director Ousmane Semb\u00e8ne, habitually described as the father of African cinema, was a lifelong critic of patriarchy. An avowedly political artist \u2014 he had been a labor organizer and a novelist before turning to filmmaking \u2014 Mr. Semb\u00e8ne grounded his attacks on colonial oppression and post-independence corruption and compromise in a feminism that could be both subtle and blunt.\u201cBlack Girl,\u201d which turns 50 this year and has been restored, is one of those works of art that is at once powerfully of its moment and permanently contemporary. Sixty-five minutes long, filmed in a handful of locations in narrow-screen black-and-white, with sound dubbed in afterward, the movie can be regarded, among other things, as a masterpiece of thrift. Mr. Semb\u00e8ne, working with the French cinematographer Christian Lacoste and a small, nonprofessional cast, had the ingenuity \u2014 the vision \u2014 to turn material limitations to artistic advantage. The unsynchronized dialogue, which seems to float above the heads of the characters rather than emerging from their mouths, gives the action a dreamlike quality and infuses an objectively grim, realistic story with poetry and longing.The story might have been suggested by a brief article in a French newspaper, a terse and tragic police-blotter item shown onscreen near the end of the film. \u201cBlack Girl\u201d is thus, in some ways, a documentary after the fact, an attempt to trace an awful, easily forgotten event to its source and to emphasize its political implications. The fate of an individual \u2014 a domestic worker who has traveled from Senegal to work as a nanny and housekeeper for a middle-class family in France \u2014 is used to illuminate larger issues of identity, exploitation and displacement.That sounds like standard neorealism, and Mr. Semb\u00e8ne\u2019s affinities with postwar Italian cinema are apparent, even if they are probably less a matter of influence than of shared ideological and aesthetic impulses. His first short, the 18-minute \u201cBorom Sarret,\u201d which is being released along with \u201cBlack Girl,\u201d feels like a succinct variation on the theme of Vittorio De Sica\u2019s \u201cBicycle Thieves.\u201d It chronicles a day in the life of a horse-cart driver in Dakar trying to feed his family and preserve his dignity in the face of obstacles large and small.His predicament is not unlike that faced by Diouana (Mbissine Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Diop), the title character of \u201cBlack Girl,\u201d whose daily routines of drudgery and tedium drive her into depression and worse. But while both characters are representative of a social condition \u2014 the poverty and injustice that fester in Senegal after independence; the inequalities that persist between white French citizens and their former colonial subjects \u2014 they do not seem like puppets in a political passion play.On the contrary, the force of Mr. Semb\u00e8ne\u2019s art \u2014 the sheer beauty that is the most striking feature of his early films \u2014 lies in his humanism. The task \u201cBlack Girl\u201d sets itself is not just to note the facts of Diouana\u2019s life but also to assert her visibility, to ensure that she is seen. Several years before the phrase \u201cblack is beautiful\u201d entered the lexicon of American racial politics, \u201cBlack Girl\u201d insisted as much from its very opening frames. Ms. Diop, dressed in a white polka-dot dress and turban, moves through a world dominated by blinding, literal whiteness.The blazing sun of Antibes, the Mediterranean city where Diouana\u2019s employers live, gives their high-rise apartment an almost hallucinatory quality. Its walls are blank and bleached, and its inhabitants are cold and self-absorbed. Diouana\u2019s psychological unraveling can partly be traced to her physical environment, which in turn underlines her cultural and existential isolation. The symbol of her alienation is a mask that she gives her employers as a gift and later tries to take back. It hangs on the wall of the Antibes apartment, a memento of home and also a totem of her estrangement from it.Mr. Semb\u00e8ne flashes back to the lively, dusty streets of Dakar, but he was never one to promote an idealized or sentimental picture of Senegal, or to refrain from criticizing its postcolonial governments. Nor, for all the specificity of its setting, does \u201cBlack Girl\u201d offer an easily digestible picture of African identity. The solution to Diouana\u2019s crisis, in other words, is far from simple, partly because her problems are themselves complicated. In Dakar, she dreams of going to France. When that dream comes true, she longs to be back in Senegal. She is hardly a picture of saintly stoicism, but a young woman subject to the usual range of emotions. To the couple for whom she works, she appears lazy, sullen and irrational, an example of the difficulty of finding good help.Mr. Semb\u00e8ne uses her inner state, and Ms. Diop\u2019s impassive features and upright bearing, to draw a map of modern oppression. Diouana is an African migrant in France, a woman in a male-dominated society and, perhaps above all, an exploited worker in a brutal, global cash economy. Not one of these identities is the key to the others. They function together, ensnaring her efforts to feel herself fully human \u2014 to discover who she is \u2014 in a web of constraints.For all its abundant historical interest, \u201cBlack Girl\u201d unfolds in the present tense, and directs its characters and its audience toward a still-unwritten future. The last shot, back in Dakar, is of a boy holding Diouana\u2019s mask halfway over his face, looking directly into the camera. Who was he? Who is he? Who will he become?\u201cBlack Girl\u201d runs through next Tuesday at BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn; 718-636-4100, bam.org.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "These Days, a Brazilian Expat \u2018Laughs So As Not to Cry\u2019", "Date": "2016-05-25", "News": "Supported byPHOENIX \u2014 A friend texted me the other day: \u201cWhat is going on in your country?\u201dI was born in Brazil, my entire family is in Brazil and I lived there until I came to the United States 18 years ago, at the age of 24. By then, Brazil had changed the name of its currency five times, each time as part of a plan to rescue its economy. The country had also moved from dictatorship to democracy, and I had cast my first vote for president in the first presidential election held after the military stepped aside.I thought about telling my friend all that, just to give him some perspective. Instead, I wrote back, \u201cIt\u2019s a big mess.\u201d\u201cLOL,\u201d he replied.In Brazil, we often say, \u201c\u00c9 rir para n\u00e3o chorar.\u201d Laugh so as not to cry.

He knows hardship, but he also knows what it\u2019s like to live in a country that rewards people for their hard work.

{"Headline": "Cheap Gas for the Holiday, but Its Days Are Numbered", "Date": "2016-05-26", "News": "Supported byWheelsHOUSTON \u2014 Enjoy the low gasoline prices this Memorial Day weekend while they last.Even with global oil prices grinding higher, American holiday travelers will see the cheapest prices at the pump in more than a decade for this holiday weekend, saving nearly 50 cents a gallon compared with last year.But the bargain-basement prices are probably fleeting.Declining oil supplies have led to a near doubling of crude prices since early February. On Thursday, the world\u2019s benchmark prices breached $50 a barrel, and for the first time since last August prices for regular gasoline have risen above $2 a gallon in all 50 states.The average gas station has raised its prices 17 cents a gallon over the last month \u2014 and 5 cents over the last week alone.The sharp decline in oil and gasoline prices since late 2014 because of a persistent global petroleum glut has been partly reversed in recent weeks as wild fires curbed production in Canada and rebel attacks throttled Nigerian oil exports.At the same time, oil companies are cutting back production in the United States and several other countries because of the recent collapse of oil prices \u2014 which still remain at levels that are roughly half what they were two years ago. And the low prices have raised demand for petroleum products in China, India and the United States.Oil and gasoline prices are not poised to return to levels of the days when crude was worth well over $100 a barrel, which became the norm in recent years. That was before the drilling frenzy in shale fields across the United States slashed imports and flooded the global market, while demand slowed in Europe and many developing markets.But the rig count in the United States is now down roughly 80 percent over the last two years, which means less exploration and production through the end of this year as output from older wells declines. Since service companies have slashed their payrolls, it will take as much as six months to rehire and organize new drilling crews to develop new wells, energy experts say.\u201cThe help the consumer has gotten in this weak economy from low oil prices is coming to an end,\u201d said Larry Goldstein, a director of the Energy Policy Research Foundation, a research group funded by the government and oil industry. \u201cThe unanticipated supply disruptions are coming at the most inopportune time. Now U.S. production is declining and global inventories hare starting to decline along with it.\u201dOil executives and other experts say that still hefty global inventories will keep prices from rising to extremes anytime soon, but that oil prices are likely to rise at least another 10 percent over the next year.Further steady rises in price are expected through the end of the decade given the deep cuts in exploration investment across the global oil patch.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.But drivers probably shouldn\u2019t worry about such projections too much for the rest of the summer.The Oil Price Information Service, which monitors fuel prices, expects that the average national price this summer will be $2.25 to $2.50 a gallon of regular, the cheapest summer driving since 2009. Refinery repairs have been particularly helpful in reducing prices in California.AAA expects 34 million people to drive at least 50 miles this holiday weekend, the most since 2005. It is part of a broader trend of more road travel as the economy improves. Experts say the Memorial Day traffic is just the beginning of a summer of traffic jams at the nation\u2019s beaches and mountain parks.\u201cThe statistics over the last two years have been dramatic in terms of numbers of increased road trips during the critical holiday periods,\u201d said Bill Sutherland, senior vice president for travel and publishing at AAA. \u201cAs the roads become busier, and as the hotels become used, as restaurants fill up, you will want to be sure you have effectively planned out the trip.\u201dEconomists have been generally disappointed that lower gasoline prices have not given the economy a bigger boost over the last year. They originally thought consumers would spend their extra dollars at the shopping mall, but instead many people have saved their extra cash, although others are buying bigger and less efficient vehicles.Then there is the toll on jobs. The drop in exploration and production in states like Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and North Dakota has led to layoffs totaling 120,000 workers in high-paying jobs. More than 70 companies in the United States and Canada have gone bankrupt, and experts say the industry will need at least a couple of years to recover.In the next several weeks, the companies are obliged to cover quarterly interest payments on loans they took out when oil prices were over $100 a barrel, and several more may be unable to meet their obligations. Many banks have cut lines of credit, seeking to reduce their own vulnerability.The depressed state of the industry has been a drag on the national economy \u2014 particularly for manufacturers who make the pipelines and drilling equipment \u2014 and that has only been partly counterbalanced by lower energy costs.Still, the share prices for many oil companies, like Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Hess, have risen sharply with oil prices in recent months, reflecting rising confidence that energy prices will rise even more in 2017 and 2018.In the meantime, economists say that they see a benefit for lower-income people, who spend the highest proportion of their salaries on energy and generally drive older, gas-guzzling vehicles. Some of the states with the lowest gasoline prices, like Mississippi, South Carolina and Arkansas, have a large number of lower-income workers, many of whom drive long distances to work.And some sectors of the economy, including tourism, are also benefiting.\u201cPeople are driving more and eating out more, and employment in restaurants is up incredibly,\u201d said Mine K. Yucel, director of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. \u201cPeople care about oil prices because they see the price of gasoline on every street corner. They experience the change in price every week or 10 days and they feel they have more cash in their pockets.\u201dIf nothing else, the rising price has raised morale in the American oil patch.\u201cThere is a chance the price could go down pretty quick,\u201d said Denzil West, president of Reliance Energy, a Texas driller. \u201cWith prices being a little more stable, we\u2019re cautiously optimistic, but a lot of companies have been wrecked and all the fallout has not been seen yet.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated when the average price for a gallon of regular gasoline nationally was $2.31 and, because of an editing error, when benchmark prices for a barrel of oil briefly pushed past $50 for the first time since August. It was Thursday, not Friday.Advertisement"}

The government said the move would extend presidential powers, though it was vague on specifics.For months, Venezuela has been convulsed by an economic crisis caused by low oil prices, a lack of savings and a drought. Lines for food have become ubiquitous, as have water shortages and blackouts. The government is working just two days a week in an effort to save electricity.The United States fears that Venezuela could face a major eruption of street violence in the coming months, according to senior American intelligence officials who spoke on condition of anonymity in discussing the government\u2019s latest intelligence assessment.While Mr. Maduro has so far held off a recall vote against him, the American officials said that they believed his grip on power was weakening by the day, and that he could be removed from power, either in a palace coup by members of his party or by the Venezuelan military.While the military\u2019s high command appears unlikely to act against the government right now, these officials said, its midlevel officers are more restive. One American official said intelligence officials were worried about some kind of change, but were not aware of any active plots.Venezuela is facing a default on its debt in the fourth quarter of this year. The government is trying to keep financing its loans to avoid having creditors seize its foreign assets. But that, as well as the steeply falling price of oil \u2014 the country\u2019s largest export \u2014 has caused imports to plummet, leading to shortages of food and medicine.The officials acknowledged that the United States had limited influence in Venezuela, where the government has blamed American meddling for the instability.Follow Nicholas Casey on Twitter @caseysjournal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sebastian Junger\u2019s \u2018Tribe\u2019", "Date": "2016-05-27", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Sebastian Junger co-directed two documentary films, \u201cRestrepo\u201d and \u201cKorengal,\u201d about a platoon of American soldiers deployed to a tiny, utterly primitive and exceedingly dangerous outpost in Afghanistan\u2019s Korengal Valley. Both films were riveting meditations on the experience of war. Grinding boredom gives way to bowel-emptying fear, followed sometimes by episodes of nearly psychedelic blood lust and the frankly sexual pleasure of unleashing a .50-caliber machine gun on enemies who are doing the same to you. We see the calming routines of mending one\u2019s kit in the interludes; the improvised forms of social authority that emerge in a place far beyond the reach of law; the rude affection and deep love among brothers in arms. Both films have a timeless quality to them, surely because of Junger\u2019s tact as a journalist and his fundamental sympathy with his subjects.What the films depict is not the high-tech warfare of remote control that affirms our clean self-image, but the recalcitrant realities of killing. We see the joys and depravities of a cell of men released from the neutering moral regulation of American society. That society has a mission for them to do, but it cannot avow the means by which it is to be accomplished and must avert its gaze from the appalling maleness of it all.How do you return home from such an experience? This is the question Junger asks in \u201cTribe,\u201d which has the subtitle \u201cOn Homecoming and Belonging.\u201d In a pre-modern tribe, Junger points out \u2014 or indeed a modern society such as Israel, in which the burden of defense is widely shared and never remote from the collective experience \u2014 war has a shared social meaning. But in a cosmopolitan society such as our own, far removed from the scene of battle, the human qualities demanded and cultivated by war are fundamentally at odds with our public principles. We think the \u201ctake care of your own\u201d mentality of the tribe emanates from a different stage of human development, part of an us-versus-them mind-set that we pride ourselves on having left behind in the forward march of reason. What the French scholar Pierre Manent said of European enlightened opinion could be said of its American counterpart: We believe \u201cwe have become so universally human that we have no enemies.\u201d And yet we rain down more death around the world than just about anybody.A society with less false consciousness about these matters would reintegrate soldiers returning from battle by putting them to work. Doing so would tacitly affirm the continuity in their contribution to our common good. Instead, Junger points out, such is the misalignment of our culture and military service that someone who has fought is regarded as fundamentally damaged. The way we receive combat veterans returning home is by \u00adtreating them as victims and putting them on disability. Victim status confers the only form of moral redemption we know, and we offer this freely \u2014 on the condition that a veteran submit to therapy. If the therapy is successful, he will come to accept the obsolescence of precisely those traits that made him a good fighter. With the help of a little medication they wither, like a limb that has been tied off to prevent an infection from spreading. Only then can the veteran hope to claim his prize, which is to become a well-adjusted consumer and cog in the corporate economy.Junger argues persuasively that postcombat psychological problems must be understood as a problem of reintegrating to society on such terms, at least as much as they are due to the trauma of war. Post-traumatic stress disorder is a medical term for a cultural problem: the basic impossibility of digesting the experience of combat as an isolated individual among other isolated individuals, each devoted to pursuing his or her private interests. There is no tribe. To risk one\u2019s life for the common good is to declare oneself outside this cultural logic of acquisitive individualism; the veteran is an outsider to us by definition, and no amount of yellow ribbons can change that fact.In his platoon, he belonged. It is not so surprising, then, that many combat veterans miss the fellowship and say they would return to it if they could. The brief introduction to \u201cTribe\u201d is a micro-\u00admasterpiece in which Junger sketches the discontent of bourgeois life. In the Boston suburb where he grew up, \u201cneighbors hardly knew each other. And they didn\u2019t need to: Nothing ever happened in my town that required anything close to a collective effort.\u201dI expect Junger will be savaged by reviewers on two fronts, for reasons that derive as much from the moral one-\u00adupmanship of book reviewing as from his blind spots: It will be said that as an adventure-seeking journalist who doesn\u2019t have to live out the full consequences of his argument, he overemphasizes the psychological benefits of war and also romanticizes tribal people. This is fair enough, and a case could be made that he is guilty on both counts, despite his explicit awareness of both hazards. But to fixate on these transgressions would be to flatter our own prejudices and inoculate ourselves against the critical force of his argument.A more serious limitation of the book, in my view, derives from Junger\u2019s reliance on evolutionary psychology for his explanatory framework. The just-so stories that various professors have offered, after imagining what survival on the Pleistocene savannas might have required, cannot compete with the kind of material gathered by a journalist who is alive to the human drama unfolding before his eyes in a firefight. There are very few elements of human experience that can pass through the sieve of social-scientific explanation without coming out thin and watered down; one wishes Junger had favored his own ethnographic reporting over such explanation and included more of it. The book also sorely lacks any sustained attempt at intellectual history. The questions he is asking are in fact perennial questions of political philosophy, and they have a history that could have enriched the book immeasurably.The self-deceptions of contemporary society that Junger elaborates run too deep to be relieved by exhortations to \u201csupport our troops.\u201d The conclusion one reaches upon finishing \u201cTribe\u201d is that we should bring back the draft and have universal, obligatory military service. It is hard to think of a public-policy reform that would do more to heal the growing chasm of social class, affirm our shared destiny as citizens and at the same time discipline our foreign policy. A nation of 320 million will never be a tribe, but if after such a reform we still have enthusiasm for putting \u201cboots on the ground,\u201d those boots will belong to \u201cus\u201d rather than \u201cthem.\u201dMatthew B.

{"Headline": "Local Designs, Served Fresh", "Date": "2016-05-04", "News": "Supported by11 PhotosIn one room of the new Apparatus showroom on West 30th Street in Manhattan, artisans polish raw brass by hand, meticulously applying finishes to create a patina that looks decades old.In the next room, someone cuts leather and horsehair, and a few steps away, others labor at workbenches, methodically assembling the various pieces into sculptural light fixtures that conjure up a vague industrial past and are imposing enough to transform a space.\u201cThis is the heart and soul of the operation,\u201d said Gabriel Hendifar, 34, who owns the firm with his fianc\u00e9, Jeremy Anderson, 40. \u201cEvery single component that goes into every single fixture passes through all of these hands.\u201dIn roughly five years, Apparatus has grown from two guys building light fixtures at their dining table to one of the most talked-about American design firms, with a staff of 35, a 10,000-square-foot studio and showroom that officially opens here later this month and a second showroom in Milan.And all the while, Mr. Hendifar and Mr. Anderson have remained steadfast in their commitment to maintain control of the entire process \u2014 not just the design, but the manufacturing, sales, packaging and marketing.\u201cThere\u2019s this idea of \u2018the maker\u2019 that we were very much inspired by, which feels like a thing in New York right now,\u201d Mr. Hendifar said.\u201cWe were originally in Los Angeles, looking to people like Lindsey Adelman, Jason Miller and David Weeks,\u201d he said, naming three established New York designers who have built their own hands-on fabrication studios. \u201cAll these amazing people were doing all these great things.\u201dMr. Hendifar and Mr. Anderson are not the only ones to emulate that model. Dozens of other young firms across the country are following suit. Unlike earlier generations of designers, most of whom sought licensing agreements with large manufacturers, they are taking control of nearly every aspect of production, from initial concept to final product delivery.Cara McCarty, curatorial director at the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum, attributes this to a number of factors, including e-commerce and social media. Designers \u201ccan sell online and become known in a way that they couldn\u2019t without that technology,\u201d Ms. McCarty said. \u201cThat\u2019s made a huge difference.\u201dBut \u201cit\u2019s also an outgrowth of this go-local movement,\u201d she said, drawing a connection to the popularity of artisanal foods and the farm-to-table trend. In the same way that many consumers are turning away from mass-produced foods in favor of the local and homegrown, she said, they are also seeking out small-batch designer goods. And often, she said: \u201cThey have an opportunity to impact the final design and actually work with the maker. It\u2019s customized for their interior or taste.\u201dWhether you think of it as locavore design or simply another byproduct of the tech revolution, the \u201cmaker\u201d movement is fueling a resurgence in American design. Not long ago, the real excitement about new design was in Europe, at furniture fairs like the Salone del Mobile, held every April in Milan. But increasingly American design seems to be stealing the spotlight.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of interest in the European market, from European designers and architects,\u201d said Jacques Barret, founder of Triode gallery in Paris, which has made products by American designers a focus for the last couple of years and is planning an exhibition on Apparatus next month. \u201cPeople who discover American design are very impressed with the design, the materials and the way it\u2019s done. They design, they make. It\u2019s really different from what we see in Europe.\u201dNick Cope, 33, who runs the wallpaper company Calico in Red Hook, Brooklyn, with his wife, Rachel, 34, has noticed a different attitude as well. Now, during the Milan furniture fair, \u201ceveryone is asking about what\u2019s going on with design in New York and how people are doing this,\u201d he said.\u201cThere\u2019s something about the American spirit of entrepreneurship and this pioneering attitude that you can do it all,\u201d he said, that \u201cseems extremely relevant right now.\u201dThe Copes founded their company in 2013 to produce one-of-a-kind wall-size murals. Ms. Cope creates original artwork by marbleizing paper using traditional methods or painting by hand, and scans the finished pieces into a computer at high resolution.When a client places an order, the artwork is digitally cropped to ensure that each installation is different, and the nonrepeating pattern is printed on rolls of wallpaper that are assembled like a puzzle.\u201cCompanies have approached us about licensing things, but for us, working together in this studio and having complete control of production is so meaningful and rewarding,\u201d Ms. Cope said. \u201cIt\u2019s part of our lifestyle. We\u2019re in this really lovely community with lots of designers around us.\u201dAmong the other designer-driven workshops on the streets surrounding Calico\u2019s studio is Uhuru, a furniture company founded in 2004 by Jason Horvath and Bill Hilgendorf, who studied industrial design together at the Rhode Island School of Design before starting a small woodworking shop in Brooklyn.\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to have to justify what we were trying to do to anyone else or to convince someone to make our stuff,\u201d said Mr. Horvath, 38. \u201cWe just wanted to design it and make it.\u201dAfter presenting their first collection at Bklyn Designs in 2006, they soon developed a reputation for creative use of reclaimed materials: ipe from the Coney Island boardwalk; heart-pine beams from the Domino Sugar refinery in Williamsburg, Brooklyn; various scraps found on the street. A new collection of brass tables and benches currently in the works was inspired by the rusty metal straps used to secure boxes to shipping pallets.Uhuru now employs about 70 people in two production facilities, an 8,000-square-foot space in an old warehouse in Red Hook, Brooklyn, and a 40,000-square-foot operation in New Holland, Pa.The company, which opened a showroom in TriBeCa last year, fills nearly $1 million in orders every month, Mr. Horvath said, and to fulfill large commercial jobs like furniture for the new Ace hotels in Pittsburgh and New Orleans, the partners are overseeing additional production in Nicaragua and Vietnam.Financial necessity, of course, plays a significant role in this. Charlie Miner, the chief executive of WorkOf, an online marketplace for products made by designers, credits the recent financial crisis in particular.\u201cWe attribute a lot of this growth to things that happened in the economy in 2007 and 2008,\u201d he said, when students were graduating from design schools with few job prospects. Those individuals began forming independent studios, and a few years later, Mr. Miner said, \u201cthe next generation of professional design and manufacturing brands was starting to emerge.\u201dWorkOf, which earns a commission on products sold through its website, was founded in January 2014 and initially represented 10 design firms, all in Brooklyn. Since then, it has grown rapidly, and now offers products from more than 100 design studios across the country.The recession, however, can\u2019t be blamed for everything. Some designers, like the role models for the partners of Apparatus, have insisted on retaining control of their work for a while now.\u201cIn the beginning, I produced everything,\u201d said Mr. Weeks, 47, who has been making his own light fixtures for 20 years. \u201cIt was me, personally, at a jewelry table making swivels, grinding metal and bending everything. I cut the shades by hand and sanded them on the belt sander.\u201d\u201cI had every intention of developing a licensing arrangement,\u201d he said, \u201cuntil I had so many disappointing experiences in that realm, not only the quality you get back, but the relationships with companies who have their own agendas.\u201dAnd licensing agreements, he was dismayed to discover, typically paid only a fraction of the wholesale price of each product to the designer. \u201cThey\u2019d have to sell a hundred of the thing that you can make one of,\u201d he said, \u201cfor you to make the same amount of money.\u201dSo Mr. Weeks built up a studio of skilled artisans who could manufacture his designs in-house, with some custom parts from outside suppliers, and that\u2019s how he continues to produce pieces like the large-scale brass Otto fixtures he is introducing this month.In 2013, he opened a TriBeCa showroom; he now employs about 20 people and is moving his production studio to a larger 6,000-square-foot facility in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.In decades past, when most furniture and product designers were just one link in the production chain, they created objects in their studios with paper, computers or physical models and then handed off the designs to manufacturers. Those manufacturers not only built the designs but promoted them as well, paying for the cost of things like advertising, customer service and exhibiting at furniture fairs.This is how Charles and Ray Eames worked in the 1940s, and it\u2019s how European design stars like Patricia Urquiola and Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec still work today.But designers who make their own products don\u2019t have that kind of support. So, many of them are turning to one another, forming collectives that allow them to share experiences, contacts and the costs of presenting at trade fairs.One such group is Join, a collective that began in Seattle, expanded to include a larger swath of the Pacific Northwest and now has members from across North America.\u201cWe had a community of friends who were involved in making things the same way we were,\u201d said Chelsea Minola, 35, one of the founders of the group, who owns the design firm Grain, on Bainbridge Island, Wash., with her husband, James, 33. \u201cWe shared all kinds of resources and presented at design shows together. It was a really important part of how we grew our business and was invaluable in bringing attention to our tiny brands.\u201dIt\u2019s a little like an old-fashioned barn-raising: The whole community coming together to help whomever is in need. A similar image comes to mind when you hear that Calico painted the large wall panels in Apparatus\u2019s new showroom. Or that Uhuru helped to build the display units that Calico uses for its presentations at trade fairs. Or that other designers are pooling resources to fund a shared showroom like Colony in Manhattan.Mr. Minola, who helped found Join, described this sort of cooperation, in its most basic form, as pragmatic: It\u2019s creating \u201ca platform to show work,\u201d he said.Then he corrected himself: \u201cIt\u2019s more than that. It\u2019s community building.\u201dThat\u2019s a big claim, but one that will sound familiar to any locavore.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Ayn Rand Acolyte Selling Students a Self-Made Dream", "Date": "2016-05-07", "News": "Supported byPARK CITY, Utah \u2014 \u201cI want to be first on Success,\u201d said Carl Barney, standing up from the breakfast table after a final sip of tea at Deer Valley, a luxury resort with a view of Utah\u2019s mountainous rooftop.Mr. Barney, who had arrived in the dining room wearing his custom-made orange ski boots, was referring to the trail named Success, with its early-morning blanket of freshly groomed, untouched snow.He could just as easily have been referring to himself.\u201cShe taught me how to live,\u201d Mr. Barney said.He credits Rand\u2019s brand of antigovernment libertarianism, hard-nosed rationality and unapologetic self-interest with helping him realize his own American dream \u2014 an achievement he sells to the students at his schools. But his inspiring story is not without contradictions.Mr. Barney, who opposes government-backed loans and grants on principle, has made his fortune in a business that is almost wholly dependent on them. His students borrow heavily to pay for their studies in hope of replicating Mr. Barney\u2019s up-by-the-bootstraps success, but often find themselves dropping out and burdened with loans. And while he invokes a rigorous Rand-inspired ethical code of fair dealing, he is in an industry with a history pockmarked by fraud and abuse.Mr. Barney sees it differently. He is proud of the role of for-profit education in catering to students often ignored or left behind by traditional colleges and universities. A few rogue employees and school operators, he says, have been used as a cudgel by critics ideologically opposed to the education business.\u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s some bad guys out there,\u201d he said, after returning from a morning of skiing. \u201cBut a lot of them? No.\u201dIn his view, there has been a \u201cdeliberately designed campaign to cripple, crush and close these schools,\u201d spearheaded by people who \u201creally think profit-making is wrong.\u201dFederal efforts to prevent abuses through increased monitoring and regulation, Mr. Barney argues, are only burdening schools with onerous requirements that further increase student costs.Mr. Barney\u2019s business and beliefs place him at the center of a pressing national debate. More than ever, a college degree has become a ticket to the middle class. But there is a divide over how to best help students with the fewest skills and resources.The clash is not just over policy options, but ideas. Ayn Rand, who died in 1982, has long been a flash point for conflicting concepts of America and its promise.Versions of this debate are playing out on the presidential campaign trail \u2014 in clashes over income inequality, government regulation and college affordability.In Mr. Barney\u2019s view, both parties are leading the country in the wrong direction. \u201cPolitics is not going to solve the problem,\u201d he said, settling into the third-floor lounge of his Alpine-styled boutique hotel.If rationality, hard work and self-interest are fundamental Randian values, so is the pursuit of happiness. And that is what led Mr. Barney to rise early that day \u2014 only to have to wait at the front of the ski lift line. Standing there, he mentions to the lift operator his intent to be first down the run.\u201cYou look like you\u2019re first in a lot of things,\u201d the lift operator replies.Soon enough, Mr. Barney is gliding down the mountain, listening on his earbuds to a favorite Broadway tune, \u201cOne Day More,\u201d from \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables,\u201d with its call to the masses to man the barricades.\u201cThe greatest tragedy in all schools today is the \u2018D.D.D.\u2019\u201d \u2014 a dropout who is in debt and doesn\u2019t get a degree, Mr. Barney said over an artistically arranged dessert plate. The term is one of the many expressions that his staff refers to as \u201cCarl Barneyisms,\u201d the abbreviations, aphorisms, quotations and guidelines that pepper the boss\u2019s daily conversation and fill employee binders.For years, Mr. Barney worked six-and-a-half-day weeks sending notes to colleagues and friends at all hours about newly discovered enthusiasms \u2014 videos, books, middle-of-the-night brainstorms or even gadgets, like the MagicJack, the as-seen-on-TV device to connect a phone to a computer for inexpensive calls.\u201cIf he finds something that he really likes, he\u2019ll send it to 10 of his friends,\u201d said John Allison, the former chief of the bank BB&T and a longtime friend who once received a Keurig coffee maker from him.Many of his work ideas are cataloged in \u201cP.D.s\u201d (procedure directives), \u201cD.L.s\u201d (data letters), \u201cI.L.s,\u201d (information letters) and \u201cM.M.s\u201d (management memos). \u201cM.M. 302,\u201d for example, is titled \u201cStudent Satisfaction and Success \u2014 S.S.S.\u201d and offers the antidote to what he calls the \u201cdreaded D.D.D.\u201d\u201cIf something worked, we then systematized it,\u201d Mr. Barney said.\u201cP.D. 154 R\u201d lays out a two-year training program for employees who want to advance to associate directors. Among other things, they will be expected to read Rand\u2019s manifesto, the 1,200-page novel \u201cAtlas Shrugged,\u201d which depicts a rotted-out America where creative geniuses stage a nationwide strike against corrupt \u201cmoochers and looters.\u201dRand made her way to the United States after escaping the Soviet Union\u2019s terrors in the 1920s, an experience that left her with a deep-rooted distrust of government. She extolled laissez-faire capitalism, ruthless ambition and individualism in her novels, including \u201cThe Fountainhead,\u201d and a philosophy known as objectivism.Mr. Barney discovered Rand in midlife. He grew up with five siblings in postwar London.His father was a serial entrepreneur, opening a nightclub, a motel and a gas station. \u201cHe was good at creating things. He wasn\u2019t good at carrying through,\u201d Mr. Barney said.Rationing of food, gas and clothing made deprivation a fact of daily life. The abundance portrayed in American movies offered an alluring contrast.As a teenager, he traveled to Australia, where he sold encyclopedias door to door and picked grapes (\u201cI was good at it\u201d). He toured India, and later ended up in California \u2014 dabbling briefly, he admits with some embarrassment, in Scientology \u2014 seeking meaning here and there while engaging in the great American tradition of self-improvement.By the 1970s, he participated in another American tradition: making money in real estate. Then a minor business transaction came along that became a seminal moment. After legally terminating a lease, he offered some extra compensation for the inconvenience.The leaseholder was offended and said, \u201cI don\u2019t want anything that isn\u2019t earned or deserved,\u201d Mr. Barney recalls. She was describing Rand\u2019s \u201ctrader principle,\u201d which holds that two people engaging in a trade shouldn\u2019t take any more, or less, from each other than is deserved.Mr. Barney was bewildered.Her explanation? \u201cYou need to read \u2018Atlas Shrugged.\u2019\u201dHe began teaching himself about Rand and objectivism. Attending her final public appearance in 1981 in New Orleans, he heard speaker after speaker declare, \u201cShe changed my life.\u201dIt was testimony Mr. Barney would ultimately echo. \u201cThis is what Rand taught me \u2014 identify that values that are important to you and practice the virtues to achieve that,\u201d he said. It infused him with \u201ca central purpose.\u201dThat led him to pursue a business in education. So when a friend told him about the existence of for-profit colleges, he was struck. \u201cWow,\u201d he said he thought, \u201cyou could actually buy a college? That\u2019s what I want to do.\u201dIn time, he ended up buying and establishing several colleges including CollegeAmerica, Stevens-Henager and California College. He developed an online division, Independence University.The money came from Mr. Barney himself in the form of loans and tax-deductible donations. Today, the colleges are no longer considered for-profit entities, and the center supports programs at brand-name universities like Tufts, Clemson and Duke.Mr. Barney has stepped back from day-to-day oversight, but nothing changed in the way the colleges are operated. \u201cWe woke up the next day with the exact same management team,\u201d said Eric Juhlin, who continued as chief executive.Todd Zywicki, executive director of George Mason Law and Economics Center and a longtime trustee at the Center for Excellence in Higher Education, called the notion \u201cinsulting,\u201d saying \u201cit totally misrepresents what we were doing.\u201dMr. Barney similarly dismisses the accusations: \u201cI could be a billionaire today if I hadn\u2019t converted to nonprofit.\u201dThe Salt Lake City branch of Stevens-Henager College occupies a modern, four-story building off Highway 15, about a 45-minute drive from Deer Valley. At night it bustles with students arriving for class after clocking out of their day jobs.All are looking to better their lives, saying they\u2019re spending from about $30,000 for an associate degree to about $70,000 for an M.B.A., and are taking on thousands of dollars in debt to make it happen.Almost everyone who applies is accepted. As Mr. Barney acknowledged, getting some of these students \u2014 those with the poorest preparation or juggling work, family and school \u2014 to graduate is difficult. \u201cWe don\u2019t select the best. We take who comes there and do the best we can,\u201d he said.Of the approximately two dozen students interviewed at random during a recent visit, nearly all praised the school\u2019s instruction. They particularly liked that the path to a degree was clearly mapped \u2014 no electives, no course catalog to decipher \u2014 and that class work was structured around short, four-week modules.Thomas Hillier, 46, said he and his daughter ended up enrolling at the same time. She graduated with an associate degree in medical specialties and has a good job, while he is finishing his bachelor\u2019s in network security. Cynthia Turgeon, 42, who is majoring in accounting forensics, said, \u201cIt has the best reputation in the Valley.\u201dShe and other middle-aged classmates said they had seen several dropouts, particularly younger students, whom they described as often lacking focus and commitment \u2014 just as they themselves used to. \u201cThis is my third time back in school,\u201d Ms. Turgeon said. \u201cIt\u2019s just clicking now.\u201dThere were dissenters. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand what I got myself into,\u201d Felicia Robbins, 21, said during a break in her medical specialties class. She had heard about the school on radio ads. \u201cThey\u2019re very enticing,\u201d she said.Ms. Robbins said she didn\u2019t realize that the course was largely self-taught, with an instructor providing guidance. \u201cI thought it was going to be like college.\u201dOnly after dropping out, she said, did she discover other colleges would not accept her credits. Rather than throw out her investment, she returned. \u201cI feel like you\u2019re stuck,\u201d she said.Linda Carter, the former dean of the Cheyenne campus in Wyoming, for example, resigned in 2012, saying she was pressured to misrepresent information to school accreditation panels and was disturbed about what she called misleading advertising.When a dispute arose over whether she qualified for unemployment benefits, the Division of Appeals of the Wyoming Department of Workforce Services held a hearing. It concluded that Ms. Carter had \u201cproved, by a preponderance of the evidence, the employer\u2019s customary working conditions involved deceit on the part of the employer.\u201dThe colleges are fighting the suits, characterizing them as without merit.Mr. Barney recalled his reaction to some of the accusations. \u201cThey are all horrific. If anybody was reading those you\u2019d say, \u2018Those were really bad guys.\u2019\u201d He said that when he investigated, however, he concluded that all the complaints were unjustified. \u201cWe\u2019re not perfect,\u201d he said, \u201cbut when we find something that\u2019s wrong, we fix it.\u201dWhat Mr. Barney said he refused to accept was guilt that was not deserved. In the Rand worldview, that would be \u201cunearned guilt\u201d and akin to a sin. A rich man should not feel guilt for hard-earned wealth, he said; a pregnant woman should not feel guilt for having an abortion.So when it comes to the \u201cD.D.D.s\u201d \u2014 the dropouts and debtors \u2014 Mr. Barney said, \u201cI\u2019m really sad about that, but I\u2019m not guilty. We do everything to help them graduate.\u201d He compared his Denver school\u2019s on-time graduation rate of 34 percent with the local community college\u2019s of 10 percent.As for the complaint brought by the Colorado\u2019s attorney general\u2019s office, Mr. Barney said it was \u201cinvented for political purposes\u201d and designed \u201cto force us into a settlement of millions of dollars.\u201dAt the same time, Mr. Barney said, students sometimes did not pay attention to the requirements and costs even when they were explained.In Mr. Barney\u2019s view, the campaign against for-profit colleges is motivated by resentment against their outsize profits. He traces this animosity to the 2008 financial crisis and recession.The bad economy turned out to be good for his business. Stranded without jobs, people flocked to enroll in college. Yet the budgets of many state-run schools were slashed as the economy contracted.People turned to for-profit schools. \u201cThe phones were ringing off the hook,\u201d Mr. Barney said. \u201cAlong with the students came a lot of money. There is no question it was massive.\u201dNot only does Mr. Barney understand the indignation about profiting off public funds, in one sense, he shares it. \u201cI don\u2019t think taxpayers should pay for our students,\u201d he said. He says he believes that government should get out of student loans and grants altogether and leave the financing to the schools, potential employers and banks.It is a view that is echoed in \u201cAtlas Shrugged.\u201d In the novel, the legendary railroad titan Nathaniel Taggart is said to have tossed a government official down three flights of stairs merely for asking if Mr. Taggart would like a government loan.To some critics, the for-profit college business represents the exploitative side of Randian philosophy, in which vulnerable students\u2019 ambitions are manipulated for personal gain.The problem is not just a few bad apples, said A. J. Angulo, a history professor and the author of \u201cDiploma Mills: How For-Profit Colleges Stiffed Students, Taxpayers and the American Dream.\u201d Mr. Angulo says, \u201cWe\u2019re really talking about a few good apples.\u201dThat was the conclusion of a 2012 Senate investigation, the latest in a series of congressional and independent inquiries into for-profit schools\u2019 advertising, job placement and graduation rates, and recruitment strategies that date to the 1980s.To Mr. Angulo, the problem is systemic. \u201cThere is a fundamental conflict of interest, and it\u2019s created by the profit motive,\u201d he said. It leads to cost-cutting, and \u201cthe thing that gets shortchanged systematically is instruction.\u201dSuch hostility to the profit motive is precisely what sets off Mr. Barney\u2019s alarm bells. He argues that for-profit schools offer an alternative to failing, overcrowded community colleges and an educational lifeline to working adults.Free enterprise is what has propelled the United States to prosperity, Mr. Barney said, sitting in a club chair in the lounge at Deer Valley, after a day on ski trails with names like Tycoon, Lucky Star and of course, Success. \u201cYes, there are things to criticize,\u201d he said.But there were \u201ctwo great philosophical experiments of our age,\u201d he said \u2014 the Soviet Union, and America. \u201cSince the founding of this country, when the king was told to buzz off,\u201d he said, laughing, \u201cit\u2019s been a wonderful ride in America, hasn\u2019t it?\u201dAdvertisement"}

The administration has recently taken a bold step that will result in more pay, particularly for college graduates: the first major update to white-collar overtime rules in more than 40 years.In 1975, 62 percent of full-time salaried workers were overtime-eligible based on their pay when they worked beyond 40 hours a week. Today, it\u2019s only 7 percent.By more than doubling the yearly salary threshold (to $47,476 a year) under which these workers qualify for overtime, more than 4.2 million people will now have overtime protection or get a raise above the new threshold.Roughly 2.3 million are college graduates, who will get half of the $1.2 billion in additional yearly pay resulting from the update. For the workers benefiting from this meaningful update, extra work will now mean extra pay.THOMAS E. PEREZSecretary of LaborWashingtonAdvertisement"}

They have been effective, winning over a rare combination of military hawks, conservative Republicans and a collection of liberal Democrats in Congress. More important, they secured a commitment late last month for $415 million in additional aid to support the Kurds\u2019 pesh merga militia force.\u201cThey are willing to fight,\u201d said Representative Gerald E.

The fund, Eaglevale Hellenic Opportunity, had raised $25 million from investors to buy Greek bank stocks and government debt.Eaglevale Partners, a Manhattan hedge fund firm founded by Mr. Mezvinsky and two former Goldman Sachs colleagues, raised money for the Hellenic fund at a time when some on Wall Street had hopes for a revival in the Greek economy. For a time, Mr. Mezvinsky appeared at hedge fund conferences promoting the Greece investment thesis.Betting on Greece has proved to be tricky \u2014 some investors have made huge gains while others have had their fingers burned, depending on the timing of their bets.And the last 17 months have been especially difficult for a number of hedge funds, even ones run by some of the best-known managers.The average hedge fund was down 0.63 percent in the first quarter of this year, according to the HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index.Mr. Mezvinsky and his partners began raising money in 2011 from investors for the firm\u2019s flagship fund. Since then, that portfolio has posted uneven performance.It is not clear why Eaglevale waited until this year to close the Hellenic fund, which already had lost about 40 percent of its value by early last year.The economic situation in Greece is still tenuous as the country continues to squabble with other eurozone nations and its creditors about how to reduce its debt burden. Investors on Wall Street continue to promote investment in Greece nonetheless.During a recent Sohn Investment Conference charity event at Lincoln Center in New York, Richard Deitz, of the hedge fund VR Capital Group, told an audience of investors that he was betting on Greek banks and government bonds.In letters to investors in 2014, Mr. Mezvinsky and his partners expressed confidence that Greece would soon be on the path to a \u201csustainable recovery.\u201d But by the end of that year, Eaglevale\u2019s leaders began to acknowledge that their perspective on the situation in Greece may have been wrong. The fund had earlier stopped taking in new money.The one silver lining for the fund\u2019s investors from all of this is that they will have a somewhat larger tax loss on investments to claim next year.Steve Eder contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Political Rifts Over Bill Clinton\u2019s Welfare Law Resurface as Aid Shrinks", "Date": "2016-05-20", "News": "Supported byPHOENIX \u2014 With little debate, Arizona last year became the only state to impose a one-year limit on cash assistance to needy families, cutting the maximum duration of benefits for the third time since 2010. The newest limit has begun to hit home for welfare recipients who are learning that their benefits are nearing an end.Anna Robinson, the mother of a 4-year-old boy, received cash assistance for about eight months in 2013, until she landed a job at a call center for a pet-supply retailer. Then her job was automated and her position was eliminated. She will receive about four months of cash payments before they dry up.As the 20th anniversary of Bill Clinton\u2019s welfare law approaches, the impact of its requirements is being felt more than ever, with the political rifts that it exposed in 1996 resurfacing on the 2016 campaign trail.In her 2003 autobiography, \u201cLiving History,\u201d Hillary Clinton said she agreed with her husband\u2019s decision to sign the welfare bill, even though it \u201coutraged some of our most loyal supporters.\u201d The old program of Aid to Families With Dependent Children, created in the New Deal, \u201chelped to create generations of welfare-dependent Americans,\u201d she wrote.Her rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, fiercely opposed the law as a House member then and continues to press his case against it.\u201cI spoke out against so-called welfare reform because I thought it was scapegoating people who were helpless, people who were very, very vulnerable,\u201d Mr. Sanders said at a campaign stop in February. \u201cSecretary Clinton at that time had a very different position on welfare reform.\u201dOff the campaign trail, the real-world effects are coming into clearer focus. Arizona is perhaps the most vivid example of a national trend: the withering of the cash assistance program created by the law, known as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families.Cash benefits in Arizona are smaller now than when Congress created the assistance program 20 years ago. In 2009, Arizona reduced the maximum benefit by 20 percent, to $278 a month for a family of three with no other income. That cut, coupled with inflation, has reduced the buying power of the maximum benefit by about half.The federal law required states to set time limits on the receipt of cash assistance and specified that the payments could not exceed five years, which is still the limit in about two-thirds of the states.In 2010, Arizona cut cash-assistance eligibility to three years, from five. In 2011, it reduced the limit to two years. Then last year it dropped to one, with that limit to begin on July 1.\u201cThe 12-month time limit is rapidly approaching,\u201d said Michael Wisehart, an assistant director at the Arizona Department of Economic Security, which runs the welfare program.Any cash assistance received since October 2002 counts against the limit, according to state law and letters being sent to welfare recipients. That means even a few months spent on welfare a decade ago can significantly limit future benefits. Arizona officials estimate that 1,200 to 1,600 families \u2014 roughly 15 percent of those receiving cash assistance \u2014 will be affected. Some may qualify for hardship exemptions.Domonique Christian, 27, recently received a notice from the state saying that her cash assistance payments of $220 a month might soon be terminated because she had exceeded the new 12-month limit on benefits.Ms. Christian, a single mother, said she could not afford to lose the aid. She has two young sons and no job. That money, she said, is for diapers, clothing and food for her children, bus fare and other daily expenses.\u201cThe money,\u201d she said, \u201cis really low, but it will get you by. It helps. It\u2019s better than nothing.\u201dHere, as in several other states, proponents say the strict limits will create a new impetus for welfare recipients to find jobs and will reduce their reliance on public benefits. When President Clinton signed the welfare law in 1996, he said it would replace \u201ca never-ending cycle of welfare\u201d with \u201c\u2018the dignity, the power and the ethic of work.\u201dAnd for a while, it did. Welfare cases fell sharply, employment of single mothers increased and harsh critics of the program acknowledged that the first years were not nearly so bad as they had predicted. Children were not sleeping on grates.But the number of welfare recipients did not increase much even as the economy softened and poverty inched up in the recession that began in 2007.\u201cThe high marks given to the 1996 reform at its 10-year anniversary are much lower now as we approach its 20-year anniversary,\u201d said Sandra K. Danziger, an expert on poverty and social welfare policy at the University of Michigan.Caseloads during the recession increased far less than the number of people receiving food stamps or unemployment insurance benefits. The cash assistance program generally requires people to work to get benefits, but work was not readily available.\u201cThe program did not respond to economic need in the Great Recession,\u201d said Hilary Hoynes, a professor of economics and public policy at the University of California, Berkeley.Many Republicans, including House Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, still point to the welfare law as a success and a model for reinventing other domestic programs.But for many Democrats, swept up more by Mr. Sanders\u2019s liberal populism than Bill Clinton\u2019s centrism, the law is far less popular. Mr. Clinton, defending his wife, says she argued against more extreme welfare proposals that would have capped federal spending on Medicaid and food stamps. Her campaign notes that child poverty decreased more than 25 percent in the Clinton years and says that many families benefited from expansion of the earned-income tax credit under President Clinton.The welfare law has indisputably achieved one of the goals that Mr. Clinton announced in his first campaign for president, to \u201cend welfare as we know it.\u201dNationally, the number of people receiving cash assistance has fallen to 4.1 million, from 12.3 million in 1996. In Arizona, the number of cash assistance recipients has plummeted to 20,495, from a monthly average of 155,000 in 1996-97.The 1996 law reversed six decades of social welfare policy, eliminating the individual entitlement to cash assistance for the nation\u2019s poorest children and giving each state a lump sum of federal money with vast discretion over its use. The amount of the main federal block grant has remained at $16.5 billion annually since the law was adopted, but inflation has shrunk the value of that money about a third.In addition, the reach of the program has been greatly reduced.In 1996, for every 100 families in poverty, 68 received cash assistance. That fell to 23 for every 100 in 2014. And in a dozen states including Arizona, the number is fewer than 10 in 100.In response, the very poor have devised what Kathryn J. Edin, a professor of sociology at Johns Hopkins University, called survival strategies. Some, she said, sell plasma, a blood component. Some collect metal junk and aluminum cans and sell them to scrap dealers. Some move in temporarily with friends or relatives to save on rent.The proportion of poor single mothers who neither work nor receive welfare has increased sharply since 1996, according to census data analyzed by the Congressional Research Service.Timothy Jeffries, the director of the Arizona Department of Economic Security, often declares his \u201clove for the poor,\u201d and with the one-year limit about to take effect, he says his agency is making vigorous efforts to help people find jobs.But Democrats, outnumbered in the Legislature, see it differently. \u201cIt really feels like a hatred of poor people,\u201d said State Representative Celeste Plumlee, a Democrat who was on welfare for three years in the 2000s. \u201cIt\u2019s just mean, that\u2019s what it seems to me.\u201dArizona is not the only state to shorten its time limit for benefits. On Jan. 1, Missouri lowered its lifetime limit to 45 months, from five years. The General Assembly, controlled by Republicans, overrode a veto by Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, who said the change was \u201cas harsh as it is unnecessary.\u201dIn the first three months of this year, Missouri ended benefits for 2,780 households that had received cash assistance for 45 months or longer.Ronald T. Haskins, who helped write the 1996 federal law as an aide to House Republicans, said that for some poor people, the erosion of cash benefits had been offset by increases in other programs, including the earned-income tax credit, nutrition assistance and Medicaid.But Mr. Haskins said, \u201cIt is reasonable and appropriate to worry about mothers and children in families with no earnings and no cash welfare.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Congress trailed a coalition of parties in Kerala led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist), adding to the party\u2019s political losses after its poor showing in the general elections two years ago.\u201cVery clearly, the party as a whole has to move beyond this sort of clich\u00e9d introspection business into some serious action,\u201d said a lawmaker from Kerala, Shashi Tharoor, referring his own Congress party. He suggested in an interview on the NDTV news channel that the party begin by promoting younger leaders throughout the country.The seats won by the Bharatiya Janata Party in Assam will not significantly change the power equation in the upper house of Parliament, whose members are elected by state legislators. In the upper house, the party is in the minority and often faces setbacks when trying to pass measures to modernize and streamline the economy, as Mr. Modi promised in his rise to power.But it was a salve for the party and for Mr. Modi after a crushing defeat last fall in state elections in Bihar, which Mr. Modi cast as a referendum on his first 17 months in office. In February of last year, it was trounced by the Aam Aadmi Party in assembly elections in New Delhi.Parties with powerful female regional leaders triumphed in the southern state of Tamil Nadu and the eastern state of Bengal, despite accusations of corruption.All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, the party headed by Jayalalithaa Jayaram, the chief minister of Tamil Nadu, whose corruption conviction in 2014 was overturned on appeal last year, won in more than half the races on Thursday evening. All India Trinamool Congress, the party of Mamata Banerjee, all but swept West Bengal, winning in more than two-thirds of the races and defeating an alliance of the Congress party and various Communist parties, further cementing her grip on the state.The Congress party, once the unchallenged power in India, could take some comfort in its performance in the union territory of Puducherry, where its alliance won after a close fight against an incumbent government.Hari Kumar contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

To Mr. Ziulkoski, the public dressing down was the kind of rupture that symbolized \u201cthe beginning of the end for her administration.\u201dBut many political analysts say Ms. Rousseff\u2019s slow-motion downfall can also be tied to an autocratic persona and a go-it-alone work style that has driven away scores of political allies, former staff members and cabinet ministers, many of whom have endured searing episodes of public humiliation.\u201cShe\u2019s alienated so many politicians and squandered the good will of so many people, in part because of her terrible political skills but also because of her arrogance,\u201d said Edson Sardinha, the editor of Congresso em Foco, a magazine that focuses on government corruption. \u201cIn her hour of need, very few people are willing to run to her defense.\u201dMs. Rousseff, who has been politically battered by the scandal, said she was the victim of a naked power grab and sexist assumptions of how a woman should lead. She also said she was a convenient scapegoat for something she cannot control: the global plunge in commodity prices that has sent the economy into a tailspin.In more than five years in office, Ms. Rousseff has largely refused to meet with members of Congress, both opponents and allies, eroding the majority support she once enjoyed in the lower house. The aggrieved include Eduardo Suplicy, a former senator and beloved figure in Ms. Rousseff\u2019s Workers\u2019 Party, who said she had turned down multiple requests for a meeting.\u201cIn politics, either you talk or you die,\u201d said Alfredo Nascimento, a former transportation minister. In April, he voted for her impeachment.\u201cI can\u2019t support a president who is incapable of governing,\u201d he said.In Bras\u00edlia, the capital, most everyone can recount stories about Ms. Rousseff\u2019s intolerance for dissent and her short fuse. The anecdotes include the time she smashed an office computer in anger, her refusal to meet with indigenous leaders or gay rights activists and the castigation of aides for the smallest of infractions.She is also finding little sympathy from the Brazilian news media, which has long viewed her as cold and condescending \u2014 a marked contrast to the charismatic, backslapping approach of Mr. da Silva.Some agree that Ms. Rousseff is being judged by a double standard that has unfairly tarnished powerful women around the world. Would she be considered so obstinate and uncooperative if she were a man? Or would she simply be called a strong, decisive leader?\u201cThe president is enduring all the stereotypes and prejudices of Brazil\u2019s highly patriarchal and oligarchic society,\u201d said Rosana Schwartz, a historian and sociologist at Mackenzie Presbyterian University in S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cI\u2019ve even heard people say, \u2018We will never again vote for a woman.\u2019 \u201dBut Antonia Melo, a former Workers\u2019 Party member, said Ms. Rousseff\u2019s gruff manner had alienated many of the party faithful. Ms. Melo described a meeting, when Ms. Rousseff was minister of energy, during which activists hoped to make their case against a contentious dam project in the Amazon.Ms. Melo said she had barely finished her first sentence when Ms. Rousseff cut her off, pounded on the table and vowed to press forward with the dam\u2019s construction. Then she turned around and left the room.\u201cWe stood there looking at each other in silence, perplexed,\u201d Ms. Melo said. \u201cWe felt so disrespected and discarded.\u201dThe episode was stinging given the origin of the Workers\u2019 Party and Ms. Rousseff\u2019s pedigree as a champion of the disenfranchised. The party\u2019s founders were Marxist guerrillas who rose to power through a coalition of trade unionists, landless farmers, indigenous activists and leftist intellectuals who helped pave the way for the re-establishment of democracy in 1985.But that coalition is in tatters. Ms. Rousseff is battling accusations that she hid the depths of Brazil\u2019s economic troubles to enhance her re-election prospects. Many bedrock supporters are disillusioned by widespread corruption in the national oil company, Petrobras, and by what many describe as Ms. Rousseff\u2019s about-face, after her re-election in 2014, on several campaign promises to preserve generous government spending.Dilma Rousseff, Brazil\u2019s president, is facing removal from office. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the proceedings.In recent weeks, at least 135 mayors aligned with the Workers\u2019 Party have changed their party affiliations \u2014 about a fifth of the nation\u2019s mayors who had been elected on the party\u2019s ticket. Among them are Jo\u00e3o Paulo Ribeiro, 31, the mayor of a small city, who said he had grown weary of the attacks by residents and even friends who questioned his association with Ms. Rousseff\u2019s party.\u201cI have to listen to the people,\u201d said Mr. Ribeiro, who changed parties last month, hoping to improve his chances for re-election in October.It is not as if the political figures lining up to oust Ms. Rousseff are viewed as saviors. Many of them are battling serious accusations of corruption, and they were in positions of great power as the country\u2019s once-enviable economy ran aground.Rising unemployment and the broad unrest over Brazil\u2019s economy only added to the strains between Ms. Rousseff and Congress. Had the economy been ascendant \u2014 as it was in 2005 when her predecessor, Mr. da Silva, became embroiled in a vote-buying scandal \u2014 she might have emerged unscathed.The end of Brazil\u2019s bonanza complicated the patronage used to navigate the fractious legislature, in which more than two dozen parties fight for government funding.\u201cWe have a political system based on extracting money from the economy and transferring it to political parties to finance elections,\u201d said Rubens Ric\u00fapero, who served as minister of finance in the mid-1990s.Many Brazilian economists and policy makers contend that the economic crisis was largely a product of Ms. Rousseff\u2019s own making. She increased the government\u2019s footprint in the economy, spending large amounts on favored industries and corporations to build up national champions.\u201cBrazil insisted in carrying out an industrial policy devoid of logic,\u201d said Arminio Fraga, a former governor of the Central Bank of Brazil. \u201cWhen the government offers companies all sorts of advantages, through protection, subsidies and contracts, it creates enormous space for this sort of thing.\u201dFriends and associates say Ms. Rousseff\u2019s worldview and personality were partly shaped by the three years she was imprisoned by the military, a trauma that included torture like beatings and shocks with an electric baton.An economist and career bureaucrat, Ms. Rousseff, 68, had not held elected office until Mr. da Silva, who was barred under the Constitution from seeking a third consecutive term, picked her to run for president on the Workers\u2019 Party ticket. Mr. da Silva has said he was impressed by her grasp of complex data and her no-nonsense managerial style.Idelber Avelar, an early member of the Workers\u2019 Party, said Mr. da Silva also viewed Ms. Rousseff as a compliant soldier who would continue his policies and keep the economy humming until he could run again.\u201cClearly, he thought Dilma was somebody he could easily control, a technocrat who would run the machine, which is pretty ironic given that she\u2019s proven to be a disastrous administrator,\u201d said Mr. Avelar, who now teaches at Tulane University in New Orleans. \u201cThe root of all her problems is a profound aversion to politics.\u201dAt least 86 cabinet ministers have come and gone since she took office, and only three remain from her first term. Many were forced to resign after being accused of corruption.Ms. Rousseff has not been accused of graft, though many people question her innocence, given her role as chairwoman of the national oil company at a time when the epic kickback scheme was being hatched.In an interview, Ms. Rousseff brushed off suggestions that her disdain for retail politics and the horse trading required to pass legislation had contributed to her woes. She defended her decision to ignore members of Congress.\u201cThere were certain types of blackmail negotiations I would not engage in,\u201d she said.For a time, the Brazilian public viewed her steely resolve positively. During her first year in office, Ms. Rousseff\u2019s popularity stood at 77 percent, among the highest percentages in recent history. These days, that figure is in the single digits.Many Brazilians still admire Ms. Rousseff\u2019s ethics. But after two years of economic turmoil, her televised speeches prompt a cacophony on the streets, as thousands bang on pots and pans to drown out her voice.Few give Ms. Rousseff credit for big achievements, including a landmark freedom of information law and measures that gave federal police and prosecutors new tools to tackle corruption.In some ways, analysts said, Ms. Rousseff has become a victim of those laws, which paved the way for the investigations that have claimed scores of the political and business elite, exposing the depths of Brazil\u2019s political rot.\u201cThis is one of the greatest paradoxes of her fall, because she put in place the machinery that ensnared the politicians who mattered the most,\u201d said Gregory Michener, a professor at Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Get\u00falio Vargas, a research institute in Rio de Janeiro. \u201cDilma did a lot for good government, and I think she ultimately wanted good government, but in the end she wasn\u2019t a good politician because in Brazil\u2019s rent-seeking party system, she was unwilling to give her allies their fill.\u201dPaula Moura contributed reporting from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, and Eduardo Porter from New York.Advertisement"}

The prospect of a Trump presidency has raised urgent fears: of the nation\u2019s fascist tendencies, of the potential for riots in the streets. At the same time, many liberals have expressed a grim satisfaction in watching the Republican Party tear itself apart. Whatever terrible fate might soon befall the nation, the thinking goes, it\u2019s their fault, not ours. They are the ones stirring up the base prejudices and epic resentments of America\u2019s disaffected white working class, and they must now reap the whirlwind.In his new book, the social critic Thomas Frank \u00adposes another possibility: that liberals in general \u2014 and the Democratic Party in particular \u2014 should look inward to understand the sorry state of American politics. Too busy attending TED talks and \u00advacationing in Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Frank argues, the Democratic elite has abandoned the party\u2019s traditional commitments to the working class. In the process, they have helped to create the political despair and anger at the heart of today\u2019s right-wing insurgencies. They may also have sown the seeds of their own demise. Frank\u2019s recent columns argue that the Bernie Sanders campaign offers not merely a challenge to Hillary Clinton, but a last-ditch chance to save the corrupted soul of the Democratic Party.Frank has been delivering some version of this message for the past two decades as a political essayist and a founding editor of The Baffler magazine. \u201cListen, Liberal\u201d is the thoroughly entertaining if rather gloomy work of a man who feels that nobody has been paying attention. Frank\u2019s most famous book, \u201cWhat\u2019s the Matter With Kansas?\u201d (2004), argued that Republicans had duped the white working class by pounding the table on social issues while delivering tax cuts for the rich. He focused on Kansas as the reddest of red states (and, not incidentally, the place of his birth). This time Frank is coming for the Ivy League blue-state liberals, that \u201ctight little network of enlightened strivers\u201d who have allegedly been running the country into the ground. Think of it as \u201cWhat\u2019s the Matter With Massachusetts?\u201dFrank\u2019s book is an unabashed polemic, not a studious examination of policy or polling trends. In Frank\u2019s view, liberal policy wonks are part of the problem, members of a well-educated elite that massages its own technocratic vanities while utterly missing the big question of the day. To Frank, that question hasn\u2019t changed much over the last few centuries. \u201cIt is the eternal conflict of management and labor, owner and worker, rich and poor \u2014 only with one side pinned to the ground and the other leisurely pounding away at its adversary\u2019s face,\u201d he writes. Today, polite circles tend to describe this as the issue of \u201cinequality.\u201d Frank prefers an older formulation. \u201cThe 19th century understood it better: They called it \u2018the social question,\u2019\u200a\u201d he writes, defined as \u201cnothing less than the whole vast mystery of how we are going to live together.\u201dAs Frank notes, today some people are living much better than others \u2014 and many of those people are not Republicans. Frank delights in skewering the sacred cows of coastal liberalism, including private universities, bike paths, microfinance, the Clinton Foundation, \u201cwell-meaning billionaires\u201d and any public policy offering \u201cinnovation\u201d or \u201ceducation\u201d as a solution to inequality. He spends almost an entire chapter mocking the true-blue city of Boston, with its \u201clab-coat and starched-shirt\u201d economy and its \u201cwell-graduated\u201d population of overconfident collegians.Behind all of this nasty fun is a serious political critique. Echoing the historian Lily Geismer, Frank argues that the Democratic Party \u2014 once \u201cthe Party of the People\u201d \u2014 now caters to the interests of a \u201cprofessional-managerial class\u201d consisting of lawyers, doctors, professors, scientists, programmers, even investment bankers. These affluent city dwellers and suburbanites believe firmly in meritocracy and individual opportunity, but shun the kind of social policies that once gave a real leg up to the working class. In the book, Frank points to the Democrats\u2019 neglect of organized labor and support for Nafta as examples of this sensibility, in which \u201cyou get what you deserve, and what you deserve is defined by how you did in school.\u201d In more recent columns, he has linked this neglect to the rise of a figure like Sanders, who says forthrightly what the party leadership might prefer to obscure: Current approaches aren\u2019t working \u2014 and unless something dramatic happens, Americans are heading for a society in which a tiny elite controls most of the wealth, \u00adresources and decision-making power.The problem, in Frank\u2019s view, is not simply that mainstream Democrats have failed to address growing inequality. Instead, he suggests something more sinister: Today\u2019s leading Democrats actually don\u2019t want to reduce inequality because they believe that inequality is the normal and righteous order of things. As proof, he points to the famously impolitic Larry Summers, whose background as a former president of Harvard, former Treasury secretary and former chief economist of the World Bank embodies all that Frank abhors about modern Democrats. \u201cOne of the reasons that inequality has probably gone up in our society is that people are being treated closer to the way that they\u2019re supposed to be treated,\u201d Summers commented early in the Obama administration.\u201cRemember, as you let that last sentence slide slowly down your throat, that this was a Democrat saying this,\u201d Frank writes. From this mind-set stems everything that the Democrats have done to betray the masses, from Bill Clinton\u2019s crime bill and welfare reform policies to Obama\u2019s failure to rein in Wall Street, according to Frank. No surprise, under the circumstances, that the working class might look elsewhere for satisfying political options.Frank is hardly the first critic to remark upon a disconnect between the lives of wealthy liberals and the grittier constituencies they supposedly serve. As the historian Steve Fraser demonstrates in his wide-ranging new book, the idea of the \u201climousine liberal\u201d has a long and messy history all its own. The term originated during the 1969 New York mayoral campaign, when the Democratic candidate Mario Procaccino charged the highborn Liberal Party incumbent John Lindsay, formerly a Republican, with acts unbecoming to his social class. Procaccino\u2019s accusation differed slightly from Frank\u2019s: Procaccino believed that Lindsay genuinely sought ambitious programs to empower the poor and the black and the disenfranchised. The problem was that Lindsay did it all from the \u201csilk-stocking district\u201d of the Upper East Side, where his wealth insulated him from the dire consequences of his actions.Though Procaccino lost the mayoral election, his biting phrase went on to have an illustrious political career of its own. \u201cNowadays,\u201d Fraser writes wryly, \u201cHillary Clinton serves as \u2018Exhibit A\u2019 of this menace,\u201d \u201cthe quintessential limousine liberal hypocrite.\u201d Despite its title, however, Fraser\u2019s book is not really about liberals and their supposed foibles. Instead, he seeks to describe how \u201cright-wing populists\u201d have insulted, vilified, mocked and analyzed those liberals in both the present and the past.According to Fraser, suspicion of highborn reformers extends back at least to the Progressive Era, when the idea of an activist government administered by well-educated experts began to take hold. Since then, these villains of American consciousness have labored under a variety of epithets: \u201cparlor pinks,\u201d \u201cMercedes Marxists,\u201d \u201cmen in striped pants.\u201d In each iteration, what seems to drive the attacks is not only the tincture of hypocrisy but the unrestrained confidence with which such liberals express their expert views. In that sense, Frank\u2019s fuming at the smug knowledge workers of Boston might have come straight from the pages of National Review, circa either 1955 or 2015.Fraser does not deny a certain reality behind the \u201climousine liberal\u201d image. \u201cLimousine liberalism was never a myth,\u201d he writes, however \u201cabsurd and scurrilous\u201d the political rhetoric may have been. Something did change beginning in the early 20th century, as the complexities of modern society began to demand new forms of expertise and new institutions to coordinate them. Resentment of \u201climousine liberals\u201d is nothing less than a reaction to the modern condition, Fraser argues, though some politicians have more effectively navigated its challenges than others. Franklin Roosevelt managed to transcend his patrician upbringing to emerge as a genuine champion of the \u201clittle man\u201d \u2014 and to become enormously popular while doing it.Fraser agrees with Frank that the Democratic Party can no longer reasonably claim to be the party of the working class or the \u201clittle man.\u201d Instead, he argues, the Republican and Democratic parties now represent two different elite constituencies, each with its own culture and interests and modes of thought. Fraser describes today\u2019s Republicans as the party of \u201cfamily capitalism,\u201d encompassing everyone from the mom-and-pop business owner on up to \u201centrepreneurial maestros\u201d such as the Koch brothers, Linda McMahon and Donald Trump. The Democrats, by contrast, represent the managerial world spawned by modernity, including the big universities and government bureaucracies as well as \u201ctechno frontiersmen\u201d like Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates. These are two different ways of relating to the world \u2014 one cosmopolitan and interconnected, the other patriarchal and hierarchical. Neither one, however, offers much to working-class voters.One liberal whose reputation still seems to be up for grabs is Barack Obama, now on his way out of office and into the history books. Frank gives Obama a middling-to-poor grade \u2014 something in the D range, let\u2019s say \u2014 for what he deems to be the president\u2019s vague and rambling answer to the \u201csocial question.\u201d Frank compares Obama unfavorably with Franklin Roose\u00advelt, another Democratic president who inherited an economic crisis from his Republican predecessor. Roosevelt took advantage of the Great Depression to reshape American society in fundamental ways, introducing social welfare and labor protections that shifted real power into the hands of the middle and working classes. (Frank largely gives Roosevelt a pass on the New Deal\u2019s own structural inequalities, including its exclusions of women and nonwhite workers.) Obama, by contrast, let the crisis go \u201cto waste,\u201d according to Frank, tweaking around the regulatory edges without doing anything significant to change the economic balance of power. \u201cOur economy has been reliving the 1930s,\u201d Frank mourns. \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t our politics?\u201dPart of the answer may be that our economy did not, in fact, relive the 1930s. By the time Roosevelt won his first presidential election, the economy had been in free-fall for more than three years and the stock market had lost nearly 90 percent of its value. Three years into the Great Recession, the stock market had begun its climb toward record highs, though that prosperity failed to trickle down to the middle and working classes. Frank sees this uneven recovery as a tragedy rather than a triumph, in which Obama \u201csaved a bankrupt system that by all rights should have met its end.\u201d He says little, however, about what sort of system might have replaced it, or about what working-class voters themselves might say that they want or need. In a book urging Democrats to pay attention to working-class concerns, there are decidedly few interviews with working people, and a lot of time spent on tech conferences and think tanks and fancy universities.Perhaps as a result, Frank\u2019s book ends on a pessimistic note. After two decades of pleading with liberals to think seriously about inequality, to honor what was best about the New Deal, Frank has concluded that things will probably continue to get worse. \u201cThe Democrats have no interest in reforming themselves in a more egalitarian way,\u201d he writes. \u201cThere is little the rest of us can do, given the current legal arrangements of this country, to build a vital third-party movement or to revive organized labor.\u201dBut this conclusion, too, may rest on a faulty analogy with the 1930s. Franklin Roosevelt did not suddenly decide on his own to enact Social Security or grant union rights. Those ideas came up from below, through decades of frustration and struggle and conflict. If Americans want something different from their politicians, there is no alternative to this kind of exhausting and uncertain hard work. In the end, it is the only way that liberals \u2014 or conservatives \u2014 will listen.LISTEN, LIBERALOr, What Ever Happened to the Party of the People?By Thomas Frank305 pp. Metropolitan Books/Henry Holt & Company. $27.THE LIMOUSINE LIBERALHow an Incendiary Image United the Right and Fractured AmericaBy Steve Fraser291 pp. Basic Books. $27.50.Beverly Gage teaches American history at Yale.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Conservative Case Against Trump", "Date": "2016-05-07", "News": "Supported byTHERE are many lessons that conservatives need to learn from the rise of Donald Trump. There are elements of his message that the party should embrace. There are grievances among his voters that the Republican Party must address.But for conservatives to support Trump himself, to assist in his election as president of the United States, would be a terrible mistake.It would be a particularly stark mistake for conservatives who feel that the basic Reaganite vision that\u2019s dominated their party for decades \u2014 a fusion of social conservatism, free-market economics, and a hawkish internationalism \u2014 still gets things mostly right.In large ways and small, Trump has consistently arrayed himself against this vision. True, he paid lip service to certain Reaganite ideas during the primaries \u2014 claiming to be pro-life, promising a supply-side tax cut, pledging to appoint conservative judges. But the core of his message was protectionist and nativist, comfortable with an expansive welfare state, bored with religious conservatism, and dismissive of the commitments that constitute the post-Cold War Pax Americana. And Trump\u2019s policy forays since clinching the nomination have only confirmed his post-Reagan orientation.Reaganite conservatives who help elevate Trump to the presidency, then, would be sleepwalking toward a kind of ideological suicide. Successful party leaders often transform parties in their image. William Jennings Bryan and Woodrow Wilson between them turned a conservative Democratic Party progressive. Dwight Eisenhower all but extinguished G.O.P. isolationism. Reagan himself set liberal Republicanism on the path to extinction.A successful President Trump (and to support him is to hope for such a thing) could easily do the same to Reaganism. In a fully-Trumpized G.O.P., Reagan\u2019s ideological coalition would crack up, with hawks drifting toward the Democrats, supply-siders fading into crankery, religious conservatives entering semi-permanent exile. And in its place a Trumpized Republican intelligentsia would arise, with as little interest in Reaganism as today\u2019s conservatives have in the ideas of Nelson Rockefeller or Jacob Javits.But what if you\u2019re a conservative who isn\u2019t a Reaganite, or you believe that Reaganite ideas have long passed their sell-by dates? What if you agree with Trump about the folly of the Iraq War, the perils of open immigration policies, or the need for a different right-wing economic agenda? What if you think his populism might bring about some necessary creative destruction to a backward-looking G.O.P.?Then supporting Trump for president could make ideological sense, and the crackup I\u2019ve just described might seem like an advertisement for doing so.His unfitness starts with basic issues of temperament. It encompasses the race-baiting, the conspiracy theorizing, the flirtations with violence, and the pathological lying that have been his campaign-trail stock in trade.But far more than Obama or Hillary or George W. Bush, Trump is actively campaigning as a Caesarist, making his contempt for constitutional norms and political niceties a selling point. And given his mix of proud ignorance and immense self-regard, there is no reason to believe that any of this is just an act.In sum: It would be possible to justify support for Trump if he merely promised a period of chaos for conservatism. But to support Trump for the presidency is to invite chaos upon the republic and the world. No policy goal, no court appointment, can justify such recklessness.To Trumpism\u2019s appeal, to Trump\u2019s constituents, conservatives should listen and answer \u201cyes,\u201d or \u201cmaybe,\u201d or \u201cnot that, but how about\u2026\u201dBut to Trump himself, there is no patriotic answer except \u201cno.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Buyer Beware", "Date": "2016-05-27", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe king\u2019s endorsement increases the chances that an I.P.O. will occur, though the scale of the offering remains unclear. It could be relatively small and restricted to Saudi investors, thus avoiding the need for the heightened transparency normally associated with I.P.O.s. Conversely, despite the lack of transparency, a larger offering could be in the cards, promoted in part by bankers and consultants who stand to reap a fortune in fees on the transaction.Either way, an Aramco I.P.O. raises questions, and what investors don\u2019t know about the company \u2014 the accuracy of its claimed oil and gas reserves, for instance \u2014 is only one of them. An investment in Aramco would also be an investment in a kingdom that systematically represses women, and hence, in human and social capital. None of the many officials named to new posts in the decrees were women.Though ostensibly aimed at modernization, neither the development plan nor the decrees propose changes in the kingdom\u2019s basic political arrangements, in which religious fundamentalists uphold the legitimacy of the royal family in exchange for freedom to foster and spread extremist ideology. There is also no explanation of how even a big infusion of cash would build new industries from nothing and transform Saudi Arabia\u2019s estimated 20 million subjects into self-supporting employers and employees.Saudi Arabia desperately needs to modernize, and even talking about that need is a step forward. But neither the Saudis nor their global bankers should pretend that an I.P.O. of Aramco, as the company is currently configured, is a viable means to that end.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Crusade That Exposed New York\u2019s Vice Economy", "Date": "2016-05-13", "News": "Supported byBookshelfOn Feb. 14, 1892, the Rev. Dr. Charles H. Parkhurst delivered what Daniel Czitrom, a Mount Holyoke College historian, calls \u201cthe most politically explosive sermon in New York history.\u201dBilly McGlory\u2019s brothel on East 14th Street operated openly, protected by the police and prosecutors and by the \u201clying, perjured, rum-soaked and libidinous lot\u201d who ran New York, Parkhurst said furiously from the pulpit.Within weeks, a Manhattan grand jury, convened to call Parkhurst\u2019s bluff, rejected his claim. Instead of retreating, however, the dogged Presbyterian minister teamed up with a suburban Republican state senator, Clarence Lexow, marshaled evidence of officially sanctioned vice, and started a decontamination crusade that resonates today in echoes of police brutality and corruption, income inequality, restricted immigration, vote suppression, links between evangelicals and politics and, as Professor Czitrom writes, \u201cthe nation\u2019s profound fear and distrust of New York City.\u201dStill, Professor Czitrom\u2019s evocative account reveals that the nexus between politics, policing and biblical trespasses in the late 19th century introduced the term \u201corganized crime,\u201d spawned the Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Association, demonstrated the power of mass media and even presaged reality television shows when George Appo, a notorious swindler, and Tom Gould, owner of a disreputable saloon, played themselves when \u201cIn the Tenderloin\u201d opened at a theater on the Bowery.The Lexow Committee found little evidence that the Democratic bosses of Tammany Hall committed vote fraud (the influx of immigrants was enough to supply them with loyal constituents) or profited primarily from vice (their most lucrative investments were from \u201chonest graft\u201d).New Yorkers eventually soured on Parkhurst\u2019s crusade. His patrician righteousness against vice came to be seen as bigoted, hypocritical and puritanical. At the trial of Hattie Adams, a brothel owner, her lawyer, the bombastic Abe Hummel, eviscerated the minister\u2019s motives in feverishly exploring the city\u2019s dens of iniquity and reporting back on nude gambols. \u201cIt is for you to decide,\u201d Hummel told the jury, \u201cwhether this man went to this house and witnessed that dance for the object which he has stated or to gratify his lustful tendencies by looking on.\u201d Adams was convicted; the jury recommended mercy.Samuel Langhorne Clemens\u2019s first public lecture, at New York\u2019s Cooper Union in 1867, was so poorly subscribed that his manager filled the auditorium by donating free tickets to teachers.

{"Headline": "Countersuits Over North Carolina\u2019s Bias Law", "Date": "2016-05-09", "News": "Supported byRALEIGH, N.C. \u2014 The nation\u2019s clash over the rights of transgender people escalated sharply on Monday as Gov. Pat McCrory of North Carolina and the Justice Department sued each other, testing the boundaries of federal civil rights laws in a dispute over public restroom access.Days after the Justice Department demanded that North Carolina back away from a new state law restricting access to restrooms, locker rooms and changing rooms, Mr. McCrory, in a lawsuit filed in Federal District Court here, accused the department of \u201ca baseless and blatant overreach\u201d stemming from a \u201cradical reinterpretation\u201d of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The state General Assembly\u2019s Republican leaders filed a similar suit against the Justice Department.\u201cUltimately, I think it\u2019s time for the U.S. Congress to bring clarity to our national anti-discrimination provisions,\u201d Mr. McCrory, a Republican who is running for re-election this year, told reporters here. \u201cRight now, the Obama administration is bypassing Congress by attempting to rewrite the law.\u201dHours later, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said no clarification was needed, and she asserted that federal civil rights laws barring discrimination on the basis of sex prohibit laws like the one in North Carolina.\u201cThey created state-sponsored discrimination against transgender individuals who simply seek to engage in the most private of functions in a place of safety and security,\u201d she said at a news conference in Washington. \u201cNone of us can stand by when a state enters the business of legislating identity and insists that a person pretend to be something or someone that they are not.\u201dStraying from her usual understated, lawyerly tone, Ms. Lynch, a North Carolina native, grew impassioned as she likened the fight to earlier battles over Jim Crow laws and laws against same-sex marriage.\u201cThis is not the first time that we have seen discriminatory responses to historic moments of progress,\u201d she said. Addressing transgender people, she added: \u201cWe see you. We stand with you, and we will do everything we can to protect you going forward.\u201dThe Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit, filed in a different federal court in the state, argued that North Carolina\u2019s law, which prohibits people from using public restrooms that do not correspond with the gender listed on their birth certificates, compels \u201cpublic agencies to follow a facially discriminatory policy.\u201dEven before the Justice Department challenged the law in court, the federal government had been examining how it could pressure North Carolina. Last month, federal agencies acknowledged that they were studying whether the law affected North Carolina\u2019s eligibility for aid from Washington that helps pay for schools, highways and housing.Mr. McCrory\u2019s suit was assigned to Judge Terrence W. Boyle, an appointee of President George W. Bush and a former aide to Jesse Helms, the longtime conservative Republican senator from North Carolina. The Federal District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, where the Justice Department filed its case, did not immediately assign a judge to handle the proceedings there.The law has drawn scorn from businesses like PayPal and the N.B.A., has led to calls for a boycott of North Carolina, and has prompted some companies and entertainers to reverse plans to do business in the state. It even found its way into the presidential race, becoming a frequent theme of the final weeks of the campaign of Senator Ted Cruz, who said, \u201cGrown adult men, strangers, should not be alone in a bathroom with little girls.\u201dA lawsuit filed by North Carolina against the Justice Department, which said last week that the state had violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964 when it passed a law prohibiting people from using public restrooms that do not correspond with the gender listed on their birth certificates.Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, on Monday described the North Carolina law as \u201cmeanspirited,\u201d and said it would harm the state\u2019s economy.But the economic arguments are familiar ones in North Carolina, and they have failed to prevent both sides from moving the clash into the courts. The litigation will test the expansive view the Obama administration has taken of civil rights law, arguing that it bars discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, even if the wording of the law does not address those issues explicitly.\u201cIt is, in some ways, bringing to a head a lot of developments that have been happening over the last several years,\u201d said Douglas NeJaime, the faculty director of the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles, which studies gender identity law. \u201cWhat\u2019s become clear is that the issue around bathroom access has really been tightly caught up in the culture wars.\u201dOn Monday, Mr. McCrory repeated his belief that Charlotte, the state\u2019s largest city, had provoked the turmoil here, saying, \u201cThe governor did not seek out this issue.\u201dThe litigation placed new attention on the dispute between Charlotte, a relatively liberal city where Mr. McCrory was mayor for 14 years, and conservative Republicans, often from rural areas, who dominate the legislature. It further presses the governor, who ran for office as a moderate, into an unexpected role, as a conservative warrior on social issues, months before voters decide if he deserves a second term.Mr. McCrory\u2019s lawsuit left little doubt about his view of a Justice Department that Republicans here regard with open contempt. The department, the lawsuit said, was engaged in \u201can attempt to unilaterally rewrite long-established federal civil rights laws in a manner that is wholly inconsistent with the intent of Congress and disregards decades of statutory interpretation by the courts.\u201dWhen she wrote to Mr. McCrory, Ms. Gupta gave the governor until Monday to tell federal officials whether he would \u201cremedy these violations.\u201dAfter her letter, there were signals that Republicans here, influenced by the prospect of losing federal funds and facing an economic backlash, were considering softening the law and its effects.But on Monday, it became clear that the prospects for a quick reconciliation had vanished.Alan Blinder reported from Raleigh, Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a from New York, and Eric Lichtblau from Washington.

Erected in 1902, it portrays Boudicca, the warrior queen who, in the words of the inscription on the statue\u2019s plinth, \u201cdied A.D. 61, after leading her people against the Roman invader.\u201dAs Britain prepares to vote next month on whether to leave the European Union, the story of Boudicca serves as a reminder that the tradition of British euroskepticism is an ancient one. Her statue, complete with rearing horses and a chariot armed with scythes on its hubcaps, seems to capture the spirit of Brexit.It is also a reminder, though, that belonging to a European superstate can bring benefits as well as drawbacks. The location of Boudicca\u2019s statue, in the heart of London, right by the seat of government, is not without its ironies. It was the Romans who founded the British capital: Londinium.Boudicca\u2019s sole contribution to its development was to massacre its inhabitants and raze it \u2014 a calamity for the city that ranks with the Great Fire and the Blitz. Although her uprising was soon crushed by the Roman legions, her presence next to the Houses of Parliament is, in a sense, as inappropriate as a statue of Sherman would be outside the Capitol in Atlanta.How do the British principally identify themselves: as an island nation or a European people? This question, which lies at the heart of the referendum on whether Britain should quit membership in the European Union, is one tortured with ambivalences.In Latin, Boudicca meant Victoria \u2014 so perhaps it was only fitting that the statue of the queen who defied the Roman Empire should have been given the face of the monarch who presided over Britain\u2019s own imperial heyday. Classically educated, patriotic Victorians \u2014 even as they reveled in their country\u2019s glorious isolation from the Continent \u2014 found it hard not to identify the British Empire with the Pax Romana. Many, as a result, were predisposed to view the defeat of Boudicca\u2019s attempt at Brexit as a thoroughly good thing.Typical was Francis Haverfield, an eminent archaeologist who was the first to examine closely how Britain, under occupation by Rome\u2019s legions, had been absorbed into the Roman order. In 1905, three years after the statue of Boudicca had been winched into position, Haverfield declared himself on the side of the invaders.\u201cWhatever their limitations,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe men of the Empire wrought for the betterment and happiness of the world.\u201dSuch a perspective, even in this postcolonial era, has not disappeared. A decade ago, Boris Johnson, a leading Conservative member of Parliament and, until this month, the mayor of London, published a book titled \u201cThe Dream of Rome.\u201d In it, he argued that, like the United States, the Roman Empire had served as a great melting pot in which peoples of every conceivable background came to share a common citizenship. When Mr. Johnson wrote that \u201cthe European Union can be seen as the inheritor of the Roman Empire,\u201d he meant it.The contradictions in Mr. Johnson\u2019s attitude to the Roman Empire are bred, perhaps, as much by geography as by his own willful and mercurial character. Just as Charles de Gaulle once warned against admitting Britain into the European Union\u2019s predecessor, the Common Market, on the grounds that, as an island nation, Britain would always look to the sea, so Roman ethnographers regarded the Britons as a people apart. The catalog of their barbarisms, from their florid body painting to their taste for milk, even made Rome\u2019s imperial strategists doubt the value of conquering them at all.Even when, in A.D. 43, they finally decided on an invasion, the advance of the Roman legions was ultimately blunted by the increasingly inhospitable landscape and the savagery of the natives. As a result, the northern outposts were always heavily \u2014 and no doubt oppressively \u2014 militarized. Historians have aptly described the occupation of the north as Rome\u2019s equivalent of Afghanistan, resistant to all attempts at subjugation. Hadrian\u2019s Wall still stands as a memorial to the failure of the Caesars to subdue the rebellious Picts.Farther south, however, classical civilization gained a greater hold. From their Continental masters, the native aristocracy acquired a taste for baths, mosaics and central heating; the villas they built during the third and fourth centuries were tributes to Roman taste.AND yet, even these acculturated Britons remained to some degree outsiders. Unlike their counterparts in Spain and Gaul, they did not enter the highest echelons of imperial society. As late as the mid-fourth century, by which point Britain had been a Roman province for 300 years, the very notion of a cultured Briton could generate snorts of derision. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a good Briton,\u201d one Roman author declared, after a British poet had dared to give him a bad review.Britain would soon become notorious for something far removed from literary criticism: armed insurrection. \u201cFertile in rebels,\u201d the early Christian theologian St. Jerome wrote of the island. By the time he did so, in 415, Britain\u2019s status as the troublemaker of the Roman world was firmly established. As early as the third century, one insurgent leader declared himself the emperor of Britain and northern Gaul; and in 383, another British warlord crossed the Channel and ruled as emperor in Gaul for five years.By the early fifth century, it was evident that the imperial authorities, struggling to cope with mass immigration and economic upheaval in their own heartlands, had lost control of Britain. It is possible that they opted deliberately to cut the province loose; but the evidence points to a more startling conclusion. The Britons, so we are told by a near-contemporary historian, \u201cthrew off Roman rule, and lived independently, no longer subject to Roman laws.\u201d So, Britain, uniquely among the provinces of the Roman Empire, seems to have chosen exit.The immediate consequences of this decision verged on the apocalyptic: The British economy imploded, villas and cities were abandoned to weeds, and the province was carved up among warlike tribal invaders. On the other side of the ledger, the upheaval proved, in the long run, to be the making of the English language, the common law and cricket.That the stakes in June\u2019s referendum are less high can be reckoned, no doubt, a positive. For all that, though, it is not wholly implausible to see in Britain\u2019s status as a reluctant, rebellious, only partly tamed member of the Roman Empire a mirror for our present choice. As it might have been expressed in Latin, \u201cBrexit quondam, Brexitque futurus\u201d \u2014 our once and future Brexit.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber and Lyft End Rides in Austin to Protest Fingerprint Background Checks", "Date": "2016-05-09", "News": "Supported byUber and Lyft were not bluffing.On Monday, the two leaders of the booming ride-hailing industry halted service in Austin, Tex., after losing a legislative fight over how they screen their drivers.Ending the service also meant that about 10,000 drivers would be out of work, Taylor Patterson, an Uber spokeswoman, said.\u201cFolks are devastated,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are saying, \u2018I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to pay my rent.\u2019\u201dThe legislative fight playing out in Austin, the Texas capital, has been watched closely by municipalities across the country as they ponder how to handle public-safety issues posed by the so-called sharing economy.Austin\u2019s City Council voted in 2015 to require that the companies subject their drivers to fingerprint background checks, which could turn up criminal records. The regulation was fiercely opposed by the industry as unnecessary and less effective than its own system.Uber and Lyft, both based in California, responded by underwriting a nearly $9 million campaign against the ordinance that culminated with an up-or-down vote by Austin residents on Saturday. Nearly 56 percent voted to preserve the measure, which also includes requirements for identifying vehicles and data reporting.Both companies described the result as bitterly disappointing on Monday.\u201cUnfortunately, the rules passed by the City Council don\u2019t allow true ride-sharing to operate,\u201d Lyft said in a statement. \u201cInstead, they make it harder for part-time drivers, the heart of Lyft\u2019s peer-to-peer model, to get on the road and harder for passengers to get a ride.\u201dLawmakers and some law enforcement professionals have argued that fingerprint checks, which are required of Austin\u2019s taxi drivers, are the best way to establish a person\u2019s identity and weed out those with criminal records.Uber has said that its own checks, performed by the third-party provider Checkr, include scrutiny of court records and other biographical information and are more effective than the fingerprint checks, which it said rely on incomplete federal databases.Industry experts have noted that the fingerprint rules, which go fully into effect next February, could pose a potentially time-intensive and costly new burden on the companies and their drivers.David Butts, a political consultant in Austin who helped lead a campaign to preserve the new ordinance, accused Uber and Lyft of putting corporate strategy above public safety.\u201cBut we\u2019re a progressive city,\u201d Mr. Butts said. \u201cWe happen to believe that government has a role to play. And the idea that we\u2019re just going to give them a blank check and say, \u2018Self-regulate and we\u2019ll take your word for it\u2019 was not acceptable to the majority of voters in this city.\u201dIn addition to Uber and Lyft, at least three ride-hailing companies are operating in Austin, a center of technology that hosts the South by Southwest festival and is home to the University of Texas\u2019 flagship campus.City officials said other companies were making inquiries on Monday after the announcements by Uber and Lyft.Councilwoman Ann Kitchen, who led the effort to tighten the regulation of ride-hailing companies, said in an interview on Monday that the city was open to continuing talks with Uber and Lyft.\u201cOf course, we have always said to Uber and Lyft that they are welcome here and we didn\u2019t ask them to leave,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we have got to respect the will of the voters.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to the start of new fingerprint background rules in Austin. While ride-hailing companies must perform the checks on all of their drivers by Feb. 1 2017, they must meet benchmarks before then.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Save Puerto Rico", "Date": "2016-05-31", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe success of the bill will depend largely on who is named to the seven-member oversight board. Under the legislation, President Obama would technically appoint all the members, but he would have to pick four people from lists provided by the Republican leaders in the House and the Senate; one pick each goes to Mr. Obama and the two Democratic leaders. If Republicans don\u2019t expand the list beyond their usual ideologues, the board could end up turning to old policies that have proved to be unworkable. Deep spending cuts will not heal Puerto Rico. Lawmakers will have more success if they pick people who have experience solving financial crises and who understand Puerto Rico\u2019s particular problems.The legislation has other problems. One provision would exempt Puerto Rico from the Department of Labor\u2019s recent decision to make more managerial workers eligible for overtime pay. Another would allow the island\u2019s governor to temporarily set a minimum wage for workers younger than 25 that is less than the federal wage floor of $7.25 an hour. The good news is that it is hard to imagine that a governor would take advantage of this measure since it would only encourage more young people to move to the states, where they are assured a higher wage.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Big Picture for Trump vs. Clinton? It\u2019s All in the Framing", "Date": "2016-05-19", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceGetting people to put on one set of glasses rather than another to view their political choices is part of what campaigns do to win elections. The fight to frame the choice is one of the biggest battles.Throughout the primaries, Donald Trump has attempted to make the choice about what we\u2019ve lost: jobs, pride and greatness. Hillary Clinton wants people to think about how far we\u2019ve come. It\u2019s a classic divide: gains versus losses. We happen to know a lot about how it affects the way people make decisions and how small changes in the way choices are presented affect whether people think they are gaining or losing something.Research has illustrated the way people\u2019s decisions over fixed choices change in light of context. In times of gains, people tend to be risk-averse. In times of loss, they tend to be risk-accepting.This particular dichotomy is relevant to 2016 as Mr. Trump attempts to convince voters, through his rhetoric, that we are in an era of loss. Even his campaign slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d invites people to remember a time when we had something that is now gone. If he is successful at framing the choice, people may be more likely to take a risk on an outsider with no previous political experience.In addition to candidates\u2019 explicit attempts to frame the choice, there are other factors that implicitly affect the context of elections \u2014 and of 2016 in particular. One of them is the president. Barack Obama is framing the 2016 election without even trying. But it\u2019s not his policy legacy or economic record that is influencing people\u2019s attitudes; it\u2019s him, personally, and it\u2019s happening on both the right and the left.In the first group, people can choose a treatment that will save 200 lives with certainty or gamble on a treatment that has a one-third chance of saving 600 people and a two-thirds chance of saving no one. People in this group overwhelming (72 percent) choose the sure thing \u2014 the treatment that will save 200 lives with certainty.In the second group, the choice is reframed in terms of deaths, and the opposite result obtains. People in this group choose between a treatment that will result in the deaths of 400 people with certainty or a treatment that has a one-third chance of resulting in no deaths and a two-thirds chance of resulting in 600 deaths. In this group, people overwhelmingly (78 percent) choose the gamble and risk losing everyone to the disease for the small chance of losing no one.The experiment illustrates the way people\u2019s decisions over fixed choices change in light of context. In times of gains, people tend to avoid risk. In times of loss, they\u2019re more willing to go for the gamble.So what is it you see in 2016, gains or losses?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Opera Fans, a Grand Day Out", "Date": "2016-05-24", "News": "Supported byFront Row CenterLONDON \u2014 They may be the last truly formal affairs in a world gone mad with casual. Opera fans in tuxedos and evening-gowns, posh picnic baskets and Champagne glasses in hand, spread out across the flowing lawns of great country houses during England\u2019s brief, emerald summers, watching a professional performance amid the grazing sheep and rolling hills.And in a twist on the star-crossed-lover plot of many of the works performed at the festivals, staging opera and running a country house are in many ways a match made in heaven. The opera company needs a venue; the owners of the home need to offset expenses and, potentially, taxes. Along the way, the local economy is stimulated through dining, hotels and employment.The business model originated in 1934 at Glyndebourne, an estate about an hour\u2019s drive south of London.John Christie, who inherited the estate in the 1920s, was inspired by the Bayreuth Festival, the annual summer gathering of formally decked-out fans of Richard Wagner in his German hometown, after visiting there as a young man.\u201cMotorcars and Wagner were his obsessions,\u201d said Gus Christie, grandson of John Christie and executive chairman of Glyndebourne.At first, the productions were a hobby \u2014 \u201cscenes in the music room,\u201d Gus Christie said \u2014 but about 10 years later, at the age of 50, the elder Mr. Christie fell in love with a soprano, wooed her and married her. \u201cHe wanted to extend the room, but she persuaded him to build a 300-seat opera house,\u201d Gus Christie said.From that original structure, Glyndebourne has grown to more than 1,200 seats. In the 1950s, John Christie received approval to set up a charitable trust to run the festival and the estate \u201cby persuading the government that we were doing something for the public good,\u201d Gus Christie said.The charitable model persists, he added, because everybody benefits: \u201cDonors get tax breaks, and in our case, the charitable trust runs until 2075. If one of my children doesn\u2019t want to take over the company, it protects the house and the estate. It\u2019s set up in such a way to protect both sides.\u201dThe company found another grand estate with owners who were looking for a way to restore and revitalize their property. Grange Park Opera will open there in 2017, in a new opera house surrounded by acres of gardens and space in the main house for 150 people to dine.Bamber Gascoigne, 81, inherited the mansion from an aunt, the duchess of Roxburghe. The 400-acre estate, with 50 rooms and much of its original building dating to the Tudor era, came with huge costs: 7 million pounds, or about $10.2 million, to restore it to its former glory, and another \u00a32 million for the stables, barns and gardens.Mr. Gascoigne enlisted Sotheby\u2019s to help auction much of his great aunt\u2019s collection of jewelry, artifacts and furniture, which raised about \u00a32 million to help offset many costs, but the estate needed something else.Enter the charitable model, under which Mr. Gascoigne placed his inheritance into a trust that gives Grange Park Opera a 99-year lease.\u201cIt\u2019s the equivalent of an anchor tenant,\u201d said Wasfi Kani, who co-founded Grange Park Opera in 1998.It\u2019s a symbiotic relationship that Mr. Gascoigne welcomes.\u201cGrange Park Opera moving here is going to make it a different and effective place,\u201d said Mr. Gascoigne, the former host of the long-running quiz show \u201cUniversity Challenge\u201d on British television. \u201cMy wife and I decided to create a charity to preserve the house \u2014 to make it a place of activity again.\u201dIf financial benefit is at the base of the country-house opera phenomenon, style and setting are at the heart. The tradition in Britain has grown more in the last 30 years than in decades past, Mr. Christie said, in part because of the appetite of a certain kind of culture lover to travel back in time and celebrate opera the way it was centuries ago \u2014 an event for the day, decked out in one\u2019s best attire.\u201cIt\u2019s a very different experience than going to an event in a major city,\u201d Mr. Christie said. \u201cIt allows you to ruminate over what you\u2019ve seen. It\u2019s about taking the afternoon off.\u201dThe formal dress code was part of the original package and has remained popular, especially as costume dramas find huge audiences in film and on television.\u201cMy grandfather recommended that people make an effort to dress formally out of respect for the musicians,\u201d Mr. Christie said. \u201cWe say black tie is customary but not compulsory.\u201d\u201cThese festivals are in places of outstanding beauty,\u201d said Douglas Boyd, Garsington\u2019s artistic director. \u201cWe like dressing up and living a slight fantasy in these places.\u201dThe opera company, founded in 1989 at Garsington Manor near Oxford, moved to its current location about five years ago and built a dramatic glass pavilion to house productions. \u201cThere is incredible magic in the lighting at dusk after the dinner interval,\u201d Mr. Boyd said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a challenge for lighting directors and conductors.\u201dFor Garsington, the relationship with the Getty family is key, Mr. Boyd said: \u201cWe have artistic control but they get a significant rent and get their estate used. And it works with the family\u2019s passion for opera.\u201d Gordon Getty, the fourth child of the oil tycoon J. Paul Getty, is a composer and supports several opera companies.The Iford Arts Festival, which began in the 1990s with concerts on the vast grounds of Iford Manor in western England, stages three operas each summer in the cloister of the garden, designed by the celebrated landscape architect Harold Peto.\u201cWhen we started at Iford, the garden was in the process of restoration,\u201d said Judy Eglington, artistic director of the festival. For her, the festival combines two distinct interests: \u201cthe potential of the place as a wonderful platform for performing\u201d and the desire of Iford\u2019s owners \u201cto put the place on the map for people to visit the gardens.\u201dAnd in the end, it is the passion of the owners of these great estates that keeps the tradition alive.\u201cA new project in one\u2019s 80s is quite surprising and challenging. It is invigorating,\u201d Mr. Gascoigne said. \u201cIt\u2019s not every day that you get an invitation to have an opera house built in your garden.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "President Obama\u2019s Overtime Pay Plan Threatens the \u2018Prada\u2019 Economy", "Date": "2016-05-30", "News": "Supported byFor decades, bosses at publishing houses, glossy magazines, consulting firms, advocacy groups, movie production companies and talent agencies have groomed their assistants to be the next generation of big shots by working them long hours for low wages.Call it the \u201cDevil Wears Prada\u201d economy, after the novel depicting life working for a fictionalized Anna Wintour, the longtime Vogue editor.In the eyes of those who have survived the gantlet of midday coffee runs and late-night emails, the administration\u2019s overtime regulation represents nothing less than the beginnings of a cultural shift, and not necessarily a welcome one.\u201cYou want to bump into the boss at 8 o\u2019clock at night,\u201d said Dan Reynolds, chief executive of Workman Publishing, the publisher of \u201cWhat to Expect When You\u2019re Expecting\u201d and many of Sandra Boynton\u2019s children\u2019s books.\u201cI\u2019m interested in how this will affect that,\u201d Mr. Reynolds said. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a cultural thing than anything else.\u201dSupporters of the new rule see many benefits, saying it will rein in an overly workaholic atmosphere and perhaps diversify a rarefied world that tends to be white and upscale, thanks to its reliance on social connections and the difficulty of working for scraps without affluent parents.Still, the coming change, which will take effect on Dec. 1, promises to be disorienting for many in these prestige professions.In a letter to the Labor Department after it proposed the overtime rule last summer, Workman\u2019s general manager, Jill Salayi, suggested that because the company could not afford to pay overtime to all newly eligible staff members or raise their salaries over the new threshold, it would have to cut back their hours in many cases.\u201cLess will be asked of them,\u201d she argued, \u201cwhich means they will not receive sufficient career development or see timely advancement and/or promotions.\u201d(Mr. Reynolds stressed that Workman was confident it would be able to adjust financially.)Some high-profile nonprofits have raised similar concerns. Ideologically, the United States Public Interest Research Group, founded to fight companies that harm consumers and the environment, and Judicial Watch, which conservative activists created in the 1990s, largely to uncover Clinton administration corruption, have little in common. But both groups, in letters to the Labor Department, argued that the new overtime rule would hamper the mission of training young idealists.\u201cWe would send them to the Clinton library if we\u2019re doing an investigation,\u201d Susan Prytherch, who oversees human resources for Judicial Watch, said of junior staff members. \u201cWe may think differently before sending them off.\u201dAccording to Lowell Peterson, executive director of the Writers Guild of America, East, which represents writers in movies, television and digital media, the model is very much alive and well in Hollywood as well.\u201cBeing a writer\u2019s assistant is often the way people get into the business of writing for a living\u201d for television, he said.The same goes for politics, according to Raelynn Olson, the managing partner of GMMB, which led the team that produced ads for both of Barack Obama\u2019s presidential campaigns. \u201cMany of the firm\u2019s senior leaders began their careers in entry-level positions here, including a number of our partners,\u201d Ms. Olson said.But the problem with trying to perform one job while simultaneously demonstrating aptitude for a bigger one is that it can require extremely long hours.At the Washington offices of Burson-Marsteller, which handles public relations and polling for a variety of corporate and political clients, so-called associates typically make $40,000 to $50,000 a year, and often work well beyond 40 hours a week. Some are tasked with pitching in on 24-hour-a-day monitoring of media coverage for clients in addition to their usual work, which can keep them up late into the night.Under the previous federal overtime rule, which applied automatically to most salaried employees making less than $23,660, those additional hours were essentially uncounted, making the young associates a relative bargain. (Employees making more than this can be eligible for overtime under a much more subjective \u201cduties\u201d test, but often don\u2019t receive it.) Under the new rule, many of these staff members are to be paid time-and-a-half overtime when they work more than 40 hours a week, if their salary remains unchanged.Catherine Sullivan, a company spokeswoman, said: \u201cBurson-Marsteller has always paid, and will continue to pay, overtime to those who are eligible.\u201d She noted that employees below the associate level currently do receive overtime pay and also participate in round-the-clock monitoring.Some organizations in which young staff members are already relatively well compensated said they would probably raise salaries over the new threshold.But the economics of that approach may be less practical at smaller companies where labor represents a larger share of overall costs. A former employee of the Wylie Agency said assistant literary agents there \u2014 usually eight to 10 in the New York office \u2014 typically earned in the $30,000s and routinely worked 50 to 60 hours a week without overtime pay.The former Wylie employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of fear of reprisals, said that there was such an expectation of long hours that anyone arriving after 9 a.m. or leaving before 6:30 p.m. generally felt compelled to email the entire office, giving a reason for being AWOL.Andrew Wylie, who runs the agency, said he would consider paying time and a half if he asked junior staff members to work overtime, but not if they worked long hours of their own volition. \u201cWhat am I supposed to do, sit at the door with a stopwatch?\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to do that.\u201dDavid Manson, a longtime television producer who has worked on such shows as \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and \u201cBloodline,\u201d said that some entry-level jobs were so widely sought after that the new overtime rule was unlikely to affect either pay or hours, at least at smaller companies.\u201cThere may be a certain amount of a wink-and-nod approach to it,\u201d he said. \u201cMost people want desperately to get in any way they can.\u201d (Mr. Manson said he believed larger companies would heed the regulation.)Among the wink-and-nod approaches already in vogue, said Eric Glatt, a former intern in the accounting department of the Fox Searchlight movie \u201cBlack Swan,\u201d was to reverse-engineer the base pay for production assistants so that the daily rate of $125 would reflect compensation for 12 hours of work: eight hours at $8.928571 per hour, and another four at $13.392857.But not everybody in these industries is opposed to the rule or looking for a way to get around it.\u201cI\u2019ll be happy for everyone in town having a slightly better quality of life,\u201d said Tony Fratto, a former George W. Bush administration official whose public affairs firm typically hires about 15 or 20 associates each year out of more than 1,000 applicants. His firm already tries to limit overtime for reasons of work-life balance.Mr. Fratto said he had been in many offices around Washington where partners require assistants to stick around as late in the evening as they do, then dump a pile of research on them on their way out the door. \u201cThat is abusive,\u201d he said.Perhaps the most important change may be to shift the norms within companies that officially offer overtime pay, but where the burden is almost entirely on the young assistants to claim it, which few feel comfortable doing.It never occurred to her to put in for overtime pay, which Cond\u00e9 Nast, the magazine\u2019s publisher, provides. \u201cI certainly would not have had that conversation with Anna; I would have had to have it with H.R.,\u201d said Ms. Weisberger, whose latest book will be out in July. \u201cI don\u2019t imagine that conversation took place a whole lot.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Years of Distrust, U.S. Military Reconciles With Nigeria to Fight Boko Haram", "Date": "2016-05-15", "News": "Supported byARUSHA, Tanzania \u2014 Less than two years after it blocked a sale of American-made attack helicopters to Nigeria from Israel because of human rights concerns, the Obama administration says it is poised to sell up to 12 light attack aircraft to Nigeria as part of an effort to support the country\u2019s fight against the Boko Haram militant group.But the pending sale of the Super Tucano attack warplanes \u2014 which would require congressional approval \u2014 is already coming under criticism from human rights organizations that say President Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria has not yet done enough to stop the abuses and corruption that flourished in the military under his predecessor, Goodluck Jonathan.Officials at the White House, the State Department and the Pentagon have been bracing for a fight with congressional Democrats, in particular Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, over the sale of the planes.The proposed sale reflects the warming of the relationship between the Nigerian and American militaries, which had frayed under Mr. Jonathan. The Pentagon often bypassed Nigeria in the fight against Boko Haram, choosing to work directly with neighboring Cameroon, Chad and Niger.In addition to citing corruption and sweeping human rights abuses by Nigerian soldiers, American officials were hesitant to share intelligence with the Nigerian military, saying Boko Haram had infiltrated it. That accusation prompted indignation from Nigeria.But that was before Mr. Buhari, a former Nigerian Army major general, defeated Mr. Jonathan in an election last year.He has fired a number of Nigerian military officers accused of corruption, and American military officials say they are now working closely with some of their counterparts in Nigeria. The Obama administration is also considering sending dozens of Special Operations advisers to the front lines of Nigeria\u2019s fight against Boko Haram, an insurgency that has killed thousands of civilians in the country\u2019s northeast as well as in Cameroon, Chad and Niger.Mr. Buhari has also pledged to investigate allegations of human rights abuses and has said he will not tolerate them.The administration has not made a formal decision to send a notification to Congress, but a senior administration official said he expected one soon. President Obama is considering a trip to Nigeria in July.But already aides to Mr. Leahy, a sponsor of a human rights law that prohibits the State Department and Pentagon from providing military assistance to foreign militaries with poor human rights records, have expressed concern.\u201cWe don\u2019t have confidence in the Nigerians\u2019 ability to use them in a manner that complies with the laws of war and doesn\u2019t end up disproportionately harming civilians, nor in the capability of the U.S. government to monitor their use,\u201d said Tim Rieser, a top Leahy aide.\u201cThe United States is committed to working with Nigeria and its neighbors against Boko Haram,\u201d said David McKeeby, a spokesman for the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs. \u201cThe Nigerian security forces and regional forces from Cameroon, Chad and Niger have made important progress in pushing Boko Haram out of many towns and villages of northeast Nigeria and the broader Lake Chad basin region.\u201dGen. Mark A. Milley, the Army chief of staff, is attending a meeting of top African military officials, including from Nigeria, here in Arusha this week. Aboard his flight on Saturday, General Milley declined to comment on whether Nigeria\u2019s human rights record had improved enough to warrant the sale, but said one of the reasons he was attending the meeting was to learn more about the African militaries with which the Pentagon is working.Consideration of selling the attack aircraft to Nigeria is a sharp turnabout from two years ago, when the United States blocked the sale of American-made Cobra attack helicopters to Nigeria from Israel, amid concerns about Nigeria\u2019s protection of civilians when conducting military operations. That infuriated the Nigerian government, and Nigeria\u2019s ambassador to the United States responded sharply, accusing Washington of hampering the effort against Boko Haram.\u201cLet\u2019s say we give certain kinds of equipment to the Nigerian military that is then used in a way that affects the human situation,\u201d James F. Entwistle, the American ambassador to Nigeria, told reporters in October in explaining the decision to block the helicopter sale. \u201cIf I approve that, I\u2019m responsible for that. We take that responsibility very seriously.\u201dUnder Mr. Jonathan, the former president, the Nigerian military was accused by human rights groups of detaining and killing thousands of innocent civilians in sweeps of the militant group, a practice that Amnesty International said was continuing. This year the military rounded up several hundred men and boys in arrests that Amnesty, in a report it released last week, called \u201carbitrary, the hazardous profiling based on sex and age of the individual rather than on evidence of crime.\u201dThe report said 149 people had died this year in detention in the Nigerian military\u2019s Giwa barracks in Maiduguri, a city that has been a staging ground for the fight against Boko Haram. Among the victims were 11 children under age 6, including four infants, Amnesty said. The prisoners most likely died of disease, starvation, dehydration or gunshot wounds, the report said.In a news release, the Nigerian military called the report \u201ccompletely baseless, unfounded and source-less with the intent of denting the image of the Nigerian Armed Forces.\u201dSarah Margon, the Washington director at Human Rights Watch, disagreed.\u201cIndications that the U.S. is going to sell attack aircrafts to Nigeria is concerning given the absence of meaningful reform within Nigeria\u2019s security sector,\u201d Ms. Margon said. \u201cThe U.S. must make clear that if the sale is to occur, critical steps, not just rhetorical commitments, on core human rights concerns must be an integral component for approving the sale.\u201dHelene Cooper reported from Arusha, and Dionne Searcy from Dakar, Senegal.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Obama, in Japan, Emphasizes Lingering Threat of Nuclear War", "Date": "2016-05-26", "News": "Supported bySHIMA, Japan \u2014 President Obama said on Thursday that he was preparing to visit Hiroshima on Friday to emphasize that decades after the end of the Cold War, the world still faces the threat of nuclear war.\u201cI do think that part of the reason I\u2019m going is because I want to once again underscore the very real risks that are out there and the sense of urgency that we all should have,\u201d Mr. Obama said during a brief news conference at the Group of 7 meeting in this southern Japanese resort city.Mr. Obama said that the city of Hiroshima was not just a reminder of the terrible toll of World War II, a conflict that ended 70 years ago. It is also a reminder \u201cthat the job\u2019s not done in reducing conflict, building institutions of peace and reducing the prospect of nuclear war in the future.\u201dMr. Obama cited some of the successes of his efforts to slow and even reverse the proliferation of nuclear weapons, including the nuclear deal with Iran, a weapons treaty with Russia and the Nuclear Security Summit meetings, which have eliminated nuclear material from some countries.But he pointed to North Korea\u2019s burgeoning nuclear program and the stationing of tactical nuclear weapons by Pakistan along its border with India as worrisome problems.\u201cNorth Korea is a big worry for all of us,\u201d he said.The president said his administration\u2019s focus on degrading and eventually destroying the Islamic State was justified because it was an \u201cimmediate risk.\u201d But he said that North Korea posed a different kind of risk.\u201cWhen you have such an unstable regime that is so isolated, that generally flouts international norms and rules more than perhaps any nation on earth, that is also devoting enormous national resources hellbent on getting nuclear weapons that they can fire long distances, that poses a kind of medium-term threat that we have to pay a lot of attention to,\u201d he said.Japan and South Korea, both close American allies, are deeply concerned about North Korea\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Mr. Obama said that other countries in the region, including China, have begun taking the risks emanating from North Korea more seriously.But he acknowledged that no efforts undertaken by those countries had solved the conundrum that is Kim Jong-un, North Korea\u2019s unpredictable leader.\u201cIn the meantime, we\u2019ve been working with the Pentagon for several years now on making sure we can develop the kind of defense architecture that can protect the United States and our allies from an unexpected escalation,\u201d he said.Mr. Obama arrived in Shima late Wednesday night and immediately held a meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. During their talk, Mr. Abe scolded the president for doing little to prevent the brutal murder of a woman in Okinawa, a crime that the Japanese police have linked to an American worker at a United States military base.\u201cThis case has shocked not only Okinawa, but also deeply shocked all of Japan,\u201d Mr. Abe said at a news conference after the meeting, adding, \u201cI also urged the United States to make sure to take effective and thorough means to prevent a recurrence, and vigorously and strictly address the situation.\u201dMr. Obama responded by extending \u201cmy sincerest condolences and deepest regrets.\u201dOn Thursday, the leaders of the Group of 7 nations, gathered at a resort here, spent the morning being shuttled to the Ise Shrine, considered the holiest place in Japan. Led by Shinto priests in white robes, they toured the immaculate grounds and at one point picked up shovels and tossed bits of dirt into piles in a ceremonial tree planting.They then spent the day in and out of a series of meetings that Mr. Obama called \u201cextremely productive.\u201dThey discussed the global economy and efforts to accelerate growth, he said. They also talked about the various trade deals being negotiated among them, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership involving Japan and the United States, and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership between the United States and Europe.Both pacts are politically troubled, and the Trans-Pacific deal has almost no chance of passing Congress before the elections in November.Mr. Obama said the leaders discussed rising protectionism and how to counter it. They also talked about the American presidential election, he said.Indeed, in one meeting where reporters were allowed to be present, Mr. Obama could be heard discussing the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump, with Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy. And at the news conference later, the president said he had discussed Mr. Trump with the leaders of all six of the other industrialized nations. Besides Italy and Japan, those countries are Britain, Canada, France and Germany.\u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say they are surprised by the Republican nominee,\u201d Mr. Obama said, referring to Mr. Trump.\u201cThey are not sure how seriously to take some of his pronouncements, but they are rattled by him and for good reason,\u201d he said, citing Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cignorance of world affairs, or a cavalier attitude, or an interest in getting tweets and headlines instead of actually thinking through what is required to keep America safe, secure and prosperous, and what\u2019s required to keep the world on an even keel.\u201dMr. Obama said he continued to have no interest in intervening to influence the Democratic primary despite concerns among many in the party that the race is showing signs of bitterness that could be difficult to overcome before the general election.\u201cDuring primaries, people get a little grumpy with each other,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the nature of the process.\u201dBut he said that Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Hillary Clinton had largely agreed on the important issues.Advertisement"}

The rates are published daily for various interest rate derivatives contracts, which banks trade with other financial institutions and sell to clients looking to either hedge against a swing in interest rates or to speculate on the markets. In a separate benchmark fixing case, Citigroup agreed to resolve claims that it had tried to manipulate the Yen London Interbank Offered Rate and the Euroyen Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate. Citigroup\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role in trying to manipulate overseas benchmark rates tied to the pricing of interest rates and the use of derivatives products tied to those benchmarks has been no secret.In 2011, the Tokyo Financial Services Agency sanctioned Citigroup for its actions and temporarily suspended a derivatives product. In February, Citigroup agreed to pay $23 million to settle a lawsuit brought by several hedge funds and a public pension plan over claims that the bank had conspired to manipulate the yen Libor rate.Bitcoin experts and law enforcement officials have spent more than two years trying to establish how hundreds of thousands of Bitcoins disappeared from the Mt. Gox exchange and there have been few solid answers. The trustee said on Wednesday at a meeting with creditors that $414 million of the claims appeared to be legitimate and have been approved. They will get some portion of the $91 million. It is not yet clear how much because of outstanding lawsuits and investigations. Bitcoin investors have complained about how long it has taken to work through the claims. The legal and accounting costs have added up to about $55 million so far. Mr. Karpeles was arrested by the Japanese authorities last August on suspicion of illegally adding money to an account under his control, though not on charges directly related to the missing Bitcoins. Japanese government officials have still given few indications of what they think happened to the missing money. end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greenpeace Leaks U.S.-E.U. Trade Deal Documents", "Date": "2016-05-02", "News": "Supported byBut American and European trade officials, while not denying the validity of the materials, insisted on Monday that the documents \u2014 248 pages, which Greenpeace said amounted to two-thirds of the latest negotiating text \u2014 merely represented negotiating positions, and that the criticisms were off base.Still, the disclosures and criticisms are unlikely to speed the talks, which already seem to have little chance of making progress until after the United States elects its next president in November \u2014 if even then, given how rancorous foreign trade has become in the American political debate.The deal, known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, would cover a huge range of goods and services between the world\u2019s largest national economy and the world\u2019s largest single market, spanning telecommunications, agricultural products, textiles, intellectual property, financial services and regulatory compatibility.In one of the negotiating documents \u2014 a chapter on \u201cSanitary and Phytosanitary Measures\u201d \u2014 American negotiators made repeated references to improving cooperation over \u201cproducts of modern agricultural technology.\u201dThe United States proposal \u201cclearly indicates their pressure to get rid of trade barriers for genetically modified organisms,\u201d Jorgo Riss, the director of Greenpeace\u2019s European unit, said in a telephone interview. The proposal also refers to a \u201cGlobal Low Level Presence Initiative,\u201d which Mr. Riss said was an American-backed initiative to gain global acceptance of agricultural exports containing traces of unauthorized genetically modified organisms.In general, opposition to genetically modified organisms, or G.M.O.s, tends to be stronger in Europe than in the United States. Mr. Riss acknowledged there was no direct reference to G.M.O.s in the documents but said the language clearly was aimed at promoting their acceptance.Negotiations over the accord began in July 2013; the latest round, the 13th, concluded Friday in New York.After decades of free-trade orthodoxy, there has been growing resistance to further liberalizing the movement of goods, services, capital and labor, fueled by fears that the benefits have flowed disproportionately to corporations, investors and well-educated workers \u2014 and that the harm to less-educated workers has outweighed the benefits to consumers. In the United States, the two leading contenders for president, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton, have expressed skepticism about trade deals.Perhaps the most sensitive issues are outlined in a document describing the \u201ctactical state of play\u201d on both sides. The document says, for example, that different approaches to animal testing \u201cremain irreconcilable.\u201d Many American-made cosmetics use ultraviolet filters, for which animal testing is used to assess safety; the European Union bans such testing on animals.The Americans expressed \u201cparticular sensitivity\u201d over tariffs on dairy, sugar and tobacco, while the Europeans wanted restrictions on wine labeling included in the accord.Greenpeace accused the American negotiators of trying to weaken environmental protection standards; of taking a laxer approach to product regulation than the Europeans; and of trying to give corporate lobbyists greater say in decision-making.The group said the documents showed the Americans were proposing to allow corporations to \u201cpetition\u201d for the repeal of a regulation if it was \u201cmore burdensome than necessary to achieve its objective,\u201d given its impact on trade. The documents also showed, it said, that the Europeans had proposed allowing certain environmental standards to be deemed \u201ctechnical barriers to trade,\u201d which could weaken labels requiring the disclosure of the climate footprint of a product or service.The Sierra Club also warned that the text included trade rules that could be used against \u201cbuy local\u201d programs that support local clean-energy jobs in nearly two dozen American states.Although the disclosures may have been embarrassing, officials on both sides tried to contain the fallout.In a statement, he said the accord would \u201cpreserve, not undermine, our strong consumer, health, environmental standards, and position the U.S. and the E.U. to work together to push standards higher around the world.\u201dMs. Malmstrom said that the documents \u201creflect each side\u2019s negotiating position, nothing else.\u201d Referring to genetically modified organisms, which are of particular concern to many European consumers, she added: \u201cNo E.U. trade agreement will ever lower our level of protection of consumers, or food safety, or of the environment. Trade agreements will not change our laws on G.M.O.s, or how to produce safe beef, or how to protect the environment.\u201dJames Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels.Advertisement"}

First guest. Band. Da, da, da. I just can\u2019t do it that way.\u201dShe was here to impart some wisdom to her niece Charley, a guileless, cheerful 11-year-old who hopes to be famous like her aunt. While a camera crew from Ms. Handler\u2019s show followed Charley taking orders and receiving an education in the school of hard knocks, the host herself was giving another kind of lesson. The subject was the seeming staleness of the topical comedy format, and how she hopes to avoid this when her show, \u201cChelsea,\u201d makes its debut on Wednesday, May 11.\u201cAll these shows try to start out selling something different, and ultimately all become the same, just with a different guy,\u201d Ms. Handler, 41, said in a husky voice that never fully shed its New Jersey roots. \u201cI have to do everything I can to prevent that from happening.\u201dThat she is one of just a few women to have hosted a late-night show, Ms. Handler said, was unimportant. \u201cI don\u2019t think of myself as a woman \u2014 I think of myself as a person,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you think that\u2019s what I think about all day? No, I\u2019m just trying to be entertaining.\u201dStill, it is an unusual proposition that Ms. Handler would create \u201cChelsea\u201d for Netflix, the streaming-video service that has no programming grid or daily schedule to speak of.Netflix has touted its ability to get viewers to binge on its content in lengthy doses, but has no track record with topical shows. It is hoping for Ms. Handler to deliver a program that has the freewheeling spirit of a late-night talk show, if not the customary formats or time slot. (New episodes will be posted at 12:01 a.m. Pacific time on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays.)It has made the deal more intriguing by taking this foray with Ms. Handler at a time when she wants to be known for her wider interests in how the world works, and not merely as a comedian who jokes about drinking and not wanting children.She is also a provocative entertainer \u2014 today she wore a necklace bearing a familiar two-word obscene phrase \u2014 who doesn\u2019t disguise her restlessness, and may even consider it her best quality.\u201cI\u2019m totally impulsive,\u201d she said proudly. \u201cI was impulsive when I signed up with E! and that lasted eight years. I was impulsive when I wrote my first book and then I wrote five. I would never want to be another way.\u201dIt\u2019s been nearly two years since Ms. Handler brought the curtain down on \u201cChelsea Lately,\u201d her home for raucous commentary on popular culture, round tables of stand-up comedians and celebrity guests.Though the series ran more than 1,000 episodes, Ms. Handler said by its end she was bristling behind the scenes, tired of being constrained by what she felt was E!\u2019s narrow focus on gossip and reality stars.\u201cWe\u2019re on before the Kardashians or after the Kardashians,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re surrounded by people who are nonsense. No one\u2019s coming to this network looking for news or political stories or human interest or global issues. None of the things I\u2019m interested in are being talked about.\u201dWhen she could feel herself losing interest, it was time to pack it in. \u201cIt\u2019s one-dimensional,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I was one-dimensional.\u201d (E! declined to comment for this article.)Ms. Handler said she intended to take the next year off from the industry, and fended off inquiries from other networks (she would not specify which), believing they would never allow her the independence she desired.But after a few conversations with Netflix, Ms. Handler said its lack of experience in the talk-show arena \u2014 and the freedom to experiment that came with it \u2014 were assets. \u201cI\u2019m my own island,\u201d she said. \u201cI have nothing to compete with. It\u2019s exactly where I want to be.\u201dTed Sarandos, Netflix\u2019s chief content officer, said Ms. Handler\u2019s willingness to inject herself into unfamiliar situations and bring a wry humor to these explorations suggested she could carry a show more expansive than \u201cChelsea Lately.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more boring than an interview where the interviewer is the functional expert,\u201d Mr. Sarandos said. \u201cWhat you want is somebody who\u2019s super-curious and, in Chelsea\u2019s case, remarkably funny. At the end of the day, the show is anchored on Chelsea and her comedy.\u201dAs for Ms. Handler\u2019s spur-of-the-moment nature, Mr. Sarandos said: \u201cIt\u2019s the most exciting part. You don\u2019t want to try too hard to contain that spontaneity, because great things come out of it.\u201dIn Ms. Handler\u2019s personal office, on the fourth floor of the David Lean Building at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City, Calif., hangs a motivational poster of sorts. It reads, \u201cYou are remembered for the rules you break.\u201d(When a departing Rosti customer told Ms. Handler, \u201cI like martinis, too,\u201d Ms. Handler grumbled audibly: \u201cPeople like to tell me they like alcohol. Oh, O.K. Glad to know it.\u201d)She has been open about past relationships that have captured the public\u2019s fascination, whether longer term, with Ted Harbert, the former E! networks president and now NBC Broadcasting chairman, or shorter lived, with the rapper 50 Cent.Even as an increasingly prominent face for an increasingly prominent content service, Ms. Handler has no qualms about posting partly nude photos of herself to her social media feeds, and makes no apologies for doing so.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to see my boobs, you can unfollow me on Instagram,\u201d she said.With a similar candor, Ms. Handler stripped bare the homogeneity of late-night TV, where she said a new generation of hosts had brought little innovation to the genre. \u201cThere are 10 or 11 guys doing what used to be done by two guys,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not interesting.\u201dIn particular, Ms. Handler criticized Stephen Colbert, the former star of Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cThe Colbert Report,\u201d who took over from David Letterman at CBS\u2019s \u201cLate Show\u201d in September.\u201cLook what\u2019s going on with Stephen Colbert and that show,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is that? He\u2019s being himself and he\u2019s not. He didn\u2019t go in and make a different show. He\u2019s just following in the footsteps of someone else.\u201d (A press representative for Mr. Colbert declined to comment.)Now the burden is on Ms. Handler, who is being paid a reported $10 million salary (a figure her representatives declined to confirm), to show that she can do something different. At her disposal she\u2019ll have a series unencumbered by commercial breaks or running times, though each episode will be around 30 minutes long.For the past few months, Ms. Handler and her producers have been busily producing field segments far and wide, trying to find topics that are timely but approaches that are evergreen, for segments that will appeal to viewers in the United States as well as the nearly 200 other countries where Netflix is available.Bill Wolff, the executive producer of \u201cChelsea,\u201d said his role at this stage was to help Ms. Handler \u201cidentify compelling material and stories which make sense with her comedic mechanism.\u201dAs Mr. Wolff, a former executive producer of \u201cThe View\u201d and \u201cThe Rachel Maddow Show\u201d explained, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to be known about Chinese farm subsidies and how they affect the American worker \u2014 what can Chelsea do to talk about that? Is that something she\u2019s really interested in?\u201d\u201cChelsea, sitting in a room, just talking to one person, is not really what we do,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s Chelsea engaged. Chelsea out in the world. Chelsea doing stuff.\u201dPinned to an office wall behind Mr. Wolff were some 50 index cards representing pieces Ms. Handler had already filmed on subjects like the so-called \u201cgig economy\u201d (working as a Lyft driver or taking furniture-assembly assignments from TaskRabbit); and on trips to Moscow and Mexico City. Another recent trip to Florida had yielded segments tied to the 2016 presidential election, like one where Ms. Handler travels on a \u201csouls to the polls\u201d trip with a black church group to illuminate the practice of early voting.At a nearby soundstage on the Sony lot, work was underway on a modular set where Ms. Handler will record segments in front of a live audience, \u00e0 la \u201cChelsea Lately,\u201d including one-on-one interviews and panel discussions.But Ms. Handler said she wants to avoid inviting celebrities just to promote their projects, and would rather emulate hosts like Dick Cavett, \u201cwhen he would put on Janis Joplin with Henry Kissinger,\u201d she said. (Even so, Ms. Handler has also taped a dinner party with actors from the comic-book movie \u201cCaptain America: Civil War.\u201d)Netflix says it has the capability to post episodes of \u201cChelsea\u201d within hours after they are completed. Still, Mr. Sarandos said, \u201cMost people are going to watch it a day or two later, a week or two later, or even a month or two later. And the show is built for that. Meaning that it\u2019s topical, but it\u2019s not a melting ice cube.\u201dGetting Netflix viewers regularly watching a topical show is \u201ca definite break in our normal model,\u201d Mr. Sarandos acknowledged. But, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not really trying to change their habit of coming to Netflix, as much as it is what you do while you\u2019re here.\u201dAsked whether \u201cChelsea\u201d would make content available to share outside the Netflix site, Mr. Sarandos said, \u201cWe\u2019re likely to experiment with ways that we can introduce a broader audience to the show. But it\u2019s not the driver. We\u2019re not trying to create viral moments but we\u2019ll find some.\u201dSome of Ms. Handler\u2019s industry colleagues are confident she will make a smooth transition to her Netflix series and that it will help energize the category.Rob Burnett, a longtime executive producer of Mr. Letterman\u2019s \u201cLate Show,\u201d said that this was no longer a TV era in which \u201cyou got somebody to be a very genial master of ceremonies and it goes on for 30 years.\u201dThe way to make a talk show now, Mr. Burnett said, is to feature someone who can \u201cmake a big splash, and almost by definition, maybe in five years, people are tired of it \u2014 there\u2019s no shame in that.\u201dJo Miller, an executive producer of TBS\u2019s \u201cFull Frontal With Samantha Bee,\u201d said that there was ample room for multiple hosts to cover similar subjects.\u201cLarry Wilmore, Chelsea and we could all do the same topic,\u201d Ms. Miller said. \u201cWe\u2019d have three different points of view and all three would be interesting and funny to watch. There are going to be topics that are perfect Chelsea topics, that she can do better than anybody.\u201dMs. Miller deflected any questions about gender in topical comedy before they could be asked. \u201cIf it\u2019s about our vaginas, I\u2019m going to seriously hang up,\u201d she said, laughing nonetheless. \u201cChelsea\u2019s got a brain. That\u2019s what it\u2019s about.\u201dOn the morning after her taping with Charley, Ms. Handler was in the kitchen of her Bel Air mansion, having her hair and makeup done while she reviewed the script she would be filming that afternoon. Near the home\u2019s front door was a giant book of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll photography, open to a 1970s-era portrait of Bob Dylan; in a den was a vase whose shape was formed from numerous conjoined female breasts.Ms. Handler said at first that she had \u201cno idea\u201d how long her contract with Netflix ran, though when pressed further she said it was \u201ca minimum of three years,\u201d adding that she took the job seriously.\u201cThis is a TV show,\u201d she explained. \u201cI would take a marriage more lightly.\u201dWhatever the duration, Ms. Handler cautioned that \u201cChelsea\u201d \u201cwon\u2019t be the show that I want, probably, the first or second day. It\u2019ll take three months for it to be where I\u2019m like, \u2018This is great. This is what I want to do.\u2019\u201d\u201cBy the way,\u201d she added, \u201cit becomes clearer and clearer as the show gets closer and closer.\u201dWhile her dogs Chunk and Tammy strolled in and out of the kitchen, Ms. Handler pointed to them and said, \u201cThat\u2019s what you do when you don\u2019t have children.\u201dCompared to humans, she said, \u201cDogs can\u2019t talk, and that\u2019s a whole big bonus.\u201dReminded that babies do not talk either, Ms. Handler replied, \u201cYeah, but then they don\u2019t shut up for the rest of their lives.\u201dA picture caption last Sunday with an article about the comedian Chelsea Handler reversed the identities of the two women shown working on her makeup and hair.

{"Headline": "One Top Taxpayer Moved, and New Jersey Shuddered", "Date": "2016-04-30", "News": "Supported byInside WealthOur top-heavy economy has come to this: One man can move out of New Jersey and put the entire state budget at risk. Other states are facing similar situations as a greater share of income \u2014 and tax revenue \u2014 becomes concentrated in the hands of a few.Last month, during a routine review of New Jersey\u2019s finances, one could sense the alarm. The state\u2019s wealthiest resident had reportedly \u201cshifted his personal and business domicile to another state,\u201d Frank W. Haines III, New Jersey\u2019s legislative budget and finance officer, told a State Senate committee. If the news were true, New Jersey would lose so much in tax revenue that \u201cwe may be facing an unusual degree of income tax forecast risk,\u201d Mr. Haines said.The New Jersey resident (unnamed by Mr. Haines) is the hedge-fund billionaire David Tepper. In December, Mr. Tepper declared himself a resident of Florida after living for over 20 years in New Jersey. He later moved the official headquarters of his hedge fund, Appaloosa Management, to Miami.New Jersey won\u2019t say exactly how much Mr. Tepper paid in taxes. But according to Institutional Investor\u2019s Alpha, he earned more than $6 billion from 2012 to 2015. Tax experts say his move to Florida could cost New Jersey \u2014 which has a top tax rate of 8.97 percent \u2014 hundreds of millions of dollars in lost payments.Mr. Tepper, 58, declined to comment on his move. He does have family \u2014 his mother and sister \u2014 who live in Florida. But several New Jersey lawmakers cited his relocation as proof that the state\u2019s tax rates, up from 6.37 percent in 1996, are chasing away the rich. Florida has no personal income tax.\u201cIf you\u2019re making hundreds of millions of dollars and you\u2019re paying close to 10 percent to the state of New Jersey, you do the math,\u201d said Jon Bramnick, the Republican leader in the New Jersey Assembly. \u201cYou can save millions a year by moving to Florida. How can you blame him?\u201dBeyond the debate on taxing the rich, Mr. Tepper\u2019s move is a case study in how tax collections are affected when income becomes very highly concentrated. With the top tenth of 1 percent of the population reaping the largest income gains, states with the highest tax rates on the rich are growing increasingly dependent on a smaller group of superearners for tax revenue.In New York, California, Connecticut, Maryland and New Jersey, the top 1 percent pay a third or more of total income taxes. Now a handful of billionaires or even a single individual like Mr. Tepper can have a noticeable impact on state revenues and budgets.California had to account for a \u201cFacebook effect\u201d in 2012 and 2013 after that company\u2019s 2012 initial public offering of stock. The offering generated more than $1 billion in revenue \u2014 much of that from the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, and a small group of company shareholders. Washington, D.C., had an unexpected $50 million gain in its 2012 fiscal year \u2014 which helped create a budget surplus \u2014 after the death of a local billionaire increased its estate tax receipts.Some academic research shows that high taxes are chasing the rich to lower-tax states, and anecdotes of tax-fleeing billionaires abound. But other studies say there is little evidence showing that the rich move solely for tax purposes. Millionaires and billionaires who move from the high-tax states in the Northeast to Florida, for instance, may be drawn by the sunshine, lifestyle and retirement culture, in addition to lower taxes.While some high earners may be moving for tax reasons, New Jersey, New York, California and other states are replacing rich people faster than they are losing them. New Jersey had 237,000 millionaires in 2015, compared with 207,200 in 2006, according to Phoenix Marketing International, a research firm. New York added 69,500 millionaires from 2006 to 2015, to 437,900, while California added over 100,000 millionaires, to 772,600.The best solution to the mega-taxpayer dilemma, some tax experts say, is for states to do a better job of tracking and forecasting the incomes of their top earners. Since the rich are the most mobile and are able to manage their investments just as easily in Miami as in Manhattan, states are devising new ways to monitor their top taxpayers and keep them from leaving.\u201cIn a time of rising inequality, I\u2019m not sure the right answer is lowering taxes or making them less progressive,\u201d said Kim S. Rueben, senior fellow of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute. \u201cIt\u2019s more about keeping an eye on people, seeing where they are and enforcing the tax rules.\u201dConnecticut, home to several hedge fund billionaires, now tracks the quarterly estimated payments of 100 of its top earners. Kevin B. Sullivan, commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Revenue Services, said about five or six of the highest earners could have a \u201cmeasurable impact on the revenue stream.\u201dMr. Sullivan said that when one of the state\u2019s rich hedge fund executives planned to move his family and company to a lower-tax state, state officials met with him and persuaded him to leave some of his work force in Connecticut.\u201cWe knew we were going to lose him,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said. \u201cBut we wanted to keep some of the higher-paying jobs.\u201d He said the state worked out a deal to keep the jobs in exchange for an agreement about the owner\u2019s regular visits to family and friends in Connecticut. (Homeowners who spend more than 183 days in the state are considered residents for tax purposes.) He said the state was holding discussions with other top earners in hopes of keeping them.\u201cI\u2019m not saying we\u2019re sending fruit baskets and get-well cards,\u201d said Mr. Sullivan, a former Democratic legislator. \u201cBut we\u2019re trying to send a more welcoming message to the high earners as a group.\u201dNew York is now more closely monitoring wealthy taxpayers who have homes in New York but claim Florida as their tax residence. And New Jersey is collecting data on all of the taxpayers who make more than $1 million to forecast their tax payments more accurately.In California, 5,745 taxpayers earning $5 million or more generated more than $10 billion of income taxes in 2013, or about 19 percent of the state\u2019s total, according to state officials.\u201cAny state that depends on income taxes is going to get sick whenever one of these guys gets a cold,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said.Hence New Jersey\u2019s concern over Mr. Tepper\u2019s departure. Whatever the reasons for his move, he is leaving for Florida at an especially opportune time for tax savings. Many hedge fund managers have for years used a tax loophole that allowed them to defer taxes on fees they earned through the use of offshore funds. A 2008 federal tax rule, however, requires them to declare those fees by the end of 2017 and pay any necessary federal, state and local taxes.For some hedge fund managers, the amounts declared will probably be in the billions of dollars, accountants say. A spokesman for Mr. Tepper declined to comment on his overseas income. By moving to Florida, Mr. Tepper could avoid paying state income taxes on any such funds.\u201cIf he\u2019s bringing money back, you\u2019re talking about a big possible gain,\u201d Mr. Bramnick said. \u201cSo it\u2019s a good time to move to Florida.\u201dMr. Tepper regularly topped state wealth rankings as New Jersey\u2019s richest resident. He also has homes in Miami Beach and the Hamptons. In 2012 and 2013, he also topped Alpha\u2019s list of the highest-earning hedge fund managers, with estimated earnings of $2.2 billion in 2012 and $3.5 billion in 2013. His earnings fell to $400 million in 2014.Mr. Tepper never publicly announced his move to Florida. But it became public on April 5, when Mr. Haines, citing a Bloomberg report, mentioned Mr. Tepper\u2019s move in his remarks to the State Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee. In discussing the move, Mr. Haines said, \u201cEven a 1 percent forecasting error in the income tax estimate is worth $140 million.\u201dMr. Tepper\u2019s payments may have even been higher. If Mr. Tepper earned $3.5 billion in 2013, his state tax bill could have been over $300 million, according to New Jersey accountants. Granted, his actual payments were probably far lower because of deferred income, charitable deductions and other accounting treatments. Yet Mr. Haines\u2019s comments are believed to be the first time a state official has warned of a budget risk because of one resident\u2019s relocation.\u201cWe\u2019ve had states mention risks from high-income groups, but never from a single taxpayer,\u201d Ms. Rueben of the Tax Policy Center said.ROBERT FRANK is CNBC wealth editor and the author of \u201cRichistan.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Refugee Crisis Is Humanity\u2019s Crisis", "Date": "2016-05-02", "News": "Supported byThe StoneThis is the third in a series of dialogues with philosophers and critical theorists on the question of violence. This conversation is with Zygmunt Bauman, emeritus professor of sociology at the University of Leeds, Britain. His latest book, \u201cStrangers at Our Door\u201d is published with Polity Press.It\u2019s true that the prevalent direction of migration has changed following the spread of the modern way of life from Europe, its place of origin, to the rest of the globe. As long as Europe remained the only \u201cmodern\u201d Continent of the planet, its redundant populations kept being unloaded onto the still \u201cpremodern\u201d lands \u2014 recycled into colonist settlers, soldiers or members of colonial administration. Indeed, up to 60 million Europeans are believed to have left Europe for the two Americas, Africa, Australia during the heyday of colonial imperialism.Starting from the middle of the 20th century, however, the trajectory of migration took a U-turn. During this time, the logic of migration changed as it was dissociated from the conquest of the lands. The migrants of the post-colonial era have been and still are exchanging inherited ways of eking out existence, now destroyed by the triumphant modernization promoted by their former colonizers, for the chance of building a nest in the gaps of those colonizers\u2019 domestic economies.On top of that, however, there is a rising volume of people forced out from their homes, particularly in the Middle East and in Africa, by the dozens of civil wars, ethnic and religious conflicts and sheer banditry in the territories the colonizers left behind in nominally sovereign, artificially concocted \u201cstates\u201d with little prospects of stability, but enormous arsenals of weaponry supplied by their former colonial masters.In such a world, those people who are forced to flee intolerable conditions are not considered to be \u201cbearers of rights,\u201d even those supposedly considered inalienable to humanity. Forced to depend for their survival on the people on whose doors they knock, refugees are in a way thrown outside the realm of \u201chumanity,\u201d as far as it is meant to confer the rights they aren\u2019t afforded. And there are millions upon millions of such people inhabiting our shared planet.As you rightly point out, refugees end up all too often cast in the role of a threat to the human rights of established native populations, instead of being defined and treated as a vulnerable part of humanity in search of the restoration of those same rights of which they have been violently robbed.There is currently a pronounced tendency \u2014- among the settled populations as well as the politicians they elect to state offices \u2014 to transfer the \u201cissue of refugees\u201d from the area of universal human rights into that of internal security. Being tough on foreigners in the name of safety from potential terrorists is evidently generating more political currency than appealing for benevolence and compassion for people in distress. And to outsource the whole problem into the care of security services is eminently more convenient for governments overloaded with social care duties, which they are apparently neither able nor willing to perform to the satisfaction of their electors.In part, they bring the mysterious and obscure, but hopefully distant, horrors of \u201cglobal forces\u201d right into our visible and tangible neighborhood. As recently as a few weeks ago those newcomers may have felt just as safe at home as we do right now. But now, they look at us, deprived of their homes, possessions, security, often their \u201cinalienable\u201d human rights, and of their entitlement to have the respect and acceptance that provide a guarantee of self-esteem.Following the age-old habit, the messengers are blamed for the contents of their message. No wonder the successive tides of fresh immigrants are resented, to quote Brecht, as \u201charbingers of bad news.\u201d They are embodiments of the collapse of order, a state of affairs in which the relations between causes and effects are stable and so graspable and predictable, allowing those inside a situation to know how to proceed. Because they reveal these insecurities to us, refugees are easily demonized. By stopping them on the other side of our properly fortified borders, it is implied that we\u2019ll manage to stop those global forces that brought them to our doors.Insofar as the label \u201ceconomic migrant\u201d stigmatizes these victims, its use should be condemned. Such discursive acrobatics leave the causes of these crises unexamined, and those responsible untouched by guilt. In a culture that ennobles the pursuit of self-betterment and happiness by raising it to the rank of life purpose and meaning, it is nothing less than utter hypocrisy to condemn those who try to follow this precept but are prevented from doing so by lack of means or proper papers.\u201cNobody can write the history of the twentieth century like that of any other era, if only because nobody can write about his or her lifetime as one can (and must) write about a period known only from outside, at second or third-hand, from sources of the period or the works of later historians (...) This is one reason why under my professional hat as a historian I avoided working on the era since 1914 for most of my career.\u201dAs Benjamin Barber crisply put it in his manifesto \u201cIf Mayors Ruled the World,\u201d \u201ctoday, after a long history of regional success, the nation-state is failing us on the global scale. It was the perfect political recipe for the liberty and independence of autonomous peoples and nations. It is utterly unsuited for interdependence.\u201d He sees that nation states are singularly unfit to tackle the challenges arising from our planet-wide interdependence, in that they are \u201ctoo inclined by their nature to rivalry and mutual exclusion,\u201d and appear \u201cquintessentially indisposed to cooperation and incapable of establishing global common goods.\u201dI trace much of the problem to the growing separation between power and politics, a rift that results in powers free from political constraints and a politics that is suffering a constant, and growing, deficit of power. Powers, and particularly those most heavily influencing the human condition and humanity\u2019s prospects, are today global, roaming ever more freely in (to use the Spanish sociologist Manuel Castells\u2019s words) the \u201cspace of flows\u201d while ignoring at will the borders, laws, and internally defined interests of political entities \u2014 whereas the extant instruments of political action remain, as they were a century or two ago, fixed and confined to the \u201cspace of places,\u201d that of states. Alternative \u201chistorical agents\u201d are much in demand, and one may surmise that until they are found and put in place, debating the models of a \u201cgood\u201d or at least a \u201cbetter\u201d society will seem to be an idle pastime \u2014 and except in the extreme margins of the political spectrum won\u2019t arouse much emotion.All the same, I don\u2019t believe there is a shortcut solution to the current refugee problem. Humanity is in crisis \u2014- and there is no exit from that crisis other than the solidarity of humans. The first obstacle on the road to the exit from mutual alienation is the refusal of dialogue: that silence that accompanies self-alienation, aloofness, inattention, disregard and indifference. Instead of the duo of love and hate, the dialectical process of border-drawing needs to be thought therefore in terms of the triad of love, hate and indifference or neglect that the refugee, in particular, continues to face.An earlier version of this article rendered incorrectly the name of a sociologist who discussed society\u2019s \u201cculture lag\u201d in adjusting to change. He was William Fielding Ogburn, not Willliam Fielding. It also misstated the title of one of Zygmunt Bauman\u2019s books. It is \u201cStrangers at Our Door,\u201d not \u201cStrangers at the Door.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.M. to Compensate Owners of S.U.V.s That Overstate Mileage", "Date": "2016-05-20", "News": "Supported byGeneral Motors said on Friday that it would offer cash payments or extended warranties to 135,000 owners of certain large sport utility vehicles with window stickers overstating likely gas mileage.The move reflects the increasing scrutiny global automakers are facing after a diesel emission scandal that has rocked Volkswagen.G.M. will offer debit cards of $450 to $900 to people who bought a 2016 Chevrolet Traverse, Buick Enclave or GMC Acadia. In place of the debit cards, customers may opt for increasing the warranty coverage to 48 months or 60,000 miles, from 36 months or 36,000 miles. Lease customers will be offered only debit cards, the company said in a statement.The compensation plan was announced a week after G.M. revealed that it had overstated the mileage of the 2016 Traverse, Enclave and Acadia by one or two miles a gallon and notified dealers to replace the window stickers on about 60,000 affected models in stock. It briefly halted sales of the models while the stickers were being corrected.On Wednesday, Suzuki Motor said it had used improper methods to determine the fuel economy of 16 vehicles it sells in Japan. In April, Mitsubishi Motors acknowledged it cheated on gas mileage tests in Japan for the last 25 years, a revelation that caused a plunge in its stock price, the resignation of its president, Tetsuro Aikawa, and the sale of a 34 percent stake in the company to Nissan Motor.\u201cThis is the new era we live in, where there\u2019s enough testing and oversight that if any manufacturer isn\u2019t completely straight on the numbers, it\u2019s going to be exposed,\u201d said Karl Brauer, an analyst at the auto research firm Kelley Blue Book. \u201cThe good news is that the G.M. case shows customers will get compensation if there is an issue.\u201dG.M. told dealers of its compensation plan on Friday. The compensation was calculated based on an assumed gasoline price of $3 a gallon and an average owner driving of 15,000 miles a year.At first, G.M. attributed the discrepancy in mileage estimates to misprinted window stickers. But on Friday, the company said it had installed additional emissions controls on the 2016 versions of the Traverse, Acadia and Enclave, and that change was not accounted for when it calculated fuel economy estimates required by the Environmental Protection Agency.\u201cWe want all of our customers to have a great ownership experience, so we designed this reimbursement program to provide full and fair compensation in a simple, flexible and timely manner,\u201d Jim Cain, a G.M. spokesman, said.Automakers have come under increasing pressure since Volkswagen\u2019s admission in September that it had equipped its most popular diesel cars with \u201cdefeat devices\u201d that cheat on emissions tests by turning on pollution controls when in the lab, and shutting them off in real-world driving. About 11 million vehicles are affected worldwide.At the request of the Justice Department, Daimler, maker of Mercedes-Benz luxury cars, is conducting an internal investigation of its certification process for diesel exhaust emissions.German authorities are looking into whether G.M.\u2019s Opel division and Italy\u2019s Fiat use engine software that turns off pollution controls. South Korean officials recently accused the Japanese automaker Nissan Motor of cheating on emissions tests.The diesel cheating scandal has rocked Volkswagen, which until recently ranked as one of the world\u2019s most profitable automakers. Since September, it has replaced its chief executive and other top managers, suffered a slump in sales in the United States and earmarked $18 billion to cover lawsuits, vehicle recalls and other costs related to the scandal.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "North Korean Leader Tells Congress His Nuclear Program Brings \u2018Dignity\u2019", "Date": "2016-05-06", "News": "Supported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, said Friday that his nuclear weapons and missile programs brought his country \u201cdignity and national power,\u201d as he convened the first congress of his Workers\u2019 Party in 36 years.Mr. Kim opened the congress in a large theater in Pyongyang, the capital, on Friday morning. The unusual political gathering was widely expected to serve as a platform for the young leader to consolidate his power, touting his nuclear weapons program as his biggest achievement.He also said the nuclear test detonated a hydrogen bomb, although the United States and South Korea have doubted the claim because it yielded an explosion too small to be a thermonuclear bomb.Mr. Kim called the nuclear test and satellite launch great successes that confirmed the \u201cdignity and national power of Juche Korea at the highest level.\u201d Juche, or self-reliance, is the North\u2019s governing ideology.Officials in Washington and South Korea who had hoped Mr. Kim might be willing to bargain over the program in return for economic and diplomatic concessions were bound to be disappointed. Mr. Kim increasingly appears to view the nuclear program as the main political asset that legitimizes his rule.The congress, held in the April 25 House of Culture, unfolded behind closed doors. More than 100 outside journalists invited to Pyongyang for the rare event were denied access to the theater and had to rely on the North\u2019s state-run Central TV, which didn\u2019t release footage of Mr. Kim addressing the delegates until late Friday night.Mr. Kim wore a Western-style suit and tie, not in his trademark Mao-style uniform. Central TV said the congress would review the country\u2019s past policies, elect the leadership of the party and revise its charter. It will also uphold Mr. Kim as the party\u2019s \u201csupreme leader,\u201d the broadcaster said.The congress was expected to last until early next week.Analysts broadly agree that any changes announced during the congress, including to the party\u2019s leadership or its charter, will seek to cement Mr. Kim\u2019s authority as the North\u2019s monolithic leader. Mr. Kim has had scores of senior generals and party officials executed for disloyalty since taking power.Analysts are also watching to see if Mr. Kim loosens the state\u2019s control over the economy, though no bold moves in that direction are expected.Mr. Kim has championed a so-called byungjin strategy for the nation, which calls for securing a nuclear arsenal while trying to rebuild the moribund economy. All indications are that Mr. Kim, who came to power after the death of his father, Kim Jong-il, in late 2011, will hold fast to this policy during the congress.In a lengthy dispatch on Friday, the state-run Korean Central News Agency, or KCNA, hailed Mr. Kim as a strong leader who had armed the country with a nuclear deterrent against its enemies, particularly the United States, so that his people could work to revive the economy.Such advances \u201care the biggest gifts our defense scientists and engineers present to the seventh party congress,\u201d KCNA said. Parroting the official rationale for Mr. Kim\u2019s byungjin strategy, the report said the \u201cpowerful nuclear deterrent\u201d would safeguard the North\u2019s future and \u201cboost the revolutionary will of the people to dedicate themselves to building the economy and improving their living conditions.\u201dThe United States and South Korea have vowed to derail such a policy by isolating the North with the enforcement of United Nations sanctions until it gives up its nuclear weapons.The party congress is the closest that North Korea has to an election of its top leader. In theory, the Workers\u2019 Party, which governs North Korea, is supposed to hold a congress every five years to elect a central committee, which in turn chooses the leader of the party and his lieutenants.But the Kim family, which has ruled the country since its creation in the 1940s, has paid little heed to such formalities. Kim Jong-il acquired all the top military and party titles without once holding a party congress. The last one took place in 1980, when Mr. Kim\u2019s grandfather, Kim Il-sung, was in power.Mr. Kim was appointed the leader of the Workers\u2019 Party in 2012 at a conference of party representatives, but that gathering was a less prestigious forum than a full-fledged congress. South Korean officials have contended that Mr. Kim is holding the party congress now because he values pomposity more than his father did and wants his young leadership to receive the imprimatur of a full congress.The decades since the last congress have been marked by existential crises for the North Korean government: the collapse of the Soviet bloc; the death in 1994 of Kim Il-sung, who remains a godlike figure in the country; and the devastating famine that followed, which weakened citizens\u2019 trust in the Kim family\u2019s rule.But South Korean intelligence officials recently told lawmakers in Seoul that discontent has mounted in the North in recent weeks, as the authorities mobilized people for \u201c70-day battles\u201d to increase production before the party congress \u2014 both to demonstrate their loyalty and help cover the costs of the event.Analysts in South Korea expected Mr. Kim to continue the past practice of handing out luxury goods to party delegates who have gathered from around the country.Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said this week that the congress was \u201cmade possible by the forced labor that untold thousands of North Koreans are subject to as part of everyday life under Kim Jong-un\u2019s abusive rule.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Putin Tolerates Corruption", "Date": "2016-05-15", "News": "Supported bySofia, Bulgaria \u2014 THE recent release of the so-called Panama Papers raises a lot of questions, one of which is: Is it better for an authoritarian regime to fight corruption, or work with it? Presidents Xi Jinping of China and Vladimir V. Putin of Russia point us to two very different answers.In 2012 President Xi, calling corruption an existential threat to China\u2019s Communist rule, undertook a broad campaign to purge the Communist Party of what he called \u201ctigers and flies\u201d \u2014 corrupt officials and businesses, at every level of the party apparatus and government bureaucracy. As of last year, the campaign had netted more than 100 high-ranking officials, including a dozen military officers, several senior executives of state-owned companies and four top politicians.Critics of the regime tend to blame President Xi for using the campaign to eliminate his rivals, but the anti-corruption effort is highly popular with the public, and many independent analysts agree that it helped galvanize further reforms in semiprivate industries like the oil sector.President Putin has followed Mr. Xi\u2019s lead, at least rhetorically \u2014 except that in his nearly 17 years in power, not a single political \u201ctiger,\u201d to borrow Mr. Xi\u2019s term, and only a few \u201cflies\u201d have been brought down by corruption charges.But why is Mr. Putin, despite his willingness to start military wars, reluctant to declare a real war on corruption \u2014 even though, as Mr. Xi has found, anti-corruption campaigns are usually popular with the public?The commonplace explanation in the Western media is that Mr. Putin himself is deeply corrupt \u2014 indeed, that he sits at the epicenter of Russia\u2019s corrupt edifice. This may be so. But as someone who has spent his life in the Balkans (and therefore knows a thing about corruption), I have learned that being corrupt is hardly a reason not to declare a war on corruption; on the contrary, it could be an incentive, because there is nothing that corrupt politicians hate more than other people\u2019s corruption.The reason for Mr. Putin\u2019s reluctance, then, is more complicated.On one hand, for him, mutual accusations of corruption are the dirty bombs of the intra-elite wars, which cause a lot of collateral damage. Research has long demonstrated that corruption, although hitting the poorest groups in society hardest, is primarily a middle-class concern \u2014 and in today\u2019s Russia, the middle class to a great extent is composed of these same bribe-taking officials that anti-corruption campaigns should target.On the other hand, what matters in politics is not the levels of corruption, but the public\u2019s perception of how corrupt their country is, and very often the link between the two is not direct. Small and successful wars abroad can be a better instrument to change people\u2019s perception of how corrupt their country is than the actual efforts to reduce corruption. Correlation is not causation, but in the wake of Crimea\u2019s annexation, the number of Russians who believed that corruption was increasing plummeted to 30 percent, from 50 percent.Interestingly, there is one way that corruption itself worries Mr. Putin: as a weapon that can be used by Russia\u2019s external enemies against him. What worries the Kremlin is not that Russian officials are corrupt, but that they are vulnerable to Western pressure, since the assets they stole, just like their children, are in the West. Corruption as a rule helps unite elites, but it can also make them good recruits. (In this sense, Moscow should not be unhappy about the West\u2019s efforts to clean up hidden offshore accounts.)The Kremlin\u2019s top priority then is not purging corrupt elites, but nationalizing them. Russian elites have the right to be corrupt, but only if they have proved their loyalty. Paradoxically, the West\u2019s sanctions against business figures closest to the Russian president helped whitewash some of the most notoriously corrupt Russian oligarchs and allow Russian propaganda to present them as selfless defenders of the motherland.Ultimately, the most important reason for Mr. Putin\u2019s reluctance to declare a war on corruption is that any anti-corruption campaign will inspire the public to demand change. It plays not only on the public\u2019s anger, but also on its aspirations. And it is precisely this demand for change that the Kremlin fears most. Unlike in China, leaders in Russia avoid promising that life will be better tomorrow; what they promise is that things will not get worse. And unlike in China, they can afford to do so because the Russian economy is driven not by the entrepreneurial energy of the masses, but by natural resources.This is why the Russian government is ready to acknowledge corruption\u2019s ubiquity \u2014 the slickest propaganda couldn\u2019t convince people otherwise. But the government also advances the idea that corruption is a way of life and is thus a natural phenomenon. In a way, corruption is like vodka: You know it hurts, but Russia is unimaginable without it.Ivan Krastev is the chairman of the Center for Liberal Strategies, a permanent fellow at the Institute for Human Sciences in Vienna and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

Indeed, many politicians and businessmen were arrested, jailed, and tortured under the direction of the military officers running the \u201ccaretaker government.\u201d He also conveniently fails to mention that once the democratically elected government came to power I was released and that subsequently the courts dismissed the fraud allegations and all related cases against me.The Beximco group does have significant borrowings from local banks, as is common for many large conglomerates such as ours. We employ over 60,000 people and our turnover is over $1 billion. Nevertheless, Mr. Allchin paints a picture that the loans were obtained with the intention of nonpayment because of my insider status, which is not true.Servicing our loans during the eight-year period between 2001 and 2008 when the BNP was in power followed by the military caretaker government were undoubtedly difficult for us; our credit lines were frozen, and our interest rate rose to a debilitating 18 percent. Since that time, we have repaired our finances, by successfully restructuring our loans and the banks have agreed to reduce the interest rate to 10 percent. We did not ask for the banks to take a haircut, which was common when the BNP was in power. In our case not a single farthing was written off.Had the restructuring not taken place, we would have been forced to close down our operations resulting in the loss of over 60,000 jobs, which would have impacted the country\u2019s economy adversely.SALMAN F.

More job sharing with higher hourly wages may also be necessary.Politically these policies may be harder to sell, but they are more likely to be effective than the absurd notion that we can return to the halcyon industrial era long past.ANTHONY A. CUPAIUOLOSouth Lake Tahoe, Calif.The writer is professor emeritus of public administration at Pace University.To the Editor:Eduardo Porter may be correct that the sort of manufacturing jobs whose loss is lamented by Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton are never coming back, but he is wrong to suggest that workers\u2019 being replaced by machines is somehow inevitable.His opening example, the mechanization of the canning tomato harvest, proves it. California tomato growers evinced little interest in mechanization until it became clear that their prized labor source, \u201cbracero\u201d guest workers imported from Mexico under conditions of near indenture, was threatened.Before 1963 there were almost no mechanical harvesters in California fields, not because the technology was unavailable, but because cheap labor was easily secured. As the cost of labor seemed set to rise \u2014 because political pressure led to the end of the bracero program \u2014 growers embraced mechanization.The adoption of technology (or the outsourcing of jobs) is, Mr. Porter\u2019s example suggests, a quintessentially political question. Mr. Trump, Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton are dead right in making it the heart of their campaigns.DON MITCHELLSyracuseThe writer, a professor of geography at Syracuse University, is the author of \u201cThey Saved the Crops: Labor, Landscape and the Struggle Over Industrial Farming in Bracero-Era California.\u201dTo the Editor:While advances in automation have reduced the labor needed to produce a particular product, they also reduce the relevancy of labor cost when deciding where to make that product.No informed person would suggest that overseas factories with thousands of workers manually assembling products should be replicated here. But advanced American factories, each employing 50 to 200 engineers, technicians and tradespeople, are better for America than overseas factories with the same output, each with thousands of unskilled laborers.Manufacturing is actually growing in certain high-cost, well-educated countries like Germany with policies supportive of domestic manufacturers and environments in which all stakeholders have a voice in these policies.American manufacturers also need a level playing field, where our goods have the same access to foreign markets that foreign manufacturers have to the United States. Trade agreements must not only be balanced, but also be enforced. We have been in a trade war for decades, but only our competition is actually fighting the battle.

{"Headline": "Our Crime Against the Planet, and Ourselves", "Date": "2016-05-18", "News": "Supported byThe StoneWhat is the nature of this crime? The human species is the agent of a terrible injustice being perpetrated against other species, future generations, ecosystems and our fellow human beings. Examples include contaminated waterways, mass species extinction, massive fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions and unsustainable rates of deforestation, to name just a few. This is leading to extreme and more frequent weather events, expanding deserts, loss of biodiversity, collapsing ecosystems, water depletion and contamination, and the rise of global sea levels.However, humans are not all equally guilty of this crime. Some, such as those advancing the interests of the fossil-fuel industry, or those whose high-income lifestyles carry a heavy environmental footprint, are implicated more than those living in poverty. Present and past generations are collectively more at fault than future generations.At the same time, the human species is an agent of justice, having crafted laws designed to hold criminals accountable. Troubled when we witness violence, discrimination and unnecessary cruelty, we also individually serve as vehicles of justice.If this situation continues unabated it will cause extreme harm to future generations and eventually a gratuitous loss of human life. Let me ask: Should we confer greater existential importance upon present generations of human beings than future ones? Environmental degradation, and in particular climate change, denies future generations their agency through no fault of their own, leaving them with a world that could very well reduce what life remains to that of mere survival.This is a crime against what makes us uniquely human \u2014 the creative agency that comes from a combination of reasoning, imagination and emotion. We may all have different capacities and opportunities through which to realize our agency, but we share the same ability to collectively and individually realize our innovative potential.Because human activities cause this environmental damage, our species is culpable for a crime we are committing against ourselves. But in our defense, humanity is largely trapped by the political form of liberal state power, which facilitates the smooth functioning of global capitalism \u2014 the source of the problem.For instance, the idea that we can \u201cgreen\u201d a capitalist economy without radically rethinking the basic premises at the heart of neoliberal economic theory is truly an example of misplaced politics. The system is premised upon a model of endless growth, competition, private property and consumer citizenship, all of which combine to produce a terribly exploitative, oppressive and violent structure that has come to infuse all aspects of everyday life.The people whom I have been in dialogue with at Unesco are deeply committed to creating policies and practices that address social and environmental injustices. We may not always agree on how to do this, but it is crucial that different voices, experiences and situations are part of the discussion, even when the outcome falls short of radical change.It is better to be at the table and contributing to the discussion than not at all. Every now and then, what one brings to the table animates the discussion enough to create small but meaningful changes.Whether the conflict in Darfur is blamed on desertification, or water scarcity as underpinning the ongoing conflict between Palestinians and Israelis, the problem of the equitable distribution of scarce natural resources and the deeper power relations concerning who reaps the benefits of these and at whose expense remains dormant.I am not suggesting that environmental degradation is unconnected to social and political unrest \u2014 it definitely is. However, to form a neat causal connection between the two disguises the myriad ways in which violence in the contemporary world operates.I am more interested in connecting conflicting political models, with the aim of creating new political solidarities. I don\u2019t mean solidarity simply based on an issue, for instance when climate- change activists link arms with indigenous-rights activists or the anti-fracking movement. While this is important to do, I think the whole notion of solidarity needs to be deepened and expanded to include solidarities across different political practices, strategically switching between oppositional intervention from the outside and working from the inside to find a more effective path forward.This would be a bastard solidarity that combines the immanent politics of Spinoza and all its offshoots, which emerge by affirming the current situation differently to produce change, with the dialectics descended from Hegel and Marx, which begin by negating the current state of affairs so that contradiction leads to change. In my view the change in question is only ever a provisional synthesis, not a stable, finished solution. As such, the struggle is necessarily continual and manifold, occurring in multiple ways and across numerous platforms. What unites them is a struggle premised upon love. A love of life, diversity, and openness. A love that works to defy hatred, oppression, and intolerance, and the violence this perpetuates.An emancipatory politics needs to be quick on its feet and recognize how capital accumulation functions and in turn build its political practices and thinking as a strategic response to this. No one political program is immune to appropriation by capital. Working within the system to change it is always going to involve risks of co-option, just as much as a politics that positions itself outside of the capitalist system would. Recognizing this and developing a critical realism regarding this situation that can switch deftly and quickly between the two positions is the basis for crafting a path forward.Environmental degradation is calling us to the witness stand of history. It demands we testify against ourselves and mount a case in our defense. Ultimately, we are all agents of history. To reduce ourselves to a role of mere observation is to deny us of our humanity.Advertisement"}

They wander the streets in tattered winter coats, even in the warmth of spring. They worry about the illnesses of age and how they will approach death without the help of children who long ago drifted from their lives.\u201cIt\u2019s hard when you get older,\u201d said Ken Sylvas, 65, who has struggled with alcoholism and has not worked since he was fired in 2001 from a meatpacking job. \u201cI\u2019m in this wheelchair. I had a seizure and was in a convalescent home for two months. I just ride the bus back and forth all night.\u201dThe homeless in America are getting old.There were 306,000 people over 50 living on the streets in 2014, the most recent data available, a 20 percent jump since 2007, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. They now make up 31 percent of the nation\u2019s homeless population.The demographic shift is mirrored by a noticeable but not as sharp increase among homeless people ages 18 to 30, many who entered the job market during the Great Recession. They make up 24 percent of the homeless population. Like the baby boomers, these young people came of age during an economic downturn, confronting a tight housing and job market. Many of them are former foster children or runaways, or were victims of abuse at home.But it is the emergence of an older homeless population that is creating daunting challenges for social service agencies and governments already struggling with this crisis of poverty. \u201cBaby boomers have health and vulnerability issues that are hard to tend to while living in the streets,\u201d said Alice Callaghan, an Episcopal priest who has spent 35 years working with the homeless in Los Angeles.Many older homeless people have been on the streets for almost a generation, analysts say, a legacy of the recessions of the late 1970s and early 1980s, federal housing cutbacks and an epidemic of crack cocaine. They bring with them a complicated history that may include a journey from prison to mental health clinic to rehabilitation center and back to the sidewalks.Horace Allong, 60, said he could not afford a one-room apartment and lives in a tent on Crocker Street. Mr. Allong, who divorced his wife and left New Orleans for Los Angeles two years ago, said he lost his wallet and all of his identification two weeks after he arrived and has not been able to find a job.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve been on the streets, so I\u2019m learning,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like Skid Row. Skid Row is another world.\u201dAcross Southern California, the homeless live in tent encampments clustered on corners from Venice to the San Fernando Valley, and in communities sprouting under highway overpasses or in the dry bed of the Los Angeles River. Their sleeping bags and piles of belongings line sidewalks on Santa Monica Boulevard.Along with these visible signs of homelessness come complaints about aggressive panhandling, public urination and disorderly conduct, as well as a rise in drug dealing and petty crimes.Beleaguered officials in Los Angeles, Seattle and Hawaii have declared states of emergency, rolling out measures to combat homelessness and pledging to increase spending on low-cost housing. Honolulu has imposed a prohibition on sitting or lying on sidewalks in the neighborhood of Waikiki. San Francisco has cleared out some encampments, only for them to sprout up in other parts of the city. Seattle has tried to create designated tent camps that are overseen by social service agencies.The aging of the homeless population is on display in cities large and small, but perhaps in no place more than here on Skid Row, a grid of blocks just southeast of the vibrant economic center of downtown Los Angeles, where many of the nation\u2019s poor have long flocked, drawn by a year-round temperate climate and a cluster of missions and clinics.\u201cI\u2019m getting old,\u201d Mr. Balancad said, lifting himself to his feet with a cane. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go into one of these shelters. I don\u2019t want to get some disease.\u201dKin Crawford, 59, said he had fallen out of the job market long ago as he battled alcohol and drug addiction. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m sleeping in someone\u2019s garage,\u201d he said. \u201cMy biggest challenge out here? Access to a bathroom. It\u2019s really crazy. That and finding a place to keep your stuff.\u201dThis is a fluid population, defying precise count or categorization. Some might enjoy a stretch of stability, holding down a job for a while or finding a spare bed with a friend. But more than anything, these are men and women who, as they enter old age, have settled into patterns they seem unwilling, or unable, to break.\u201cWe are seeing people who have been on the street year after year after year,\u201d said Jerry Jones, the director of public policy at the Inner City Law Center in Los Angeles.Mr. Sylvas said the lines at the Hippie Kitchen were growing longer, and there were more tents on the sidewalks. \u201cIt\u2019s getting worse,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can see it. A lot more old ones.\u201dSylvia Welker is 70, but she maneuvers her electric wheelchair around the obstacles of her world \u2014 the lurches in the buckling sidewalks, the sharp curb drop on Crocker Street, the piles of clothes on the pavement, the tourists rushing through Skid Row on the way to the Arts District \u2014 with confidence and precision.For Ms. Welker, who has been divorced and on her own since 1981, this is the latest stop in a tumultuous journey. She lived in Lancaster, in California\u2019s high desert, until she was evicted about five years ago, unable to pay the rent. She tried to sleep on the streets, shivering on the sidewalks at night, until she finally pleaded for a room in the home of a daughter. \u201cI told my daughter I\u2019m not going to make it because of my handicap,\u201d she said, referring to her right leg, which she said she almost lost after she was hit by a car.Her daughter put her up for a few years, but Ms. Welker said she eventually left, ending up on Skid Row a year ago. She said she had since lost touch with all three of her children. \u201cThey don\u2019t even know how to reach me,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are probably going nuts. I didn\u2019t want to interfere with their lives.\u201dHome for Ms. Welker is now a room at a center for the homeless on San Pedro Street, but she has been told, she said, that her program is about to end. She has no idea what she will do next. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much longer I\u2019ll be there,\u201d she said.\u201cSkid Row is sad,\u201d Ms. Welker said. \u201cIt is as sad as you can imagine. You literally have to live here to see how sad it is.\u201dMs. Welker, chatty with a wide smile and white flowing hair that falls over her shoulders, has her routines. She knows the staggered schedules of the soup kitchens. Her bad leg and wheelchair usually entitle her to a spot at the front of the line, and she brings a plastic baggie to collect extra food to pass on to friends on the streets, or to eat when she returns to her room.She passes the days riding her wheelchair, waiting for the battery to run down so she can return to her room and charge it up for the next day.\u201cYou have to wait until it goes down to two or three dots,\u201d she said, flicking her finger at the battery indicator. \u201cSo I just ride up and down the street and say \u2018hi\u2019 to everybody. And when my chair goes down enough, I go back in. I have to charge my chair. And I have to elevate my leg, otherwise I could end up losing it.\u201dThe challenges faced by people like Ms. Welker have forced advocates for the homeless and government agencies to reconsider what kinds of services they need: It is not just a meal, a roof and rehabilitation anymore.So the older residents of Skid Row make do, and in the process, tax public services. There is the emergency room at Los Angeles County-U.S.C. Medical Center, or the ambulance from Firehouse No. 9 on Skid Row, which brings a crew of medics who are by now well versed on the characters and medical ailments outside the station house.Homeless veterans of all ages receive housing vouchers, and federally subsidized low-income housing projects give preference to the elderly. But few of the older homeless people have worked the time required to qualify for Social Security, much less put aside money for a 401(k) or employee retirement plan.That leaves them to turn to Supplemental Security Income, or S.S.I., a program set up to help poor older people and the disabled that typically pays around $733 a month. But S.S.I. is for people 65 and over, and Social Security does not start until age 62.By then it might be too late. Experts say the average life span for a homeless person living on the street is 64 years.Many manage as best they can, living outside and maneuvering around the drug dealing, random stabbings and shootings, and crackdowns by the police.Brenda Gardenshire, 66, who lives in a trim blue tent on a sidewalk she sweeps every morning, said she had learned not to venture out after dark in search of a bathroom, instead using a jar she keeps in her tent.\u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot of things out here wrong \u2014 everybody doing drugs and alcohol, friends and not friends,\u201d she said. Still, Ms. Gardenshire said she liked her life on the street, saying it was better, at least, than living in a shelter. Her only complaint was how people kept treating her as if she were frail.\u201cEveryone is like, \u2018You O.K.?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018Am I O.K.?\u2019 Or, \u2018You want to sit down?\u2019 Why do I want to sit down?\u201dIt is not the older homeless people whom Ms. Welker worries about as she surveys Skid Row from the perch of her wheelchair. It is the younger ones, who are slowly changing the makeup of this world.\u201cI\u2019m 70; I\u2019ve done my thing,\u201d she said. \u201cThe younger people, they are losing the best years of their lives. This is not a place to be.\u201d\u201cYou see things you wouldn\u2019t believe,\u201d Ms. Welker said. \u201cSomeone could be getting killed, someone could be getting knifed. And life goes on. Charities are still handing out coffee and soup.\u201dThere were 235,000 homeless Americans between 18 and 30 in 2014, making up 24 percent of the nation\u2019s homeless population. That was up from 226,000 in 2007, when the age group made up 20 percent of the total homeless population, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development.Some of them can be seen on Skid Row. But here in Los Angeles, these younger homeless people have staked out their own spaces to live \u2014 on the beaches of Venice, on the garbage-scattered scraps of dirt by the Hollywood Freeway.Some were bustling on a recent morning through the cramped hallways of My Friend\u2019s Place, a two-story ramshackle storefront right up against the edge of the freeway, its entrance hidden off an alley. It is a former recording studio that was turned 18 years ago into a center for homeless youth; nearly 1,500 people between the ages of 18 to 24 came here last year.\u201cWe are getting sandwiched by real old folks and real young folks,\u201d said Heather Carmichael, the executive director of My Friend\u2019s Place. \u201cIt\u2019s horrific.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "After Two Decades, W.N.B.A. Still Struggling for Relevance", "Date": "2016-05-28", "News": "Supported byARLINGTON, Tex. \u2014 The three women in the second row at College Park Center were strangers before tipoff, united only by their passion for women\u2019s basketball. But as the Dallas Wings played a home preseason game here earlier this month, they gradually bonded into a boisterous cheerleading unit \u2014 shouting, shimmying and shaking their fists to support the Wings.The team is starting its first season in its third city.\u201cWe need to promote these women!\u201d said Terry Spivey, of Glenn Heights, a Dallas suburb.From its start in 1997, the Women\u2019s National Basketball Association has had enthusiastic fans looking for good basketball and seeing in the league affirmation of the goal of sports equality.But as its 20th season gets underway, the W.N.B.A.\u2019s modest attendance and television viewership (just below 200,000 on ESPN\u2019s networks last season) illuminate a stubborn imbalance between men\u2019s and women\u2019s professional leagues, adding to the expanding debate about the place of women\u2019s sports in society.These anxieties have increased more than 40 years after the federal law known as Title IX opened the way for millions of girls to play sports. The women\u2019s professional leagues they move on to are still struggling to develop and hold lasting public interest.The Women\u2019s World Cup, the play of Serena and Venus Williams on the tennis circuit, and some professional women\u2019s golf events do generate a broad following. But those tend to be exceptions. There has yet to be a financially viable women\u2019s mainstream sports league in the United States.Building and sustaining a league, a challenge across sports and genders, has proved especially nettlesome for the W.N.B.A., even though it has the significant advantage of backing from one of the most financially endowed leagues, the National Basketball Association. Some wonder if, without that subsidy, the W.N.B.A. would have gone the way of other women\u2019s leagues with noble aspirations but little support to keep them alive.Half of the W.N.B.A.\u2019s 12 teams lose money, and they benefit from revenue generated by the N.B.A.\u2019s national television and sponsorship deals. This season, the $25 million the W.N.B.A. is getting from its primary broadcaster, ESPN, is a tiny fraction of the N.B.A.\u2019s average $930 million payment from ESPN and TNT, which will rise to about $2.6 billion next season.In a rare and candid moment last year, James L. Dolan, who owns the W.N.B.A.\u2019s Liberty and the N.B.A.\u2019s Knicks, told HBO\u2019s \u201cReal Sports\u201d that he came close to handing the franchise back to the league in 2015.\u201cIt hasn\u2019t made money,\u201d he said. \u201cIts prospects of making money, at that time and even today, are still slim.\u201dDolan has held on to the Liberty, though, and there seems to be little doubt of the N.B.A.\u2019s continued support of the W.N.B.A. as a legacy investment in women\u2019s basketball.But the W.N.B.A. has a fundamental problem: It needs more fans \u2014 lots of them. Attendance fell to an average of 7,318 a game last season, almost two decades after reaching its peak of 10,864 in 1998, the league\u2019s second season.Mary Jo Kane, the director of the Tucker Center for Research on Girls & Women in Sport at the University of Minnesota, said women\u2019s leagues still take a back seat in the sports world, despite the stated interest of fans, but she saw some hopeful signs.\u201cIf the baseline for comparison is where women\u2019s sports were in the early stage of Title IX, the W.N.B.A.\u2019s cup runneth over,\u201d she said. Still, she added: \u201cWhile there is no back-room conspiracy to suppress interest in women\u2019s sports, women\u2019s sports are still an afterthought and not considered core to the brand of sports. But having said that, at least they\u2019re in the conversation.\u201dThe W.N.B.A.\u2019s inability to fully capitalize on its early successes has been acknowledged by one of its founders, Adam Silver, now the N.B.A. commissioner. He said last fall that the league had not progressed as far as it should have \u2014 and that he had not focused on it as much as possible.\u201cAs much as we\u2019ve done in lending the league our name,\u201d he said, \u201cthe people who have been in the sports business for a long time, and I\u2019m one of them, historically underestimated the marketing it takes to launch a new property.\u201dThe need to market the league \u2014 as the best women\u2019s basketball in the world with deeper talent than ever \u2014 is recognized by players.Sue Bird, the Seattle Storm guard who is playing in her 14th season, said, \u201cThere\u2019s a weird disconnect between college players and W.N.B.A. players in terms of how people view us.\u201dIt is as if fans needed to be reminded, she said, that \u201cwe\u2019re actually the same players.\u201dBefore the season, the league hired a new president, Lisa M. Borders, to replace Laurel J. Richie. Silver likens the task of managing the league to running a political campaign \u2014 something that Borders has done, when she was on the Atlanta City Council and ran unsuccessfully for mayor. More recently, Borders chaired the Coca-Cola Foundation.She is trying to augment increased television coverage with a vigorous digital and social media marketing plan in an effort to lift attendance and viewership.She is fond of adages, like one from her grandfather, who told her, \u201cYou\u2019ve got two ears and one mouth, so listen twice as much as you talk.\u201d She talks about the Harry Truman-like whistle-stop tour that will take her to each market during the season. And she promised to bring a businesslike approach to reversing the league\u2019s troubles.\u201cHere\u2019s my job,\u201d she said emphatically. \u201cI am the No. 1 salesperson in the W.N.B.A. My title says president, but economic viability is my No. 1 job.\u201dBorders recognizes the challenges in making the W.N.B.A. stand out to hard-core women\u2019s basketball fans as well as more casual sports lovers who might not pay attention to women\u2019s sports.\u201cPeople have to know there\u2019s a team in their market,\u201d she said during a recent interview in her office at N.B.A. headquarters in Manhattan. \u201cThey have to know it\u2019s affordable family entertainment. There is no reason why people shouldn\u2019t know that a W.N.B.A. game is being played.\u201dThe 2016 season is a reboot, an opportunity to watch the rookie season of Breanna Stewart, one of the league\u2019s biggest new stars who was drafted by the Storm after leading the University of Connecticut to four consecutive N.C.A.A. titles; and to celebrate the final campaign of one of the league\u2019s most popular players, Tamika Catchings of the Indiana Fever.It is also a season to follow the Dallas Wings, a franchise with three W.N.B.A. titles and as many relocations to build an audience \u2014 exemplifying the ups and downs of the league.The W.N.B.A. strives to keep the failure of other leagues from haunting it. Two women\u2019s soccer leagues succumbed after three seasons; one of them, the Women\u2019s United Soccer Association, which was launched in the afterglow of the United States\u2019s victory at the 1999 Women\u2019s World Cup, had a group of cable television companies and executives as its backers.\u201cI\u2019m optimistic, but I\u2019m not na\u00efve,\u201d said Michael Alter, the owner of the Chicago Sky. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to get the word out. We don\u2019t have the support of all the free media; we have to work really hard. It\u2019s a grind, and we\u2019re just plugging away. But we\u2019ve got great athletes, and we\u2019re doing everything possible to expose them to the media.\u201dTo combat criticism that the league has not come as far as it should have, executives often repeat a mantra: The W.N.B.A. is ahead of the N.B.A. at a similar period in its development.Last year\u2019s average W.N.B.A. attendance of 7,318 a game exceeded the 6,749 at the same period of the N.B.A.\u2019s development in the mid-1960s. The N.B.A. then was not the marketing juggernaut it would later become under the former commissioner David Stern and lacked a nurturing, financially well-heeled league as its parent, as the W.N.B.A. has had.The comparison between the leagues is less favorable now: The N.B.A. is a global sports force, with $5.18 billion in revenue last year, that just set a regular-season attendance record of 17,864 a game.Still, Val Ackerman, the first W.N.B.A. president, said: \u201cLongevity is itself a victory. There were naysayers around every corner who said we wouldn\u2019t last a year or even two years, and now it\u2019s 20.\u201dBacked by the \u201cWe Got Next\u201d marketing campaign and the ownership of its teams by N.B.A. franchises, the W.N.B.A. started with unexpected strength the year after the United States women\u2019s team won the gold medal at the 1996 Summer Olympics. Original average attendance projections of upward of 4,500 fans in the first season were obliterated in the surprising rush to see the women play. That average attendance of 9,664 in 1997 swelled to a peak of 10,864 in 1998, then began its gradual downward descent.\u201cThe first year or two, sure, there was a lot of sampling and a lot of excitement coming out of the Olympics,\u201d said Rick Welts, president of the N.B.A.\u2019s Golden State Warriors. \u201cThe league did a great job launching, but a whole lot of N.B.A. fans looked, watched and said, \u2018I don\u2019t like this league that much.\u2019 That was the biggest wake-up call of all, that there was not an automatic migration of N.B.A. fans to the W.N.B.A. It took us a while to figure out that this was not the N.B.A. and we had to approach it differently.\u201dSilver said his goal within three to five years was to bring attendance back to 10,000, a level the Phoenix Mercury, the Minnesota Lynx and the Liberty approached last year.That may help shore up finances that contribute to the W.N.B.A.\u2019s low player salaries, from $39,676 to $111,500 this season, that push many of its players, like Maya Moore, Diana Taurasi, Brittney Griner and Tina Charles, to play in Europe and China during the off-season for multiples of their league wages.\u201cHopefully, in five years, players won\u2019t have to go overseas, and we\u2019ll have the off-season to make ourselves and the W.N.B.A. better,\u201d said the Sky\u2019s Cappie Pondexter, who has played in a Turkish league between seasons.Often, it seems, the league is striving for respect even in supportive quarters.In January, ESPN and league officials met to discuss plans for the upcoming season and narrowly avoided what could have been a major slight. The league\u2019s original 2016 television schedule omitted an opening-night game, an oversight John Skipper, the ESPN president, said he rectified.Skipper said: \u201cI asked what day the season opened and what game we were doing, and I was told we weren\u2019t doing a game. And I said: \u2018Guys, that\u2019s an issue. We can\u2019t be the league\u2019s partner and not to do an opening-day game.\u2019\u201dSilver was relieved at Skipper\u2019s intervention.\u201cI had accepted that we\u2019d gotten all we could out of ESPN and was thrilled when John added the opening-day game,\u201d Silver said. \u201cIt was a reminder of how much more we need to do.\u201dThe opening game ended up being the Lynx\u2019s 95-76 victory over the Mercury with a paid attendance of 9,221 fans at Target Center \u2014 which sells only lower-bowl seats for most Lynx games \u2014 on an opening weekend when league attendance was up 7 percent over last season.The Wings hope they have made their final move and that it will generate attendance. Starting out in 1998 as the Detroit Shock, the team moved to Tulsa, Okla., in 2010 and then relocated to the Dallas-Fort Worth area after last season.Bill Cameron, the franchise owner, thought that taking the team to Tulsa, where it would be the city\u2019s only major franchise, would be as beneficial as it was for the Seattle SuperSonics when they moved to Oklahoma City, where they became the Thunder.But he was wrong. The franchise, which won three titles in Detroit, foundered in Tulsa. Three key players did not join the relocation. The team won as few as three games during five consecutive losing seasons. Last season\u2019s team was hurt by injuries to its stars, Skylar Diggins and Odyssey Sims, but still won 18 of 34 games.\u201cAs we looked ahead, the protracted downturn in the energy economy in Tulsa was worrisome,\u201d Cameron said, but the Dallas area beckoned.\u201cWhen the opportunity came to move to Dallas, we needed to pursue it,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cIn a short time, we\u2019ve almost reached the same level of ticket sales and sponsorship we had in Tulsa after five years.\u201dIn moving to the campus of the University of Texas at Arlington, Cameron took the team from BOK Center in Tulsa, with 17,800 seats for basketball, to College Park Center, with 7,000 seats.To Sims, it is the right size for a W.N.B.A. team.\u201cObviously, we\u2019re not going to fill up 20,000,\u201d she said at the team\u2019s media day. \u201cNo W.N.B.A. team has done that. They should just make arenas smaller. Even if you only have 3,000 fans on a bad night, it\u2019ll sound loud.\u201dThe small Arlington arena needed most of the first half of a preseason game between the Wings and the Connecticut Sun before the crowd appeared to reach its paid attendance of 2,326. The first regular-season home game, a victory over the San Antonio Stars in a sellout arena, was a better early indicator of local interest in the relocated team that will try to break through in a crowded market. The region features the National Football League\u2019s Dallas Cowboys and Major League Baseball\u2019s Texas Rangers, who play nearby, as well as the N.B.A.\u2019s Dallas Mavericks and the National Hockey League\u2019s Dallas Stars.For more than a quarter, even as the Wings took a big lead, fans were quiet, many with arms folded, as if sending a message to the players: Show me. The recorded exhortations to shout \u201cDefense!\u201d were not being followed. Slowly, the fans came alive. They started razzing Sun players at the free-throw line. A white-haired man jawed at the visiting team.And Tiesha Bailey, who watched the game in a state of exuberance near Spivey, said: \u201cI was 11 when the W.N.B.A. started. I remember being so excited that Sheryl Swoopes was in Houston. Now I have season tickets, so I can take my 9-year-old niece here.\u201dThe Houston Comets were the league\u2019s early powerhouse, winning the first four W.N.B.A. championships and attracting as many as 12,602 fans a game in 1998. But by 2008, they were out of business, victimized by their owner\u2019s lack of finances.\u201cI only wanted to risk myself so far,\u201d the owner, Hilton Koch, said at the time. \u201cMy money was only going to last so long.\u201dBarbara Miggins stayed on her feet through nearly all of the Wings\u2019 preseason game, gesturing with her right arm while cradling her 17-month-old daughter, Gina, in her left. Her older daughters, Chrissy, 4, and Lina, 5, and her husband, Reggie, sat nearby.\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting 17 years for this,\u201d she said after the Wings\u2019 loss to the Sun. \u201cThis is a role-modeling experience for our daughters. I want them to see this.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Ad That Helped Reagan Sell Good Times to an Uncertain Nation", "Date": "2016-05-07", "News": "Supported byHistorySourceGiven that Donald J. Trump appears to have locked up the Republican nomination after spending little on television ads, it may be hard to explain to younger Americans how a single commercial made a difference in the 1984 presidential campaign.The scenes in \u201cMorning\u201d would have fit almost seamlessly into the 1950s sitcoms \u201cFather Knows Best\u201d or \u201cLeave It to Beaver.\u201d One difference is that the ad is rendered in soft, pastel colors similar to those used in \u201cThe Natural,\u201d the Robert Redford baseball film also released that year.Set to the music of sentimental strings, images include a paperboy on his bicycle, a family taking a rolled rug into a house and campers raising an American flag. The subtext is that after 20 years of social tumult, assassinations, riots, scandal, an unpopular war and gas lines, Mr. Reagan returned the United States to the tranquillity of the 1950s.At the start of the ad, the narrator\u2019s melodious voice says: \u201cIt\u2019s morning again in America. Today more men and women will go to work than ever before in our country\u2019s history.\u201d This wording, which reflected the growth of the American population in four years, distracts from the fact that unemployment remained higher (at about 7.5 percent) than it was when Mr. Reagan\u2019s predecessor, Jimmy Carter, left office.It\u2019s true that by 1984, the severe inflation that helped Mr. Reagan defeat Mr. Carter in 1980 was down significantly, but under Mr. Reagan, the deficit had more than doubled. Although times were improving, the president was potentially vulnerable to attack for having failed to fully keep his 1980 pledge to restore the American economy.Nancy Reagan, who was, as ever, deeply involved in the way her husband was presented to the world, disliked the pedestrian ads produced for his 1980 campaign, which appeared to bend over backward not to make Mr. Reagan, an ex-actor, look \u201ctoo Hollywood.\u201d And in 1984 what came to be called Tuesday Team Inc. (named for Election Day) entered the picture.Unlike earlier presidential campaigns that gave their accounts to existing advertising agencies, the Reagan campaign constructed its own shop with about 40 stars of the industry, starting with BBDO\u2019s Phil Dusenberry, who had been co-screenwriter for \u201cThe Natural\u201d and had produced Michael Jackson as he hawked Pepsi.By Mr. Messner\u2019s account, Mr. Reagan\u2019s pollster, Richard Wirthlin, and other Reagan lieutenants briefed the Tuesday Team on the president\u2019s accomplishments over two days in Washington. At one point, the president popped in and said, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to sell soap, you ought to see the bar.\u201dMr. Riney used his own resonant voice to narrate \u201cMorning in America.\u201d A full quarter of the commercial is devoted to a small-town church wedding that is almost a dead ringer for the one in Mr. Riney\u2019s Crocker Bank spot. The faces in the ad are overwhelmingly white.The commercial boasted that interest rates were about half those of 1980, and that about 2,000 families a day were buying homes. Then, over the wedding images, it said, \u201cThis afternoon, 6,500 young men and women will be married.\u201dThe number of weddings held per day is not quite the chief metric an economist would use to measure the health of a society, but reciting this statistic allows the announcer to say, \u201cThey can look forward, with confidence, to the future.\u201dThen the payoff: \u201cUnder the leadership of President Reagan, our country is prouder, and stronger, and better. Why would we ever want to return to where we were less than four short years ago?\u201dWhat\u2019s missing from \u201cMorning in America\u201d is Mr. Reagan. His face appears in the commercial for only two or three seconds, at the end \u2014 a still color photo on a campaign button, next to an American flag.Thirty-two years later, the Reagan campaign of 1984 is largely remembered for that one commercial. Few would argue that it saved Mr. Reagan from defeat by Mr. Mondale, who ultimately carried only Minnesota \u2014 his home state \u2014 and the District of Columbia. But it captivated many voters and helped push many of Mr. Reagan\u2019s problems to the periphery. In today\u2019s fractured media universe, it is unlikely that a single paid TV spot will again approach that kind of influence.MICHAEL BESCHLOSS, a presidential historian, is the author of nine books.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Clinton\u2019s Imagination Problem", "Date": "2016-05-06", "News": "Supported byIn March Hillary Clinton told a CNN interviewer, \u201cWe\u2019re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.\u201d That was a true but dumb thing to say in advance of the West Virginia primary. So this week Clinton went on an apology and listening tour through Appalachia.She heard tales of loss and renewal. Then she gave a speech proposing an agenda for the region. It was a perfectly serviceable speech. Yet you can see in it some of the reasons the Clinton campaign has not exactly caught fire.The core problem is that she sounds like a normal Democratic candidate in the noble tradition of Edmund Muskie and Hubert Humphrey, but she doesn\u2019t sound like an imaginative candidate who is responding with fresh eyes to situations today.Heavy opioid use often slides over into heroin use. Heroin overdose deaths tripled between 2009 and 2014. In those years the state had the highest drug overdose death rate in the nation.It\u2019s not surprising that there\u2019s so much drug use in towns where there\u2019s so little to do. But the root of this kind of addiction crisis is social isolation. Addiction is a disease that afflicts the lonely. It is a disease that afflicts those who have suffered trauma in childhood and beyond. And once the social fabric frays it\u2019s hard for economic recovery to begin. I ran into employers in Pittsburgh who had industrial jobs to fill but they couldn\u2019t find people who could pass the pre-employment drug test.She vowed to \u201ctake a hard look at retraining programs.\u201d She\u2019d expand tax credits to encourage investment. She\u2019d get tough on trading partners who are trying to dump cheap steel. These are the normal, sensible ideas candidates propose, but they are familiar and haven\u2019t exactly done much good.A daring approach might have been to use the speech to propose a comprehensive drug addiction and mental health agenda. That would have grabbed the attention of all those Americans whose families are touched by addiction and mental health issues \u2014 which is basically everybody.A more imaginative approach might have been to unfurl a vision to reweave social fabric, the way David Cameron has in Britain. In areas of concentrated poverty, everything is connected to everything else \u2014 job loss, family structure, alcoholism, domestic violence, neighborliness. It would be nice if America, too, had creative politicians who could put together a comprehensive agenda that nurtures social connection, rather than just relying on economic levers like job-training programs that have consistently disappointed.Place-based federal anti-poverty programs discourage mobility; if you move in search of opportunity you risk losing your benefits. The government could offer mobility grants to help people get their families from one place to another. It could set up migration zones \u2014 helping people find housing and connection in places where jobs are available.Clinton\u2019s speech was not bad by any means. But she could have offered something inspiring and audacious \u2014 to tackle mental health problems, to reweave community, to make America the daring mobile place it used to be. She could have grabbed the nation\u2019s attention.This is a country seriously off course. A little creativity is in order.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sued, Cuomo Says He Supports New York Farmworkers\u2019 Right to Organize", "Date": "2016-05-10", "News": "Supported byGov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Tuesday that he supported collective bargaining rights for the 60,000 New York farmworkers and that the state was renouncing a loophole in federal labor laws that had left farmworkers unprotected and marginalized for more than seven decades.In a statement, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, said his administration would not fight the lawsuit.\u201cBecause of a flaw in the state labor relations act, farmworkers are not afforded the right to organize without fear of retaliation \u2014 which is unacceptable,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will not tolerate the abuse or exploitation of workers in any industry. This clear and undeniable injustice must be corrected.\u201dDonna Lieberman, the executive director of the civil liberties organization, said it was now looking forward to achieving a court-ordered settlement to establish protections allowing farmworkers to organize.The right of workers to organize is enshrined in a federal law passed in 1935 known as the National Labor Relations Act.As part of a compromise to get the legislation and other key parts of the New Deal approved by Congress, President Franklin D. Roosevelt made a number of concessions. Specifically, he needed the support of a bloc of politicians from the South, where the economy was largely driven by agriculture \u2014 and where the work force was disproportionately black. An exemption carved into the labor act put its protections beyond the reach of farmworkers. To this day, farmworkers are not accorded the same federal protections as other workers.In 1938, New York amended its own Constitution to expand the rights of workers to bargain collectively.\u201cIt\u2019s a shame for New York that in 2016, a holdover, racist policy from the Jim Crow era prevents farmworkers from organizing to improve their brutal work conditions,\u201d Ms. Lieberman said. \u201cEnough is enough.\u201dThe New York Farm Bureau, an industry advocacy group, said it was reviewing the lawsuit and could not comment on it specifically, but said there were reasons farmworkers should not be allowed to bargain collectively.\u201cThe right to organize is a labor union tactic that may work in a factory setting,\u201d the group said. \u201cBut not on a farm where the planting and harvesting of crops and the milking of cows are extremely time-sensitive and weather-dependent.\u201dAfter Mr. Cuomo said he wanted to raise the minimum hourly wage to $15 gradually, Dean Norton, the president of the group, said that the \u201cdecision to not defend the state\u2019s labor law is an affront to agriculture and good farmers across the state.\u201dThe fight to expand worker protections to farmworkers in New York stretches back decades. Former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, the current governor\u2019s father, even formed a task force to study the issue and found that farmworkers were largely left to fend for themselves.\u201cRelatively defenseless and powerless, they benefit from few protective programs,\u201d the task force reported in 1991. \u201cThey typically work only part of the year and earn low annual incomes for arduous physical labor. All too many live in deplorable housing and have little recourse against those employers who are unscrupulous.\u201dThe civil liberties group argues that many of those conditions still apply.With $6.36 billion in sales in 2014, New York is one of nation\u2019s leaders in a variety of dairy and farm products. Yet the farming industry\u2019s workers are among the lowest paid in the state. The average yearly wages for farmworkers in 2015 was $28,430, according to data from the State Labor Department, about one-third less than the overall state average of $41,650.Farmworkers tend to be less likely to challenge unfair conditions, according to their advocates, because many do not speak English and fear deportation. A study by the Community and Regional Development Institute at Cornell University estimates that roughly 75 percent of farmworkers in New York are undocumented.In a statement, the owners of Marks Farms said that the complaint was inaccurate and that they would be working to set the record straight.What Mr. Hernandez wanted, according to the complaint, was a forum to discuss issues as basic as having to pay out of pocket for full-sleeve gloves to protect against chemicals.Last summer, he and other workers met with advocates for farmworkers in a trailer on the farm during nonworking hours. The police were summoned by the managers of the farm, in a clear attempt to intimidate the workers, the complaint says.On Aug. 24, Mr. Hernandez was again spotted speaking with a labor rights activist during nonworking hours.Eight days later, he was fired and given four days to move out of his home.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Canada Fire Deals Staggering Blow to Oil Sands Industry and Economy", "Date": "2016-05-11", "News": "Supported byFORT McMURRAY, Alberta \u2014 Oversize transport trailers typically barrel dangerously along Highway 63 as they deliver heavy loads of equipment and even prefabricated metal buildings to the multibillion-dollar oil sands projects that dominate this area. But more than a dozen such trailers, still full, now sit at pull-ins and rest stops, abandoned by drivers who unhitched their tractors and fled south on warnings of a devastating forest fire.As the fire ripped through Fort McMurray, oil companies severely pulled back or stopped pumping altogether. Production dropped by a million barrels a day, roughly 40 percent of Alberta\u2019s output.While the oil markets have remained relatively stable and production is slowly picking up, the economic blow is significant to a region and a country already battered by weak oil prices and uncertainty over global growth.Oil companies could take weeks or months to get fully up and running, depriving the province of Alberta of royalty payments. And rebuilding costs will add to the strain on a national government that had only recently, and perhaps not fully, recovered from a mild recession. Ultimately, the financial fallout from the fire could sap what little growth Canada was expected to eke out in the latest quarter.\u201cEverything is kind of in a state of flux,\u201d said Derek Burleton, the deputy chief economist at the Toronto-Dominion Bank. \u201cBut ultimately, it is a pretty big deal. Growth is going to fizzle out.\u201dFort McMurray, the heart of the province\u2019s oil sands production, plays an outsize role in the country\u2019s prospects.When oil prices were surging, the city and its vast reserves of oil sands fed an economic boom. Energy companies poured billions of dollars into projects and thousands of workers flowed into Fort McMurray.But the oil slump of the last year brought an end to the prosperity. Even before the fire, the government projected an $8 billion deficit, in contrast to an $800 million surplus in 2014.The damage to the oil sands industry, which makes huge payments to the provincial government, will deepen the morass. And the fire-related costs will probably be in the billions, although the federal government will eventually cover 90 percent of that amount. As a result, several economists predict that the province will slip into negative growth this quarter.\u201cThe deficit and the government\u2019s economic outlook still relies on a very bullish outlook for oil,\u201d said Andrew Leach, an economist at the University of Alberta.The national economy will feel the pain. Oil sands workers come from around the country, so the job losses often show up in other provinces. Newfoundland, for example, has an unemployment rate of 13.1 percent, sharply higher than those of Alberta and Canada.Before the fire, Canada\u2019s economy was expected to grow around 1 percent for the quarter. Zero, or even negative, growth is now a possibility, said Mr. Burleton of Toronto-Dominion Bank.The full toll will depend largely on the health of the oil sands.The largest projects, north of Fort McMurray have been largely unscathed, protected in part by their wide, deforested perimeters. And Alberta\u2019s premier, Rachel Notley, along with 12 senior oil executives, announced that production was slowly starting up again at several plants, since Fort McMurray no longer appears to be under imminent threat.But oil companies are still assessing the damage to the electrical network, the aboveground buildings and the pipelines that ship Fort McMurray\u2019s production. Then there is the complex nature of the projects, which means that oil will not necessarily start flowing again quickly.\u201cThere are a lot of challenges ahead of us,\u201d Tim McMillan, the president and chief executive of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cEach facility has its own timeline ranging from days to weeks and, potentially, beyond that.\u201dAdding to the uncertainty, many employees who were evacuated when the fire hit Fort McMurray have nowhere to live. The fire has consumed about 2,400 buildings, mostly houses. Officials will need two more weeks just to figure out when it may be possible to reopen Fort McMurray to the 88,000 residents who fled on May 3.Suncor Energy, one of the largest and earliest oil sands operators, is trying to arrange work camp accommodations for employees who have lost their houses. It evacuated about 10,000 employees.\u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t be a barrier to opening up,\u201d Steve Williams, Suncor\u2019s president and chief executive, said on Tuesday. \u201cEarly this morning I looked at my phone and we have more rooms than we needed.\u201d He added that the company would continue to pay employees whether or not they can come to work.Suncor\u2019s initial assessment, Mr. Williams said, found that the pipeline system is in good shape, since it is largely underground. But there is far more work to be done to the electrical networks.The status of smaller plants, which are largely south of the city, is less clear. That area remains under a mandatory evacuation order because of the lingering potential for renewed fire.The southern plants, for the most part, bring the tarlike bitumen of the oil sands to the surface by injecting vast quantities of steam underground. Plants of that variety, like Japan Canada Oil Sands, have been operating for several years and have built up so much heat underground they can sit idle for up to 12 months and be restarted with comparative ease.But the outlook for newer operations, like Hangingstone, a 12,000-barrel-a day project owned by Athabasca Oil, look shakier. Rob Broen, the company\u2019s president and chief executive, said that there remained a danger that its underground \u201csteam chambers\u201d might collapse if too much time passed without fresh infusions. If the bitumen in its wells has solidified, restarting the operation will be a long and costly process.The global oil markets are sensitive to that timeline.Goldman Sachs estimates that the lost production, assuming companies can ramp up production over 10 days, will total 14 million barrels. If so, that would have a relatively minor impact on North American stockpiles, which are nearly full.But not everything in those stockpiles suits the needs of American refineries that rely on heavy oil produced in the sands. If those inventories become depleted, refiners may have to look to import from elsewhere.Already, the rebuilding process is underway. On Highway 63, convoys of trucks from utilities as well as Telus, the regional telecom, have joined the columns of wildfire fighters in pickup trucks heading north.It indicates the potential for new spending to help offset some of the economic losses, at least after a while. \u201cThere\u2019s that awkward notion that disasters are ultimately a benefit in the long run,\u201d said Mr. Burleton of Toronto-Dominion Bank. \u201cThe recovery money is going to be coming in from other places.\u201dClifford Krauss contributed from Houston.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Fast Talk With New York\u2019s Fed Chief, and a View of a Steady Economy", "Date": "2016-05-09", "News": "Supported byMonetary PolicyWilliam Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, may well be the most powerful policy maker in America who is neither elected nor confirmed by Congress. Mr. Dudley serves as vice chairman of the Fed\u2019s policy-making committee, the Federal Open Market Committee, and he is the only regional reserve president who holds a permanent vote on monetary policy.The fast-paced interview has been lightly edited for clarity.Does the latest jobs report, showing the American economy added 160,000 jobs in April, fewer than expected, suggest a loss of momentum?I wouldn\u2019t make too much about the headline payroll number being a little softer, because there\u2019s other things in the report that are more positive. For example, total hours worked were up quite a bit; average hourly earnings were up quite a bit. So there\u2019s actually a lot of income being generated from the labor market. And the data on payrolls is quite volatile month to month \u2014 160,000 sounds like a lot weaker than the 200,000 people were expecting, but it\u2019s actually well within what you\u2019d expect in terms of normal volatility. It\u2019s a touch softer, maybe, than what people were expecting, but I wouldn\u2019t put a lot of weight on it in terms of how it would affect my economic outlook.You said in a speech last month that events so far this year have not shifted your economic outlook. Does that remain the case?I think the first quarter was weaker than expected, but in terms of the outlook, when I look at the fundamental forces driving the U.S. economy, I still think that they\u2019re pretty much in place.Employment is growing at a reasonable clip even with the slightly weaker payroll employment gain that we saw. Incomes are rising; wages are on a flat to maybe gently accelerating trend. So I think the fundamentals supporting consumer spending are quite good even though consumption was a little weaker in the first quarter than anticipated.Another positive is the fact that financial conditions, which had tightened very substantially in January and February, have eased considerably since that time. That provides better support for things like the housing sector. Also in terms of people looking at their balance sheets, their balance sheets look better than they did a few months ago. The fact that fiscal policy is going to be a little stimulative adds a little additional support for the economy. And while there are still a lot of question marks about the global economy, it still looks like the global economy is growing at a reasonable clip. So I think the U.S. economy is still on a decent trajectory, above-trend growth, growth that will cause the labor market to continue to tighten, which is what we would like, and I think we\u2019ll see gradual upward pressure on wages, which is desirable, and then hopefully inflation will start to track back toward our 2 percent objective.So what should we make of the ongoing divergence between the strength of job growth and the reported weakness of economic growth?Typically what happens is the labor market data tends to be the more reliable set of data, so you\u2019d expect that G.D.P. would tend to converge to the labor market, but it doesn\u2019t always have to be that way. My view is still that we\u2019re looking for 2 percent real G.D.P. growth over the next year. If that\u2019s right, the labor market should continue to improve. We should continue to see tightening of the U.S. labor market, probably a gradual acceleration in wages as the labor market gets tighter. And if that\u2019s how the economy plays out, then I think we\u2019re going to see further moves by the Fed to gradually normalize interest rates.Where do you expect your benchmark rate at the end of the year?You\u2019ve highlighted the persistence of long-term unemployment as an enduring legacy of the financial crisis. Are we making progress?The news from this latest payroll unemployment report was actually quite positive in terms of the long-term unemployed. I think what\u2019s happening is, as we\u2019ve run the labor market to a higher degree of utilization, the long-term unemployed are getting picked up and getting more employment opportunities.It is concerning that a number of indicators of inflation expectations have come down a bit, but they haven\u2019t come down that much. So the direction of travel is concerning, but the magnitude of the decline isn\u2019t that great at this point. I view it as concerning, but against that we have to weigh a number of other things in terms of inflation. One, the labor market is gradually tightening up and I think we are making progress in our objective of getting closer to full employment. Two, wage inflation looks like it\u2019s stable to gently rising. And three, if you actually look at the inflation data over the last year, despite a stronger dollar and despite lower energy prices, core inflation has been quite stable. Now it\u2019s been a bit below our 2 percent objective for the core personal consumption expenditures deflator but not that much \u2014 1.6 year over year for the core deflator isn\u2019t a big miss, especially given that there are a number of forces in play probably pushing that down. Now you look at the last couple of months, energy prices seem to have stabilized and actually increased a little bit and the dollar has actually weakened. So I\u2019m pretty confident that as long as the economy continues to grow at an above-trend pace, the labor market continues to tighten, I am reasonably confident that inflation will get back to our 2 percent objective over the medium term. So inflation expectations? It\u2019s a mild concern.What are the questions marks about global growth?We know that there are a lot of uncertainties in the world. There always are. I wouldn\u2019t want to state that this is a particularly uncertain period. But as you look at events over the last year, there are questions about Chinese growth, there are questions about Chinese currency policy. There was stress on emerging economies due to the weakness in global commodity prices. There were questions about the efficacy of negative interest rates in Europe and Japan, how effective would they be in supporting those economies. The fact is inflation, inflation expectations are still very low in a number of places around the world. A little bit low in the U.S., quite a bit low in Japan and Europe. So that\u2019s a concern that it\u2019s harder to get inflation back to central banks\u2019 objectives because inflation expectations are on the softer side of where we would like them. So there\u2019s still plenty of issues. Brexit [Britain\u2019s June referendum on continued membership in the European Union] is another issue that\u2019s on the horizon. So far if you look at the polls, if you look at the predictive markets, it looks like they\u2019re going to vote to stay as opposed to leave, but if they were to vote to leave that would probably be a market event that could actually lead to some change in financial conditions. There\u2019s always some things, but the situation today is dramatically better than it was in the first two weeks of February.Are the potential consequences of a Brexit vote sufficiently significant that you are less likely to raise rates are your next meeting, in June, so you can wait and see what happens?I think it\u2019s one more thing that\u2019s in the mix. Obviously it\u2019s going to depend on 1) An assessment of what\u2019s the economic outlook for the U.S. at the time of the meeting. 2) What\u2019s the probability of a vote to leave. 3) If there was such a vote, how much turbulence should one reasonably expect in financial markets. So it\u2019s just another variable in the mix. But what\u2019s unusual about this particular variable is we\u2019ll have a pretty good understanding on June 24 about how it plays out. That\u2019s different.If the Fed starts raising rates while other central banks are moving in the other direction, expanding their stimulus campaigns, how much does that constrain you by weighing on the domestic economy?It really depends on how the divergence feeds back into U.S. financial market conditions. The big question always when there\u2019s a divergence in monetary policy is what\u2019s the consequence for currency valuation. If the U.S. were to follow a much more aggressive, tighter monetary policy than the rest of the world, one would expect in that environment the dollar probably would appreciate. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily have to happen. There\u2019s lots of factors that affect the currency valuation.Monetary policy convergence could have consequence for financial market conditions, and if it did we\u2019d have to take that into consideration. But I don\u2019t think a priori I have a view that U.S. monetary policy can\u2019t diverge from Japan and Europe. I don\u2019t feel there\u2019s some clear constraint on the U.S.Do you think the Fed has been successful in convincing financial markets that the path of policy is data dependent?It\u2019s probably not for me to say whether we\u2019re communicating effectively. We\u2019re certainly trying to communicate clearly. The Summary of Economic Projections, where we show our short-term interest rate projections and we have the median short-term projections, I think we try to make it very clear that there\u2019s no commitment to that. That\u2019s just the current expectation based on what we know at the time of that particular meeting. So at the time of the December meeting, the median expectation was four rate hikes in 2016. And by the time we got to the March meeting, the situation had changed, at least in the minds of many F.O.M.C. participants, and so the median expectation was two rate hikes. I think people should understand that as economic circumstances change our expectations about what we\u2019re going to do are going to change. It\u2019s just what we think we\u2019re most likely to do at that moment based upon the information we have in hand at that moment in time. But if the information changes, and that affects the economic outlook, then our view of how much monetary policy accommodation is appropriate will change.The market fixates on the median because that\u2019s a summary statistic, but all that is is an expectation at that particular moment in time based on the available information. If the information changes, then people\u2019s expectation about what is appropriate is going to change. In my mind there\u2019s no commitment whatsoever in the dot plot.But last year the Fed seemed perfectly happy to use those same projections as a kind of forward guidance about how long it was likely to keep interest rates near zero. I think forward guidance was an important tool of policy when we were at the zero lower bound for interest rates. Because there\u2019s a question of, if the economy is weak, how can I actually add additional monetary policy accommodation? One way you can do that is you can commit to keep short-term interest rates low into the future \u2014 that can affect long-term interest rates and that can provide stimulus to things like mortgage rates, support the housing sector. So at the zero lower bound that makes a lot of sense.And now?One of the challenges that we face is that we are transitioning from a period where there was forward guidance to a period where there\u2019s in my mind not much forward guidance any longer. I think the only forward guidance we\u2019re giving right now is very, very soft. It\u2019s just the notion that we expect the rate path is likely to be quite gradual, but even that is not a commitment, that\u2019s just our expectation. And I think the market is having trouble adjusting to that fact that after years of having forward guidance, they don\u2019t have forward guidance any longer. So how the economic information unfolds and how that affects the outlook for economic activity, for the labor market, for inflation, that then will drive the monetary policy decisions. So the challenge is for the Federal Reserve to get the markets to think right along with us so as the economic information comes out they revise their expectations about what we\u2019re likely to do as we do in reaction to the economic information.Do you think you\u2019ve contributed to the confusion by using the same tools to communicate a different message?It\u2019s on us to communicate it as effectively as possible, and I think we\u2019re trying to do that. The Federal Reserve today is much more transparent than it was even seven or eight years ago in terms of statements, press conferences, testimony, interviews like this one. So I think we\u2019re trying to communicate as clearly as possible. Unfortunately the world is uncertain, the outlook changes in relationship to a lot of developments that are hard to anticipate, and so the world is a little bit messier than what we would like it to be, but that\u2019s the world we live in.Does it bother you that investors discount the possibility of policy moves at meetings with no scheduled news conference?I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a real problem, because if there was some compelling reason to raise interest rates at a meeting, we would do so regardless of whether there was a press conference or there wasn\u2019t a press conference scheduled at the meeting. In the current environment, with the economy growing slowly and inflation below our objective, slow and gradual seems like an appropriate monetary policy regime in that environment. So if you wait a meeting, it doesn\u2019t have much consequence. But I think if there was a reason to move at a non-press-conference meeting we absolutely would.After almost eight years of low rates, do you see signs of dangerous distortions in financial markets or in the broader economy?We look at this very carefully. Financial stability is definitely a part of how we think about monetary policy now, much more so than before the financial crisis, because without financial stability you can\u2019t actually have an effective monetary policy over time. The two are pretty much joined at the hip. So of course looking for places where there might be excesses in terms of financial markets are important because that creates potential vulnerabilities in terms of future financial stability.I would say at this point I don\u2019t see a lot of things that disturb me. The things that would disturb me would be things that are very excessive in terms of valuation and very large in terms of the weight that they carry for the economy. If you think back to the financial crisis, you had a big bubble for the U.S. housing sector which was very large and affects lots of people, so that was a huge bubble in terms of the consequences for the economy. Obviously it was magnified by the fact that there were structural weaknesses in the financial system that, rather than dampen the impact of the decline in housing, actually tended to amplify it. I don\u2019t see anything like that today. There are some areas you might point to and say that those look excessive, but some of the areas you might have pointed to six months ago, they\u2019ve actually sort of self-corrected.Some people see a new structural weakness in the post-crisis decline in the liquidity of financial markets. Do you share that concern?The fact is, liquidity was probably underpriced in 2004 and 2005. It\u2019s certainly appropriate that we\u2019ve raised capital and liquidity standards for major and systemically important firms, and if that has had some consequence on market liquidity that may be a very appropriate price to pay for having a more stable financial system.Unfortunately there\u2019s a lot more work we need to do on this market liquidity issue. We don\u2019t have good data on this, for example in the Treasury market, on dealer-to-customer interactions. We just need to do a lot more work on this to understand how much market liquidity changed, what are the factors driving it, how much of a role if any has regulation played and is there something we need to do about it.I personally think people are perhaps a little overly concerned about changes in market liquidity in terms of their consequences for the macro-economy. At the end of the day, if liquidity is a little more expensive but the financial system is a little more stable, the benefits on the financial stability side are probably much more important than the fact that market liquidity might be a little more expensive.Another possible weakness you raised recently is that the Fed remains constrained in its ability to lend to securities firms.Do you expect to normalize interest rates before the next recession?I don\u2019t have a strong view of how likely or unlikely that is. I don\u2019t think the risk of a U.S. recession right now is high. There\u2019s not a lot of imbalances in the U.S. economy in terms of leverage build-up; monetary policy is quite accommodative; fiscal policy this year is stimulative. The consumer is in good shape with rising payroll employment and rising household income. I don\u2019t see a lot of recession risk over the near term. That said, things could change.The idea that the expansion is long-lived, a pretty long expansion by historical standards, I don\u2019t think that tells you anything about how much longer it\u2019s going to last. If you look at economic expansions historically, they don\u2019t die of old age. They die for two reasons. One, because the Fed tightens monetary policy because there\u2019s a potential inflation problem. That\u2019s obviously not going to happen over the near term, at least on purpose, because we don\u2019t have an inflation problem, so why would the Federal Reserve be forced to act and tighten policy in such a manner? The second way is a large adverse shock, something that happens to the U.S. economy that\u2019s unanticipated or it could be an external shock. That\u2019s a harder thing to forecast. There\u2019s always a risk of a shock that could push us into a recession. But in the current environment, given that the monetary policy one doesn\u2019t seem to be a big risk, in my own mind the overall risk is quite low.Are you concerned about the Fed\u2019s ability to deal with a shock, given that rates remain so low?I think we have quite a bit of ammunition. In some ways we have more ammunition that we had 10 years ago because we\u2019ve developed new tools that we actually know are effective. We could lower short-term interest rates. We could engage in additional quantitative easing, we could extend the duration of our portfolio, we could go back to forward guidance and make commitments about the path of short-term rates. In some ways we\u2019re in better shape because we actually have tools that we know are effective and we have a monetary policy regime that we shown is very workable even with a very large balance sheet.You didn\u2019t mention negative interest rates.I would never say never to any potential policy tool. But when the U.S. economy was weak several years ago and we were far away from our unemployment and inflation objectives, we did not pursue a negative-rate policy, so I would take some signal from that. I think there are questions about the net positives and benefits of negative short-term interest rates. Clearly it can make financial conditions more accommodative, but also it has consequences potentially for bank profitability, and I think households wonder about what kind of a regime we\u2019re in if we\u2019re in a regime of negative interest rates. We also have a very large money market, which also raises questions about how well it would work in the United States.This is not something I\u2019m spending any time thinking about, and it\u2019s not something I contemplate doing now or in the future. But at the same time it would be crazy to say I\u2019m going to rule out categorically a whole set of policy tools. It depends on the circumstances.Is it possible that we\u2019re trapped in a world of low interest rates?Anything is possible, but let\u2019s look at how the U.S. economy is performing: If the economy is growing at an above-trend pace, and job gains are sufficient to tighten the labor market, then one would certainly expect that that would be consistent with monetary policy normalization over time. I think the issue that arises in the current environment is, if the economy is growing just a little bit above trend, not a lot above trend, and we\u2019re not really certain where the full employment rate is \u2014 we\u2019re approaching the full employment rate at a very shallow angle of attack. That means that small changes in the growth rate, small changes in what we see in terms of how the labor market is translating in terms of wages, can affect the timing of monetary policy by several months. But I think the general story of the economy over the last few years is very much intact. So I think I\u2019m not that worried about the issue that we\u2019re not going to succeed in our objectives. I think we\u2019re still on track.Why have we not seen overheating?I think there are residual headwinds from the financial crisis that affect the appetite for people to take on debt, for example. There\u2019s headwinds from the financial crisis that affect the extension of credit to borrowers in the housing sector. For example, prior to the crisis your credit score didn\u2019t seem to have much consequence for your ability to get mortgage credit, but now there\u2019s a really strong bifurcation of the mortgage market by credit score.Also I think that the demographics of the U.S. economy are changing and we\u2019re getting older. That may also be a factor.And of course we exist in a global world and the rest of the world has been growing more slowly than what it was 10 to 15 years ago. And that has a consequence for us.How about the local economy? You\u2019ve said that New York is doing pretty well; some of its suburbs less so. Younger people really seem to like to live in urban centers, and New York City is a great city. It\u2019s a huge magnet for people to come to live and work, and the suburbs of New York just don\u2019t have that same degree of attraction. You see this around the whole country. There\u2019s a lot of economic development going on in city centers. There does seem to be a shift in taste in terms of where people want to live and work. It disadvantages the New York City suburbs a bit. That said, the suburbs do benefit by the vitality of New York. Many, many people, myself included, commute from the suburbs.The Fed in general, the New York Fed in particular, and Bill Dudley, by name, are often accused of focusing too much on Wall Street and not enough on Main Street.We absolutely care about Main Street. That\u2019s the whole goal of policy is maximum sustainable employment and price stability. There\u2019s absolutely nothing about the stock market, there\u2019s nothing about Wall Street in our dual mandate. The reason why financial markets matter is because they are our transmission mechanism for how monetary policy affects the economy. If credit spreads widen dramatically, if mortgage rates go up, if the stock market plummets, that will have real consequences for household and business spending that will affect real G.D.P. growth, that will feed into the labor market and inflation. I\u2019m never in my mind targeting a given level of any financial market. I\u2019m looking at financial conditions broadly and asking myself the question, \u201cAre they broadly consistent with the objectives that I want to achieve in terms of employment and inflation?\u201dYou worked at Goldman Sachs before you joined the Fed, and this is often cited as evidence that your sympathies are with Wall Street.I can\u2019t wipe out my employment history. But I know through my actions \u2014 the monetary policy decisions that I\u2019ve voted on and the commitment I think I\u2019ve shown to the community in terms of spending a lot of time traveling around the New York district and trying to really understand what\u2019s happening on the ground, on Main Street \u2014 hopefully deeds speak more powerfully than words and I hope people judge me on my actions and I hope my actions are very much consistent with the view that I care completely about Main Street.There is a lot of talk lately about whether the Federal Reserve\u2019s structure should be changed to increase its accountability. Some people would also like to change the Fed\u2019s mandate. Do you see any merit in the view that things aren\u2019t working as well as they could?The structure of the Federal Reserve is very much consistent with the way the whole country is set up, in terms of the federalized structure. As time has passed, that structure of the Federal Reserve has evolved, often in response to financial crises. I think that it\u2019s always appropriate to ask yourself the question: Could the Fed be structured in a different way so it could do its job better? But I think people should actually be asking themselves a slightly different question: How is the Fed actually doing its job today? Are we actually making progress toward our dual mandate objectives? What is the unemployment rate in the U.S. relative to full employment? It\u2019s pretty close. Where is inflation in the U.S. relative to our 2 percent objective? It\u2019s pretty close. Things aren\u2019t perfect. I would have liked a stronger recovery. I would have liked if we\u2019d gotten here a lot sooner. I would like the long-term unemployed to be employed a lot sooner. But we\u2019re making progress on our mission. If you look at how the Fed has actually behaved over the last few years, I would not want to trade places with a lot of other countries around the world.The second thing I would say, it\u2019s very, very important that any changes that are made to the Federal Reserve are made to make the Fed function better, not because we\u2019re unhappy about how the financial crisis played out. I completely understand why people are unhappy about the financial crisis. As I\u2019ve said many times, there\u2019s something fundamentally unfair about the fact that large firms had to be rescued to prevent the financial system from collapsing as people lost their homes and jobs. There\u2019s something totally unfair about that. However, the consequence of letting those large financial firms fail would have been worse for everybody. I\u2019m absolutely convinced that we would have had a global depression. But it\u2019s really important not to let that unfairness lead to a response that could potentially hamstring the Fed in terms of its ability to achieve its objectives. I just ask that people ask themselves the question, how is the Federal Reserve actually performing in its mission?Why has the U.S. bounced back from the crisis more quickly than Europe or Japan?I think it\u2019s hard to say. We have quite a different financial system, much more dependent on the capital markets and less on the banking system. That may have caused us to have a lot more pain early, but then a recovery sooner.The fact that we were very aggressive in recapitalizing our banks early I think was important. We got the banks in a much better place of health sooner than many other countries.We also have a more flexible economy. In the United States I think it\u2019s much easier for resources to flow from one use to another pretty quickly, and so if there are mistakes that are made in terms of the allocation of resources those mistakes get corrected quite quickly.And I think the Fed probably had a role. I wouldn\u2019t want to overstate our role, but we were very aggressive in terms of monetary policy. Coming out of the financial crisis, we were very concerned about the U.S. ending up in a situation where inflation expectations ended up anchored to the downside, that they could be come trapped at the zero lower bound and monetary policy could lose its effectiveness. To guard against that risk, we were very aggressive in terms of how we pursued monetary policy through the financial crisis and in the aftermath. I think there are a lot of factors and I like to think the Federal Reserve played its part.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saudi King Shakes Up Government as Economic Plan Moves Forward", "Date": "2016-05-07", "News": "Supported byRIYADH, Saudi Arabia \u2014 Troubled by low oil prices and unsettled by a hostile landscape in the Middle East heightened by a growing rivalry with Iran, Saudi Arabia is moving to chart an ambitious new direction for the kingdom.In a series of sweeping royal decrees announced Saturday, King Salman replaced top ministers and restructured government bodies, the first concrete steps in a bold plan to reduce the country\u2019s heavy dependence on oil, diversify its economy and improve its citizens\u2019 quality of life.The decrees, which included a restructuring of the oil ministry and the replacement of its longtime minister, Ali al-Naimi, set in motion a plan that was announced last month to great fanfare by the king\u2019s son Mohammed bin Salman, the deputy crown prince. Prince Mohammed has emerged over the last year as a significant influence in Saudi Arabia, overseeing economic and oil policy and heading the Defense Ministry, despite being only about 30.The moves announced Saturday amount to a significant restructuring of the government at a difficult time for the kingdom. The regional order over which Saudi Arabia has long prevailed is in tatters, with wars raging in Iraq, Syria and Yemen, and with its regional nemesis, Iran, extending its influence. Those stresses come as low oil prices have shaken the Saudi economy, causing the government to run huge budget deficits and leaving government contractors falling behind in paying salaries.\u201cWhat you are seeing in Saudi Arabia is a genuine need for reform that is felt at the very top of the ruling establishment,\u201d said Adeel Malik, the Globe fellow in the economies of Muslim societies at Oxford University. \u201cYou can clearly see that there is fire under the seats of the rulers.\u201dThe rise of Prince Mohammed has effectively overturned decades of cautious Saudi policy traditionally overseen by senior princes, many of whom have found themselves sidelined by a man who is decades younger. While some grumble privately, Prince Mohammed has forged ahead with a clear mandate from King Salman, who also put him second in line to the throne, after Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, the interior minister.Prince Mohammed bin Salman was the driving force behind the country\u2019s new development plan, Saudi Vision 2030, which many Saudis have lauded as a powerful statement of purpose from a royal family that has often failed to communicate its plans or do much to prepare for the future. But analysts and economists have questioned the ability of Saudi Arabia\u2019s bloated bureaucracy and unproductive native work force to meet the plan\u2019s aggressive targets.Many of the changes announced Saturday were aimed at restructuring the government so it would work toward the plan\u2019s goals.These included the replacement of the country\u2019s long-serving oil minister, Mr. Naimi, who is 80 and had held the position since 1995. Mr. Naimi\u2019s oversight of oil policy for the kingdom, the world\u2019s largest oil exporter, had made him a towering figure whose mere utterances were closely scrutinized by traders seeking to divine the country\u2019s thinking.The decline in oil prices, which began in mid-2014, led Mr. Naimi to champion the Saudi strategy of maintaining production levels to preserve market share and undermine higher-cost producers like the United States. While the approach has largely worked, it has also contributed to an oil glut that has kept prices low, analysts say.Mr. Naimi has long been essential to the royal family\u2019s policy of using the country\u2019s oil wealth to finance government social policy \u2014 a tradition Prince Mohammed wants to move away from through widespread privatization.Although Mr. Naimi had long expressed a wish to retire, the suddenness of his exit struck some foreign analysts as a sign that Prince Mohammed was flexing his muscles.\u201cTo essentially drop him in a cabinet reshuffle rather than celebrate his retirement was pretty rude, even by Saudi standards,\u201d said David L. Goldwyn, who was a senior energy official in the State Department during the first Obama administration. \u201cThe way he left is a sign of Mohammed bin Salman making clear that he is directing the appointment of important positions.\u201dMr. Naimi was named an adviser to the royal court and was replaced by a younger official, Khalid al-Falih, who had previously run the Health Ministry and served as the chairman of Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil company.Some energy experts viewed the appointment of Mr. Falih as a signal to both the Saudi power structure and international oil markets that Prince Mohammed was pushing forward with plans to transform Saudi Aramco into an energy conglomerate that could invest in projects with less interference from the royal family.In the announcement on Saturday, the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources was renamed the Ministry of Energy, Industry and Natural Resources, a semantic shift meant to indicate the country\u2019s commitment to diversifying away from oil.Most energy experts said they did not see Mr. Naimi\u2019s departure as a sign that oil policy would soon change, especially with prices gradually rising and Saudi leaders refusing to endorse production limits unless Iran does as well.\u201cThe Saudis sneeze and the oil market catches a cold, but I think it\u2019s going to turn out not to mean much,\u201d said Michael Lynch, the president of the consultancy Strategic Energy and Economic Research, who has been an adviser to OPEC. \u201cBy picking Khalid al-Falih, it doesn\u2019t seem like this means a radical change.\u201dOther decrees announced on Saturday changed the head of the central bank, renamed and combined ministries, and put new officials in charge of water, commerce, social affairs, health and transport.\u201cAll these measures were ultimately aimed at making government more efficient and more accountable, reducing red tape,\u201d said Fahad Nazer, a senior political analyst at JTG Inc., a consulting firm based in Vienna, Va. \u201cThey are clearly meant to help in terms of implementing the vision going forward.\u201dNone of the decrees addressed the country\u2019s political structure, and missing from Prince Mohammed\u2019s vision were any moves toward allowing Saudis a role in choosing their rulers. None of the newly appointed officials were women.Other changes were in line with goals articulated in the new vision.The Ministry of Hajj, an important body in a country that derives much of its international standing from its management of Islam\u2019s holiest sites, was changed to the Ministry of Hajj and Umra. While the Hajj pilgrimage happens once a year, the Umra pilgrimage can be done year round, and Prince Mohammed has spoken of raising the number of Umra visitors as a source of unexploited income. The body\u2019s minister was also replaced.Many among Saudi Arabia\u2019s large population of young people \u2014 more than two-thirds of the country\u2019s 20 million citizens are under 30 \u2014 speculated on social media, often with sarcasm, about the duties of the newly created General Authority for Entertainment, a surprising body in a hyperconservative country where public movie theaters are banned and many people flee abroad for vacations and weekends.Prince Mohammed has spoken about the importance of providing Saudis with more ways to enjoy life in their country, although it remains to be seen what new options will be provided under the new plan.Follow Ben Hubbard on Twitter @NYTBen.Follow Ben Hubbard on Twitter @NYTBen.Clifford Krauss reported from Houston.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Trips to Capitol Hill Years Ago Foretold Themes of Campaign", "Date": "2016-05-11", "News": "Supported byDonald J. Trump boasted of his business success. He railed against political correctness. He insisted his opponents could not handle \u201cthe tough guys, the bad guys\u201d the way he could.Oh, and one other thing.\u201cThey don\u2019t look like Indians to me,\u201d Mr. Trump said of the Mashantucket Pequot tribe, stunning a packed congressional hearing room by assailing the operators of the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut. \u201cThey don\u2019t look like Indians.\u201dBut in that episode and several others since the 1980s, Mr. Trump\u2019s navigation of Washington\u2019s corridors of power appears all too familiar in hindsight \u2014 fusing showmanship, a reductive approach to ethnicity, shape-shifting policy rationales and gleeful name-dropping into the political currency required to get what he wanted, or at least make headlines trying.As he sets off on a round of meetings this week to announce himself as the town\u2019s new Republican standard-bearer \u2014 most notably a sit-down scheduled for Thursday with the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan \u2014 Mr. Trump can draw on decades of intermittent, but memorable, experiences.He is no Jimmy Stewart, wide-eyed and reform-minded. But not infrequently, Mr. Trump goes to Washington, making the short flight by jet to advance his business enterprises, hold forth on economics and charm lawmakers \u2014 including some future supporters, like Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, who seemed tickled by his visit in 2005.\u201cI want to thank you for your courage,\u201d Mr. Sessions told him, after Mr. Trump\u2019s swaggering testimony about proposed renovations to the United Nations headquarters in New York. (In critiquing the United Nations before Mr. Sessions and other Republicans, he was preaching to the choir.)In large measure, despite his self-styled reputation as a political outsider, Mr. Trump seems to have had little trouble fitting in \u2014 less a bull in a china shop than a New Yorker briefly on the wrong end of the Acela corridor.John A. Boehner, the former House speaker, became a golfing buddy. Lobbyists counted Mr. Trump as a client. And lawmakers came to recognize his tactics and recurring themes.Donald J. Trump is set to be the Republican standard-bearer, but when it comes to some of his policies, he is out of sync with many Republican leaders in Congress.During his stops on Capitol Hill, he foretold several campaign motifs: a frustration with the pace of government, scattershot policy prescriptions, predictions of impending doom.Before a House panel on the credit shortage in November 1991, Mr. Trump seemed irritated at times, calling changes in the tax code a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d for real estate entrepreneurs and offering a bleak assessment of the economy and its stewards in Washington.\u201cI truly feel that this country right now is in a depression,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not a recession. People are kidding themselves if they think it is a recession.\u201d (The recession had actually ended the previous March.)Mr. Trump presented suggestions, including a tax increase on the wealthy to encourage investment.\u201cFor high-income people, it should be raised substantially with the understanding that if you invest, you can get it down, and down substantially,\u201d he said. \u201cThe incentive was taken away when the tax rates came down for high-income people.\u201dAnd in a flourish that has earned Mr. Trump some scorn from conservatives recently, he was critical of Reagan-era tax reforms, at one point suggesting the United States was \u201cno different than the Soviet Union.\u201dLawmakers have grappled with whether or not to support the presumptive nominee.\u201cThey have no incentive, and we have no incentive,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if something isn\u2019t done to quickly put the incentive back, this country is going to be in very deep problems. It already is, but it\u2019s going to get far worse.\u201dMr. Trump and his ambitions were discussed from time to time by presidential aides as far back as the Reagan administration, and records show that he attended some White House events, though not frequently or recently. He attended a state dinner for King Fahd of Saudi Arabia in 1985 with his wife at the time, Ivana.The next year, records from the Reagan Presidential Library show, Mr. Trump invited Nancy Reagan to be his guest at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. (She politely declined.)Mr. Trump was not shy about traveling to Washington to advance his own business interests.In 1985, Mr. Trump, as an owner of the United States Football League\u2019s New Jersey Generals, testified on the regulation of the National Football League, which he referred to as a \u201cgreat monopoly.\u201d (The U.S.F.L., which would soon disappear, had filed an antitrust lawsuit against the N.F.L.)As his testimony wore on, Mr. Trump seemed to recognize the frivolousness of turning to Washington over a sports matter. \u201cWith all of the problems of the country, it does seem strange that we are sitting here this morning talking about football,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the fact is, it is something somewhat close to my heart.\u201dCurrent polls show an uphill battle for Donald Trump should he and Hillary Clinton face off in the general election.Mr. Trump\u2019s 1993 appearance before the House Subcommittee on Native American Affairs was perhaps his most memorable.An overflow crowd packed Room 1324 of the Longworth House Office Building, eager to take in a celebrity\u2019s testimony. By the end, Mr. Trump had accused the committee chairman of having a \u201ctotally closed mind,\u201d predicted \u201cone of the biggest scandals since Al Capone\u201d and ridiculed those who he said had played down the threat of organized crime in tribal gambling.\u201cThat an Indian chief is going to tell Joey Killer to please get off his reservation is almost unbelievable to me,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Yet at other times, Mr. Trump preferred to keep his distance, dispatching others to operate on his behalf during Beltway casino disputes.One lobbyist, Ronald Platt, who worked for Mr. Trump about 15 years ago on a tribal gambling matter, said he had been owed thousands of dollars in outstanding bills. Mr. Trump would not pay, Mr. Platt recalled in an interview. So he traveled to New York to collect.Mr. Trump, he said, was not pleased to see him. \u201cIt is so prestigious down in Washington to represent me that you ought to be willing to do it for free,\u201d Mr. Trump said, according to Mr. Platt.Mr. Platt replied with a profanity, he said, and Mr. Trump stormed out of the room.Eventually, Mr. Platt said, he got his check.Mr. Trump described the proceedings differently.\u201cI have no idea who he is,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a statement emailed by an aide, \u201cbut if I held back payment, it was probably because he did a lousy job.\u201dJeremy Merrill contributed reporting, and Kitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton Mocks Donald Trump Over Not Releasing Tax Returns", "Date": "2016-05-11", "News": "Supported byBLACKWOOD, N.J. \u2014 Hillary Clinton on Wednesday mocked Donald J. Trump as evasive and secretive after he suggested that he would not release his tax returns before the November election, which would be a break with 40 years of political precedent.But Mr. Trump quickly hit back, saying that he still intended to release his tax returns as soon as a federal audit was completed \u2014 and that Mrs. Clinton was hitting him out of desperation.Mrs. Clinton, at a rally here to open her campaign for the New Jersey primary on June 7, had just begun attacking Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed tax cuts for wealthy Americans when a man in the audience called out, \u201cWhat about his tax returns?\u201dMrs. Clinton, who often ignores catcalls, smiled and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll get to that.\u201dMoments later she urged the man and other voters to keep asking to see Mr. Trump\u2019s tax filings and indicated that her campaign would make them an issue in the general election, saying, \u201cWe\u2019ll get around to that, too.\u201dCurrent polls show an uphill battle for Donald Trump should he and Hillary Clinton face off in the general election.\u201cSo you\u2019ve got to ask yourself, why doesn\u2019t he want to release them?\u201d Mrs. Clinton said with a slightly dark edge to her voice. \u201cYeah, well, we\u2019re going to find out.\u201dThe tax filings are a ripe target for the Clinton campaign given that Mr. Trump has been portraying her as the candidate with something to hide, attacking her for using a private email server as secretary of state and earning millions of dollars for paid speeches that have not been made public.Clinton advisers have also been seeking fresh lines of attack on Mr. Trump\u2019s character, given that he has begun criticizing Mrs. Clinton as an \u201cenabler\u201d of Mr. Clinton\u2019s extramarital behavior. By seizing on the tax issue, rather than responding directly to Mr. Trump\u2019s broadsides, the Clinton campaign could undermine Mr. Trump\u2019s attempt to sit in judgment of the character and transparency of the Clintons.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to learn from them,\u201d Mr. Trump told The A.P., explaining that he did not think voters were particularly interested in the contents of his returns.Donald J. Trump is set to be the Republican standard-bearer, but when it comes to some of his policies, he is out of sync with many Republican leaders in Congress.Mr. Trump, in a telephone interview later on Wednesday, said he was following legal advice by not releasing his tax returns until the \u201cvery unfair government audit\u201d was complete.\u201cI will release them as soon as the audit is done. I hope that\u2019s soon,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d like to do it before the election.\u201dMr. Trump added that he thought Mrs. Clinton was attacking him because she was struggling to win over voters and beat Senator Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nomination.Dr. Thorndike noted that President Richard M. Nixon released his tax returns while he was under audit, starting the tradition of presidential candidates making their returns public.Lawmakers have grappled with whether or not to support the presumptive nominee.\u201cI think 40 years of tradition carries real moral and ethical weight,\u201d Dr. Thorndike said. \u201cIt is quite striking that a major candidate would decide not to release their tax information \u2014 especially someone with an admittedly complex tax situation.\u201dAmong the most prominent people to call on Mr. Trump to release his returns this year has been Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, who did not want to release his tax returns but finally relented under pressure. One of the people who encouraged him to do so was Mr. Trump, who said that Mr. Romney should be proud of his wealth and not hold back his financial information.At her New Jersey rally, Mrs. Clinton highlighted Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns to reinforce a broader point about his approach to taxation, portraying him as a billionaire businessman who was concerned only with his own interests and those of fellow wealthy Americans.She said that his tax plan \u2014 which envisions a top tax rate of 25 percent, compared with the current maximum rate of 39.6 percent \u2014 would provide $3 trillion in tax relief to millionaires and billionaires over the next decade, a figure that her campaign attributed to an analyst at a left-leaning think tank. She also cited studies showing that the plan would add $34 trillion to the national debt over 20 years.\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s tax plan was written by a billionaire for billionaires,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said, adding that $3 trillion would be \u201cenough money to make Social Security and Medicare solvent for the next 75 years.\u201dMrs. Clinton was blunt about her own tax plans, noting that she would target the wealthy and rule out any tax increases on middle-class Americans.\u201cI do want to raise rich people\u2019s taxes because they have benefited the most from the economy in the last 15 years,\u201d she said to cheers from several hundred union workers, college students, professors and others gathered in a gym at Camden County College. \u201cIt\u2019s time they paid their fair share for America\u2019s prosperity and our success.\u201dPatrick Healy reported from Blackwood, and Alan Rappeport from Washington.Advertisement"}

Oettinger, the European commissioner in charge of the digital economy, said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cWith these new rules, we will uphold media pluralism.\u201dSuch rules already exist for traditional broadcasters, like the BBC in Britain and the TF1 Group in France. On average, they pay the equivalent of millions of dollars each year, or roughly 20 percent of their annual revenue in the countries where they operate, to support local content.European policy makers said that online streaming rivals currently invested only around 1 percent of their annual revenue in local content. Netflix has been able to sidestep existing funding rules, most notably in France, because the company\u2019s European headquarters are in the Netherlands.Streaming services will also be required to ensure that at least 20 percent of their online content is from Europe, and that those movies and television programs are given prominence in their digital catalogs. A report funded by the European Commission recently found that both Netflix and Apple already met this requirement.The commission\u2019s digital plans are subject to the approval of the European Parliament and individual member states, a lengthy process that could lead to significant changes.Europe\u2019s proposals on digital services are only the beginning.The European Commission said on Wednesday that it would also propose new copyright rules in the fall that could force companies like Google to pay online publishers when using their content, including in its news aggregation service Google News.Officials also said that they were still reviewing potential new rules to control how so-called online platforms like Facebook and Amazon operate in the 28-member bloc.European officials said they were looking into making it easier for people to move their digital information between online platforms by the end of the year, giving them greater control over data that companies collected on their daily digital lives.\u201cI want online platforms and the audiovisual and creative sectors to be powerhouses in the digital economy,\u201d said Andrus Ansip, the European Commission vice president in charge of the region\u2019s digital single market proposals. \u201cThey need the certainty of a modern and fair legal environment: That is what we are providing today.\u201dAdvertisement"}

His criticism, as Winston Churchill might say, was not agreeable. But it called necessary attention to unhealthy developments in the Democratic Party, including its at-times obliviousness to the lingering economic pain of the middle class and the young, and its drift toward political caution over aspiration.To this day, Mr. Sanders\u2019s rallies are lit up by people who say he is the candidate most focused on their struggle for jobs, better health care and debt relief, and most interested in taking action against those who profited while wages for the working class stagnated and their hopes diminished.Mr. Sanders\u2019s unwillingness to compromise has contributed to a thin record of accomplishment over his decades in Congress. While Mrs. Clinton outflanks him on both knowledge and practice of foreign policy, on domestic policy he has forced her to address the impact of trade deals and globalization, spell out her stances on clean energy and oil and gas exploration, and put more meat on her plans for college affordability. He\u2019s exposed her failure to support $15 an hour as a federal minimum wage, and rightly called her out on the Wall Street speeches that earned her millions and her refusal to make the transcripts public.Unlike the voices on the Republican side, Mr. Sanders\u2019s has elevated this campaign.

{"Headline": "Behind the Barricades of Turkey\u2019s Hidden War", "Date": "2016-05-24", "News": "FeatureA simmering conflict with the Kurds threatens to consume an American ally and inflame an already unstable region.Supported bySome who stood on the roadside that day have told me it changed their lives. The battle against the Islamic State had made the downtrodden Kurds into heroes. In the weeks and months that followed, the Kurds watched in amazement as fighters aligned with the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or P.K.K. \u2014 long branded a terrorist group by Turkey and the United States \u2014 became the central protagonists in the defense of Kobani. The P.K.K.\u2019s Syrian affiliate worked closely with the American military, identifying ISIS targets for airstrikes.By the time ISIS withdrew from Kobani in January 2015, the Kurdish militants had paid a heavy price in blood. But they gained admirers all over the world. The Pentagon, impressed by their skill at guerrilla warfare, saw an essential new ally against ISIS. There was renewed talk in Europe of removing the P.K.K. from terrorism lists, often in news articles accompanied by images of beautiful female Kurdish soldiers in combat gear. For many Turkish Kurds, the lesson was unmistakable: Their time had come. I met a 27-year-old P.K.K. activist in Turkey, who asked not to be named, fearing reprisals from the government, and who first went to Kobani in 2012, when the Kurds began carving out a state for themselves in Syria called Rojava. \u201cI remember talking to P.K.K. fighters, and I thought, They\u2019re crazy to think they can do this,\u201d she said. \u201cNow I look back and think, If they can do it there, we can do it here.\u201dNineteen months after that convoy passed, the feelings it inspired have helped to start a renewed war between Turkey and its Kurdish rebels. Turkish tanks are now blasting the ancient cities of the Kurdish southeast, where young P.K.K.-supported rebels have built barricades and declared \u201cliberated zones.\u201d More than a thousand people have been killed and as many as 350,000 displaced, according to figures from the International Crisis Group. The fighting, which intensified last fall, has spread to Ankara, the Turkish capital, where two suicide bombings by Kurdish militants in February and March killed 66 people. Another sharp escalation came in mid-May, when P.K.K. supporters released a video online seeming to show one of the group\u2019s fighters bringing down a Turkish attack helicopter with a shoulder-fired missile, a weapon to which the Kurds have rarely had access. Yet much of the violence has been hidden from public view by state censorship and military \u201ccurfews\u201d \u2014 a government word that scarcely conveys the reality of tanks encircling a Kurdish town and drilling it with shellfire for weeks or months on end.The conflict has revived and in some ways exceeded the worst days of the P.K.K.\u2019s war with the Turkish state in the 1990s. The fighting then was brutal, but it was mostly confined to remote mountains and villages. Now it is devastating cities as well and threatening to cripple an economy already burdened by ISIS bombings and waves of refugees from Syria. In Diyarbakir, the capital of a largely Kurdish province, artillery and bombs have destroyed much of the historic district, which contains Unesco world heritage sites. Churches, mosques and khans that have stood for centuries lie in ruins. Tourism has collapsed. Images of shattered houses and dead children are stirring outrage in other countries where Kurds live: Iraq, Syria and Iran.This war, unlike earlier chapters in the centuries-old Kurdish struggle, is also creating a painful dilemma for the United States. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey is furious about American support for the P.Y.D., a leading Kurdish party in Rojava, which the Erdogan government considers a P.K.K. front. The White House says it has little choice: Erdogan has offered limited help in the fight against ISIS, despite years of American lobbying. That has pushed the United States to rely more and more on the P.Y.D., which it views as distinct from the P.K.K. American Special Operations troops now arm, equip and advise these Kurdish fighters, even as Turkey shells their bases farther west \u2014 and pays Islamist militias to attack them. As the war in Turkey grinds on, the United States is confronting a perilous sideshow that has begun to drain the energy and attention of the two allies it needs most. If it continues to spread, it could be worse than a distraction. As one Obama administration official put it to me: \u201cPost-Paris, post-Brussels, we have to clear ISIS out. If it turns out that the coalition can\u2019t operate in that space\u201d \u2014 because of Turkey\u2019s conflict with the Kurds \u2014 \u201cthen we have a serious problem.\u201dI entered in early March with the help of a local activist, who acted as a translator and guided me as we drove along a winding road on the edge of town. We had to carefully avoid army and police checkpoints; journalists are strictly barred by the Turkish government from reporting on the insurgency, and even the mildest expression of sympathy for the rebels can earn a prison sentence. As a result, what has happened behind the barricades and under \u201ccurfew\u201d has gone largely unreported.We stopped near a bridge over a shallow creek with big holes blasted into it, the legacy of a car bomb several months earlier. The rusted carcass of an upturned water truck, riddled with bullet holes, marked the start of the insurgents\u2019 territory. We walked around it, and after a block or so we reached the first barricade, built of paving stones. It was about six feet high and three feet thick. We soon passed several more; the streets had been torn up to build them and were now mostly dusty earth. The area seemed deserted, but at last we heard voices and emerged into a vacant lot between houses. A young man came out to greet us, wearing a tan vest and clutching a walkie-talkie. He led us into a half-open patio that once served as a garage, where other fighters and activists were slumped on battered old couches, chatting and drinking tea and smoking.Also on the walls were two big portraits of Abdullah Ocalan, the founder of the P.K.K., with his unmistakable log of a mustache and tussocky black eyebrows. Ocalan, a man of titanic ego who ruthlessly ordered the execution of rivals and dissidents, has been in prison on the Turkish island Imrali since his capture in 1999. He still lords over the movement \u2014 including its Syrian affiliate, the P.Y.D. \u2014 like an absent philosopher-king, issuing cloudy leftist declarations through his lawyers. Ocalan no longer directs the P.K.K.\u2019s day-to-day operations, and no one has been allowed to see him for more than a year. I asked the fighters what they would do if Ocalan told them to take down the barricades and stop fighting. \u201cWe would stop,\u201d one of them said, with no hesitation. \u201cWe see Ocalan as our leader.\u201dNo one in Nusaybin had any illusions about what was in store for them. A few days earlier, the war\u2019s realities burst into public view in Cizre, about two hours to the east. Cizre had been under curfew and closed to the outside world for almost three months, with tanks on nearby hillsides firing down on it. Few images had leaked past the military\u2019s blockade until the town was declared free of terrorists and partly reopened, early on a Wednesday morning.I drove in with the first wave of returning residents. The damage was visible as soon as we passed the first checkpoint on the edge of town: Burned debris and shattered glass littered the main boulevard. Huge holes left by tank rounds gaped in the walls of buildings. Moving onward on foot, I followed the returnees into a residential district where the streets were half-blocked by piles of rubble. Roofs had collapsed earthward, the buildings\u2019 innards \u2014 mattresses, curtains, chair legs \u2014 sticking out at odd angles. A weird silence reigned. I saw people clutch their faces as they found their ruined homes. Others sobbed or shouted curses. Some were looking for children who were trapped in basements during the fighting. The smell of rotting corpses played in the spring breeze, hinting at what lay buried below. One man stared in wonder at a featureless pile of bricks and stones. This, he explained, had been the local mosque. Another grabbed my shoulder and stammered: \u201cWhat is the accusation against us? That we are Kurds, and we refuse to be slaves. They are telling us, \u2018If you refuse to be slaves, we will kill you.\u2019\u2009\u201dNow, on the patio in Nusaybin, the rebels talked to me about friends who died in Cizre, and they made clear that they expected an equally merciless assault any day. I asked whether by staying behind the barricades they were committing suicide. No one appeared to have survived the Turkish blockade in Cizre. One of them said: \u201cThe other side has more powerful weapons. We fight with our belief, so they can\u2019t stop us.\u201d Another one told me: \u201cIf you die, you die with honor.\u201dThe P.K.K. aimed to reverse all of this, preaching a reverence for transnational Kurdish identity and language under the banner of a secular, leftist program. Its war with the government has cost at least 30,000 lives since it began in 1984. The group\u2019s leader, Ocalan, cleverly played on Turkey\u2019s rivalries with neighboring states to gain refuge for his fighters in Iraq, Syria and Iran, which are home to about half of the Middle East\u2019s roughly 30 million Kurds.Kurdish men carrying the body of 14-year-old Yilmaz Gegim, killed as he sought shelter in the basement of a building in Cizre.The Nusaybin rebels I met were mostly born in the mid-1990s, when the Kurdish conflict last crescendoed. One of them, a lanky 27-year-old with a lean, foxlike face, seemed startled when I asked about his childhood; I got the sense that no one had bothered to ask him before. He went by the nom de guerre Omer Aydin. He spoke quickly, hunching forward in his chair and steadily tapping his feet, his dark eyes glinting with a nervy, cheerful energy. He was born in a village near Nusaybin, the son of a farmer. His village was full of P.K.K. sympathizers, including his parents, who ardently supported the group\u2019s vision for a Kurdish state, and would shelter and feed its armed rebels as they slipped back and forth from their strongholds in the mountains. The military raided Aydin\u2019s village so many times \u2014 arresting young men, shooting up houses and animals \u2014 that Aydin\u2019s father gave up and moved the family to an Istanbul slum. Aydin\u2019s parents sent him to work in a clothing factory when he was 10. One day the factory boss overheard Aydin speaking Kurdish, the only language he knew, and rounded on him, shouting: \u201cNever speak that language in here! You will speak Turkish.\u201d Aydin told me he would never forget that.In those years, the Turkish military destroyed and evacuated thousands of Kurdish villages, creating a flood of displaced people. The state supported shadowy proxy groups like Kurdish Hezbollah (no connection to the Lebanese movement), which tortured and killed with impunity and fostered an atmosphere of terror. The P.K.K. responded with raids that killed hundreds of Turkish soldiers and police officers. Kurdish children born in the \u201990s are known to their elders as the \u201cyouth of the storm.\u201d They grew up with a legacy of anger. Tens of thousands were arrested as teenagers, and prison contact with P.K.K. members radicalized many. They are more likely to be unemployed than their non-Kurdish peers. And there are a lot of them: The bulk of the population in some Kurdish areas is under 20. Older Kurdish political figures often declare, in talks with the state, that they are the last generation the government can have a dialogue with; the next one, they say, is far more radical. It\u2019s a pressure tactic, and it has become a talking point. It may also be true.By the time Aydin was in his teens, his father and all of his eight brothers had been arrested on charges of P.K.K. activity. So had many other relatives; one childhood friend was shot dead by Turkish soldiers in the mountains. Aydin had spent a total of four years in school. He learned Turkish there; he still didn\u2019t speak it well. \u201cWhen you are 15 or 16 years old, you are looking for something,\u201d Aydin told me. \u201cAfter what happened to my brothers, my father, all the arrests and the killings, I looked at my life and said: I should do something toward a revolution.\u201d He joined the P.K.K. I asked him how it happened, and he grinned mischievously. \u201cWhen there is a light in the dark, you will find your way to it,\u201d he said.Aydin trained in the mountains, learning how to handle a gun, set bombs, evade capture and communicate with fellow members. He then spent a decade in a series of Turkish cities, mostly helping to recruit other young Kurds. This, too, is a mark of his generation. The Kurds were a rural people for thousands of years, but in the past two or three decades that abruptly changed, and most now live in cities. By 2014, the P.K.K. had ordered Aydin to Nusaybin. His primary task was to supervise the recruitment and training of young locals. These youth affiliates were given a new name: the Y.D.G.-H., which later grew into Y.P.S. (The P.K.K. is known for its love of abbreviations.) Many were only teenagers.At the time, there was some hope for an end to the conflict. After its high point in the 1990s, violence had lapsed under Erdogan, who quietly loosened restrictions on Kurdish language and culture after he came to power in 2002. He also promoted economic development in the long-neglected southeast. Many Kurds were moved and impressed when Erdogan said in a 2005 speech that \u201cthe Kurdish problem is not only the problem of one part of my nation, it is a problem of every one of us, including myself.\u201d Progress was slow and halting, but after a cease-fire was declared in 2013, Turkish security forces largely withdrew from Kurdish cities in the southeast, softening old resentments. Some Kurds told me they felt free to walk late at night without fear of arrest for the first time. You could even wave a P.K.K. flag without receiving a jailhouse beating.Erdogan had long appeared to believe that peacefully resolving the Kurdish issue would bolster his reputation as a unifying leader and win more votes from Turkish Kurds. He needed those votes to accomplish a larger goal: revising Turkey\u2019s Constitution to create a presidential system that would augment his own powers. To get there, he would need to offset the rise of a new Kurdish political party, the H.D.P., which was expanding beyond its base to appeal to other minorities and even to some liberal Turks. The party\u2019s soft-spoken leader, Selahattin Demirtas, seemed to embody widespread hopes for a new center of gravity that would marginalize Ocalan and the militant P.K.K. leaders in the Qandil Mountains of northern Iraq. He spoke of a more pluralist Turkey, with greater local control within the Kurdish areas in exchange for a reconciliation with the Turkish state. This vision was very popular with ordinary Kurds, which made the H.D.P. a real political threat to Erdogan. To outflank it, he would need to tackle the Kurdish issue himself \u2014 and get credit for it.With all this in mind, Erdogan gave his blessing in mid-2014 to an unlikely series of meetings on the prison island of Imrali. Every few weeks, Ocalan sat at a table with H.D.P. leaders and members of Turkey\u2019s intelligence ministry, discussing the terms of a P.K.K. disarmament. Hatip Dicle, a Kurdish political figure who participated, told me that the meetings helped to build trust. Several times, the parties relayed grievances about government arrests or unwelcome P.K.K. moves, and they were sent back down the chain and resolved, Dicle said. Notes from each meeting were instantly relayed to both Erdogan and the P.K.K.\u2019s leaders in the mountains. Finally, in late February 2015, a joint news conference took place in Istanbul with Turkey\u2019s deputy prime minister and leading H.D.P. members to announce a 10-point plan, including both the P.K.K.\u2019s disarmament and enhanced local authority in the Kurdish southeast. They even relayed a message from Ocalan: \u201cThis is a historic declaration of will to replace armed struggle with democratic politics.\u201dBut that triumph was stillborn. Before the battle of Kobani became a high point of Kurdish pride, it began sowing mistrust. Weeks before their troops were allowed to join the fighting, the Kurds watched with outrage as Erdogan breezily predicted an ISIS victory in Kobani and refused to allow Turkish Kurds to cross to the rescue. There were protests across the southeast, and young P.K.K. members began building barricades; the police responded with force, shooting and killing dozens of protesters. Only weeks later and under heavy international pressure did Erdogan allow the Iraqi Kurdish convoy to pass through and join the battle. As Kobani fueled a wider sense of Kurdish empowerment, Erdogan appears to have concluded that he was being played for a fool. Within weeks of the news conference, he began distancing himself from the peace talks. He declared that \u201cthere is no Kurdish problem\u201d and ultimately denied that he\u2019d even known what his deputies were doing. All dialogue was dropped, and the government took away Ocalan\u2019s ability to communicate with the outside world.The P.K.K. began making menacing noises. In July, amid mutual recriminations, P.K.K. militants killed two police officers in the town of Sanliurfa. Young Kurdish militants began rebuilding their barricades across the southeast, and this time, they were armed.The radicalism of the P.K.K.\u2019s younger urban members clearly played a role. Some of these fighters even speak dismissively of the H.D.P. \u2014 the flagship Kurdish political party in Turkey \u2014 as a pack of cowardly appeasers. One young activist who spent time in Cizre before the final assault there told me she\u2019d watched a delegation of sympathetic Kurdish political figures arrive inside the barricades to press for a cease-fire, only to be rebuffed. Afterward, she said, one of the young commandos \u2014 now dead \u2014 declared: \u201cLies, all lies. They say, \u2018We\u2019re with you,\u2019 but when we die they\u2019ll come and take selfies with our corpses.\u201dFor all their talk of victimhood, the young radicals have become adept at waging guerrilla war. Almost 500 Turkish police officers and soldiers have been killed since the cease-fire ended, many by snipers. The streets around the Nusaybin \u201cliberated zone\u201d were planted with roadside bombs, I was later told, to be used in case of a Turkish assault. Two days after my first visit there, a car bomb exploded outside a police building a few hundred yards away, killing two officers and wounding dozens of civilians.After we\u2019d finished talking, Aydin led me out into the bright spring sunshine. I heard a high voice shouting orders. In the vacant lot, about two dozen women dressed in combat fatigues and balaclava-style head coverings were doing an exhibition drill, their boots crunching the ground in unison as they swung their rifles up, across their shoulders and down. A row of female commanders stood at attention in front of them. It was International Women\u2019s Day, an opportunity for women to showcase their powerful role in the movement. One paradox of the P.K.K. is its blend of ardent feminism and cultish devotion to Ocalan. Many women are escaping difficult homes. They credit Ocalan with elevating Kurdish women from a traditional life, in which honor killings were common, to a position of power and respect. A number of women in the movement told me that their first experience handling weapons was revelatory. One who fought as a sniper in Kobani described the moment when she killed her first man, an ISIS fighter: \u201cI felt as if fire were streaming from my eyes,\u201d she said. I had expected some expression of remorse or unease, but instead her face glowed with a kind of exaltation as she said the words.Most of the women that day carried AK-47s, but one had a Russian-made sniper rifle, and I glimpsed a rocket-propelled grenade launcher off to the side. Several dozen children and older women sat near a wall, watching. At one point, a commander held out a sheet of paper and read a statement aloud in a strident voice. \u201cIn the spirit of our martyrs, we will fight harder in our self-administered areas. We will not forget our comrades murdered in Cizre.\u201d She continued: \u201cWe invite all the women of Kurdistan to fight behind the barricades.\u201d Aydin leaned over and told me that women made up about half the fighters in Nusaybin.When the military maneuvers were over, the women put away their guns and formed lines to do a traditional folk dance, their voices sailing over the empty streets in trilling ululations. Some of the civilian women had dressed up in bright, sequiny gowns for the occasion, and joined the dance. A tinny P.A. system blasted P.K.K. anthems, including one about Rojava \u2014 the new Kurdish statelet in Syria \u2014 and the battle of Kobani. There were frequent choruses of allegiance to \u201cApo,\u201d the Kurdish word for uncle, Ocalan\u2019s nickname.From where we stood, the border was only a few hundred meters to the south. From the rooftops around us, you could easily see the grain silos and watchtowers of Qamishli, the new capital of Rojava, where Ocalan\u2019s portrait hangs almost everywhere. It struck me that if the Turkish military waged full-scale war here, it would be like the battle of Kobani in reverse. The Syrian Kurds \u2014 many of them cousins of those in Nusaybin \u2014 would be sorely tempted to come to their aid.I met a 42-year-old gas dealer in Cizre who showed me the ruins of his house, what once must have been an attractive three-story home, with a stone courtyard. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want this, any of it,\u201d he told me. \u201cWhen the youth started building barricades and digging trenches, we warned them, \u2018You are doing something dangerous; we are civil people.\u2019 They said, \u2018We are protecting you.\u2019 You see the result.\u201d The man said he and other local business leaders held meetings with the insurgents and the governor during the autumn, and appealed for peace. He stared at the remains of his house for a moment. \u201cBoth sides are responsible,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are caught in between, and our hearts are broken.\u201dWithin the movement, the violence has clearly radicalized many young people. But there, too, I heard some quiet but telling voices of dissent. One of them was a 24-year-old woman, a battle-tested P.K.K. sniper whose commitment to the group was beyond question. She grew up in Silvan, another movement stronghold, to a family crowded with P.K.K. members and martyrs. She had not planned to join the organization herself, but as a university student in western Turkey, she grew resentful that the university authorities treated her and other Kurds as potential criminals. She began reading Ocalan\u2019s writings, and his ideas \u2014 especially about women\u2019s empowerment \u2014 won her over.She did her military and political training in the Qandil Mountains. Before it was over, the ISIS assault on Kobani began, and she and another new recruit joined. She fought inside Kobani for more than a month, often coming so close to ISIS fighters that she could see their faces. She carried one grenade on each hip: one to use against the enemy, one to blow herself up in case of capture. Several of her comrades used their grenades this way, she said. The Kurds lost huge numbers of people. In her 25-person unit, only three survived. She described carrying away the remains of friends who were eviscerated by a suicide truck bomb. \u201cYou don\u2019t have time to have emotions,\u201d she said. \u201cYou go back to your fighter mood.\u201d In November, she was injured in the back by a collapsing barricade and was taken to the mountains for surgery.I asked her whether she had been tempted to join the P.K.K.\u2019s struggle in Turkey, behind the barricades. She was living in Mardin at the time, a short drive from Nusaybin. She said no. Then she was silent for almost a full minute, her open face suddenly full of unease.\u201cWhen we were fighting in Kobani, we knew we\u2019d get a result,\u201d she said. \u201cHere, when they fight, they don\u2019t see a result. I don\u2019t want to die for a cause that brings no results. All the world knew what we were doing in Kobani. The fight had a meaning. Here, I don\u2019t see a meaning.\u201d She continued: \u201cWhen I look around at my generation, everybody\u2019s mind is confused. People are asking: Are these trenches right or wrong?\u201dHer feelings echo those of many other war-weary Kurds, who watched in dismay last summer as Turkey\u2019s politics congealed once again into hostile camps. All hopes for a middle ground vanished. The H.D.P. had to take sides once the fighting started, and its highest-ever share of votes in June \u2014 13 percent \u2014 dropped to 10 percent in the November elections. Many believe that if elections were held today, the party would not be in Parliament at all. \u201cThe H.D.P.\u2019s constituency was based on a bridge between Kurds and non-Kurds,\u201d Gonul Tol, a Turkey analyst at the Middle East Institute in Washington, told me. \u201cAfter that bridge collapsed, the H.D.P. had to take a more extreme stance in order to hold onto its base. It became little more than a front for the P.K.K.\u201dI saw this drama being enacted at some of the P.K.K. funerals I attended in March, where H.D.P. politicians seemed desperate to shore up their base. After my last visit to Nusaybin, an activist invited me to attend the funeral of a veteran P.K.K. commando, who was killed the night before in a gun battle with Turkish soldiers. We had to drive for 20 minutes along narrow country roads to get to her village, a cluster of stone houses overlooking a magnificent landscape of rolling hills and olive trees. Several guests told me the village was a celebrated center of P.K.K. support, with many local martyrs. As we arrived, we could see images of the dead fighter\u2019s face \u2014 lean and ascetic, with short dark hair \u2014 being held aloft on posters; relatives also handed out stamp-size pictures for guests to pin on their lapels. Her name was Jiyan Konak, and relatives told me she spent 22 years as a fighter. We waited alongside geese, turkeys and clucking chickens until a coffin draped in a flag emerged from her parents\u2019 house, with scores of women ululating and holding up the victory sign with their fingers. At least half a dozen local officials and members of Parliament, all from the H.D.P., were there. When the ceremony began, the relatives and elders gave short, simple speeches. The H.D.P. members delivered long, fierce tirades against the \u201chorrific enemy\u201d \u2014 the Turkish government \u2014 that killed Konak. One of them, a middle-aged female lawmaker in an elegant gray patterned blazer and scarf, spoke longer than anyone else. \u201cKobani did not fall, and northern Kurdistan will triumph, too,\u201d she said, her voice rising almost to a shriek as she neared her conclusion. \u201cThe Kurdish woman will triumph soon. Leader Apo will triumph soon. She was not the first martyr, and she won\u2019t be the last. Until we win our freedom on this land, we will continue to fight!\u201dAt the same time, Erdogan has led a crackdown on the press, with the state jailing critical journalists and academics en masse and closing down opposition outlets; scarcely any remain. He has urged Parliament to \u201credefine\u201d terrorism in a way that is ominously broad. \u201cThe fact that their title is lawmaker, academic, writer, journalist or head of a civil society group doesn\u2019t change the fact that that individual is a terrorist,\u201d he said in March. Even in Erdogan\u2019s own party, total loyalty to the president has become a condition of survival. Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, long viewed as a flunky, was forced out unceremoniously in early May after some mild gestures of difference with Erdogan, including on the Kurdish issue; he had hinted at a return to peace talks. \u201cThe one who talks about peace in wartime is as much a traitor as the one who talks about war in peacetime,\u201d wrote an Erdogan ally, in an anonymous denunciation of Davutoglu posted on a blog on May 1.This all-or-nothing strategy seems guaranteed to return Turkey to the days when the Kurds were forced to choose between the P.K.K. and the state. If that happens, many who are now critical of the P.K.K.\u2019s violence and hungry for an alternative will fall in line behind Ocalan\u2019s minions. Turkey\u2019s compliant mainstream media, meanwhile, have done their part to whip up a nationalist frenzy. Turn on a TV anywhere in Turkey, and you will see frequent footage of soldiers\u2019 funerals, but no mention of civilian casualties or the hundreds of thousands forced to leave their homes.Anyone who tries to reach across the gap becomes a target. One of the country\u2019s few remaining bridge figures was Tahir Elci, a celebrated Kurdish human rights lawyer and president of the Diyarbakir Bar Association. Elci had a long record of taking on the state, but he also publicly criticized the P.K.K., something very few people \u2014 including H.D.P. members of Parliament \u2014 were willing to do. In the fall, the drumbeat of death threats against Elci rose after he said in a televised interview that he considered the P.K.K. an armed political organization rather than a terrorist group. A month later, facing prosecution for his comments, he appeared at a midday news conference in Diyarbakir, where he called again for an end to the conflict. Moments later, gunfire broke out, and a bullet struck him in the neck. The killing remains unsolved. His funeral drew tens of thousands of mourners.The Turkish government has pledged to rebuild the southeast and to make peace with the Kurds in its own way. So far, that effort does not look promising. I happened to be driving toward Silopi, another town ravaged by war, on the day in March when Prime Minister Davutoglu, then still in government, was visiting. We could see Black Hawk helicopters crisscrossing the sky as we approached, and a long convoy of armored vehicles \u2014 part of his security detail \u2014 blocked traffic for hours. It was painfully apparent that this remained enemy territory for the Turkish state. Government officials have hinted that they have their own Kurdish intermediaries, and Davutoglu met with some of these during his visit. This is an old Turkish strategy: For decades, the state paid \u201cvillage guards\u201d to fight the P.K.K., and the Ottomans had their own divide-and-rule strategies. If history is any guide, this will sow more violence without damaging the P.K.K.\u2019s popular legitimacy.Europe once had the power to play a moderating role, thanks to Turkey\u2019s decades-long quest to join the European Union. But the migrant crisis has reversed that equation. European Union officials are now so desperate for Turkey to stop the flow of refugees that they have made little mention of Turkey\u2019s civil rights issues or the Kurds in recent talks. One Kurd who lost his house in Cizre told me bitterly that no one would help, \u201cbecause the E.U. only cares about stopping the migrants.\u201dThe United States may have more leverage. The Paris and Brussels attacks have raised the pressure on President Obama to destroy the ISIS sanctuary in Syria and Iraq, and it is clear that Turkey\u2019s Kurdish conflict is putting this effort at risk by dividing the administration\u2019s two key allies. \u201cWhat\u2019s concerning is that while Turkey has every right to fight the P.K.K., it\u2019s increasingly becoming a conflict pitting Turkey against the Kurds,\u201d one administration official told me. \u201cThat jeopardizes the credibility of even our friends among the Kurds, including Iraqi Kurds.\u201d American officials have tried to keep their Kurdish allies in Syria from unnecessarily provoking the Turks. They say they are not aware of any P.Y.D. fighters or weaponry being transferred north to be used against the Turkish military. The Turks dispute that claim and insist that American weapons sent for use against ISIS have been passed northward and used by the P.K.K. (The shoulder-fired missile shown in the recent online video has prompted widespread speculation about a weapons trail from Syria.) The Obama administration officials I spoke with said they believed that if a peace deal is reached, the Turks will eventually become reconciled to a Kurdish statelet in Syria, just as they agreed to (and even helped midwife) the birth of Iraqi Kurdistan a decade ago. Perhaps. But the Turks say the two situations cannot be compared. In mid-March, the Syrian Kurds took another step toward independence, voting to establish a self-governing federal region. The announcement prompted angry rebuttals from the Turkish and Syrian governments and Arab opposition factions fighting in Syria.Meanwhile, the Americans are trying to find Arab allies who could substitute for the Kurds in a push to conquer Raqqa, the Islamic State\u2019s capital. But they are hobbled by Turkey\u2019s insistence on treating not just the P.Y.D. but also anyone who has worked with it, including Arabs, as terrorists. The fact that Erdogan\u2019s government has itself supported hard-line Islamist militias in Syria \u2014 including some with ties to Al Qaeda \u2014 only adds to the American frustration. The Obama administration appears to be forging ahead with its plans, despite Turkish complaints: In late April, Obama announced that an additional 250 Special Operations troops were on their way to northeastern Syria to work with the Kurdish-led force there. American officials say they have little choice; the Turks have provided no viable alternatives for an assault on Raqqa. For Erdogan, fighting ISIS remains secondary to ousting President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, whom he blames for the region\u2019s turmoil.I thought about Omer Aydin, the P.K.K. commander who told me his life story. Most of the fighters I met refused to say much about their feelings; they retreated behind a stoical mask and repeated the same P.K.K. talking points. Not Aydin. \u201cI can\u2019t forget the face of this soldier I killed,\u201d he said at one point. \u201cAt the end, they are human, too.\u201d Aydin seemed a little defensive about the justice of his cause, as if he understood that he and his fellow rebels were putting the lives of ordinary people at risk. A few months earlier, he told me, he\u2019d been on the lookout for Turkish snipers when he walked past a mother holding a baby who was crying uncontrollably. The sight unnerved him for a moment. \u201cI passed, and when he saw my weapon, he stopped crying,\u201d Aydin said. \u201cHe was 5 or 6 months old. I had a feeling: Even this baby knows why we\u2019re fighting. I will never forget this.\u201dOne afternoon at the end of March, I received a message from my activist contact in Nusaybin. She had fled the city. There were reports of terrible firefights that day, with tanks blasting buildings into rubble in an effort to recapture the P.K.K. neighborhoods and young rebels struggling to push them back. Omer Aydin, she said, was dead.Robert F. Worth is a contributing writer for the magazine. His book on the legacy of the Arab uprisings, \u201cA Rage for Order,\u201d was published in April by Farrar, Straus & Giroux.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama\u2019s War on Inequality", "Date": "2016-05-20", "News": "Supported byThere were two big economic policy stories this week that you may have missed if you were distracted by Trumpian bombast and the yelling of the Sanders dead-enders. Each tells you a lot about both what President Obama has accomplished and the stakes in this year\u2019s election.What both stories tell us is that the Obama administration has done much more than most people realize to fight extreme economic inequality. That fight will continue if Hillary Clinton wins the election; it will go into sharp reverse if Mr. Trump wins.Step back for a minute and ask, what can policy do to limit inequality? The answer is, it can operate on two fronts. It can engage in redistribution, taxing high incomes and aiding families with lower incomes. It can also engage in what is sometimes called \u201cpredistribution,\u201d strengthening the bargaining power of lower-paid workers and limiting the opportunities for a handful of people to make giant sums. In practice, governments that succeed in limiting inequality generally do both.Now, America isn\u2019t about to become Denmark, and Mr. Obama, facing relentless opposition in Congress, has never been in a position to repeat the New Deal. (Even F.D.R. made limited headway against inequality until World War II gave the government unusual influence over the economy.) But more has happened than you might think.Most obviously, Obamacare provides aid and subsidies mainly to lower-income working Americans, and it pays for that aid partly with higher taxes at the top. That makes it an important redistributionist policy \u2014 the biggest such policy since the 1960s.And while the move on overtime comes late in the game, it\u2019s a pretty big deal, and could be the beginning of much broader action.Again, nothing Mr. Obama has done will put more than a modest dent in American inequality. But his actions aren\u2019t trivial, either.And even these medium-size steps put the lie to the pessimism and fatalism one hears all too often on this subject. No, America isn\u2019t an oligarchy in which both parties reliably serve the interests of the economic elite. Money talks on both sides of the aisle, but the influence of big donors hasn\u2019t prevented the current president from doing a substantial amount to narrow income gaps \u2014 and he would have done much more if he\u2019d faced less opposition in Congress.And in this as in so much else, it matters hugely whom the nation chooses as his successor.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.P.A. Methane Leak Rules Take Aim at Climate Change", "Date": "2016-05-12", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration on Thursday unveiled the first federal regulations to control emissions of potent planet-warming methane gas that could leach from new oil and gas wells, the next step in President Obama\u2019s effort to combat climate change.The E.P.A. estimates that the rules will cost companies around $530 million in 2025, but it also estimates that they will yield companies savings of as much as $690 million from reduced waste, a potential net benefit of $160 million. The agency said the regulations would lower methane emissions by 510,000 tons in 2025, the equivalent of 11 million metric tons of carbon dioxide.\u201cThese new actions will protect public health and reduce pollution linked to cancer and other serious health effects while allowing industry to continue to grow and provide a vital source of energy for Americans across the country,\u201d said the agency\u2019s administrator, Gina McCarthy.Oil and gas companies, already reeling from sustained low prices, see an economic burden and have vowed to fight.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense that the administration would add unreasonable and overly burdensome regulations when the industry is already leading the way in reducing emissions,\u201d said Kyle Isakower, vice president for regulatory policy at the American Petroleum Institute. \u201cImposing a one-size-fits-all scheme on the industry could actually stifle innovation and discourage investments.\u201dThe new methane rules are the latest part of a broader push by Mr. Obama to cut greenhouse gas emissions from industries across the economy. E.P.A. regulations would cut carbon dioxide emissions from cars, trucks and power plants, and new rules are in the works to reduce emissions from airplanes. Many of those regulations could face years of litigation before they can go into force.Reducing methane is an important part of the administration\u2019s climate change strategy because the gas is 25 times more effective than carbon dioxide in trapping heat. It does, however, dissipate in the atmosphere far more quickly than carbon. The administration has set a goal of reducing methane emissions by as much as 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025.The rule on methane emissions from new oil and gas wells will not be enough to meet Mr. Obama\u2019s methane reduction targets, but the E.P.A. is also expected to move forward with additional rules governing methane leaks from existing wells.\u201cWe will remain steadfast in our efforts urging E.P.A. to move expeditiously on its commitment to address existing sources of this highly potent greenhouse gas \u2014 which will continue to be responsible for the vast majority of this pollutant \u2014 and is essential in meeting the Paris climate agreement,\u201d Michael Brune, the executive director of the Sierra Club, said in a statement Thursday.Oil and gas companies call the rules unnecessary and costly, maintaining that they already have an incentive to stop and prevent methane leaks: Methane can be sold. The companies say the rules impose new costs on a struggling industry.The new methane rules are being watched closely in Canada, where Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has pledged to work with Mr. Obama on a joint methane reduction strategy. Mr. Trudeau\u2019s government is expected to produce a similar set of regulations for Canada, where oil and gas extraction is a larger part of the economy than in the United States.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump Reaches Out, Quietly, to Republican Establishment", "Date": "2016-05-05", "News": "Supported byDonald J. Trump, turning his attention to the general election, has begun quietly reaching out to key elements of the Republican establishment as he seeks to unite the party behind his candidacy before his anticipated battle against Hillary Clinton.Mr. Trump, who is expected to run on a nonideological platform of his own design, is trying to reassure party officials that he understands there are certain norms even he needs to follow as the Republican nominee, and that he is capable of producing an organization and infrastructure that can sustain a costly general election campaign.His team, already working to transform a lean operation into a national presidential campaign apparatus, has been reaching out to members of Congress and Washington think tanks; strategizing on how best to take on Mrs. Clinton and woo supporters of her primary opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont; and planning to head to Cleveland next week to help direct the party\u2019s July convention, according to aides.The campaign has also begun thinking about what a convention with Mr. Trump, a circus master and media savant, as the prime-time act will look like.\u201cThe site has been chosen and the arena is fine, but I\u2019d want to have \u2014 you know, the last Republican convention was extraordinarily boring,\u201d Mr. Trump said in one of two phone interviews Wednesday. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to come up with some things that will make it interesting and informative, but also smart and different.\u201dMr. Trump, a former reality television host, added that he would look to organizations like IMG, a global talent management company, to help with the production.To improve its outreach to the Republican political and policy establishment, the Trump campaign recently opened an office near the nation\u2019s capital, in the Old Town neighborhood of Alexandria, Va. But it is unclear whether the core of the campaign will be based in the Washington area or in New York, where Mr. Trump returns almost every night.Soon, the campaign plans to put a transition team in place to prepare for a Trump administration, and on Thursday announced Steve Mnuchin, the head of a private investment firm, as the team\u2019s national finance chairman.As the presumptive nominee, Mr. Trump will begin raising money for the Republican Party and various congressional committees, his campaign said. He has largely self-funded his campaign so far \u2014 a fact he often promotes as evidence that he is not beholden to special interests \u2014 but has signaled he will raise money for his general election effort.He also did not rule out the possibility of accepting public matching funds, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know enough about it,\u201d but he added that he would receive a briefing on the topic on Thursday.On Tuesday, Ed Rollins, once Ronald Reagan\u2019s campaign manager, joined Great America PAC, a \u201csuper PAC\u201d supporting Mr. Trump, as a chairman. On a call with prospective supporters of the group on Wednesday, Mr. Rollins said its goal would not be to spend large amounts on television ads, but instead to try to plug holes for the campaign. \u201cI think what we want to do is really examine what are the pieces that are missing,\u201d he said.Since last month, Mr. Trump\u2019s congressional team has held meetings on Capitol Hill every Thursday morning when Congress is in session. It said that attendance at the meetings, which often feature a guest speaker from the Trump campaign, had swelled after the recent string of Trump victories, and that it would announce more than half a dozen endorsements in the coming weeks.Mr. Trump\u2019s fund-raising efforts could help court lawmakers.\u201cDollars matter a lot in these tough races, so to the extent that Mr. Trump is helping us raise money, money that will help us protect our majority, he\u2019s going to win a lot of friends in Congress,\u201d said Representative Chris Collins of New York, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s congressional chairmen. \u201cThat\u2019s going to soothe a lot of folks and show he does care about the House maintaining its majority.\u201dThe campaign has begun reaching out to Washington consultants and operatives from rival campaigns, as well as meeting quietly with Republican leaders in swing states where it believes Mr. Trump can win in November.\u201cI\u2019ve seen it when the campaign comes in and says: \u2018This is the way we\u2019re going to run the state, whether you like it or not. We know more about your state than you do,\u2019\u201d Mr. Manafort said in an interview. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not an effective way to do it.\u201dBut recruiting supporters in the Washington establishment has been something of a challenge.\u201cIt\u2019s still very much an insurgency campaign, and there\u2019s still a high degree of reluctance in D.C. to get on board with the campaign, even though a lot of people have made the jump or are softening their positions,\u201d said Joe Kasper, chief of staff to Representative Duncan Hunter of California, a chairman of Mr. Trump\u2019s congressional outreach effort.The campaign is also refining its messaging for the general election, with Mr. Trump preparing lines of attack against Mrs. Clinton \u2014 including, possibly, continued assaults on her gender \u2014 and discussing how he can woo supporters of Mr. Sanders, who his team hopes will be receptive to his anti-Washington message of economic populism.In an interview, Mr. Trump suggested that Mrs. Clinton had \u201cbad judgment\u201d and \u201ca lot of baggage\u201d that could harm her. \u201cThe emails are bad judgment,\u201d he said. \u201cBenghazi was bad judgment. Libya was bad judgment. Whitewater was bad judgment.\u201dThe campaign also plans to bring on additional staff to help with the news media, and it is seeking a point person for surrogates, who would recruit and book Trump supporters to speak on television and hone their talking points.Ultimately, however, Mr. Trump said he did not plan to make wholesale changes to his approach after his primary victories. \u201cWhen you win the pennant and you\u2019re in the World Series and you\u2019re three games up, you don\u2019t want to start changing your lineup,\u201d he said.Jeremy W.

{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Energy Plan: More Fossil Fuels and Fewer Rules", "Date": "2016-05-26", "News": "Supported byBISMARCK, N.D. \u2014 Donald J. Trump traveled Thursday to the heart of America\u2019s oil and gas boom, where he called for more fossil fuel drilling and fewer environmental regulations while vowing to \u201ccancel the Paris climate agreement,\u201d the 2015 accord committing nearly every nation to taking action to curb climate change.Laying out his positions on energy and the environment at an oil industry conference in North Dakota, he vowed to rescind President Obama\u2019s signature climate change rules and revive construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, which would bring petroleum from Canada\u2019s oil sands to Gulf Coast refineries.It was the latest in a series of recent policy addresses, including on Israel and foreign policy, intended to position Mr. Trump, the real estate mogul and reality show star, as credible on substantive issues now that he is the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.But experts remain skeptical of Mr. Trump\u2019s command of the complexities of the global energy economy. And he made claims, such as a promise to restore jobs lost in coal mining, that essentially defy free-market forces.\u201cMany of his proposals thus far don\u2019t seem to appreciate the complex forces that drive the energy system,\u201d said Richard G. Newell, an energy economist at Duke University who has closely followed Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks.Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to set his speech in North Dakota was politically strategic. He began the day fewer than 30 delegates shy of clinching the nomination, and on Thursday, he reached the required 1,237-delegate threshold with the help of unpledged delegates in the state who moved to support him.Mr. Trump asked North Dakota\u2019s Republican congressman, Kevin Cramer, to suggest energy policies before the speech.A central question confronting the next president will be how to address climate change. Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly denied the established science that climate change is caused by humans, vowed in his speech to undo many of Mr. Obama\u2019s initiatives.He did not explicitly address the scientific legitimacy of human-caused climate change, but said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to deal with real environmental challenges, not the phony ones we\u2019ve been hearing about.\u201dThe issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.\u201cRegulations that shut down hundreds of coal-fired power plants and block the construction of new ones \u2014 how stupid is that?\u201d Mr. Trump said.In his speech, he complained, inaccurately: \u201cThis agreement gives foreign bureaucrats control over how much energy we use on our land, in our country. No way.\u201dIn fact, at the heart of the Paris Agreement are voluntary pledges put forward by the governments of over 190 nations, laying out plans to lower emissions. No government has control over the emissions-reduction plans of other governments.Once the accord is ratified by 55 countries responsible for 55 percent of global emissions, it will enter into legal force, and any country wishing to withdraw would have to wait four years to do so. However, if the deal has not been ratified by January 2017, a new American president could withdraw immediately. For that reason, many countries, fearful that a President Trump would do just that, are racing to ratify the deal this year.But there would be no legal consequence if the United States, the world\u2019s second-largest greenhouse gas polluter, simply did not follow through with the Obama administration\u2019s pledge to cut emissions up to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025.In an even more potent threat, Mr. Trump declared that the United States would \u201cstop all payment of U.S. tax dollars to global warming programs.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve got big problems, folks, and we can\u2019t be sending money all over the world,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep our money here and our jobs here and bring our jobs back.\u201dBut developing nations, including India, have made clear that their ability to cut emissions depends largely on financial help from other countries. And as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton pledged that rich countries, including the United States, would commit $100 billion annually by 2020 to help poor countries adapt to the ravages of global warming. A clear signal that the United States would back down from its commitments to reduce emissions and provide financial assistance could undermine the political will in other countries, such as India and China, to take action.Other elements of Mr. Trump\u2019s energy proposals appear less viable. As coal mining jobs have declined, Mr. Trump has vowed to fully restore their numbers.\u201cWe\u2019re going to bring back the coal industry, save the coal industry,\u201d he said. \u201cI love those people.\u201dDonald J. Trump is set to be the Republican standard-bearer, but when it comes to some of his policies, he is out of sync with many Republican leaders in Congress.It is unclear how Mr. Trump could restore lost jobs in the coal industry. As domestic coal demand has declined, companies have laid off thousands of miners. But economists say that shift is driven by market forces: The natural gas boom led power companies to buy cheaper gas rather than coal.\u201cMost analysts would say that coal is hurting because natural gas prices have collapsed,\u201d said Robert McNally, the president of the Rapidan Group, an energy consulting firm, and a senior energy official in the George W. Bush administration. \u201cDonald Trump would have to find a way to raise natural gas prices.\u201dMr. Trump also repeatedly emphasized \u201cenergy independence\u201d \u2014 the idea that the United States could isolate itself from global oil markets and cease importing fuels.\u201cUnder my presidency, we will accomplish complete American energy independence,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will become totally independent of the need to import energy from the oil cartel or any nation hostile to our interest.\u201dBut experts say that such remarks display a basic ignorance of the workings of the global oil markets.\u201cEven if energy independence was achievable, it would not be desirable,\u201d Mr. Newell, the Duke University energy economist, wrote in an email. \u201cOur interests tend to be best served by getting each type of fuel we need from the least expensive source, be it domestic or imported. When domestic U.S. energy is globally competitive, like the recent oil and gas boom, our imports go down. But energy independence itself is one of the least useful energy policy goals \u2014 and is at times damaging.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s speech, which he delivered with the help of teleprompters, drew a large, cheering crowd to the conference, packing an arena here with thousands of people.Steve DeWacht, 45, a district manager at Colter Energy, a company in the fracking industry, said he liked what he knew of Mr. Trump\u2019s energy policy.\u201cI\u2019m hoping he\u2019s going to support the oil industry, open up some new plays \u2014 in Pennsylvania, maybe \u2014 keep Texas going and help out in North Dakota,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s got to get us off the OPEC train and help us make our own train.\u201dBob Morman, 60, who works for Montana-Dakota Utilities on the natural gas side, said he was supporting Mr. Trump, but knew little about his energy plans and had come to learn more.An earlier version of this article misstated the amount of money Hillary Clinton has said rich countries will commit to help poor countries adapt to global warming. It is $100 billion, not $100 million.Ashley Parker reported from Bismarck, and Coral Davenport from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Do-Nothingism, a Fine Idea for the Fed", "Date": "2016-05-28", "News": "Supported byEditorialIf she\u2019s true to her word, Ms. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, will resist what many people think will be an interest rate increase when the Fed\u2019s policy committee meets in mid-June. The underlying economic data \u2014 on jobs, prices and economic growth generally \u2014 simply do not support such an increase.Widespread expectations of a rate increase arose in part from a misreading by investors of the minutes of a Fed meeting in April. What the minutes actually said was that \u201cit likely would be appropriate\u201d to raise rates in June \u2014 if economic growth picked up in the second quarter, if the labor market remained strong and if inflation rose from its depressed levels.Those are very big ifs that, by all indications, are not being met.Government data on economic growth in the second quarter will not be out before the Fed\u2019s next meeting, but early signs are grim. In May, service-sector growth in the United States slowed markedly and manufacturing continued a steep decline, according to recent purchasing managers\u2019 surveys by Markit, a data supplier. The surveys, which have been prescient, suggest that growth in the second quarter will be at a meager annual rate of 0.7 percent, on par with growth in the first quarter of 0.8 percent.Recent jobs numbers have also been disappointing. Job growth last month, reported shortly after the Fed\u2019s April meeting, was the slowest since September, with only 160,000 new positions added. Job growth in May could be even worse if, as anticipated, the recent slowdown in services and manufacturing impedes hiring. The Markit surveys project a gain in May of only 128,000 jobs.As for price inflation, it remains below the Fed\u2019s target of 2 percent. What evidence there is of inflation is largely attributable to slowly rising oil prices, not to any significant or fundamental improvement in wages or spending or, by extension, economic health.Rate increases are called for when economic activity is speeding up to the point of overheating, as reflected in an upward spiral in wages and prices. At its best, the economy in recent years has managed to grow at an annual rate of about 2 percent, a moderate pace that has resulted in considerable slack in the job market. Raising rates in June would apply the brakes to a recovery that has never hit full speed and that now appears to be slowing.This sad reality must be frustrating for the Fed. When the term of the previous Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke, ended in 2014, it was widely assumed that the Federal Reserve\u2019s next big task was to reverse the near-zero interest rate policy of the bailout years. That assumption has created pressure on the Fed, partly self-imposed, to do just that.Adding to the frustration is that Fed policy is not to blame for the economy\u2019s underperformance. Congress bears much of the blame because of its tightfisted federal budgets when more government spending is needed to offset feeble spending and investment in the private sector. Still, sound policy making by the Fed requires answering to conditions as they are, not as policy makers might wish they were.Advertisement"}

His piece is reposted below with permission, followed by some overarching thoughts from me.One of the best arguments I\u2019ve read for why the U.S. should invest in an energy revolution: https://t.co/58978QoWeY https://t.co/xJV5Dm8hSp\u201cFighting climate change successfully will certainly require sensible government policies to level the economic playing field between clean and dirty energy, such as putting a price on carbon dioxide emissions. But it will also require policies that encourage investment in new clean energy technology, which even a level playing field may not generate on its own.\u201d\u2013 We have made a factual error by asserting, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf the world is to avoid climate calamity, it needs to reduce its carbon emissions by 80 percent by the middle of this century\u00e2\u0080\u0094a target that is simply out of reach with existing technology.\u201d\u2013 It is impossible to achieve deep reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by mid-century using \u00e2\u0080\u009cmysterious nonexistent technology.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u2013 Existing clean energy technologies have fallen in cost and will continue to do so as a function of their deployment, which implies that they are sufficient to achieve ambitious climate goals.Concretely, in our essay we propose several clean energy technologies that the world needs to achieve deep decarbonization. We write:\u201cNew reactor designs could make nuclear meltdowns physically impossible, and nanoengineered membranes could block carbon emissions in fossil-fueled power plants. Solar coatings as cheap as wallpaper could enable buildings to generate more power than they consume. And advanced storage technologies\u00e2\u0080\u0094from energy-dense batteries to catalysts that harness sunlight to split water and create hydrogen fuel\u00e2\u0080\u0094could stabilize grids and power vehicles. The wish list goes on: new ways to tap previously inaccessible reservoirs of geothermal energy, biofuels that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t compete with food crops, and ultra-efficient equipment to heat and cool buildings. Every one of those advances is possible, but most need a fundamental breakthrough in the lab or a first-of-its-kind demonstration project in the field.\u201dNone of these technologies are mysterious or non-existent, but they will require resources and time to achieve commercial entry and displace fossil fuels. Dr. Romm argues that the pace of previous energy transitions and the colossal amounts of capital required for such a transition preclude next-generation technologies from playing a major role before 2050.\u201cIf we have a viable pathway at building nuclear power in smaller bites, the whole financing structure can change and make it much more affordable\u00e2\u0080\u00a6If we can demonstrate let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s say the first modular reactor in the early part of the next decade, then what we hope is it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part of the planning process in the middle of the next decade for our utilities. Around 2030 the 60-year lifetime of existing reactors will start to kick in, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a time period when utility commitments to a new round of nuclear will be especially important\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 If a couple of [the more than 50 privately funded companies developing advanced nuclear technologies] make it it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a big deal.\u201dPartnering Innovation with DeploymentDr. Romm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s third contention is actually one on which we share substantial common ground. We should celebrate the fall in the costs of several clean energy technologies as a function of their cumulative production (the \u00e2\u0080\u009cexperience\u00e2\u0080\u009d effect). But I do disagree with Dr. Romm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s extrapolation that existing technologies will suffice to meet the climate challenge. Still, I think that their deployment plays an important role in paving the way for superior technologies to succeed them.Deployment and innovation go hand in hand. Sometimes, policies that encourage deployment can discourage innovation. I contend, for example, that some solar deployment policies create ring-fenced markets in which mature technologies can lock out emerging competitors through incumbency advantages. But in most cases, public and private resources for deployment do not come at the expense of resources for innovation. And by holistically designing policies that support both emerging technologies as well as mature ones, as we argue in our essay, policymakers can most cost-effectively confront climate change. We assert that a price on carbon, in conjunction with increased support for research, development, and demonstration of innovative clean energy technologies, can best coordinate innovation with deployment.I hope this resonates with anyone committed to the cause of combating climate change. I invite Dr. Romm and others who might disagree with me to engage in civil discourse\u00e2\u0080\u0094we have a lot to learn from each other. And if we find we have irreconcilable differences, I will be more than happy to respectfully agree to\u00c2\u00a0disagree.Keep it up, Varun and Teryn.In today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s political world of binary debates, is there a way to get traction simultaneously on both deployment of today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clean tech where it makes the most sense and on greatly boosting spending on fundamental science related to energy systems?\nI\u2019ve explained my thinking in two slides that build on an important 2003 study of ecosystem resilience.

{"Headline": "Fraud Charges Mar a Plan to Aid a Struggling Vermont Region", "Date": "2016-05-10", "News": "Supported byNEWPORT, Vt. \u2014 Jo-Ann Brooks grimaced as she looked out the window of her jewelry store in this tiny town in northern Vermont, near the Canadian border. Across Main Street, an entire block of shops and apartments was razed more than a year ago in the expectation of a new \u201crenaissance\u201d development that has yet to materialize. In its place is a gaping hole, with old concrete cellars.\u201cWe call it Little Beirut,\u201d Ms. Brooks said. \u201cIt looks like it was bombed.\u201dThe hole is a visual monument to the failed plans of two ambitious businessmen who vowed to revitalize this struggling region, known as the Northeast Kingdom. With an $850 million dream, they promised the biggest economic development in Vermont history. They planned to finance it through a federal program that allows wealthy foreign citizens to invest $500,000 in projects in distressed areas in return for green cards, leading to permanent residency in the United States.Instead, the two have been accused of perpetrating the biggest fraud in Vermont history \u2014 as well as in the history of that federal visa program, known as EB-5.The allegations against Mr. Stenger particularly stung people here because they had known him for decades as a friend and civic-minded neighbor. He was not accused of siphoning money for his personal use, but the S.E.C. said he \u201cextremely recklessly ceded control of investor funds to Quiros\u201d and \u201cdid almost nothing to manage investor money, even when confronted with red flags of Quiros\u2019 misuse.\u201dIn an email interview, Mr. Stenger said he could not discuss the specific allegations against him. But in his most extensive comments yet on the situation, he said he knew he had let people down.\u201cBetrayal is a strong term, and I understand the disappointment because I\u2019m terribly disappointed not to be able to finish the work I started,\u201d he said. Still, he said, the projects have generated 6,500 direct and indirect jobs of the 10,000 he promised for rural Orleans County, the poorest in the state. He estimated that 650 of nearly 800 investors already have or would get their green cards.\u201cI\u2019m terribly upset that some of these folks could be at risk,\u201d he said, adding that he was seeking to make them financially whole.He said his \u201cbiggest heartbreak\u201d was the failure to build the biotech firm, called AnC Bio, which the S.E.C. said was \u201cnearly a complete fraud.\u201dMr. Leahy, a longtime Stenger backer, has been one of the biggest supporters of the EB-5 program, seeing it as an important tool for economic development. Indeed, it is working successfully in other projects in Vermont. But because of fraud in the program elsewhere, he was already pushing for an overhaul. Now, he says unless fundamental changes are made, \u201cEB-5 will die, and it should die.\u201d\u201cThere isn\u2019t a human being on this earth, when you go through a disappointment like this, that doesn\u2019t ask, \u2018Couldn\u2019t something have been done to find this sooner?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Shumlin said in an interview. \u201cWe all wish the answer were yes, we all wish we got subpoena power to look at accounts earlier. But there was no reason to believe that what the developers were representing wasn\u2019t true.\u201dBut others say the state was lax in pursuing hints of trouble, in part because officials trusted Mr. Stenger and had high hopes that the development could stimulate the economy.\u201cI didn\u2019t know there was a Ponzi scheme or fraud,\u201d Mr. Gibson said. \u201cBut I had suspicions that they couldn\u2019t repay their initial investors and that they were taking investor money to pay for ongoing operations. And everyone told me to bug off.\u201dMohammed Adil, 49, an Indian who runs a fashion retail company and who wanted his four daughters to be educated in the United States, said he invested $550,000 in Jay Peak in 2012.\u201cI thought, if the government is giving out visas, there must be checks and balances on this program,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we have ended up in the soup, our money is probably gone and our green card is in trouble.\u201dSimilarly, Felipe Vieira, 50, a financial analyst who moved his family to Vermont from Brazil in 2013, invested in townhouses at Jay Peak that are half finished. His chief concern is staying in the United States.\u201cGoing back would feel like an enormous personal failure,\u201d he said.Even as they contemplate financial losses, some investors said they might put more money into the unfinished projects; creating at least 10 jobs is a condition of obtaining a green card.\u201cThe investors don\u2019t want to liquidate; they want these jobs to continue so they can get their green cards,\u201d Mr. Shumlin said. Noting that Jay Peak plans to stay open and pay its employees, he added, \u201cIn two years, this will look like a bump in the road to good jobs and great resorts.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Treasury Dept.\u2019s Never-Ending Fight to Combat Tax Cheats", "Date": "2016-05-09", "News": "Supported byWhite Collar WatchBenjamin Franklin once pointed out that \u201cin this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.\u201d Evading taxes and shielding ill-gotten gains are an effort to avoid some of that certainty, but as much as the government tries to battle corruption in the financial system, it will almost never be enough.Like other well-intentioned steps to fight corruption, they will make it a little bit harder to shift money around anonymously, but ultimately will be only a modest impediment to stanching the flood of illicit funds that course through the economy.If it involves a cat, it shows how remarkably easy it is to create an anonymous entity that can be used for almost any purpose, whether nefarious or benign.How much of a barrier the new Treasury Department rules will erect to the misuse of shell companies to hide assets remains to be seen. Ownership of a L.L.C. or other corporate entity could be divided among five holders, none crossing the 25 percent threshold, to stay below the customer information requirement. The use of nominees holding purported interests in a shell can still take place to shield the true owner\u2019s identity, although perhaps if the same names appear on regulatory filings with some regularity then investigators will at least have a lead on who to scrutinize.A third proposal would make it easier for the Justice Department to introduce the records obtained from foreign banks in court, relaxing the requirements under the rules of evidence for submission of these documents.The legislative proposals will require approval by Congress, which may not be likely during the run up to the November elections when few bills are likely to be considered unless they are urgent.There is also the question of whether requiring greater disclosure of who controls a corporate entity goes too far in denigrating the privacy rights of the owners. There are legitimate reasons to hide one\u2019s wealth from public disclosure, especially in those parts of the world where that information could make one a target for extortion or kidnapping. Just because a criminal can use a corporate shell to hide ill-gotten gains does not necessarily mean that most, or even many, of these entities are used for illegitimate reasons.Balancing the needs of law enforcement with the privacy interests of individuals is always difficult, as the recent fight over iPhone encryption between Apple and the Justice Department amply demonstrates. How far the need to gather information on the identity of owners should go is an issue Congress will have to settle.Even if President Obama gets everything on the wish list of changes being suggested, there remains the problem of how effective they would be in fighting corruption. Money is like water, following the path of least resistance. Impediments to anonymously transferring and holding assets may slow the flow in the short term, but are unlikely to put much of a dent in how illicit funds move through the financial system because there always seem to be new avenues to hide their ownership.That does not mean that pushing for greater transparency in the ownership of assets and making it easier to prosecute money laundering are not worth the effort. But the proposed changes should be seen for what they are \u2014 small steps in a continuing battle.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York Plans to Make Fighting Climate Change Good Business", "Date": "2016-05-09", "News": "Supported byBy DegreesA governor wants to lead on green energy. The state\u2019s utilities are nervously falling in line. Young entrepreneurs are buzzing, determined to be part of the generation that finally solves climate change.To most ears, that might sound like California, where all those things and more are happening. But it also describes New York.New York?The state may not leap to mind as being in the vanguard of the green economy. But under Gov. Andrew Cuomo, the most populous state in the Northeast is in a close race with its counterpart in the West in setting ambitious climate goals. And in some ways, New York may be on the verge of pulling ahead of California.Without much fanfare, Mr. Cuomo has started a big effort to retool his state\u2019s utilities for the modern age, trying to apply market forces to transform the way electricity is produced, transmitted and consumed.Critical rules are due in coming weeks from a state agency, the Public Service Commission. Depending on the details, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s program could prove to be the most ambitious effort in the country, and possibly in the world, to enlist the profit motive as an ally in the fight against global warming.New York starts with advantages. It receives about 26 percent of its power from renewable sources already. Much of that comes from upstate dams, but wind farms have been popping up around the state, and solar power is up 575 percent in four years. Transport emissions are among the lowest in the country because of New York City\u2019s huge transit system.The state has largely shut down its coal-burning power plants, and Mr. Cuomo intends to close the rest of them by 2020. He has set a goal of getting 50 percent of the state\u2019s electricity from renewable sources by 2030.Mr. Kauffman argues that the utilities distributing electrical power are among the most hidebound, least innovative, businesses in the nation. Historically, they were monopolies that made their money by selling more electricity, building whatever power plants were necessary to produce it, and collecting the money to pay for those plants and other equipment in a sort of cost-plus business model. Some of the plants tended to sit idle, waiting to be turned on to meet peak demand a few hours a year \u2014 an enormous waste of money.New York State has been trying to get away from this system for years, adopting rules that reduced the incentive for utilities to try to sell more and more power. It successfully introduced competition in the wholesale power market. But substantial inefficiencies remain. And now, the falling costs of renewable power, the invention of devices like intelligent thermostats and electric meters, and other developments have created the possibility of sweeping change.\u201cWe need to open up the electricity system to innovation,\u201d Mr. Kauffman said in an interview.How, exactly, does the state intend to do that?The issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.The state is likely to shift the rules of how utilities are paid. New York may set targets \u2014 for instance, telling the utilities to cut the average power consumption per household, or to cut their peak demand on the hottest days \u2014 and then allow them to earn more money by meeting or exceeding those targets.The key to this system is giving the utilities a profit motive to cooperate with smaller companies that are bringing innovations to the electric grid. Take, for instance, the companies driving the national boom in the installation of solar panels.Other small companies want to help people manage their electrical demand in real time, installing water heaters or dishwashers that can turn themselves on or off to match the intermittent supply of electricity coming from wind farms and solar panels. Still others want to earn money by fixing up drafty houses that waste huge amounts of energy, just as millions of houses, with their leaky windows and barely insulated attics, do across the country.New York\u2019s public service commissioners, as they put the final touches on the plan, are no doubt torn between the desire to move quickly and the fear of messing with an electrical grid that, whatever its flaws, does work. They may well choose to start with small tweaks to the rules, meaning it could take years to know if the plan is going to succeed.Advertisement"}

I rushed around like an Alice in Wonderland reporter, looking for stories but finding mostly propaganda, all the while keeping my finger firmly pressed on a tiny flap of the grenade to stop it from going off. It was anxious work.In The Times\u2019s Beijing bureau these days, we\u2019re busy reporting the 50th anniversary of the violent political movement Mao orchestrated that lasted for about a decade until his death in 1976 and killed between 1.7 million and 20 million people, depending on whom you believe. So I\u2019m certain I\u2019m not the only person in China dreaming these days about the Chairman.We can report on it freely, but Chinese media cannot because the state still heavily censors discussion. Leaders, including President Xi Jinping, reportedly believe \u2014 hope! \u2014 that keeping a lid on the past will contribute to harmony amid today\u2019s roiling society and slowing economy. As my colleague Jonathan Ansfield remarked, \u201cWhat if I told you that Xi Jinping dreams the same dream?\u201dThe responses were powerful. They spoke of pain, fear, anger and loss, and suggested that Mao, for good and bad, runs like a red-hot wire through many people\u2019s lives.Shortly after Mao died, my mother took me to see his portrait in the Communist Party-run Bank of China on Queen\u2019s Road Central in Hong Kong. A line of grieving Chinese in dark pants and white shirts waited to pay their respects.Standing on tiptoe, I saw an enormous face in the dimness of the ground-floor hall. My mother was no Maoist, but she was born into Nazi Germany and wanted me to know what was going on around me. Still, the line was too long for a child, and she abandoned her plan to take me in.To this day, Mao is everywhere in China. When I take my kids to Fundazzle in Beijing, an indoor play hall with ball pits and climbing frames, we pay with red 100 renminbi notes that bear his face.Hail a cab and there he may be in a small gold frame dancing from the driver\u2019s rearview mirror, a talisman against accidents.He was present in Chongqing, a southwestern Chinese city that drapes the hills around the Yangtze like a riverine Hong Kong, when I traveled there in late 2011 to interview Huang Jiren, the biographer of the city\u2019s flamboyant police chief, Wang Lijun.Mr. Wang would later make a failed asylum bid, fleeing to the United States consulate in nearby Chengdu and precipitating one of the biggest crises in recent Chinese history: the fall of Bo Xilai, a \u201cred noble\u201d and the party boss of Chongqing, who extolled Mao\u2019s egalitarian ideals and revolutionary philosophies to mark out his political territory and mount a national leadership challenge. In Chongqing, choirs were singing \u201cred songs\u201d and banners praised Maoist values.It made sense to the losers of China\u2019s economic miracle, the farmers and others without political power to parlay into money. And it frightened people who had suffered under Mao.As Mr. Huang and his driver picked me up from Chongqing\u2019s new high-speed railway station, the biographer said he had just received a call from his subject, the police chief. Did I mind if we went to lunch via police headquarters?We drove into the headquarters, situated high on a hill, without a security check, just a wave of the hand from Mr. Huang. I saw tidy grounds and new office blocks, tennis courts and a courtside restaurant, a mural of the world that included the Eiffel Tower.Later, at the InterContinental Hotel, Mr. Huang leaned over the reception desk to murmur to a young woman that he wanted the usual room. We took an elevator to a high floor. There he suggested we pull the curtains in the middle of the day. It was too bright outside, he said.I looked out the window. Chongqing was draped in fog. I said no.He took my hand, tracing Chinese characters on my palm in an intimate manner. I said it was time to go.On the street outside, Mr. Huang\u2019s phone rang. The police chief wanted to see him again, he said. He would drive me back to the high-speed railway station before returning to headquarters. Any time I wanted an interview with Mr. Wang he could arrange one. Chinese contacts confirmed that Mr. Huang really was writing a biography of Mr. Wang, a flamboyant figure who wore a fedora and was said to conduct autopsies personally.I very much wanted to interview Mr. Wang. But the Mao songs, the wish for drawn curtains, the apparently well-timed phone calls from the police chief, the hand touching \u2014 I returned to Beijing convinced that something was rotten in the municipality of Chongqing, but unconvinced it was safe to return on my own. At the time, I was a freelancer for The International Herald Tribune, which later became the International New York Times, and without the resources of the bureau. I dropped it.One gets used to the money, the talismans in cars, even the clocks playing the Maoist anthem \u201cThe East Is Red.\u201dBut Mao still has the power to shock. Not long after the trip to Chongqing I stood for hours under a broiling sun outside the hall in Tiananmen Square where he lies. People were irritable, and as we approached the inner sanctum they began to shove.\u201cPlease stop pushing,\u201d I said to a man in a red T-shirt. He hissed an unprintable word at me, just as we passed Mao\u2019s dead, discolored face. It went off like a hand grenade.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Obama Presses Vietnam on Rights, Activists Are Barred From Meeting", "Date": "2016-05-24", "News": "Supported byHANOI, Vietnam \u2014 President Obama won enthusiastic applause here on Tuesday with a supportive reference to Vietnam\u2019s disputes with China, saying in a speech that \u201cbig nations should not bully smaller ones.\u201d But several activists who had been scheduled to meet with him before the speech were prevented from doing so, underscoring the gulf with Hanoi on human rights.The White House had requested the meeting as a signal to Vietnam\u2019s Communist government that the United States cares about human rights here. Mr. Obama spent more than his allotted time with the six Vietnamese civil society leaders who did attend the meeting at a JW Marriott hotel, but he said that several others had been prevented from coming.\u201cVietnam has made remarkable strides, the economy is growing quickly, the internet is booming, and there\u2019s a growing confidence here,\u201d Mr. Obama said when a group of reporters were briefly allowed into the meeting. \u201cBut as I indicated yesterday, there\u2019s still areas of significant concerns in terms of areas of free speech, freedom of assembly, accountability with respect to government.\u201d\u201cVietnam has demonstrated itself that it doesn\u2019t deserve the closer ties the U.S. is offering,\u201d said John Sifton of Human Rights Watch. \u201cDetaining or preventing civil society from meeting President Obama is not just an insult to the president, it\u2019s also a human rights abuse in itself, a deprivation of the right to freedom of expression and freedom of movement.\u201dHe had been detained by plainclothes security officers, he said later by telephone. They shoved him into a car outside his home in Hanoi at 6:30 a.m. Tuesday, confiscated his cellphone, preventing him from contacting his family, and then drove him 50 miles east of Hanoi.\u201cI was taken on a touristic tour,\u201d he said. The men declined to say why they were driving him around for seven hours, just saying to him, \u201cYou know why we have to do this.\u201dA prominent blogger and journalist, Pham Doan Trang, who had flown to the Vietnamese capital from Ho Chi Minh City on Monday, was also barred from attending. She had not been heard from since landing in Hanoi, according to Phil Robertson, deputy director of the Asia division of Human Rights Watch.The use of security forces to keep the activists from an event that the Vietnamese government had agreed to suggests that the government may have been divided over the meeting. It is unusual for a government, even one with a poor record on human rights, to allow such a gathering with an American president to proceed and then prevent some guests from attending.Benjamin Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser, said that administration officials became aware Monday night that the government was preventing some activists from attending and that American officials had objected.Still, he defended the decision to lift the arms embargo even if the government failed to immediately improve civil rights.\u201cWe believe that broadly speaking what we\u2019ve done through normalization in Vietnam is empowering the Vietnamese people,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cAnd that we can push that process forward much more effectively by deepening the relationship than by pulling back.\u201dMr. Obama also took advantage of his afternoon speech at the National Convention Center here to make the case for improving human rights in Vietnam.The audience of about 2,300 well-dressed Vietnamese, seated in red velvet seats and almost certainly vetted by the government, cheered loudly when Mr. Obama appeared. They cheered again when he said, \u201cVietnam is an independent and sovereign nation, and no other nation can impose its will on you,\u201d an apparent reference to China, which has claimed much of the seas just off Vietnam\u2019s 2,000-mile coastline.But the auditorium was notably silent when he broached the subject of human rights practices.He said that the United States was not trying to impose its form of government on Vietnam, but that some values were universal. The rights to free speech, assembly and a free press, he said, were enshrined in Vietnam\u2019s Constitution.\u201cSo, really, it\u2019s about all of us, each country, trying to consistently apply these principles,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cMaking sure those of us in government are being true to those ideals.\u201dHuman Rights Watch estimates that about 110 political dissidents are serving prison sentences in Vietnam. In March, Nguyen Huu Vinh, 60, a blogger, was sentenced to five years in jail for writing posts that were deemed to be against the government.In the weeks before Mr. Obama\u2019s arrival, the security police detained demonstrators protesting immense fish kills on the central coast, where tons of fish have washed up on shores close to a steel plant owned by a company in Taiwan. Some of the protesters had been beaten.Mr. Obama has been received warmly in Vietnam, by a government eager for a powerful ally against China but also by ordinary Vietnamese citizens.After his speech, as he met for a second time in two days with the celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain, scores of onlookers braved a downpour, cheerfully getting soaked for a glimpse.Mr. Obama briefly waded into the crowd, shaking hands and saying, \u201cThank you.\u201dLater in the afternoon, he flew to Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, where tens of thousands of people lined the streets and cheered lustily as he drove by.By then, Mr. Quang A had been returned to his house. There, he said, his 25-year-old son had been told by the police that \u201cwe took your father away because he was going to attend a meeting with Obama and we had to block him.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the location of the meeting with six activists. It was at a JW Marriott hotel, not the United States Embassy.Because of an editing error, an article on May 25 about the barring of Vietnamese activists from a meeting with President Obama during his recent visit to Hanoi referred incorrectly to one of those barred, a prominent blogger and journalist. The journalist, Pham Doan Trang, is a woman.Gardiner Harris reported from Hanoi, and Jane Perlez from Beijing.Advertisement"}

A smaller number, 41 percent, think transgender people should be allowed to use the restroom that matches the gender they identify with.Democrats, college graduates and those under the age of 45 are more supportive of allowing for gender identity in bathroom choice, while their counterparts take the opposite stance.Nearly six in 10 Americans say they think decisions about which bathroom transgender students can use in public schools should be left to individual state or local governments to decide. While a slim 51 percent majority of Democrats think it is a federal issue, more than three-quarters of Republicans say the matter should be decided at the state or local level.While the public narrowly disagrees with Mr. Obama\u2019s stance on transgender rights and the restroom policy, his overall job approval rating, at 50 percent, is at its highest level in more than three years. His approval rating briefly rose after his re-election in November 2012.However, approval for the president\u2019s handling of the economy (42 percent) and foreign policy (47 percent) remain lower than his overall rating, and the public remains pessimistic about the track the country is on and sharply critical of Congress and the way things are going in Washington.The poll also found decreased support for a vote on Judge Merrick B. Garland, whom Mr. Obama has nominated to fill the Supreme Court seat of Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February. In March, 53 percent of Americans said the Senate should hold a vote on whether to confirm Judge Garland, who is the chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, rather than wait until next year when a new president could nominate someone. In the latest poll, 48 percent of the public supported action now, while 45 percent said the Senate should wait.In the last two months, Donald J. Trump has emerged as the Republican Party\u2019s presumptive nominee, and the number of Republicans supporting a vote on Judge Garland has fallen 10 points.The telephone poll was conducted on landlines and cellphones with 1,300 adults nationwide, and it has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.

The attacks raised alarm bells because the thieves gained access to Swift, which is considered the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most secure payment messaging system. It is used by 11,000 banks and companies to move money between countries, making it a tempting target.

Oracle contended that Google used copyrighted material in the software code for the Android mobile phone operating system. Oracle asked for $9 billion from Google.

In its opinion, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago said that Epic Systems, a health care software provider in Verona, Wis., violated federal labor law when it required its workers to bring disputes individually to arbitration. The decision directly conflicts with an earlier decision by an appeals court in Louisiana and the split could prompt the Supreme Court to wade back into the fray. In a pair of decisions in 2011 and 2013, the Supreme Court blessed the use of arbitration in a case pushed by a group of credit card companies. The credit card companies turned to a 1925 federal law that formalized arbitration as a means for companies to hash out their disputes with one another.Courts across the country have largely upheld arbitration clauses, deferring to the Supreme Court, which ruled that the Federal Arbitration Act beat even federal laws.Mr. Denton assured Mr. Thiel that Gawker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s journalists would be reporting on his involvement in lawsuits against the company.  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story Advertisement"}

Politics aside, there is more good news than bad.Most other indexes are encouraging: Consumer confidence has risen and the housing market has basically recovered. Budget deficits have plummeted, there is less reliance on foreign oil than any time in almost three decades, and the health care overhaul has had more positive consequences than negative ones.Still, wages are only starting to creep up. While the federal government is frozen, more than one-third of states have increased their minimum wage.Wages should be a focus of the presidential campaign, though vows such as breaking up the banks or slapping big tariffs on Chinese imports are distractions.There is progress on cultural and social fronts, too. Bitter divides remain, but Americans have become more tolerant. Although some politicians still pander to racial prejudices, young people are more open.The same is true of sexual orientation.

There is slow progress in the fight against the Islamic State, though future terrorist acts are inevitable and the danger will remain for years.To be sure, many of the problems articulated in the campaign are real.

Today\u2019s clean energy innovators are finding power by looking beyond the expected.Consider solar energy. In the early 1950s, Bell Labs engineers were stumped with a power problem. In the tropics, batteries used by the telephone system had a habit of corroding, a humid hang-up that disrupted service. Toying with alternative power sources, engineers couldn\u2019t make a connection until someone mentioned their promising experiments with silicon, then seen as a cheap byproduct of sand. Despite the unorthodox material and methodology, they followed their gut instinct, and after endless prototypes, arrived at the Bell Solar Battery \u2014 a remarkable new device that could convert sunlight into useful electricity, and the ancestor of today\u2019s rooftop arrays. Billed as \u201ca modern version of Apollo\u2019s chariot,\u201d the technological leap suggested that, even when attempting to harness the world\u2019s most abundant energy source, success comes from serendipity, tangential thinking and vision.Kerosene lamps are the main source of nighttime light for millions of low-income households around the world \u2014 principally in Africa, China and India. Every time a family lights one up, the clock starts ticking on the amount of light they can afford and on the harm to their health from its smoky emissions.While you read this page, witness how \u2014 for the same cost of energy \u2014 the light from a kerosene lamp dwindles as you advance, while the LED\u2019s light barely changes.It\u2019s an unprecedented clean energy challenge: create affordable, scalable and decentralized power. How do you tackle a challenge of this scale? It requires progressive change, something Shell supports via Shell LiveWIRE and Shell Springboard, initiatives which have provided assistance and millions in funding to help startups and today\u2019s clean energy innovators realize their visions. Real shifts often come from small, smart and flexible ideas, ones that seem as outlandish as harvesting the sun\u2019s rays with silicon seemed more than a half century ago.Asad LiaquatFor Pakistani electrical engineer Sanwal Muneer, 22, the solution came by recasting a longtime enemy of environmentalists \u2014 traffic \u2014 as a savior and energy source. The company he co-founded with CTO Asad Liaquat and Sidra Muneer, Capture Mobility, a Shell LiveWIRE alumnus that recently won an Outstanding Achievement award from the UK Trade and Investment department, manufactures 8-foot tall columns topped with a spinning turbine, which resemble roadside artwork. But when positioned in medians or along highways, the hybrid power source uses a built-in helical turbine, turned by the wind and turbulence from passing cars and trucks, as well as solar panels, to generate electricity. Portable enough for roadsides and rural areas, the device creates enough power in a day to run a small home. Removable filters also help clean air that\u2019s been polluted by passing traffic.The idea came to Muneer in 2013, when he was competing in Shell Eco-marathon \u2014 a competition to design, build and test an energy-efficient vehicle. A stray observation led him to consider the high speed traffic turbulence which made him think about using wind turbines to capture the energy of traffic being wasted; soon he was planting prototypes beside local roads.\u201cI wanted to create something that could be scaled up easily irrespective of geography and environment,\u201d says Muneer. \u201cAvailable renewable resources might not be efficient and reliable everywhere \u2014 such as solar in Scotland \u2014 so we need to come up with innovative ways to generate clean energy to pace up with the demand.\u201dRoads are getting more crowded, but energy created by cars doesn\u2019t go to use.Displaced air created by automobile momentum is an unharvested energy source.Click to advanceThe idea came to Muneer in 2013, when he was competing in Shell Eco-marathon \u2014 a competition to design, build and test an energy-efficient vehicle.

{"Headline": "The Imperialist Roots of Our Modern Crises", "Date": "2016-05-12", "News": "Supported byLetter From EuropeLONDON \u2014 The calendar is filling with moments marking Britain\u2019s role in molding events that changed the world.On July 1, the centenary of the start of the Battle of the Somme will inspire memories of one of the bloodiest contests of World War I, which pitted French and British forces against German adversaries. A few days later, on July 6, after many delays, an official inquiry into Britain\u2019s role in the American-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 is set to finally produce its voluminous report.What binds the two is the ambiguous legacy of power projected onto foreign fields. World War I fueled an urge to build new orders as old empires collapsed. Borders were redrawn, countries carved up. The seeds that were sowed as Western powers like Britain faded after the world wars, have contributed to some of the most persistent problems and dangerous phenomena of the present. The Iraq inquiry is likely to shine a light on a weakened Britain\u2019s uncomfortable role in trying to fix some of the mistakes that were born less than a century after the Somme.Frail nations shaped by the victors of World War I have faced challenges of their own \u2014 the Arab Spring convulsed North Africa and the Middle East, and Iraq and Syria descended into turmoil, helping give rise to the Islamic State.Frontiers redrawn after World War I could not contain the populations within them. The claimed right of imperial-minded Westerners to expand their presence and influence has been reversed.That, in turn, has redefined the balance of geopolitical advantage. A million Chinese settlers in sub-Saharan Africa have recast economies and alliances there. Remittances by India\u2019s 20-million-strong diaspora account for a significant 4 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product, Mr. Leonard said. Turkey\u2019s geographic position as a land bridge, once a bulwark against the Soviet Union in the Cold War, now enables its leaders to use the Syrian refugee crisis as a high-stakes diplomatic lever to pursue its ambitions in Western Europe.For many in the West, migration is a narrow, not-in-my-backyard issue, often depicted as a zero-sum competition for access to national largess that many Europeans fear will be jeopardized by an influx of outsiders \u2014 from other European countries and beyond.Almost reflexively, the contest assumes an ominous ethnic profile. Consider, for instance, Donald J. Trump\u2019s pledge to bar Muslims from the United States.In some part, the anniversary of the Somme commemorates Britain\u2019s role in the power plays of the past. The country\u2019s role in the power plays of the present and future are at issue in another significant date that is just around the corner. On June 23, voters in Britain will decide in a referendum whether to leave the European Union.Increasingly, that closely fought debate is linked to Britain\u2019s ability to control migration across its borders \u2014 and to the interlinked question of whether the country would be more secure if it pulled out of the 28-nation bloc.The imponderables reach far beyond Britain\u2019s frontiers. According to the United Nations, there are about 244 million migrants who live and work in countries where they were not born. Moreover, wars and upheaval, the organization says, have created roughly 20 million refugees and left 40 million displaced in their own countries.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Anger Overflows in Nigeria as Economy Dives", "Date": "2016-05-09", "News": "Supported by7 PhotosLAGOS, Nigeria \u2014 Young men became entangled in a swirl of flying fists. Gas station workers swatted away boys hoping to fill their plastic cans. A mother with a sleeping baby in her minivan was chased off, rightly accused of jumping the line. A driver eager to get ahead crashed into several cars, the sound of crunching metal barely registering amid the noise.Nigerians were getting used to days like this.But then came the ultimate insult to everyone waiting at the Oando mega gas station: A bus marked Ministry of Justice rolled up to a pump, leapfrogging no fewer than 99 vehicles. \u201cService With Integrity\u201d was painted on its door. A gas station supervisor who calls herself Madame No Nonsense stepped aside to let it fuel up before anyone else. The crowd howled at the injustice.\u201cStarvation in the land of plenty,\u201d said Tony Usidamen, a public relations consultant waiting for fuel.In this country of rampant inequality, the poor have long been desperate, and the rich are still able to buy their way out of problems. But the situation in Nigeria, Africa\u2019s largest economy, is having an outsize impact on the expanding middle class, which has become accustomed to air-conditioning, owning a car and going out for Domino\u2019s pizza. Now, even a bottle of Perrier is too expensive for many.\u201cWe are experiencing probably the toughest economic times in the history of our nation,\u201d Mr. Buhari told Nigerians on Friday. \u201cI cannot promise you that this will be an easy journey.\u201dImported fuel has been arriving in Lagos, a city of 20 million, by tanker truck, a trip that takes a week. Old trucks and bad roads cause delays. Trucks sometimes disappear across the border, where thieves sell the fuel and pocket the cash, and militants keep blowing up oil platforms and pipelines.The lines at gas stations ebb and flow, depending on the day. But the government says the supply is getting better. It has finally fired up Nigeria\u2019s three rickety oil refineries, and the wait in Lagos improved drastically last week. Eventually, officials say, Nigeria will make all of its own gasoline.At the gas station in Lagos, Olafay Segun and Abu Bellow tried to sleep away the pain of losing a morning of valuable fares in their yellow minibus. They joined a huge line of vehicles backed up along the expressway. Both men stretched across the old metal seats. In the beating sun, it was like sleeping inside a TV dinner.Suddenly, the car in front gave up on the wait, pulling out of line and leaving a gap. Mr. Bellow bolted for the driver\u2019s seat, turning the key. Nothing happened. Long seconds passed as both men panicked that someone would pull in front of them. He tried the key again. Success. The bus jolted ahead a few feet.They wound up behind Adeanike Oso, whose mind was on her chickens. As the owner of Oso Farms, a 3,500-bird operation outside Lagos, she worried they might not have enough food and water.That morning, Ms. Oso had dropped off her children at school before heading to the farm, but her Nissan Pathfinder was running low on fuel so she pulled into line. That was two hours ago.Toward the front was Toyin Adeniyi, who was on her way to work as a school administrator. Three hours after arriving at the station, she was still waiting.As midmorning arrived, young men holding plastic gas cans gathered. \u201cThere\u2019s no light, there\u2019s no water, there\u2019s no anything,\u201d said one, Michael Tungi, venting about Nigeria. \u201cEverything is spoiled.\u201dThe station was not allowed to sell gas to Mr. Tungi, to prevent fuel from slipping onto the black market. People had been filling jerrycans and selling gas at high prices to drivers looking to skip long lines at filling stations. Mr. Tungi and the others were optimists, hoping to sneak a few liters.First they would have to get past Nike Olorunfemi, 50, the station supervisor. Wearing a straw hat and bright yellow vest, she hollered, sometimes with a bullhorn, to let them know they were waiting in vain.\u201cThat\u2019s why they call me Madame No Nonsense Action Lady,\u201d Ms. Olorunfemi said. \u201cI don\u2019t take nonsense.\u201dThe day had started out orderly and calm. Drivers inched forward. The procrastinators, the planners, the innocents \u2014 the line absorbed them all, having mercy on no one.\u201cI\u2019m late already,\u201d grumbled Peter Ademola, a swimming pool maintenance man. He had hopped into a minibus, heading to a repair job, but it was low on fuel. Now he was stuck in line, wiping his brow. Tiny beads of sweat formed above the purple lipstick of the passenger next to him.\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d Mr. Ademola said.Another driver, Ify Ezeobi, a shopkeeper, figured every hour of waiting cost him $100 worth of business at his store. \u201cI\u2019m sick and tired of this,\u201d he said.It was almost noon when the line stopped altogether. The station\u2019s supply had run dry. Vehicles squealed away to search for fuel elsewhere. It was anyone\u2019s guess when the next fuel truck would arrive.Some drivers made use of the empty hours until more fuel came. A policeman read over a stack of witness statements. One driver repaired a busted side mirror. A doughnut saleswoman paraded alongside the vehicles. Old friends found one another in line, their reunion an upside to the otherwise grim day.The hottest part of the day came and, with it, stress. A mother made the calculations of every busy parent \u2014 if she waited, would she get to school in time to pick up her children? Three energetic boys bounced in the back seat of another car, hanging out the windows and slugging one another. It was the first day of vacation and their father needed gas to reach their grandparents outside the city.A billboard with a man clutching his head taunted the stalled motorists: \u201cNeed pain relief?\u201dMs. Olorunfemi \u2014 Madame No Nonsense \u2014 was still trying to chase off the people holding gas cans. She snatched a can from one man\u2019s hand and threw it onto the freeway.\u201cAnybody jumping the queue, they call Action Lady and I send them out,\u201d she said. \u201cI hate cheating.\u201dBut by afternoon, cheating was in abundance. Some drivers employed a fried-chicken strategy: gaining entrance inside the station\u2019s parking lot by claiming they were patronizing the adjoining KFC.At 2 p.m., a fuel truck rolled in, eliciting a cheer. But unloading its 33,000 liters would take hours.Two men lugging a heavy generator rested it on the driveway. Three elementary-age boys, sent by their mothers, arrived after school with plastic cans to try their luck.At nearly 5 p.m., fuel was finally in the pumps again. Drivers started their engines. Wheels spun in the dirt. Station employees blocked off the cars at the KFC, dashing the hopes of line jumpers. Workers gathered around Madame No Nonsense for a pep talk.\u201cDon\u2019t sell to anyone with a can,\u201d she said. \u201cBe nice to all your customers.\u201dHorns started blaring. A security guard in T-shirt and jeans, with an AK-47 slung around his chest, stepped in front of the vehicles. The station\u2019s gates scraped open.\u201cO.K.,\u201d Madame No Nonsense said. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cloak of Secrecy Fuels Anxiety Over Trans-Atlantic Trade Talks", "Date": "2016-05-16", "News": "Supported byLetter From EuropePARIS \u2014 Opposition to a sweeping trade deal between the United States and the European Union has gathered strength in Europe in recent weeks, but with a twist: The latest objections have less to do with what is known to be at stake, and more about what is unknown.While Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany defended the treaty during a visit to her country by President Obama in late April, Sigmar Gabriel, the economy minister in her coalition government, led the charge for greater transparency.Secrecy, Mr. Gabriel said, only \u201ccreates a lot of conspiracy; this creates mistrust.\u201dBoth American and European negotiators dismissed the Greenpeace leaks as \u201cmisleading at best\u201d and \u201cflatly wrong,\u201d contending that they reflected a work in progress, not final documents.According to a popular European perspective, the closed-door strategy is an American condition that is putting European citizens, their agricultural products and strict environmental standards at the mercy of United States-based corporations.\u201cThe way is being cleared for a race to the bottom in environmental, consumer protection and public health standards,\u201d Greenpeace said.Both sides agree that confidentiality is essential to any sensitive negotiations \u2014 a condition that was applied to earlier trade talks involving the European Union and other countries, with little objection in European capitals.To strike a balance between secrecy and transparency, for instance, members of Congress and 600 identified stakeholders \u2014 environmentalists, unions and companies \u2014 have been given security clearance to regularly review the American negotiating positions.In Europe, parliamentary deputies have also been given access to working documents, but under strict conditions that some European politicians find objectionable.The documents can be viewed only at guarded sites, and French deputies have complained that the information amounts to little more than \u201ctactical summaries\u201d that provide few details on the state of negotiations.Since 2013, Europe has scored points by publicly taking some sensitive subjects off the table, starting with a \u201ccultural exception\u201d for movies and other audiovisual materials, a demand first put forward by France.But there is still a great deal of uncertainty, and anxiety, over a broad range of subjects that may, or may not, lead to lower standards for food safety and the environment, a rise in pharmaceutical prices and other issues that have struck fear in the hearts of many in Europe.However, so-called geographical indications, a European practice that gives regions the exclusive right to label their products \u2014 like Parma ham, or Roquefort cheese \u2014 remain a heated issue. American negotiators argue that these products are protected under existing trademark law, which the Europeans regard as too loose.In France, geographical indications are regarded as sacrosanct, a \u201cred line\u201d that no government would dare to cross.Earlier this month, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France bowed to popular opinion when he said that the country\u2019s position on the treaty, as it now stands, would be \u201cno.\u201dBut where do negotiations stand? That is an open question.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "North Korea\u2019s Party Congress Explained: A Coronation for Kim Jong-un", "Date": "2016-05-05", "News": "Supported byFriday is the start of North Korea\u2019s most important political meeting in 36 years: the seventh congress of the ruling Workers\u2019 Party. Thousands of delegates from around the country are in Pyongyang, the capital, whose residents have been mobilized to welcome them. But beyond the choreographed pageantry and fervor, there are reasons to watch the proceedings closely.In theory, the Workers\u2019 Party rules North Korea, and the congress is where its most important decisions are made. Delegates will elect the party\u2019s central committee, which will choose the Politburo and the party\u2019s top boss, the first secretary. (Kim Jong-un is, to say the least, highly likely to retain that post.) The congress also reviews past policies and adopts new party lines._____By the time Kim Jong-il inherited power in the mid-1990s, the North\u2019s economy had collapsed after decades of mismanagement, the disintegration of the Soviet bloc and a series of droughts and floods. Famine is believed to have killed more than two million citizens during the 1990s. Kim Jong-il\u2019s response to the crisis was to rely on a military of 1.1 million to ensure internal security, and the army replaced the Workers\u2019 Party as the main governing body. Kim Jong-il retained his party titles as well as military ones, but he never convened a party congress, which spared him from having to address the subject of the famine._____\u201cWith this party congress, Kim Jong-un is restoring the party as the main governing agency,\u201d said Lim Eul-chul, an analyst at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies in Seoul, South Korea. Under Mr. Kim, the Workers\u2019 Party has regained powers and perks that it ceded to the army under his father\u2019s rule, including the lucrative right to export coal. The new party leadership he puts together \u2014 approved by delegates who, though technically chosen in local elections, are actually handpicked loyalists \u2014 will make the party truly his own. That is why some analysts have likened the congress to Mr. Kim\u2019s coronation and called it the official start of the Kim Jong-un era.__________At that congress, North Korea also mobilized a million people in Pyongyang for a rally. Nearly 120 countries sent delegates to the capital that year, including senior officials from the Chinese and Soviet Communist Parties. This time, as the North\u2019s circle of friendly nations has shrunk considerably, the congress will be a domestic affair, though some foreign journalists have been invited to cover it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "He Survived Ebola. Now He\u2019s Fighting to Keep It From Spreading.", "Date": "2016-05-26", "News": "Supported byFeatureIt was just 100 miles south of here, in a village called Meliandou near the Sierra Leonean and Liberian borders, that the Ebola epidemic began in December 2013. More than 28,600 people were infected, and more than 11,300 people died over the two years that followed. Guinea, which is more than double the size and population of Sierra Leone or Liberia, the other two hardest-hit nations, had a difficult time stamping out the virus and was the last to be declared \u201cEbola free,\u201d in late December 2015. In each country, the virus has flared again, most recently in Guinea, with eight deaths in March 2016 alone.The fatality rate in the Faranah prefecture was extremely high. Eighty-four percent of the 62 reported cases died, and almost half died at home rather than in a medical facility. The nearest Ebola treatment center was a five-hour drive away, and there were widespread rumors that the centers were actually covers for human experimentation, or that Cond\u00e9 had manufactured the epidemic as a ploy to draw international aid money. The rumors about Cond\u00e9 took hold around Faranah even though the president comes from the same Maninka ethnolinguistic group as the region\u2019s inhabitants, which would typically assuage their skepticism. But faith in the government, which has long been plagued by incompetence and corruption, was already fragile, and the fear and misunderstanding around Ebola shattered it entirely. In Faranah, a mob of several dozen angry residents attacked the maternity center, which was being used as a base for the Red Cross. They defaced the facility, destroyed equipment and set fire to a Doctors Without Borders vehicle parked outside. Nationwide, Guinea had a much higher fatality rate (66 percent) than Liberia (45 percent) or Sierra Leone (30 percent) \u2014 in part probably because of the population\u2019s determined avoidance of medical support.Even if citizens had trusted the government medical workers enough to seek care, the country\u2019s feeble health care system would have had little to offer them. The government of Guinea devotes only 2 percent of its gross domestic product to health care, amounting to about $12 per person in 2013. That figure would need to be closer to $44 to support a bare minimum of \u201cbasic lifesaving services,\u201d according to the World Health Organization, and the country has among the worst maternal-, infant- and child-mortality rates in the world to show for that gap. Ten percent of children die before the age of 5, and nearly a third die before 15, most from malaria, diarrhea or pneumonia. Many villages have no trained health workers, and sick or pregnant patients must travel long distances on foot to access even rudimentary care at a health outpost \u2014 usually just a bare room with an auxiliary nurse who has little more than malaria test kits and some training in assisting childbirth. Even the largest hospitals operate without running water, sanitation, consistent electricity or reliable stores of medications or equipment. The danger of pandemic emergence is highest where the levels of health care infrastructure and resources are low, and 28 other countries around the world struggle with health systems as weak as Guinea\u2019s, or worse.During the epidemic, Western media outlets focused much attention on the billion-dollar scramble for high-tech medical solutions \u2014 vaccines, or antiviral drugs like ZMapp \u2014 that are still making their way through clinical trials and certifications. But the initiative that holds the most promise for preventing another epidemic is as rudimentary as they come. The governments of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, with assistance from the W.H.O. and NGOs, have tried to train all government health workers in a standard set of practices called Infection Prevention and Control (I.P.C.) and provide these workers with the low-tech, inexpensive equipment \u2014 soap, wash buckets, hand sanitizer, gloves, masks, long-sleeved gowns \u2014 needed to put those practices into effect. It amounts to basic hygiene, with an emphasis on hand-washing, which remains the single most effective practice for preventing the transmission of infectious disease. The I.P.C. trainings in West Africa are adapted for the realities of conditions on the ground, where access to plentiful running water, plumbing, electricity and cleaning supplies is often lacking, and infection-prevention protocols are unfamiliar.In Guinea, as new cases of Ebola continue to appear, the front-line soldiers in this fight will be the health workers in Faranah and other towns across the countryside. Most did not complete high school, and some struggle with French, the language of higher education in the country. Many serve in communities where literacy rates are less than 25 percent, germ theory is unfamiliar and trust in government is low. Their success in adopting infection-prevention practices and in recognizing symptoms of Ebola and other deadly infectious diseases \u2014 and keeping themselves and other patients from spreading them \u2014 is crucial to preventing the next dangerous outbreak from becoming another epidemic.For years, Diallo has been affiliated with an NGO called Jhpiego, originally the Johns Hopkins Program for International Education in Gynecology and Obstetrics. When the Ebola crisis arose, Jhpiego already had a network of Guinean doctors, nurses and midwives ready to serve as \u201cmaster trainers\u201d for the health system. Their expertise was easily up\u00adgraded to Ebola, and the director of the W.H.O.\u2019s Ebola response in Guinea described them to me as providing the \u201cgold standard\u201d of training in the country. Now, when Diallo was not at the medical center, he was conducting I.P.C. trainings around the country as a Jhpiego instructor.I joined Diallo and his colleagues Dr. Kadiatou Traor\u00e9 and Kaba Kourtim Saran, a midwife, in Faranah in November at a disused building \u2014 basically an empty concrete room \u2014 that belonged to the municipal government. Hefty wooden tables and chairs had been arranged in a U shape, leaving just enough space for 13 men and 12 women to wedge themselves around the perimeter. A few Ebola educational posters had been stuck to the walls with strips of masking tape. On one, graphic cartoons depicted a man suffering from each Ebola symptom \u2014 bloody diarrhea, fever, bleeding nose and gums, muscle and joint pain, bloody vomiting and skin eruptions \u2014 as he is beckoned into a neat, white health post by a welcoming lab-coated caretaker. Another poster depicted ways to avoid infection, with big red Xs over drawings of dangerous situations representing the \u201cdon\u2019ts\u201d: a pair of people carrying a corpse; a family weeping and embracing a deceased loved one; a frying pan filled with flesh, which a thought bubble indicated came from a bat, a squirrel or a monkey. Next to the don\u2019ts were the \u201cdos\u201d: the steps of proper hand-washing.The trainees shrugged their way into the gauzy smocks, helping one another with the sticky tabs behind the neck, then unraveled the bonnets and tucked their hair inside. Diallo walked around the room, face impassive, gauging their level of experience, stopping to offer a few words of correction here and there or demonstrate procedure. He moved with economy, touching materials with just the tips of his fingers, minimizing the surface area of contact.Elisa, a young midwife from Conakry doing a temporary rotation in a rural health center, confidently peeled open the envelope of sterile, individually packaged gloves, pressing its edges flat to the table. She pinched the wrist of the glove delicately, placed the fingertips of her other hand inside the opening, then slipped on the glove in a single motion, pulling it over the edge of her smock sleeve. The trainee next to her watched her out of the corner of his eye. Failing to recognize the purpose of sterile-packaged gloves, he picked them up in his hand, flipping them around until he picked one, stretched it on over his fist, then struggled to tug each finger into place, pulling at the palm, with no regard for contamination.5 Photos\u201cWhat service do you work in?\u201d Dr. Yolande Hyjazi, the Guinea director of Jhpiego, asked him brusquely.Traor\u00e9 began a circuit of the room carrying a small plastic bottle. Onto the students\u2019 gloved palms, she squirted a tablespoon of bright red paint. \u201cClose your eyes and wash your hands,\u201d she instructed from the front of the room. Diallo walked slowly from student to student, waving at them to close their eyes. \u201cWash like you usually do,\u201d he directed.Despite its fearsome reputation, Ebola is transmissible only once an infected person is heavily symptomatic. The virus itself can be killed with a simple, thorough scrubbing of hands or surfaces with a chlorine solution or alcohol-based sanitizer; even a careful washing with soap and water can remove it.The students began rubbing their palms together vigorously, paint smearing over the insides of their hands. Most knew to flip each hand over to scrub the back with their fingers interlaced. But only a few knew all the steps they were expected to complete \u2014 cupping the fingers together with one palm up and the other down and rotating the first two joints underneath each other; swirling the fingertips in each palm; grasping and twisting around each thumb and then each wrist. After 30 seconds, Diallo told them to stop and hold up their hands. Dull patches of ivory-colored latex mottled the glossy red paint where they had failed to clean their thumbs, pinkies or the tips or sides of their fingers.Their next challenge, he told them, was to remove the gloves as if the paint were infected blood, avoiding any contamination. He walked around the room, inspecting their efforts to invert the soiled gloves. He complimented one student who had deftly wrapped one glove neatly into the other. Approaching another, he pointed to a red swipe on his skin.His delivery was deadpan, and nearby students snickered nervously. Traor\u00e9 and Hyjazi looked at the students Diallo had just reprimanded and burst out laughing. Traor\u00e9 waved her arms, theatrically warding them off and backing away as Hyjazi pointed. \u201cWatch out,\u201d Hyjazi said. \u201cThey\u2019ll give you Ebola!\u201d The room erupted in laughter.On Aug. 25, 2014, Diallo was called into an emergency operation at Matam, where he delivers babies. Earlier in the day, his colleague and former student, Dr. Seyni Gu\u00e9mou, had performed a cesarean on a patient whose baby\u2019s heartbeat had become dangerously slow and weak during delivery. Despite receiving immediate care from a neonatal intensive care doctor, the baby did not survive, and it quickly became apparent that the mother was having complications, hemorrhaging alarming quantities of blood. She was rushed back into the surgery room, and Diallo worked with Gu\u00e9mou and two assistants to stem the bleeding, ultimately removing the woman\u2019s uterus.\u201cBut the bleeding didn\u2019t stop,\u201d Diallo told me as we sat in the cramped staff room at Matam, shaking his head as he remembered his bewilderment. \u201cHer skin itself was bleeding.\u201d It was unlike anything he had seen before.Only 45 people had died from Ebola in Conakry at that point. Rushing into a life-or-death operation and worrying only about the health of the mother, the surgical team hadn\u2019t thought they might need anything other than their regular kit, a substandard ensemble they fatalistically call \u201ckamikaze\u201d: short-sleeved cotton scrubs, rubber apron, latex gloves, paper surgical mask, goggles, bonnet. It was only while standing next to her body, covered in her blood, that Diallo began to suspect that the mother might have been infected.He sought out the anesthesiologist, who told him that the woman had presented with a high fever, but she was given antibiotics, and the fever dropped. The matron attending her in the delivery room confirmed that the woman vomited, and experienced diarrhea, but she considered those normal in labor.Diallo returned to the staff room, which, like the rest of the medical centers in Guinea, did not have running water. He scrubbed a cut on his left forearm vigorously with bleach, then gathered the team to inform them to prepare for the near certainty that all of them had contracted the Ebola virus.Gu\u00e9mou was the first to fall ill, five days after the operation. As Day 7, Day 10 arrived, more of the team \u2014 the three surgical assistants involved in the cesarean or the hysterectomy, the intensive-care doctor who took charge of the baby \u2014 developed fevers. On Day 13, Diallo asked his wife to take their four children from their apartment. She settled the kids with family, but returned to his side and refused to leave. He was certain he had contracted the virus. He organized his papers and wrote out instructions for his wife in the event of his death.Finally, on Day 15, his temperature began to rise. He immediately made arrangements to leave for the Doctors Without Borders Ebola treatment unit (E.T.U.), which had been set up in a huge bare lot next to Conakry\u2019s largest hospital. His wife begged him to wait, to be certain it wasn\u2019t malaria, but he was firm. He asked her to leave the apartment, lock it behind her and stay away until tests confirmed his diagnosis. If he was quarantined, the Red Cross would sterilize the apartment before her return.He called his driver, informed him that he had Ebola and asked him to bring the car and leave it running, with the door open and the keys inside. He wanted to drive himself to the E.T.U. without putting anyone else at risk. When the driver insisted on taking him, Diallo asked him to open the right rear door, then return to the driver\u2019s seat. As he told me this, he sketched an agitated diagram on a scrap of paper, the rectangle of the car body, with an X in the back corner for him, an X in the opposite front corner for the driver. At the E.T.U. \u2014 a plastic village of mud-spattered white tents navigated through a maze of waist-high channels bounded by orange netting that was meant to keep the uninfected from stumbling upon the infected \u2014 he made certain the attendants sterilized the car before the driver left. \u201cI contaminated no one,\u201d he insisted.The worst of the symptoms followed several days later. For five days, he could barely move, even to turn his own body in his cot. He could talk on his cellphone, but if it fell on the floor, he was helpless to retrieve it. Attendants would tuck the phone under his ear, lift him to give him water, food and medication and to clean what he couldn\u2019t keep down.\u201cIt was all these acts that saved me,\u201d he said. In a photograph taken 16 days after his arrival, his shoulders are shrunken, his frame swamped by the red T-shirt he is wearing. There is an IV port in his arm, but he is standing, and smiling weakly. Others from his team weren\u2019t so lucky. Of the six who contracted the virus, the other two doctors and one assistant did not survive. The doctor who had taken charge of the infected infant died on the floor of the E.T.U. as Diallo watched, helpless.After 18 days, Diallo was released. In the absence of him and his team, hundreds of women who would otherwise have given birth at Matam were left to deliver their babies at home. Women had been calling the center, asking about him. They took his recovery as a sign that the worst was over, and began returning to Matam for his care.Soon after, he received a call from Dr. Yolande Hyjazi, asking him to consider an active role in Jhpiego\u2019s I.P.C. training for Ebola prevention. Jhpiego\u2019s records indicate that the rate of Ebola transmission to health care workers dropped to 0 to 5 percent from 5 to 35 percent after training. Diallo had seen the impact at Matam, where, after I.P.C. training, the staff recognized and referred a number of pregnant women with Ebola to the appropriate treatment facilities, with no transmission to staff or other patients at Matam. He was eager to assist.\u201cThe concern I have is this: This will not stop repeating,\u201d Diallo told me. \u201cIt is endemic here now, like malaria. We must be ready at every moment.\u201d When he travels for Jhpiego, he is often the first Ebola survivor many of the trainees have met. Their vigilance in identifying the signs of the Ebola virus \u2014 which overlap with common ailments like malaria \u2014 is crucial. He is not shy about using himself as an object lesson in the high stakes of their work, from using Matam\u2019s tragedy to add weight to his lessons. And the students respond, listening a little more carefully, watching a little more closely.One of the gravest missteps at the beginning of the outbreak led those with Ebola in the wrong direction \u2014 i.e., toward local healers and away from medical centers. At that time, authorities, hoping to convey how important it was to follow steps to avoid contracting the virus, stressed that there was no medication and no vaccine. But this message unintentionally suggested that it was futile to seek treatment. (Eventually the government settled on a new message: Early treatment improves the chances of survival.) Authorities are now also trying to increase reliance on health care workers among village residents through a network of \u201ccommunity agents.\u201d These are local residents, one man and one woman chosen by each community, who are being trained to make sure that they have a basic understanding of issues like vaccination, hygiene and childbirth. There are currently 5,800 community agents, and the government hopes eventually to have 18,000. The notion is that these Guineans can serve as trusted sources for their towns, encouraging sick patients and their relatives to turn to the medical system \u2014 the same tenuous groups of nurses and assistants that Diallo and his colleagues have been trying to teach.On the fifth and final day of training in Faranah, the students were exhausted, their attention strained after hundreds of slides and hours of developing action plans. They were draped over one another\u2019s chairs, fanning themselves with papers and conducting sideline conversations in low tones. The fan bolted to the ceiling had no electricity to power it. A goat, tied by its collar in the back of a truck in the yard, crashed around outside the window, interrupting final lectures. It was a Saturday, and the students were eager to finish their exams and get on with their evening plans.Diallo held up a set of green cotton scrubs. \u201cThe nurse who died at Donka during Ebola got it on her skirt. She couldn\u2019t take it off, so she just did like this,\u201d he said, miming wiping his leg. \u201cIf you\u2019re wearing scrubs, you can just take it off.\u201d Scrubs \u2014 separate clothing for the work of caring for sick people who remain at the health care facility \u2014 are another piece of equipment that is still uncommon for many health workers.He asked six trainees, three men and three women, to come to the middle of the room. He held a stapled checklist. On the ground in front of each student were the elements of a P.P.E., the Ebola-specific personal protective equipment. Donning the equipment, which took the students 25 minutes, is not even the dangerous part. After an encounter with an infected patient, when the caregivers are overheated and exhausted, the exterior of the suit is most likely contaminated.The stakes, then, are highest during the removal procedure, which reverses the steps. Diallo directed them. He misted the students, front and back, with a chlorine solution between each step. Following his instructions, they placed their right hands on the zipper at the level of their navels, walking their fingertips slowly up to the zipper pull beneath their chins. He corrected them as they went, warning them not to touch their necks with contaminated gloves. Unzipping the suits, they peeled them outward, away from the sweat-soaked clothing now clinging to their skin. They lifted their knees high, trying to extract their legs and boots and shake their skirts back down over their calves without touching the exterior of the P.P.E.\u201cDance! Dance! Merengue!\u201d teased Traor\u00e9 from the corner of the room.At the end of the day, the trainers gave the students a pep talk and wrote their personal cellphone numbers on a flip chart, encouraging the students to call them anytime with questions or concerns. After rounds of group photos and farewells, Diallo, Traor\u00e9 and Saran returned to the classroom, taking advantage of the electricity from their portable generator to fill out paperwork and evaluations on laptops. I brought up the new Liberian Ebola cases \u2014 two months after the country had been declared \u201cEbola free\u201d \u2014 which had just been identified. The new cases were an unwelcome reminder that Ebola not only persisted in unidentified animal reservoirs, but seemed to be capable, in rare cases, of becoming contagious again in human survivors months after their recovery. Each new appearance of the virus threatened to spark a new epidemic.Diallo couldn\u2019t disguise a flash of worry, but he reacted to the news with his usual dry sense of humor. He picked up a bottle of hand sanitizer, flipped open the lid and held it out pointedly over my hands.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Congo Lurches Toward a New Crisis as Leader Tries to Crush a Rival", "Date": "2016-05-11", "News": "Supported by6 PhotosLUBUMBASHI, Democratic Republic of Congo \u2014 As hundreds of police officers ringed the courthouse, the mob came barreling up the street. From blocks away, you could hear its hungry roar.\u201cI am Mo\u00efse!\u201d the people yelled. \u201cWe are ready to die today!\u201dThe crowd exploded in a celebratory frenzy. The police officers surged, swinging clubs, slamming protesters to the ground and firing tear gas. Clouds of acrid purple smoke cut through the tropical air.Congo\u2019s government, which is continuously lurching from one crisis to the next, is now playing a very dangerous game. Mr. Kabila, who faces term limits, is resisting international calls and rising pressure in Congo to relinquish power by the end of this year, as Congo\u2019s Constitution requires.Instead, Mr. Kabila seems to be withdrawing deeper inside the corner he has painted himself into. He has unleashed his security forces on protesters, strained relations with powerful friends like the United States and lashed out at perceived enemies.His security services, especially the dreaded intelligence agency, are now going after the biggest fish of them all: Mr. Katumbi, who seems to have the whole city of Lubumbashi and a good part of the country rallying around him.\u201cI love Mo\u00efse more than I love my wife,\u201d said Jackie Roko, a vendor of belts here in Lubumbashi, Congo\u2019s second-largest city.Mr. Katumbi, an affable, loquacious and very rich former governor, declared last week that he was running for president. He has the money, the network and the cult of personality to be a real contender. He even has his own soccer team, TP Mazembe \u2014 the Bulldozers \u2014 one of Africa\u2019s most successful. And he has begun to unify Congo\u2019s opposition, which no other politician has ever come close to doing.The case against Mr. Katumbi taps into much of Congo\u2019s sordid past: a whiff of rebellion, the talk of foreign mercenaries and the way power in Congo tends to be exercised, absolutely and with ruthlessness.Until last year, Mr. Katumbi, 51, was king of this part of Congo.He was a close confidant of Mr. Kabila\u2019s and was the governor of Katanga Province, which produces a good chunk of the world\u2019s copper supply. During his nine years in office, he was widely credited with improving the business climate, helping the poor and cracking down on corruption. But corruption and influence-peddling remain rife.Mr. Katumbi has a flair for the flamboyant that evokes Mobutu Sese Seko, Congo\u2019s former dictator renowned for his staggering opulence. Mr. Katumbi\u2019s mansion in Lubumbashi is lined with ivory tusks, giant vases, enormous paintings and acres of marble and white leather. Out back is a tennis court with murals of him swatting a ball, and he enjoys hosting visitors for an afternoon match, no matter what is happening outside. Then there are his chapel, kingly gardens and an enormous aquarium, full of gulping fish.Each night, outside his towering gates, scores if not hundreds of people gather. They are his citizen sentries. They stand in clumps in the dark, craning their necks up and down the street, ready to battle anyone who tries to take their hero \u2014 and benefactor \u2014 away.\u201cMo\u00efse, Mo\u00efse,\u201d an older woman pleaded, rapping her gray knuckles on the gate. \u201cTransport. Transport.\u201dShe wanted money for a taxi home \u2014 or maybe just money. Dozens of other women, dressed in rags, pushed and shoved behind her, pleading for the same.Last week, Congo\u2019s justice minister announced that the government had \u201cdocumented proof\u201d that Mr. Katumbi had hired hundreds of mercenaries, including Americans, possibly in a plot to overthrow the government.The word mercenary carries a certain electricity in Congo. In the 1960s, Belgian mercenaries fought a short-lived war to split this province off from the rest of Congo. In the mid-1990s, Mobutu used mercenaries in a last-ditch effort to stay in power. Then, in the late 1990s, when Congo plunged into chaos, soldiers from nearly a dozen African countries carted off untold millions in stolen minerals.The justice minister showed as evidence pictures of an American, Darryl Lewis, who was arrested last month in Lubumbashi, carrying a machine gun. Mr. Lewis served in the United States military several years ago and the picture was apparently an old one, taken from a social media account.The United States government shot back with an unusually forceful statement saying that the allegations were false and that Mr. Lewis was never armed in Congo and worked for a private American security company.Mr. Katumbi said he had hired Mr. Lewis as a security adviser because government intelligence agents were stalking him and his family. Some Western diplomats said it was possible Mr. Katumbi could be assassinated.He was summoned to court this week, first on Monday and then again on Wednesday.The same Lubumbashi police who used to trot after his car now scream at his supporters, telling them they were not allowed to even watch him arrive at the Palais de Justice, which, with its grand Art Deco edifice, is the most striking building in town.When the crowds did not move fast enough, the police turned vicious. They charged anyone standing in front of the courthouse, including us journalists.All of a sudden we were surrounded, the police closing in from all sides. They rushed toward us, thumping their clubs on their shields. People burst down the street, the lucky ones reaching nearby shops, whose doorways seemed to suck them in. I was too far away, so I kept running.Congo\u2019s government is clearly stressed. Global commodity prices have crashed, pummeling a country whose struggling economy turns on the price of minerals like copper. China, which had been Congo\u2019s new savior, has its own economic woes and is in no position to extend the billions of dollars of easy credit it had in the past.On top of that, Western governments are considering sanctions against Congolese officials for human rights abuses in connection with the political crackdowns.Lambert Mende, the information minister and a close ally of Mr. Kabila\u2019s, said in a recent interview that the government did not have enough money to hold elections. He also said that if the president agreed to step down at the end of the year but the election was then delayed, \u201cwe\u2019d start confusion, we\u2019d start rebellions, we\u2019d start wars.\u201dHe added, \u201cWhy should you bring the president to prepare such a game?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The End of Black Harlem", "Date": "2016-05-27", "News": "Supported byOpinionI HAVE lived in Harlem for half my life \u2014 30 years. I have seen it in all its complexities: a cultural nexus of black America, the landing place for Senegalese immigrants and Southern transplants, a home for people fleeing oppression and seeking opportunity. Harlem is the birthplace of so much poetry and music and beauty, but in the eyes of many who have never set foot here, it has long been a swamp of pain and suffering.It is also changing, rapidly. A few years ago I was on Eighth Avenue, also known as Frederick Douglass Boulevard, picketing a fund-raiser for a politician who was pushing for denser mixed-use zoning along 125th Street, the \u201cMain Street\u201d of my sprawling neighborhood. Harlem has seen an influx of tourists, developers and stroller-pushing young families, described in the media as \u201curban pioneers,\u201d attracted by city tax abatements. New high-end housing and hip restaurants have also played their part. So have various public improvements, like new landscaping and yoga studios. In general all this activity has helped spruce the place up. Not surprisingly, on that day a few passers-by shot us ugly looks, as if to say, \u201cWhy can\u2019t you accept a good thing?\u201dBut even then, a few boys passing by on their bikes understood what was at stake. As we chanted, \u201cSave Harlem now!\u201d one of them inquired, \u201cWhy are y\u2019all yelling that?\u201d We explained that the city was encouraging housing on the historic, retail-centered 125th Street, as well as taller buildings. Housing\u2019s good, in theory, but because the median income in Harlem is less than $37,000 a year, many of these new apartments would be too expensive for those of us who already live here.Hearing this, making a quick calculation, one boy in glasses shot back at his companions, \u201cYou see, I told you they didn\u2019t plant those trees for us.\u201dIt was painful to realize how even a kid could see in every new building, every historic renovation, every boutique clothing shop \u2014 indeed in every tree and every flower in every park improvement \u2014 not a life-enhancing benefit, but a harbinger of his own displacement.A few ask, isn\u2019t this a good thing \u2014 or, at least, the price of a good thing? \u201cYou and all the others had better get over your grieving, we need Whole Foods,\u201d said my friend and fellow Harlem resident James Fenton, the noted English writer.But this is the problem with gentrification \u2014 what James, with all due respect, doesn\u2019t get, but what that boy on Eighth Avenue did. For so many privileged New Yorkers, like James, Whole Foods is just the corner store. But among the black and working-class residents of Harlem, who have withstood red-lining and neglect, it might as well be Fortnum and Mason. To us, our Harlem is being remade, upgraded and transformed, just for them, for wealthier white people.There is something about black neighborhoods, or at least poor black neighborhoods, that seem to make them irresistible to gentrification. Just look at U Street in Washington or Trem\u00e9 in New Orleans. \u201cEverywhere I travel in the U.S. and even in Brixton, in London, a place as culturally vibrant as Harlem, wherever people of color live, we and the landmarks that embody our presence, unprotected, piece by piece, are being replaced,\u201d said Valerie Jo Bradley, who helped found the preservation advocacy group Save Harlem Now!This isn\u2019t a new story. As the historian Kevin McGruder explains in \u201cRace and Real Estate: Conflict and Cooperation in Harlem, 1890\u20131920,\u201d an assessment of how Harlem came to be America\u2019s \u201cblack Mecca,\u201d African-Americans began moving north in large numbers into the area in the early 20th century after Macy\u2019s, Penn Station and the theater district replaced what had been black neighborhoods farther south.The extension of the subway to 145th Street gave black leaders an opportunity, within the nation\u2019s leading metropolis, to set up an autonomous black city. Black churches strategically relocated here, and prime residential properties were bought for settlement by black residents. In the early 1920s followers of Marcus Garvey\u2019s Universal Negro Improvement Association, promoting political and economic independence, built a complex of shops, a theater and dance hall they called the Renaissance Theater and Casino. It quickly became a centerpiece of the neighborhood. (It was demolished in 2015.) With slavery scarcely a generation behind, the audaciousness of this plan was staggering.By 1930 hundreds of thousands of blacks (and not a few whites) lived in Harlem. And yet, even then, residents understood that the black hold on Harlem was tenuous. That same year the author James Weldon Johnson asked in \u201cBlack Manhattan,\u201d his classic account of Harlem\u2019s early years, \u201cThe question inevitably arises: Will the Negroes of Harlem be able to hold it?\u201dAfter all, Harlem is a broad, flat section of northern Manhattan, poised just above Central Park with easy access to high-end jobs farther south and La Guardia Airport to the east. It is a mix of stately Victorian rowhouses and miles of apartment houses, the former ripe for adaptation, the latter for destruction and replacement by gleaming glass-cube condos. As Horace Carter, the founder of the Emanuel Pieterson Historical Society, insisted to me, \u201cI tell you, they have a plan. Harlem is too well placed. The white man is ready to take it back.\u201d It\u2019s possible to remember a short time ago when this warning seemed pathetically alarmist.Today the pace of change is bracing, as is the insolence of the newcomers. A local real-estate speculator who specializes in flipping buildings in the shrinking Little Senegal section of Harlem told me that new tenants complained, \u201cWe\u2019re not paying that much money to have black people living in our building!\u201dThat\u2019s what happens in the rentals, he said. But, he added, \u201cWhat really upsets them is having blacks freeloading in noneviction co-op conversions. Blacks are paying $800 a month for the same four-bedroom, two-bath unit the newcomers bought for $2 million. Whites pay $2,000 just for maintenance! It\u2019s not the blacks, but their poverty that\u2019s resented. They ask me, \u2018How come they didn\u2019t buy this building when it cost nothing?\u2019 \u201dInterestingly, not all gentrifiers are comfortable with the change they\u2019re bringing. \u201cI couldn\u2019t afford it, and I\u2019m relieved,\u201d Rene Gatling, who moved to Harlem in 2009 but left in 2014 for Connecticut, told me. But it wasn\u2019t just price that persuaded her to leave. \u201cSuddenly I thought, Why is there no anger, no push back? Our being here is pushing people out.\u201dBlacks who relocated here when Harlem was still affordable have been disillusioned, too. When I told Sharifa Rhodes-Pitts, who wrote the elegiac book \u201cHarlem Is Nowhere,\u201d about the group Save Harlem Now! just the name made her respond, \u201cIt\u2019s too late.\u201d She said that she and her young son were moving out. \u201cIt costs too much.\u201dStill Harlem endures as a community with high hopes, and in 2013, we felt sure we had found a champion. Bill de Blasio ran as the mayor for everyone, which we figured had to include Harlem. Black voters were crucial to his victory, and we thought we were covered and cared for. He even has a likable son, as liable to get stopped by the police as ours might.We were wrong. The man we saw as \u201cour mayor\u201d may talk about housing affordability, but his vision is far from the rent control and public housing that President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia once supported, and that made New York affordable for generations. Instead, he has pushed for private development and identified unprotected, landmark-quality buildings as targets. He and the City Council have effectively swept aside contextual zoning limits, which curb development that might change the very essence of a neighborhood, in Harlem and Inwood, farther north. At best, his plan seems to be to develop at all speed and costs, optimistic that the tax revenues and good graces of the real estate barons allow for a few affordable apartments to be stuffed in later.And so even under \u201cour mayor,\u201d the dislocation of minorities continues apace. Gentrification in Harlem might well be likened to the progress of the British Raj, where the most that \u201ccivilizing\u201d interlopers could muster was a patronizing interest in token elements of local culture. Thus: Yes to the hip Afro-fusion restaurant, but complaints to 311 over Sundae Sermon dances, barbecues and ball games in parks or church choir rehearsals.These are people who, in saying \u201cI don\u2019t see color,\u201d treat the neighborhood like a blank slate. They have no idea how insulting they are being, denying us our heritage and our stake in Harlem\u2019s future. And, far from government intervention to keep us in our homes, houses of worship and schools, to protect buildings emblematic of black history, we see policies like destructive zoning, with false \u201ctrickle down\u201d affordability, changes that incentivize yet more gentrification, sure to transfigure our Harlem forever.But when we friends gather at a restaurant like Cheri for a convivial romp hosted by the owner, Alain, or on a Friday, at the Rooster, presided over by the D.J. Stormin Norman, we are every color, every race, every age, identity and class. In the moment, laughing, drinking and dancing together, it seems marvelous. This Harlem, this is what New York is supposed to look like, to be like. Only, most of us know that our fun times together are doomed.Michael Henry Adams conducts tours in Harlem and is the author of \u201cHarlem: Lost and Found, an Architectural and Social History, 1765-1915\u201d and the forthcoming \u201cHomo Harlem: Lesbian and Gay Life in the African- American Cultural Capital, 1915-1995.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Brexit,\u2019 a Feel-Good Vote That Could Sink Britain\u2019s Economy", "Date": "2016-05-20", "News": "Supported byBIRMINGHAM, England \u2014 If not for the trifling matter of Britain potentially abandoning the European Union, Rowan Crozier figures the factory he oversees would already be clattering away with extra urgency. Men and women in blue coveralls would be busy patrolling the concrete floor, monitoring molded hunks of steel that stamp loops of metal into electronics parts. A new order would be destined for a major customer.Mr. Crozier, 41, is the chief executive of Brandauer, a small manufacturer in a gritty suburb of Birmingham, 125 miles northwest of London. Started 154 years ago as a maker of nibs for pens, his factory these days makes components that land in a range of everyday items, including cars and teakettles.Last year, a prominent American brand approached Brandauer about supplying parts for a new product it planned to assemble at a factory in Germany. The deal appeared in hand. Then, the Americans began asking about the referendum, a June 23 vote on whether Britain should remain part of the European Union.Not since the fall of the Berlin Wall has Europe confronted such a profound question about its future course. The vote throws open elemental questions about the lines of regional power and the spirit of collective interest that has prevailed since the end of World War II. The war yielded an understanding that people would feel less inclined to murder their neighbors if their livelihoods were dependent on trading goods with one another.That idea brought the European Union into being and propelled its expansion, even as bitter differences emerged over its mission: Was it an economic confederation, or a political creation that required central authority? If Britain leaves, it could presage the disintegration of the European project.Many of the bottles of beer served at the Post Office Vaults pub in Birmingham arrive duty-free from Belgium, which would change if Britain votes to exit the European Union. \u201cI think our business would completely fail,\u201d a bartender said.What would happen to exchange rates? To the free movement of labor? Would Brandauer be able to ship its components to the factory in Germany without paying duties?With the knowns trumped by a proliferating set of unknowns, Brandauer\u2019s American customer held off its order. Mr. Crozier expects to hear nothing until after voters deliver their verdict, determining whether Britain is to remain a central player in the largest unified market on earth or instead revert to an island separate from the troubled Continent across the channel.\u201cIt\u2019s just this uncertainty,\u201d Mr. Crozier said. \u201cHonestly, I think this is crazy. It\u2019s a big step back for the U.K. if we do actually step away.\u201dThose campaigning for Britain to depart the European Union tend to dismiss such laments as the cost of liberation from an institution troubled by malaise, political dysfunction and unrelenting bureaucracy. In their telling, Brussels, the headquarters of the European Union, is a land of pencil-pushing killjoys who awake every morning eager to find new ways to strangle business with inscrutable directives, writing nonsensical rules that standardize everything from the length of the workweek to the acceptable shape of bananas. Ditch all that, they say, and flush times will follow.This is an aspiration fueled by talk of Polish plumbers pressing down wages, would-be terrorists crossing porous borders and the maddening impossibility of buying a flat in an era in which sons and daughters of London must compete with the offspring of Russian oligarchs and Saudi royalty. In the Brexit campaign, the public has found an expression for those fears, frustrations and desires.The British Treasury explored a range of trade arrangements the government might forge with Europe post-Brexit and concluded it could lop some 6.2 percent off the gross domestic product by 2030, leaving the average household worse off by about 4,300 pounds a year (about $6,240). The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, said that leaving the European Union could swiftly send Britain into a recession.\u201cIt is absolutely clear we would incur significant economic costs if we left the European Union,\u201d said Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent research institution in London. \u201cFree trade with the E.U. is worth quite a lot, and foreign direct investment would be impeded. All of the serious economic models show that.\u201dThough the European Union has no shortage of economic afflictions, it also absorbs 44 percent of British exports, a flow of trade linked to some 3.3 million British jobs. Its inclusion in the European Union\u2019s vast single market is a primary reason multinational companies have in recent years expanded operations in Britain. From that perch, they can sell goods and services from Scotland to Romania \u2014 an area holding more than 500 million people. It is part of the reason London has grown into a financial center whose importance rivals New York.The Brexit camp insists that an independent Britain would somehow wind up richer.\u201cThe suggestion that the world\u2019s going to stop and trade\u2019s going to stop is complete scaremongering,\u201d said Richard Tice, a property magnate and a co-founder of the Leave campaign. Once freed of the stultifying straits of Brussels, he added, Britain could expand trade with faster-growing parts of the globe like China, India and the United States.Even Mr. Tice acknowledged that the economy could be in for \u201ca bit of bumping and boring\u201d in the years after a Brexit. But he prefers to focus on more pleasing aspects.\u201cLife\u2019s not just about money,\u201d said Mr. Tice, whose firm manages a hoard of real estate worth in excess of $750 million. \u201cIt\u2019s about the quality of life, the quality of public services, the density of your population and looking after your own people first.\u201dIn that regard, a Brexit collides directly with the collectivist notion that has propelled European integration for seven decades.Brandauer and its exports are the fruit of this project. During World War II, the factory supplied parts for British fighter planes, as the Germans bombed the city. These days, Brandauer sends its wares to trade shows in Germany. The rebuilt city streets are full of German-made luxury cars.\u201cHistory is history,\u201d sniffed Mr. Tice. \u201cAll you can do something about is the future. And the E.U. in its current form is no longer fit for purpose.\u201dSpend a little time with Mr. Tice and you come away with the impression that, whatever comes next \u2014 whether Britain remains, exits or perhaps even runs off to join Tanzania \u2014 he will be all right. Brash and imposing, he filled out a double-breasted blue suit accented with a shiny red necktie as he occupied a bench above the lobby of the upscale May Fair Hotel (two-bedroom suite: $4,300 a night) in London. \u201cIt\u2019s like an extension of my office,\u201d he said, as women with extravagant hairstyles showed off handbags brought home from weekends in Paris, and waiters raced fearfully, bearing trays laden with champagne. A red Maserati was parked in front of the entrance.\u201cThe E.U. is stagnating,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s got unbelievable, devastating levels of unemployment. There\u2019s no growth there.\u201dBut finding economists who say they believe that a Brexit will spur the British economy is like looking for a doctor who thinks forswearing vegetables is the key to a long life.\u201cThe pro-Brexit argument that Britain will be free of lots of regulations, that there will be a bonfire of red tape that will cause us to grow rapidly and we\u2019ll strike lots of new trade deals as this buccaneering new England \u2014 there\u2019s just no credible scenario to any of that,\u201d said John Van Reenen, director of the Center for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics. \u201cThere aren\u2019t anything like the game-changing propositions that the pro-Brexit camp is putting forward.\u201dThe European Central Bank in recent years has sought to shift trading of securities priced in euros to countries that actually use the currency, a clear swipe at Britain, where the pound remains. Last year, the European general court handed Britain a victory in a lawsuit brought by the government. So-called clearing of euro-denominated trades was permissible anywhere in the European Union.If Britain leaves, European governments are likely to make another run at moving this lucrative business to their shores. And financial firms could shift foreign exchange operations and investment banking to the Continent. Executives at global banking giants such as HSBC and Goldman Sachs have already suggested that a Brexit would prompt them to move jobs.\u201cThe minute the U.K. is no longer part of the E.U., there is zero chance that London remains the center for euro-denominated transactions,\u201d said Jacob Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. \u201cLondon will become a much smaller, more regional financial center.\u201dIn the northeast of England, the city of Sunderland worries that it, too, could be a casualty. In the mid-1980s, at a time of fears about Japan\u2019s rise, Sunderland secured a victory: Nissan set up a factory there. Over the years, the plant expanded, selling cars across Europe. In a city of 277,000 people, the Nissan plant now employs some 7,500.But with the Brexit vote, the Nissan factory could become a lesson in the pitfalls of redrawing the map. Nissan has been weighing Sunderland against other plants in France and Spain as it seeks a place to develop a new version of a popular sport utility vehicle. If Sunderland is not in the union, that could increase the cost of imported parts while making its finished vehicles more expensive in European markets.\u201cOur preference as a business is, of course, that the U.K. stays within Europe \u2014 it makes the most sense for jobs, trade and costs,\u201d Carlos Ghosn, Nissan\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said in a written statement. \u201cA position of stability is more positive than a collection of unknowns.\u201dNot for nothing is Birmingham sometimes referred to as the Detroit of England. A centerpiece of the Industrial Revolution, it rose to formidable heights as an automaker before manufacturing shifted to lower-wage countries and automation replaced working hands.Britain will hold a referendum on Thursday on whether to leave the European Union, a decision nicknamed \u201cBrexit.\u201dWhen MG Rover, an archetypal British brand, closed a major factory here in 2005, the pain spread through the local supply chain. But the MG plant was recently bought and revived by SAIC Motor, a Shanghai-based carmaker. What had been a grubby and forlorn downtown now has a glittering new train station with high-speed rail connections to London and a Selfridges & Company department store, which occupies an architectural trophy that looks something like a steel-plated armadillo.As the Brexit referendum approaches, the politics of identity are colliding with the economics of global trade.For Brandauer, the vote delayed the order from the American electronics company, a deal worth about $1 million. Mr. Crozier, the Brandauer chief, had flown to California to meet with executives. A handshake deal had been secured. Then the procurement director in the United States began asking about the implications of a Brexit. The director was weighing Brandauer against competing suppliers in Germany.\u201cI\u2019ve spent the last 12 months building that relationship,\u201d Mr. Crozier grumbled.Mr. Crozier has delayed replacing aging machinery, spreading the grip of commercial purgatory. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to sit back and wait,\u201d he said.He worries that a Brexit will bring limits on immigration, making it difficult for him to hire people with needed skills. Many of Brandauer\u2019s parts are tiny, a tenth the width of a human hair, so every detail counts in designing the tools. Brandauer recently turned to Romania for a product engineer.Downtown, at the Post Office Vaults pub, a pleasingly musty dark room, the bartender, Jess Milton, 24, tended to 360 varieties of bottled beer, many of them from Belgium.

E.U. regulations prevent all manner of things.\u201dWhat about trade, economic growth and jobs? Mr. Plumb said Brexit fears were overblown. And if there is a price to be paid, abandoning Europe will be worth it.\u201cIt\u2019s about being our own sovereign nation again,\u201d Mr. Plumb said. \u201cIt would make the country feel better. It\u2019s a feeling.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the British Treasury\u2019s estimate of the economic cost of \u201cBrexit\u201d to the average British household.

{"Headline": "Donald Trump Is Coherent on Monetary Policy, but Not on Debt", "Date": "2016-05-05", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceDonald Trump emphasizes his business savvy as a reason to make him president. In a phone interview with CNBC on Thursday, he showed both the strengths and limitations of this background as he talked about the Federal Reserve, the dollar and the national debt in more detail than he has before.In short, he showed clarity and consistency in talking about monetary policy and the dollar. But he also made an offhand comment that, if taken literally, would amount to rejecting the very underpinnings of the global financial system and would threaten to undermine the United States\u2019 two centuries of creditworthiness.Win some, lose some?Mr. Trump was asked whether he would reappoint Janet Yellen as Fed chairwoman (her term is set to expire Feb. 3, 2018, about a year after the next president takes office). \u201cI have nothing against Janet Yellen whatsoever,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know her. She\u2019s a very capable person. People that I know have a very high regard for her. But she\u2019s not a Republican.\u201cWhen her time is up, I would most likely replace her because of the fact that I think it would be appropriate.\u201dFair enough. If he is elected president, it will be Mr. Trump\u2019s prerogative to appoint a Fed leader of his liking. That said, traditionally presidents try to make it a nonpartisan appointment. Ronald Reagan renominated Jimmy Carter\u2019s appointee, Paul Volcker; Bill Clinton renominated Reagan\u2019s appointee, Alan Greenspan; and Barack Obama renominated George W. Bush\u2019s appointee, Ben Bernanke.Still, Fed watchers have assumed that if a Republican wins the 2016 election, the new president will appoint a new Fed leader. More interesting is that Mr. Trump seems to favor a new Fed chair who continues the low-interest-rate policies of Mr. Bernanke and Ms. Yellen.\u201cShe\u2019s a low-interest-rate person, she\u2019s always been a low-interest-rate person,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I must be honest, I am a low-interest-rate person. If we raise interest rates, and if the dollar starts getting too strong, we\u2019re going to have some very major problems.\u201dThat gets the economics of the current American monetary policy dilemma pretty much right. As the Fed moved toward interest rate increases last year, when other global central banks were trying to ease policy, it created steep upward pressure on the dollar. That in turn hammered American exporters, undermining growth here.It also caused strains across the global economy. Because the dollar is the global reserve currency and because debts around the world are denominated in the currency, a stronger dollar meant tighter money in countries from China to Brazil.It was in no small part due to this effect that the Fed has slowed the pace of rate increases from what it envisioned late last year.Moreover, if you agree with Mr. Trump\u2019s oft-repeated views that China and other countries seize unfair advantage in trade by depressing their currencies (economists generally argue that\u2019s not the case with regard to China at present, but it has been in the recent past), you should want low-interest-rate policies out of the Fed. \u201cWhile there are certain benefits, it sounds better to have a strong dollar than it actually is,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump acknowledged that his preference for low interest rates would need to change if inflation took off: \u201cIf inflation starts coming in, and we don\u2019t see any signs of that, inflation starts coming in, that\u2019s a different story. You have to go up and you have to slow things down. But right now I am for low interest rates.\u201d (Janet Yellen would agree.)That\u2019s in contrast with many leading conservatives, like Paul Ryan and Ted Cruz, who have favored tighter money and a stronger dollar for the last several years.Things got messier when Mr. Trump talked about his view of the national debt, seeming to apply his experience renegotiating with creditors for his casinos and hotels to the world of Treasury debt. \u201cWe\u2019re paying a very low interest rate \u2014 what happens if that interest rate goes up 2, 3, 4 points?\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a country. We have tremendous debt, tremendous.\u201d He advocated shifting toward longer-term debt, locking in current low interest rates for the federal government.That isn\u2019t unreasonable. The federal government\u2019s budget could be strained if interest rates rise \u2014 though a world in which rates rise significantly is probably a world in which there is also strong economic growth, higher inflation or both. Either would mean more tax revenue, which would make the debt manageable despite higher rates.But Mr. Trump also suggested something that would represent a radical shift in United States policy if we take him seriously. \u201cI\u2019ve borrowed knowing that you can pay back with discounts,\u201d he said. He added, \u201cNow we\u2019re in a different situation with the country, but I would borrow knowing that if the economy crashed, you could make a deal.\u201dHe specified later that he didn\u2019t mean renegotiating bond terms, which countries like Argentina and Greece have done repeatedly. What he says he meant was buying back bonds at discounts after rates have risen, much as a company at risk of bankruptcy might buy its own bonds back at, say, 70 cents on the dollar and thus reduce what it owes. \u201cI don\u2019t want to renegotiate the bonds, but I think you can do discounting,\u201d he said.It is that reputation for creditworthiness and reliability that has made United States Treasury bonds the bedrock of the global financial system \u2014 a crucial difference between American government debt and the likes of Argentina\u2019s, or, for that matter, the kind of debt owed on a failed casino project.\u201cI am the king of debt,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI love debt, I love playing with it. But now you\u2019re talking about something that\u2019s very, very fragile, and has to be handled very carefully.\u201dTwo centuries of United States Treasury secretaries would tend to agree.An earlier version of this article misstated when Janet Yellen\u2019s term is set to expire. It is Feb. 3, 2018, not Jan. 30 of that year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Looming Crisis in Lebanon", "Date": "2016-05-03", "News": "Supported byIn Levantine landscapes, history is piled high. The present is layered on the remnants of the past, both modern and ancient.Nowhere is this more apparent than in Lebanon\u2019s capital, Beirut. Sparkling buildings and sweeping urban highways rise up out of heaps of rubble that remain a quarter-century after the 1975-1990 civil war. Yet the crumbling edifices of earlier eras are also, amazingly, still inhabited.Metaphors involving unwanted detritus have been irresistible to commentators as Lebanon again finds itself in the crossfire of geopolitical conflict. The regional rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia has found a new focal point in Lebanon with its uneasy equilibrium.At the center of the crisis is the growing role of Hezbollah, the Shiite political party and militia. Beyond its Lebanese strongholds, the group has also become one of Iran\u2019s main strategic assets in the region: Heavily supported by Hezbollah fighters, the Russian-Iranian surge in Syria has swung the momentum of the war back in favor of the government of President Bashar al-Assad.Lebanon\u2019s own political dynamics have also shifted. Beirut has long been trapped in a Syrian orbit; as the fortunes of the Assad regime have revived, Hezbollah\u2019s power in Lebanon has grown. Hezbollah had already angered the Saudis and their Gulf allies by its intervention in Syria and support for Iran. The Shiite group has also stalemated domestic politics by blocking the selection of a new Lebanese president.The Gulf states\u2019 cutting off aid to their Lebanese allies \u2014 an incongruous grouping of Sunni, Druze and Christian factions whose only common ground is a shared fear of Hezbollah \u2014 undoubtedly cedes the field to Iran. But as a senior Gulf diplomat told me, \u201cOur money in Lebanon just didn\u2019t stretch as far as Iran\u2019s.\u201d It did not have the same political impact because most Gulf aid went to national institutions like the army, while Iran\u2019s mainly goes directly to a proxy militia: Hezbollah. With the growing power of Hezbollah, the Gulf states felt that, by underwriting Lebanon\u2019s national institutions, they were subsidizing what were becoming, in effect, Iranian assets.The key to Lebanon\u2019s relative stability, as the veteran Druze leader Walid Jumblatt told me, is that \u201cits security services are able to work with the Syrians, the Saudis, the Iranians and the West simultaneously.\u201d If that balance is lost, Lebanon\u2019s fragile equilibrium may collapse.Worse, with proxy conflicts raging in Syria, Yemen and elsewhere, Lebanon, too, is a potential battleground for indirect Iranian-Saudi hostilities. So far, the country\u2019s competing factions have united to quarantine the spillover of the Syrian war to a remote part of northern Lebanon. But should Tehran or Riyadh authorize a new theater of confrontation, Lebanon is a potential powder keg.The country is poised, in a way familiar to the Lebanese, between tense calm and a potential conflagration. But the pressures are rapidly mounting, and outside actors will have a decisive role in determining whether the country can avoid being sucked into the inferno raging around it.Hussein Ibish is a senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Durant\u2019s Free Agency Is an Emotional and Economic Factor in Oklahoma City", "Date": "2016-05-08", "News": "Supported byOKLAHOMA CITY \u2014 Hal Smith first met Kevin Durant four years ago, when a mutual acquaintance informed him that the basketball superstar was thinking about opening a restaurant.Smith, 69, runs a restaurant group based in Norman, Okla., that employs about 7,000 people across seven states. From their very first talk, the two men established an easy rapport, and within a year and a half they opened KD\u2019s, a sleek spot in downtown Oklahoma City serving Southern comfort food.But while the restaurant has done well, in recent months a matter of basketball business has been prickling Smith\u2019s mind. After spending nine seasons with the same franchise, Durant will become a free agent this summer. Smith, therefore, has been forced to ponder the possibility that his famous business partner, the face of their food brand, could leave the city.\u201cI think about it every day,\u201d Smith said, laughing. \u201cWhat am I going to do? Are we going to keep it as KD\u2019s? Are we going to change the name if he leaves?\u201dSmith\u2019s concerns are a microcosm of the wider anxiety that has taken hold of the populace here. The Oklahoma City Thunder, fresh off another excellent regular season, are locked in heated battle with the San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference semifinals. And in the background every day has been the whispering of an unavoidable question: Could these be Durant\u2019s final days in the team\u2019s blue and orange uniform?Tension is inevitable when the possibility looms that a star athlete might switch teams. Yet the stakes somehow feel higher, more profound, than normal in Oklahoma City, where Durant and the Thunder are so tightly interwoven with the city\u2019s identity.The players\u2019 likenesses decorate buildings and storefronts downtown, and the franchise\u2019s influence is plainly discernible in the city\u2019s small-business nomenclature: Thunder Donuts, Thunder Nails, Thunder Bail Bonds, Thunder Cab, Thunder Vapor, Thunder Ducts, Thunder Concrete Plumbing Service, Thunder Towing.\u201cWe\u2019ve got this reputation as an up-and-coming city, and a lot of that is tied around the Thunder, and the success of the team is obviously directly tied to Kevin Durant,\u201d said Curtis Fitzpatrick, a morning host on the WWLS the Sports Animal radio station. \u201cSo, yeah, there\u2019s lots of anxiety. There\u2019s nervous energy. A lot of people don\u2019t talk about it. But there\u2019s no avoiding it on the horizon.\u201cThere\u2019s a whole local economy based in oil and gas,\u201d Fitzpatrick added. \u201cBut there\u2019s a Kevin Durant economy, too.\u201dDurant\u2019s stature in the area has been growing since 2008, when the Seattle SuperSonics, who drafted him the year before, relocated to Oklahoma City. The restaurant, in which Durant owns a 25 percent share, symbolizes the roots he has established. When KD\u2019s was still being conceptualized, Durant sent Smith on a three-city tour \u2014 from Miami to Los Angeles to Washington \u2014 to sample seven of his favorite restaurants. Even now, Smith said, Durant evaluates new dishes before they are added to the menu.The restaurant itself is situated just a few blocks from the team\u2019s arena. Memorabilia from Durant\u2019s career dots its walls. At a news conference at the start of the restaurant\u2019s construction, Durant elicited laughter when he said, \u201cIf somebody has a complaint, I\u2019ll try to go in the back in the kitchen and help fix it, if I can.\u201dOklahoma City has never seemed like an obvious place for a major professional sports franchise, but Durant, 27, who lives downtown, has fit in here about as well as any global sports superstar could. Anyone asked to elucidate his local standing will often point to the $1 million donation he made to the American Red Cross in 2013 the day after a tornado devastated Moore, an Oklahoma City suburb. Durant, who was in Minneapolis at the time, had Smith deliver the check to the local Red Cross office.\u201cPeople were crying that day,\u201d Smith said, \u201cand so thankful.\u201dEarly in his career, Durant\u2019s ingenuous demeanor endeared him to fans. There was the time during the 2011 N.B.A. lockout when Durant, after connecting on Twitter with an Oklahoma State graduate student named George Overbey, drove an hour to Stillwater to play in an intramural flag football game for Overbey\u2019s fraternity team. Video of the game, and the huge crowd that gathered to watch it, made the rounds in the blogosphere the following day.\u201cHe was locked in,\u201d said Overbey, whose squad, despite winning, was disqualified from the tournament for fielding Durant, the most obvious of ringers. \u201cHe didn\u2019t care about all the girls there, the people who came to watch. We were talking strategy in the car the whole time on the way to the game.\u201dFor Overbey, it was a small glimpse of the competitiveness that has helped Durant collect seven All-Star selections, four scoring titles and the 2014 Most Valuable Player Award.Durant\u2019s public image has morphed a bit as he has matured. A little over three years ago, the ad agency Wieden & Kennedy devised a campaign for Nike titled \u201cKD is Not Nice,\u201d a quirky effort to show that Durant, while generally modest and shy, did not lack fire on the court.Indeed, he has shown an ornery side, at times. He bristled at reporters at the All-Star Game last year, for example, telling them, \u201cY\u2019all not my friends.\u201d During the first round of the postseason this year, he was retroactively issued a technical for deliberately elbowing a Dallas Mavericks player.Regardless, the support for him in Oklahoma City has hardly ever wavered. Two years ago, when The Oklahoman printed the headline \u201cMr. Unreliable\u201d in reference to Durant\u2019s struggles during a playoff series against the Memphis Grizzlies, the local backlash was severe enough to prompt an apology from the newspaper. The sports editor said in a statement then that the paper had \u201cfailed\u201d its readership, calling the headline \u201coverstated and unduly harsh.\u201d\u201cHe could be the mayor, if he wanted,\u201d said Nick Collison, Durant\u2019s teammate since the Seattle days.Durant has quashed inquiries about his future plans whenever the subject has arisen. To the uninformed outsider \u2014 that is, possibly, everyone besides Durant \u2014 the possibilities seem multitudinous to the point that discussing them feels like a pointless pursuit. Still, it can be entertaining: Reports have hinted at interest from elite teams like the Golden State Warriors and the Spurs. Some wonder whether Durant would move to Los Angeles, where he often spends his summers. The idea that Durant might prefer the Eastern Conference, where the playoff road tends to be more forgiving, seems intriguing, too.People here are praying he stays. But many also insist that if a separation were to occur, it would be mostly amicable \u2014 nothing resembling the nastiness that occurred after LeBron James left the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2010.\u201cI can tell you people won\u2019t be burning his jersey in Oklahoma the way people did for LeBron in Cleveland,\u201d Overbey said. \u201cPeople will be devastated. They\u2019ll be sad. But they have too much respect for what he\u2019s done for the city.\u201dFor now, then, all people can do is wait until free agency starts on July 1. Smith, the restaurateur, said he hoped to sit down with Durant next month to brainstorm possible additions to the menu. He also wants to discuss plans to open a KD\u2019s in Austin, Tex., where they might reformat the restaurant as an upscale steakhouse.In an ideal world, Smith said, the Oklahoma City location would keep its name no matter what Durant decides this summer. But he will have to wait and see.\u201cI think the city loves him enough not to hold a grudge,\u201d Smith said. \u201cBut if he leaves, and people are disgruntled, I\u2019ll have to make another decision, and I don\u2019t have that decision in my mind just yet.\u201dJack Begg contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Gas Runs Low in France as Protesters Block Refineries in Labor Battle", "Date": "2016-05-25", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 An escalating battle between the French government and unions over labor law changes led to long gasoline lines on Wednesday as protesters blocked the entrances to some of the nation\u2019s eight refineries.The blockade of the refineries led the government to use force to try to disperse the union protesters in some locations. It also took the rare step of dipping into its strategic petroleum reserves in order to deal with the fuel shortfalls and keep the economy stable.In southern France, riot police officers dismantled a blockade at a refinery in Fos-sur-Mer on Tuesday, and a second blockade, at a refinery in Douchy-les-Mines in northern France, was dismantled Wednesday morning. The police turned water cannons on the striking workers and removed burning tires and other obstacles to allow traffic in and out of the refineries.It was unclear when the situation would become calm enough to allow fuel trucks through, and in the meantime motorists faced long waits to fill their tanks in some regions of the country, rationing in others and growing numbers of stations where gas had run out. In northeastern France, some motorists were reported to be driving over the border to Belgium to fill up.The actions by the police did not seem to deter the unions.\u201cAs long as the government refuses to discuss the law with us, the strikes will go on,\u201d Philippe Martinez, the secretary general of France\u2019s largest union, the General Confederation of Labor, said Wednesday on the radio station France Inter.The union, known by its French initials, C.G.T., and the other unions working closely with it on the strikes are among the least amenable to negotiations, labor experts here say.But the government appeared to be in no mood to negotiate. Speaking to Parliament on Wednesday, Mr. Valls said that there would be \u201cno retreat\u201d from the text of the law and that \u201cthe C.G.T. does not lay down the law in this country.\u201dThe unions have called for a nationwide strike on Thursday that would affect public transportation including the suburban train system in the Paris area, high-speed trains nationwide and air traffic controllers, as well as planned 24-hour walkouts by workers at at least 16 of the 19 nuclear plants that provide electricity around the country, although it was unclear how severe the strikes would be and whether they would affect electricity output.The refinery blockades have created shortages or completely drained fuel supplies at about 4,000 of the country\u2019s roughly 11,500 service stations, according to an interview by Agence France-Presse with Pierre Auclair, a founder of the app Essence, which tracks fuel supplies to gas stations. But the shortages are not evenly distributed. The country\u2019s north is facing far more service station closures than much of the rest of the country, and so are several major cities, including the Paris metropolitan area, Toulouse and Lyon.The government and the unions have pledged to stand their ground, suggesting a prolonged period of confrontation.Mr. Martinez said the leaders of seven of the country\u2019s largest unions had demanded a meeting with Mr. Hollande to discuss the new labor law.While Mr. Hollande appears politically weak less than a year before the next presidential election, he has shown little inclination to compromise, not least because some measures in the legislation have already been weakened as it has moved through Parliament. Even the measures remaining in the proposed law are seen as insufficient by the International Monetary Fund to revive France\u2019s economy and generate substantial numbers of new jobs.The government forced the legislation through the lower chamber of Parliament using a rarely invoked executive power. The French Senate will start discussing the legislation on June 13. Should the disruption in gasoline supplies continue, it could complicate life for visitors and residents alike during the Euro 2016 soccer tournament, which France will host. The tournament starts on June 10 and will continue for weeks at sites across the country.The legislation, known as the El Khomri law for the labor minister, Myriam El Khomri, would make a number of changes in the rights of workers that could result in reduced pay or longer working hours, even though it would not change the 35-hour workweek.The provisions that have proved most controversial in the proposed legislation would enable agreements negotiated at the company level to take precedence over those negotiated at the branch or industry level. Unions fear that at the level of individual businesses, employers would have more leverage to force concessions from workers.The proposed law also states that pay for overtime cannot be less than 10 percent more than regular pay. Currently, it cannot be less than 25 percent more than regular pay.Another much-contested provision would specify in a detailed manner the economic criteria for laying off workers in times of financial hardship. Now, judges in labor courts have some leeway in determining whether a layoff is justified.Fights between unions and the government are standard fare in France, and presidents in the past have sometimes backed down in the face of large strikes. More recently, government leaders have been less willing to yield as France\u2019s economy has struggled \u2014 and so far failed \u2014 to recover after five years of slow or no growth.This fight has been particularly bitter because it has pitted a Socialist government against unions and other groups on the left that see the government\u2019s policies as excessively business-friendly and therefore a betrayal and an abandonment of a tradition of left-leaning parties\u2019 supporting workers as well as campaign promises to protect workers.Huge strikes during Jacques Chirac\u2019s presidency forced the government to back down from changes in the pension system that would have, among other things, raised the retirement age for railway workers above 55 and reorganized the state transportation system, cutting jobs among other changes designed to cut the government\u2019s deficit.Aurelien Breeden contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Others even seemed a little relieved; at least the long battle was almost over.\u201cI\u2019m convinced that there is more than enough proof of her crimes,\u201d said Marta Suplicy, a senator from S\u00e3o Paulo who was Ms. Rousseff\u2019s ally before defecting from her leftist Workers\u2019 Party.Even some of Ms. Rousseff\u2019s supporters in the Senate expected her to lose the vote, which would oust the Workers\u2019 Party from the presidency it has held for 13 years.\u201cThere is no other path for us than opposition,\u201d Humberto Costa, the Workers\u2019 Party leader in the Senate, told reporters during the session on Wednesday. Still, he said it would be a \u201cvery firm opposition.\u201dThe Senate vote is a watershed in the power struggle consuming Brazil, a country that experienced a rare stretch of stability over the last two decades as it strengthened its economy and achieved greater prominence on the world stage.Dilma Rousseff, Brazil\u2019s president, is facing removal from office. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the proceedings.If she is suspended and put on trial, she will become the second of Brazil\u2019s four elected presidents to be removed from office since democracy was re-established in the mid-1980s after a long dictatorship.\u201cPlainly said, this is the worst crisis in our history, with its combination of economic calamity, discredited politics and the violation of the lowest ethical standards,\u201d Boris Fausto, a Brazilian historian, told reporters this month.Unlike some of her adversaries in Congress, Ms. Rousseff is not suspected of stealing for personal enrichment. Instead, she faces accusations that she borrowed money from state banks to plug budget holes. Her opponents say she used this strategy to hide Brazil\u2019s economic problems, in an attempt to improve her re-election prospects.\u201cTemer is what we\u2019ve got,\u201d Mr. Fausto said. \u201cI hope he\u2019ll be up to the difficult and often highly unpopular tasks ahead of him.\u201dBut the impasse between Ms. Rousseff and her rivals has kept the government in Bras\u00edlia distracted from these problems, exposing the political establishment to withering scrutiny around the country.While Ms. Rousseff, Brazil\u2019s first female president, has largely stuck to her routine in recent days, consulting with cabinet ministers and meeting with supporters, aides said they expected her to watch the Senate vote on television.Ms. Rousseff, 68, contends that her predecessors enacted the same budgetary manipulation policies that she is accused of. Her rivals say that does not make her innocent.Beyond that, an array of figures in her Workers\u2019 Party are either in jail or under investigation on charges of graft, dealing a blow to the legitimacy of a party that came to power vowing to end such practices.During a suspension, her salary would be cut in half, to about $4,400 a month, though she would still have access to a large staff, numbering in the dozens. The man seeking to replace her, Mr. Temer, would take the helm of government while living in his official residence, the Pal\u00e1cio do Jaburu.Concerns are growing about the legitimacy of a government assembled by Mr. Temer. If Ms. Rousseff and the Workers\u2019 Party shift into the opposition, they will most likely claim her ouster was illegal, and Mr. Temer\u2019s top allies remain mired in corruption scandals of their own.Several of his top advisers are under investigation, including Romero Juc\u00e1, a senator from Roraima State in the Amazon, and Geddel Vieira Lima, a former executive at one of Brazil\u2019s largest public banks. Mr. Temer has insisted that those inquiries would not prevent him from naming the advisers to his cabinet.The president has maintained a sense of resolve. Speaking in Bras\u00edlia to activists promoting women\u2019s rights this week, Ms. Rousseff, who was an operative in an urban guerrilla group in her youth, addressed the crestfallen mood around her.Calling her adversaries \u201ctraitors,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m not tired of fighting.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Recognizes New York Drivers\u2019 Group, Short of a Union", "Date": "2016-05-10", "News": "Supported byUber announced an agreement on Tuesday with a prominent union to create an association for drivers in New York that would establish a forum for regular dialogue and afford them some limited benefits and protections \u2014 but that would stop short of unionization.\u201cWe\u2019re happy to announce that we\u2019ve successfully come to agreement with Uber to represent the 35,000 drivers using Uber in New York City to enhance their earning ability and benefits,\u201d said James Conigliaro Jr., the guild founder and assistant director and general counsel at the International Association of Machinists District 15, which represents workers in the Northeast.The agreement is Uber\u2019s latest attempt to assuage mounting concerns from regulators and drivers\u2019 groups about the company\u2019s labor model, which treats drivers as independent contractors. That model helps Uber keep its labor costs low, but it excludes drivers from coverage by most labor and employment laws, such as those that require a minimum wage and overtime.In response, Uber, which is based in San Francisco, has been striking deals to tamp down the problems \u2014 with the proviso that the company be able to continue classifying its drivers as contractors and stop short of allowing drivers to unionize.Under the terms of the deal in New York, which will be in effect for five years, a group of drivers who are guild members will hold monthly meetings with Uber management in the city, where they can raise issues of concern.The drivers will be able to appeal decisions by Uber to bar them from its platform, and can have guild officials represent them in their appeals. In addition, they will be able to buy discounted legal services, discounted life and disability insurance and discounted roadside help for problems they encounter while driving.Yet unlike a traditional union, which contractors typically cannot form, guild members will not be able to bargain over a contract with the company that would stipulate fares, benefits and protections. Uber will continue to determine most of these elements unilaterally, albeit with more input from driversThe machinists union has also indicated that for the duration of the five-year agreement, it will refrain from trying to unionize drivers, from encouraging them to strike and from waging campaigns to have them recognized as employees rather than independent contractors.\u201cIt\u2019s important to have immediate assistance in the industry and this is the structure that provides that,\u201d said Mr. Conigliaro.He emphasized, however, that drivers did not waive any labor rights by joining the guild, and that if Uber drivers were found to be employees at any point during the agreement, the union could try to unionize the drivers at their request.Uber said the agreement would help smooth relationships with drivers, whose frustrations have grown with recent fare cuts and policy changes .\u201cCommunication is important,\u201d said David Plouffe, Uber\u2019s chief adviser. \u201cOn price cuts, we haven\u2019t always had the best forum to discuss and share data \u2014 how price cuts work, what we see afterward.\u201dMr. Plouffe said that as a result of discussions with drivers in certain parts of the country, Uber had adopted a number of changes, like a pilot program to charge riders when a driver has to wait for more than two minutes.With the agreement, Uber also wins an ally in its effort to change the New York State law that levies a nearly 9 percent tax on black car rides but that does not apply to taxis. (There is a 50-cent surcharge on yellow taxi trips.) Uber says the law unfairly singles out parts of its service. Under the terms of the deal, the machinists union will help Uber lobby the State Legislature to treat all hired vehicles equally.Mr. Plouffe said the money likely to be saved from changing the law would flow to drivers\u2019 bottom lines, and some of it would be used to help set up a benefits fund that the guild would administer and whose scope it would determine. Among the potential new benefits is paid time off for drivers.Uber was not seeking to replicate the guild idea outside New York, which differs from other cities in that a much higher fraction of Uber drivers use the platform full time or close to full time, Mr. Plouffe added.Also on Tuesday, Uber said the Freelancers Union, which supports independent workers, will advise the company on how to create portable benefits for its drivers and other gig economy workers.Sara Horowitz, the group\u2019s founder and executive director, praised the agreement as a bold step that would become \u201cpart of a larger strategy for this new work force.\u201dThe agreement drew a mixed reaction from drivers. Eric Grant, a veteran Uber driver who recently served on a panel in Seattle that heard appeals from fellow drivers who had been deactivated \u2014 part of a special pilot program in that city \u2014 said Uber\u2019s new appeals program was a much-needed change.\u201cOne of the issues they have had in the past is that they deactivate people willy-nilly, without any appeals process,\u201d Mr. Grant said.Others, particularly those involved in competing attempts to organize Uber drivers in New York, were skeptical. Abdoul Diallo, who helped found an association of drivers in New York, which is called the Uber Drivers Network and claims about 5,000 members, said that the new organization sounded \u201cbogus\u201d and that the guild was no substitute for an actual union.Mr. Diallo said deactivation was relatively far down the list of concerns for most drivers in his organization. \u201cFirst and foremost, price cuts and commissions matter most to drivers,\u201d he said.The machinists union said no topic was off the table in the guild\u2019s discussions with Uber, including fares and commissions.Mr. Diallo\u2019s group, meanwhile, is encouraging drivers to sign cards that will allow the Amalgamated Transit Union to represent them; more than 5,000 drivers have signed.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mitsubishi Grabs a Shiny Sliver of the American Market", "Date": "2016-05-05", "News": "Supported byWheelsANN ARBOR, Mich. \u2014 IN Japan, the automaker Mitsubishi Motors is mired in a heap of trouble.Last month, it acknowledged cheating for the last 25 years on gas-mileage tests for cars in Japan, embarrassing top executives and tarnishing a name that has been dented by scandal before. Since then, its stock price has plunged, and it has had to halt production of the tiny models at the center of the scandal.But in the United States, it\u2019s a brighter picture.Although Mitsubishi is a bit player, it is increasing new-car sales faster than most other automakers and is expanding its sliver of the American market. Helping the surge are a few affordably priced models that can appeal to consumers on tight budgets, a group other car companies often ignore.The company says the vehicles it sells in the United States \u2014 like the Outlander sport utility vehicle and the Lancer compact \u2014 are not affected by the fuel-economy deception that took place in Japan. American customers and dealers seem unfazed.\u201cI read about it; it doesn\u2019t change my mind a bit,\u201d said Timothy Harig, a retired factory worker in Canton, Ohio, who bought a metallic brown Outlander in October for about $24,000, a few thousand less than competing models from Honda and Nissan. \u201cI track my gas mileage on every tank and I\u2019m happy with what I have.\u201dThere are others like Mr. Harig. In April, while the gas-mileage scandal was making headlines in Japan, Mitsubishi\u2019s sales in the United States rose 18 percent.Its performance stands in contrast to that of Volkswagen, which has been mired in an emissions scandal of its own. Last month, Volkswagen sales fell 9 percent, continuing a steady decline since the disclosure in September.If anything, Mitsubishi\u2019s low profile has helped it weather the storm in the United States. \u201cWith Mitsubishi, it\u2019s a very small number of people who even possibly care\u201d about its troubles at home, said Karl Brauer, an analyst with the auto research firm Kelley Blue Book.He added that Mitsubishi enjoyed the continuing support of its major shareholders, including the Mitsubishi Corporation, Japan\u2019s largest trading company with holdings in electronics, finance, machinery and chemicals.\u201cThey still think there\u2019s potential in the U.S. market and so they stick with it,\u201d Mr. Brauer said.Although it is growing in the United States, Mitsubishi still faces hurdles. The gas-mileage controversy has caught the eye of American regulators, and the Environmental Protection Agency has asked the company to provide more information about its vehicles and to repeat one test that is used to determine a car\u2019s official fuel-economy rating.Don Swearingen, chief operating officer of Mitsubishi Motors North America, said the company was complying and was confident there were no irregularities with the fuel-economy ratings of its American models. He added that he had no concerns that the scandal in Japan could hamper Mitsubishi\u2019s push to grow in North America.\u201cI think they are very committed,\u201d Mr. Swearingen said. \u201cWe add tremendous value to the company.\u201dMitsubishi recently reported that its North American business generated $58 million in operating profit in 2015, the second annual profit in a row in the region after seven years of losses.Still, in the highly competitive American market, Mitsubishi struggles to measure up. Its brand is not a household name like Ford, Chevrolet, Honda or Toyota, and it trails in quality. Last year in J. D. Power\u2019s closely watched initial quality study, Mitsubishi ranked well below average.Automakers also increasingly push dealers in the United States to build megashowrooms offering coffee bars and other plush amenities. Mitsubishi showrooms are often small and spartan.Ann Arbor, Mich., for example, has a Mitsubishi dealership, but it is tucked behind Hyundai and Nissan franchises, and is overshadowed by Toyota, BMW and Chevrolet showrooms down the street. On Tuesday, the dimly lit Mitsubishi showroom was occupied by four Outlanders and no sales employees.Ryan Lester, the sales manager, acknowledged that selling Mitsubishis could be tough. \u201cIt is what it is,\u201d he said.Not so long ago, Mitsubishi\u2019s future in the United States was uncertain.In 2000, it admitted that it had covered up safety defects in its vehicles for years. Then, like other automakers, Mitsubishi was hit hard by the recession.In 2011, a devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan disrupted auto production for months. Lacking inventory, Mitsubishi saw its American sales slump in 2012 to fewer than 58,000 vehicles, half the number in 2007.The next year, another small Japanese automaker, Suzuki, exited the United States market, a move that followed Isuzu\u2019s departure in 2008. It seemed Mitsubishi could be next.To turn around its North American business, Mitsubishi trimmed its model line, ending production of one of its most popular cars, the Galant, and leaving itself without a midsize sedan. It also decided to close its lone American plant, in Normal, Ill. Production ended in November.At the same time, Mitsubishi redesigned the Outlander sport utility vehicle, just in time to catch the wave of consumers moving out of cars and into S.U.V.s. The company also added a small car, the Mirage, that could travel 40 miles or more on a gallon of gas.Both vehicles are aggressively priced. The Mirage, for example, starts under $15,000. In the last two months, Mitsubishi offered rebates of $3,500 that brought prices on 2015 Mirages down further, said Doug Waikem, owner of a Mitsubishi dealership in Massillon, Ohio.\u201cI like the brand,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not huge volume, but I can take someone who\u2019s looking at a used car and say, \u2018Hey, I can get you into something new for about the same price.\u2019\u201dThat is just the deal Steven Sanders made at Mr. Waikem\u2019s dealership last month. Mr. Sanders, a Y.M.C.A. teacher and college student, was looking to trade in his beaten-up minivan for a used Honda Civic. New Civics, which sell for $18,000 and up, were out of his price range.But then his wife ran across the Mirage and fell in love with it, Mr. Sanders said. With his trade-in and the rebate, his total cost came in at $11,000.As for Mitsubishi\u2019s troubles in Japan, he didn\u2019t put much stock in it. \u201cI read a lot of reviews,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a friend who has a Mitsubishi.\u201d He added, \u201cI feel good about it.\u201dAn article on the Automobiles page on Friday about Mitsubishi\u2019s growing success in the American automobile market misstated the Mitsubishi Corporation\u2019s relationship to the automaker. It is a shareholder, not the automaker\u2019s parent.Advertisement"}

Then a blackout swept over the city, shutting down the respirators in the maternity ward.Doctors kept ailing infants alive by pumping air into their lungs by hand for hours. By nightfall, four more newborns had died.\u201cThe death of a baby is our daily bread,\u201d said Dr. Osleidy Camejo, a surgeon in the nation\u2019s capital, Caracas, referring to the toll from Venezuela\u2019s collapsing hospitals.Hospital wards have become crucibles where the forces tearing Venezuela apart have converged. Gloves and soap have vanished from some hospitals. Often, cancer medicines are found only on the black market. There is so little electricity that the government works only two days a week to save what energy is left.At the University of the Andes Hospital in the mountain city of M\u00e9rida, there was not enough water to wash blood from the operating table. Doctors preparing for surgery cleaned their hands with bottles of seltzer water.\u201cIt is like something from the 19th century,\u201d said Dr. Christian Pino, a surgeon at the hospital.The figures are devastating. The rate of death among babies under a month old increased more than a hundredfold in public hospitals run by the Health Ministry, to just over 2 percent in 2015 from 0.02 percent in 2012, according to a government report provided by lawmakers.The rate of death among new mothers in those hospitals increased by almost five times in the same period, according to the report.Here in the Caribbean port town of Barcelona, two premature infants died recently on the way to the main public clinic because the ambulance had no oxygen tanks. The hospital has no fully functioning X-ray or kidney dialysis machines because they broke long ago. And because there are no open beds, some patients lie on the floor in pools of their blood.It is a battlefield clinic in a country where there is no war.\u201cSome come here healthy, and they leave dead,\u201d Dr. Leandro P\u00e9rez said, standing in the emergency room of Luis Razetti Hospital, which serves the town.\u201cThis is criminal that we can sit in a country with this much oil, and people are dying for lack of antibiotics,\u201d says Oneida Guaipe, a lawmaker and former hospital union leader.But Mr. Maduro, who succeeded Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, went on television and rejected the effort, describing the move as a bid to undermine him and privatize the hospital system.\u201cI doubt that anywhere in the world, except in Cuba, there exists a better health system than this one,\u201d Mr. Maduro said.Late last fall, the aging pumps that supplied water to the University of the Andes Hospital exploded. They were not repaired for months.So without water, gloves, soap or antibiotics, a group of surgeons prepared to remove an appendix that was about to burst, even though the operating room was still covered in another patient\u2019s blood.Even in the capital, only two of nine operating rooms are functioning at the J. M. de los R\u00edos Children\u2019s Hospital.\u201cThere are people dying for lack of medicine, children dying of malnutrition and others dying because there are no medical personnel,\u201d said Dr. Yamila Battaglini, a surgeon at the hospital.Yet even among Venezuela\u2019s failing hospitals, Luis Razetti Hospital in Barcelona has become one of the most notorious.In April, the authorities arrested its director, Aquiles Mart\u00ednez, and removed him from his post. Local news reports said he was accused of stealing equipment meant for the hospital, including machines to treat people with respiratory illnesses, as well as intravenous solutions and 127 boxes of medicine.Around 10 one recent night, Dr. Freddy D\u00edaz walked down a hall there that had become an impromptu ward for patients who had no beds. Some clutched blood-soaked bandages and called from the floor for help. One, brought in by the police, was handcuffed to a gurney. In a supply room, cockroaches fled as the door swung open.Dr. D\u00edaz logged a patient\u2019s medical data on the back of a bank statement someone had thrown in the trash.\u201cWe have run out of paper here,\u201d he said.On the fourth floor, one of his patients, Rosa Parucho, 68, was one of the few who had managed to get a bed, though the rotting mattress had left her back covered in sores.But those were the least of her problems: Ms. Parucho, a diabetic, was unable to receive kidney dialysis because the machines were broken. An infection had spread to her feet, which were black that night. She was going into septic shock.Ms. Parucho needed oxygen, but none was available. Her hands twitched and her eyes rolled into the back of her head.\u201cThe bacteria aren\u2019t dying; they\u2019re growing,\u201d Dr. D\u00edaz said, noting that three of the antibiotics Ms. Parucho needed had been unavailable for months.He paused. \u201cWe will have to remove her feet.\u201dThree relatives sat reading the Old Testament before an unconscious woman. She had arrived six days before, but because a scanning machine had broken, it was days before anyone discovered the tumor occupying a quarter of her frontal lobe.Samuel Castillo, 21, arrived in the emergency room needing blood. But supplies had run out. A holiday had been declared by the government to save electricity, and the blood bank took donations only on workdays. Mr. Castillo died that night.For the past two and a half months, the hospital has not had a way to print X-rays. So patients must use a smartphone to take a picture of their scans and take them to the proper doctor.\u201cIt looks like tuberculosis,\u201d said an emergency room doctor looking at the scan of a lung on a cellphone. \u201cBut I can\u2019t tell. The quality is bad.\u201dFinding medicine is perhaps the hardest challenge.The pharmacy here has bare shelves because of a shortage of imports, which the government can no longer afford. When patients need treatment, the doctors hand relatives a list of medicines, solutions and other items needed to stabilize the patients or to perform surgery. Loved ones are then sent back the way they came to find black-market sellers who have the goods.The same applies to just about everything else one might need here.\u201cYou must bring her diapers now,\u201d a nurse told Alejandro Ruiz, whose mother had been taken to the emergency room.\u201cWhat else?\u201d he asked, clutching large trash bags he had brought filled with blankets, sheets, pillows and toilet paper.Nicol\u00e1s Espinosa sat next to his tiny daughter, who has spent two of her five years with cancer. He was running out of money to pay for her intravenous solutions. Inflation had increased the price by 16 times what he paid a year ago.He flipped through a list of medicines he was trying to find here in Barcelona and in a neighboring city. Some of the drugs are meant to protect the body during chemotherapy, yet the girl\u2019s treatments ended when the oncology department ran out of the necessary drugs a month and a half ago.Near him, a handwritten sign read, \u201cWe sell antibiotics \u2014 negotiable.\u201d A black-market seller\u2019s number was listed.Bice\u00f1a P\u00e9rez, 36, scanned the halls looking for anyone who would listen to her.\u201cCan someone help my father?\u201d she asked.Her father, Jos\u00e9 Calvo, 61, had contracted Chagas\u2019 disease, a sickness caused by a parasite. But the medication Mr. Calvo had been prescribed ran out in his part of Venezuela that year, and he began to suffer heart failure.Six hours after Ms. P\u00e9rez\u2019s plea, a scream was heard in the emergency room. It was Mr. Calvo\u2019s sister: \u201cMy darling, my darling,\u201d she moaned. Mr. Calvo was dead.His daughter paced the hall alone, not knowing what to do. Her hands covered her face, and then clenched into fists.\u201cWhy did the director of this hospital steal that equipment?\u201d was all she could say. \u201cTell me whose fault is this?\u201dThe ninth floor of the hospital is the maternity ward, where the seven babies had died the day before. A room at the end of the hall was filled with broken incubators.The glass on one was smashed.

How many babies died because of the blackout was impossible to say, given all of the other deficiencies at the hospital.\u201cWhat can we do here?\u201d Dr. Rodr\u00edguez said. \u201cEvery day I pass an incubator that doesn\u2019t heat up, that is cold, that is broken.\u201dFollow Nicholas Casey on Twitter @caseysjournal.Ana Le\u00f3n and Meridith Kohut contributed reporting from Barcelona, and Patricia Torres from Caracas, Venezuela.Advertisement"}

Theodoros Chronopoulos, said the evacuation of the camp, which had 20,000 migrants at its peak in March and until Tuesday morning about 8,000, most of them Syrians, was carried out \u201ccompletely smoothly\u201d and would continue through the end of the week.\u201cIt\u2019s going much better than we expected, or than we\u2019d hoped even,\u201d he said.A police helicopter monitored the evacuation. Journalists were denied access to the camp to avoid \u201cexciting\u201d the refugees, according to the authorities.Colonel Chronopoulos said 2,500 people had left the camp in the past two or three weeks, in response to gentle but firm urging by the authorities.\u201cReally, this is an intensification of the evacuation, which has been happening gradually,\u201d he said.Katy Athersuch, a communications officer for Doctors Without Borders, one of the aid organizations working at the camp, said the situation was \u201cvery relaxed.\u201d But she expressed concerns about the lack of information for refugees worried about their fate.\u201cThese people have been sitting in a camp for two and a half months, and now they\u2019re being put on a bus with no real explanation about what\u2019s happening,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re scared.\u201dThe migrants are mostly in camps \u2014 some makeshift settlements like the one at Idomeni, others in state-run facilities.Most of the migrants are eager to continue their journeys toward more affluent countries, particularly Germany and Sweden, but those nations have also tightened their borders, and more stringent controls are likely to remain in place for six more months.There are fears, however, that the deal on migrants between Turkey and the European Union might be undermined by tensions between Ankara and the bloc over Turkey\u2019s reluctance to alter its antiterrorism laws and over the legal victory of three refugees, who successfully argued against the rejection of their asylum applications in Greece. The court deemed Turkey an \u201cunsafe country.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "We\u2019ve Seen the Trump Phenomenon Before", "Date": "2016-05-24", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneWhy Donald Trump? That\u2019s the big question the stunned Republican establishment, America\u2019s worried allies, and his frazzled Democratic opponents are asking.But here\u2019s the better question: Why did it take someone like Mr. Trump so long to show up and threaten to upend the nation\u2019s political order?Look around the advanced market democracies of the industrialized, generally prosperous West. Versions of Trump and the kind of politics he represents have been popping up everywhere.In Denmark, that haven of social democracy Bernie Sanders loves, a nativist party that rails against immigration, multiculturalism and the loss of sovereignty to the European Union won more than a fifth of the vote in parliamentary elections last year, three times the share it got in 1998.This is not new. \u201cThere is something cyclical here,\u201d said Paul De Grauwe, professor of European political economy at the London School of Economics. \u201cWe must keep in mind that we have seen these dynamics before.\u201dRight-wing parties have been achieving electoral success in a growing number of nations.\u201cBacklashes against globalization promoted a zero-sum-game thinking: To protect ourselves, we must do so at the expense of somebody else,\u201d said Harold James, an expert on European history at Princeton\u2019s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. \u201cIt increases nationalism and the willingness to go to war.\u201dAnger is built in. Expanded trade and immigration put pressure on the jobs and wages of the working class, yet they also served to deliver enormous wealth and enhanced power into the hands of a tiny elite. In the absence of actions to mitigate the damage and more broadly share the bounty of globalization, it\u2019s no surprise that righteous anger against the establishment has opened the door to unorthodox political entrepreneurs.\u201cThe middle class allows for both democracy and stability,\u201d he writes. Middle-class people \u201ctend to eschew extremism of both the left and the right.\u201d Workers who feel themselves losing their perch in the middle class may be the most vulnerable of all to a populist appeal.Mr. Trump may seem unusual to Americans because the United States did not produce the kind of autocratic populist leaders Europe offered the 20th century, men who built power bases blaming others for their ills: immigrants, Jews, foreigners in general.In the last few decades, Professor Milanovic argues, rising inequality in the United States led not to populism but to what he calls a \u201cplutocratic\u201d equilibrium, where elites purchase political power while the poor are systematically excluded and the working class is encouraged to support the status quo based on issues like gun control and gay marriage.Perhaps the United States\u2019 more vigorous economy allowed the plutocratic equilibrium to survive. But after a couple of decades in which wages have gone nowhere for all but the most fortunate workers, American voters seem willing to give nativist populism a try.Mr. Trump may not be president of the United States. The European far right may remain mostly in the minority. Yet these forces are to a large extent driving the agenda \u2014 pushing mainstream politicians to turn away from establishment positions.What\u2019s scarier, Professor De Grauwe argues, is voters\u2019 sharp turn against reason, opening space for snake-oil salesmen who will promise anything to achieve political power. \u201cThe intellectuals have apparently failed,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you get guys like Trump that come up with statements that have nothing to do with facts.\u201dThese entrepreneurs offer few solutions: Thousand-mile walls and sky-high tariffs will do nothing to mitigate the pressure bearing down on the working class. If the Trumps of this world came to power, might they compromise, further angering their frustrated base? Or might they instead whip up even more anger?It\u2019s possible the United States will soon by governed by a president who rode into office partly by appealing to popular resentment against China, a country where overt nationalism is a central plank of the government\u2019s claim to authority. What would happen if an incident in the South China Sea ended with 200 dead American sailors?\u201cNobody thinks of actually going to war,\u201d Professor Milanovic said. \u201cBut small things can happen that the other must react to.\u201dResponding to overt appeals to naked nationalism is not just about money. It\u2019s also about policies to strengthen workers\u2019 bargaining power; about policies to help displaced blue-collar workers find a productive place in an economy dominated by services.Aggrieved Americans are unlikely to be won over with more generous food stamps or a bigger earned-income tax credit. Anger brews as well even in countries with more robust social safety nets.We shouldn\u2019t try to stop globalization, even if we could. But if we don\u2019t do a better job managing a changing world economy, it seems clear that it will end badly again.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greek Debt Talks Enter Familiar Summer Tumult", "Date": "2016-05-09", "News": "Supported byBRUSSELS \u2014 The Greek debt talks are entering an all-too-familiar stage, as the country\u2019s creditors on Monday sought to overcome a standoff over whether to give new aid to Athens.Eurozone finance ministers discussed the bailout terms and for the first time formally debated ways to possibly ease Greece\u2019s giant debt burden. But the talks here on Monday were inconclusive.The ministers said they would meet again on May 24 in hopes of signing off on a long-delayed review of whether Athens is complying with the terms of the 86-billion-euro bailout agreed to last summer \u2014 its third financial lifeline since the crisis began seven years ago.Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers, told a news conference Monday evening that there could be an agreement leading to more aid for Greece at that May 24 meeting.The Greek government said on Monday that it hoped an agreement would make it possible to dispense \u20ac5.7 billion, or about $6.5 billion, from the bailout funds.European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.Once again, though, there are wide gulfs between European officials, Greece and the International Monetary Fund over a continuing austerity program and the prospects of debt relief for Athens.Greece needs the money to make a debt payment in July. If the parties involved do not come to terms, the country could default, and the markets could be put through another summer of tumult. A year ago, the jockeying over the bailout prompted fears that Greece could crash out of the eurozone and destabilize the wider regional economy.The situation does not seem to have changed much in a year.The I.M.F., a major creditor, has been threatening not to contribute to the bailout program if eurozone member states fail to offer Greece some debt relief. And although the Greek Parliament has narrowly approved a bill overhauling the debt-ridden country\u2019s pension and tax systems, workers in Greece started a three-day general strike on Friday, protesting austerity that has cut household incomes by a third, with around 25 percent of Greeks still unemployed.The Eurogroup ministers have struggled for weeks to find common ground between their national governments and the I.M.F., which has demanded far-reaching guarantees to make the prospect of Greece paying back its loans more realistic.Greek debt is around 177 percent of gross domestic product, and its potential to climb was underlined by an analysis prepared by the European Stability Mechanism, the eurozone bailout fund. That analysis, seen by The New York Times on Monday, showed that Greek debt could fall as low as 63 percent of gross domestic product by 2060 \u2014 or rise as high as 258 percent by that same year. The wide range was a result of different scenarios using variables like the Greek growth rate and the external economic environment.Germany, the main national lender, and a number of smaller countries that have endured austerity, are skeptical about whether Greece needs such relief.\u201cMy assumption will be that there will be a problem of debt sustainability that we need to address,\u201d Mr. Dijsselbloem acknowledged during the news conference. \u201cHow big it is, when we need to address it, how we can address it, we will discuss in detail next Eurogroup,\u201d he said.Euclid Tsakalotos, the Greek finance minister, warned over the weekend that imposing more pain on Greece could lead to the breakdown of bailout negotiations and the creation of a \u201cfailed state\u201d in the region that could shake the currency bloc.But on Monday, at a separate news conference after the finance ministers\u2019 meeting, Mr. Tsakalotos suggested that the plans for an austerity \u201cmechanism\u201d were acceptable to Greece.Asked whether the \u201cmechanism\u201d would also be acceptable to the I.M.F., Mr. Tsakalotos indicated there could be still be more wrangling ahead. \u201cThe I.M.F. made it quite clear it wasn\u2019t its favorite mechanism \u2014 that it didn\u2019t think it was what it would have chosen,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think there is a general recognition by the I.M.F. that we can only do what is legally possible.\u201dThere has also been mounting discontent among ordinary Greeks over the new measures. Protests during the weekend\u2019s general strike briefly turned violent on Sunday when hooded youths pelted the police with firebombs and stones outside the Parliament building in central Athens.The package of measures includes 5.4 billion euros, or about $6.2 billion, in budget savings, chiefly stemming from an overhaul of the social security system, including more cuts to pensions and higher social security contributions. The package also includes higher taxes for Greeks on medium and high incomes, and higher levies on alcohol and cigarettes.Niki Kitsantonis contributed reporting from Athens, and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trembling Before Blancmange", "Date": "2016-05-26", "News": "Supported byEatTo write about something that has gone so far out of style requires (I have learned) some defense. Here is what I like about the old, wobbly white pudding:I like that it is the world\u2019s first truly international dessert, finding, in the Middle Ages, a home in (nearly) every cookbook, and in every country in Europe and the Middle East.I like the economy of its ingredient list, even in medieval versions: almond milk, chicken, sugar, rosewater. In the mid-17th century, the chicken \u2014 exhausted by the centuries of labor \u2014 dropped out, replaced by the thickener isinglass, then sea moss or cornstarch or gelatin. But it stayed simple.I have also always had a soft spot for foods devised for the physically delicate \u2014 an antiquated category including \u201cnursery\u201d and \u201cinvalid\u201d foods, many of which were also desserts \u2014 and for dishes flattered with the compliment \u201cdelicate.\u201d At their intersection is blancmange: easy for a fragile body to digest, and expressing that highest of human ideals, delicacy, which I think enjoys that usage because we all know, on some level, that we are such bulls in the china shop.And I like very much that blancmange, with its endearing tremble and mild name, has proved both resilient and wily. It is as if, over the centuries, the dessert has been ducking or weaving or evading capture, in the style of a reptile or fox or petty thief. It will not be pinned or extinguished.Each time the blancmange is threatened with extinction, it changes. Pease pudding has gone the way of the woolly mammoth. Haddock-apple pie might as well have been a dodo. Why did the blancmange\u2019s mixture of capon and sugar and almond milk not lead to its demise? That is just the sort of thing \u2014 meat in a sweet dish, sugar in an entree \u2014 that often does; we don\u2019t eat much medieval food today. But blancmange dropped an ingredient and stayed.It is with us still. Its dust-rose-and-copper name has rubbed off, but if you put blancmange ingredients and instructions next to those for panna cotta, the differences are only details. Panna cotta isn\u2019t necessarily flavored with nuts; but neither are the blancmanges, so called, that I\u2019m told are still served today at British children\u2019s parties and school lunches.Which delivers me to what I like most about blancmange: as long as it\u2019s without too much gelatin, I find it utterly delicious. Jessica Kerwin Jenkins writes in her \u201cEncyclopedia of the Exquisite\u201d that blancmange \u201ctastes like heaven.\u201d And it is an enrapturing, old-fashioned idea of heaven \u2014 beamy angels with gold harps, God on a throne, St. Peter at the milky gates.cookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fed Is Seriously Considering Raising Interest Rates in June, Meeting Minutes Say", "Date": "2016-05-18", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve sent a sharp, simple message to financial markets on Wednesday: Pay attention. The Fed is thinking seriously about raising its benchmark interest rate at its next meeting, in June.That message was sharply at odds with the expectations of investors, who had largely written off a June increase before Wednesday, betting instead that the Fed would leave rates unchanged until later in the year. Measures calculated from asset prices suggested that investors saw less than a 5 percent chance of a June increase at the beginning of the week; by the end of Wednesday, that had spiked above 30 percent.It remains far from certain, however, that the Fed will move at its meeting on June 14 and 15. The economy has yet to demonstrate the strength the Fed says it wants to see, and some officials said in April there might not be time to gain the necessary confidence before the June meeting.Still the account made clear that Fed officials want markets to take the possibility more seriously.Two other Fed officials similarly said on Tuesday that they were thinking about a June increase.The Fed, which entered the year predicting quarterly rate increases, instead held steady in the first quarter as the global economy weakened and markets swooned. Its benchmark rate remains in a range between 0.25 and 0.5 percent. The Fed is holding rates at historically low levels to support economic growth by encouraging borrowing and risk-taking. It plans to raise rates, gradually reducing those incentives, as the economy gains strength.The April account, published after the standard three-week delay, showed the Fed was continuing to struggle with communications. Officials have said repeatedly that they want to get out of the business of telling markets when rates will rise. They want investors to draw inferences from the economic data. They want to move from date dependence to data dependence.But the account said some Fed officials were frustrated by the conclusions investors had drawn.\u201cSome participants were concerned that market participants may not have properly assessed the likelihood of an increase in the target range at the June meeting,\u201d it said.As a corrective, it offered an account of how the Fed would decide whether to raise rates in June.\u201cMost participants judged that if incoming data were consistent with economic growth picking up in the second quarter, labor market conditions continuing to strengthen, and inflation making progress toward the committee\u2019s 2 percent objective, then it likely would be appropriate for the committee to increase the target range for the federal funds rate in June,\u201d it said.The Fed carefully distinguishes in its meeting accounts between the broader group of 17 officials who attend policy meetings and the 10 of those officials who hold votes. Narayana Kocherlakota, a professor of economics at the University of Rochester who stepped down as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis at the end of last year, noted that those 10 \u201cmembers\u201d were described in the minutes as more tempered in their assessment of the chances of a June hike.\u201cMembers generally judged it appropriate to leave their policy options open,\u201d the account said.William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and one of those voting members, said in a recent interview that it was reasonable to expect the Fed to raise rates twice more this year, but that the decision would depend on the strength of the data.The labor market has gained strength in recent months, while reported economic growth has been relatively weak. Economists have puzzled over which to take more seriously, but the account said most Fed officials had concluded the economy was doing better than the data suggested.They judged \u201cthe apparent softness in spending in the first quarter was unlikely to persist,\u201d it said.Among the reasons: strong job growth, rising incomes and looser financial conditions.Another key question is whether the supply of workers has receded to a normal level, suggesting that continued economic growth will begin to put upward pressure on wages and prices. Officials were described as divided on this issue; some noted evidence that people who had left the labor force were returning in significant numbers, seeing better chances of finding work.Concerns about the persistence of inflation below the Fed\u2019s 2 percent annual target appear to have diminished somewhat. The April account said that for many Fed officials, \u201crecent developments provided greater confidence that inflation would rise to 2 percent over the medium term.\u201dOther familiar concerns remained, in particular about the impact of renewed global weakness.Yet the account portrayed Fed officials as waiting to raise rates largely from an abundance of caution. And it suggested that they did not expect they would be waiting too much longer.Advertisement"}

The choice between good jobs and a healthy planet is a false dichotomy.

The two are mutually reinforcing when green jobs are the priority.RICK FEDRIZZIWashingtonThe writer is chief executive of the United States Green Building Council.To the Editor:Labor unions' opposition to environmentally responsible policy making in favor of smokestack-industry construction projects highlights the failure of our policy makers to come to grips with the decline of old-economy industries and the need for major restructuring and retraining efforts. But that does not justify perpetuating industries that poison our earth.Still, there is a clear path for Hillary Clinton, as the likely Democratic presidential nominee, to satisfy the legitimate claims of both the environmental and the old-industry labor wings of her party. In addition to committing to environmental protection, she can, and she should, pledge to pour effort and funding into major infrastructure projects.The crumbling of our nation\u2019s roadways, bridges, tunnels, water systems and other infrastructure is at a critical stage and is threatening our economic competitiveness. A federally funded initiative to restore and rebuild these essential facilities will bolster our national security, improve the quality of our daily life and, in the process, create huge numbers of jobs for members of labor unions.We missed a golden opportunity to use infrastructure projects to combat the unemployment caused by the recession following the 2008 financial industry meltdown.

Chairs really emptied at the barbershop, though, in 1999 after the Lakers and the National Hockey League team the Kings left the Forum here, Mr. Wells said, and moved to the Staples Center in Downtown Los Angeles, about a half-hour\u2019s drive northeast.The development will include about 900,000 square feet of retail space, a hotel, 2,500 residential units and 25 acres of public parks, all on the site of the former Hollywood Park Racetrack. Plans include almost 800,000 square feet of office space.\u201cThis development adds a dimension to the city that it has never had before,\u201d said Inglewood\u2019s mayor, James T. Butts Jr.Inglewood, a city of 110,000, is just 10 miles from downtown Los Angeles and a short drive from its upscale western environs like Beverly Hills. \u201cInglewood is strategically located in the L.A. basin,\u201d said Bob Healey, a senior vice president at the commercial real estate firm CBRE who specializes in the South Bay area of Los Angeles. Mr. Healey added that commercial values in the areas surrounding the stadium site had already risen.The city has a predominantly black, lower-income community with pockets of middle-class residents and a growing Hispanic population, said Jamie Brooks, a CBRE executive.\u201cThe stadium reinforces the idea that this is going to be a destination,\u201d Mr. Brooks said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a master developer to figure it out: This place has a lot of potential.\u201dIn 2005, Stockbridge Capital Group, a real estate investment management firm, acquired the 238-acre Hollywood Park site, across the street from the Forum and a premier place for horse racing in its day. The firm aimed to build the entertainment complex, which will include a 6,000-seat performing arts theater.The Kroenke Group, a development firm founded by Mr. Kroenke, in 2013 bought a 60-acre parcel adjacent to Hollywood Park and the Forum, which reopened in 2014 and hosts many concerts. The groups formed a joint venture the next year, the Hollywood Park Land Company, to develop Hollywood Park and the newly acquired site.\u201cOur deal involved no financial contribution from the city,\u201d said Mr. Butts, who supported the project. \u201cEverything public and private is financed by the developer.\u201dOnly in a year when the city derives more than $25 million in direct tax revenue from the project is it responsible for any financial reimbursement of the cost of public infrastructure, Mr. Butts said.Now, just as values have increased in markets affected by Los Angeles International Airport, Inglewood expects to see the same.\u201cSince Jan. 12 when the announcement was made, if a Realtor puts a sign on a property in the morning, by the time they get back to the office in the afternoon, they usually have five to six offers, $10,000 to $20,000 over asking price,\u201d Mr. Butts said.\u201cN.F.L. stadiums are used little more than 10 times a year,\u201d Mr. Tomer said. \u201cAnd as we\u2019ve supersized our sports facilities, much like other components of American life, it has become difficult to integrate them into the fabric of our cities.\u201dBut in the case of the Inglewood stadium, he added, \u201cTypical rules may not apply.\u201dOne reason is that the stadium is not directly supported by taxpayers. And Inglewood is close to Los Angeles International Airport and will be accessible by light rail after a Metro stop is completed in 2019.While a professional football stadium might not be the reason people and businesses choose Inglewood, Mr. Tomer said, it encourages them to consider it.\u201cThis is the kind of pattern we see in highly successful regional economies like L.A., San Francisco, New York,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s like your Brooklyn. Inglewood could be on that list, but it\u2019s going to be because of access to other amenities and jobs in the regional district.\u201dInglewood businesses hope to claim some of the influx from the project. Linda Credit, 61, opened up the Rusty Pot Caf\u00e9 on South Market Street two years ago. The restaurant, one of the few lively storefronts on the street, serves the kind of kale salads and specialty aiolis more often found in nearby Santa Monica.\u201cI was thinking about moving,\u201d Ms. Credit said. But the council members who stopped in for lunch urged her to stay before the N.F.L. announcement. \u201cIt\u2019s changing, and that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d she said.Mayor Butts said, \u201cI really do believe that within five years you won\u2019t be able to recognize the new Inglewood.\u201dAmelia Hernandez, 32, runs Selwyn Jewelers, a family business a few blocks from the Rusty Pot Caf\u00e9 on South Market Street. While she expressed concerned about how to keep a mom-and-pop business competitive as bigger enterprises come in, she predicted the development would help the area. \u201cBuy in Inglewood,\u201d she said. \u201cDo not sell.\u201dLast month, Keion Morgan, 37, was in Posh Klipz barbershop in preparation for a job interview as a college recruiter.

{"Headline": "Law School\u2019s Acceptance of GRE Test Scores Provokes Tussle", "Date": "2016-05-05", "News": "Supported byThe legal profession\u2019s gatekeepers engaged in a fierce debate this week after an Arizona law school began accepting applicants who had taken only the more general GRE graduate admissions exam instead of the traditional Law School Admissions Test.The University of Arizona James E. Rogers College of Law announced the new test policy in February, opening its doors to a larger pool of applicants. That decision prompted a scolding by the Law School Admissions Council, the nonprofit entity that oversees the law school applications process. The council warned in an April 4 letter that it might expel Arizona\u2019s school from its network, which would send a strong signal to law schools that they need to play by the established rules.On Wednesday, some 150 law school deans, including Martha Minow from Harvard and Robert Post from Yale, lined up to support Arizona. In a letter to the council\u2019s president, Daniel Bernstine, the deans argued that \u201cexperimentation benefits all of us,\u201d and said that kicking out Arizona \u201cis unwarranted under the existing rules and sends a terrible message to law schools about experimentation in the admissions process.\u201dThe council has significant clout in the legal profession because it oversees the administration of the LSAT and the common application process used by tens of thousands of people when they apply to any of the 206 law schools accredited by the American Bar Association.Last month, the council told Arizona\u2019s law school that \u201csubstantially all\u201d of its member students take the LSAT, and suggested that to ignore that practice could jeopardize the school\u2019s membership.The tussle highlights a growing frustration in legal academia. Some law school deans, grappling with an overall drop in enrollment, view the standardized test as an impediment to their reaching new groups of potential applicants who could become law students. The GRE is given by computer and offered frequently during the year. The LSAT, critics say, is less user-friendly because it is a written exam and offered only four times a year.The council issued a statement on Thursday saying it wanted \u201cto emphasize that our inquiry into the University of Arizona Law School was a request for clarification on the law school\u2019s new policy, which we had only learned about through media reports. To characterize this as a \u2018threat\u2019 is unfortunate.\u201dTwo months before Arizona decided to accept students with successful scores from either test, it worked with the Educational Testing Service to examine whether GRE test results were a \u201cvalid and reliable predictor of students\u2019 first-term law school grades\u201d and, thus, whether the test met the standards set by the bar association, whose section on legal education accredits the country\u2019s law schools. They concluded that the test met the standards.Marc L. Miller, the dean of Arizona\u2019s law school, said it had received about 30 applications from GRE test-takers, and, so far, has admitted three of them for the class entering this fall. And there could be more.\u201cWe are trying to diversify the paths to legal education, and believe that GRE applicants are as good or better than LSAT applicants,\u201d Mr. Miller said. He said the number of people who take the GRE was five times the number of students who take the LSAT.Arizona, ranked nationally among the top 50 law schools, has 130 to 135 first-year students, including 30 who are foreign students earning an American juris doctorate. The 100 American students are about evenly split between Arizona residents and nonresidents.\u201cWe would love to get back to 150, the number we had before the downturn,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cBut we are not looking to GRE takers for that.\u201cAs the economy changed six or seven years ago, we began changing the makeup of our class to admit international students, many of whom are from Asia. But this move is about diversifying the mix, which worked well for us when we tried it earlier.\u201dBut the dispute could get nasty. Mr. Miller also wrote a letter to the council, noting that curbing the school\u2019s admissions policy could raise antitrust issues. Restrictions on the Arizona school\u2019s actions \u201cunreasonably restrain(s) the competition on law school admissions testing market.\u201dHe said on Thursday that two weeks ago he was worried about how his school would get the services of the Law School Admissions Council. \u201cBut after the support from other deans, I don\u2019t see us being left out,\u201d he said.The council\u2019s board, comprised mainly of law school deans and law professors, will meet Friday at a regularly scheduled board meeting, according to spokeswoman Wendy Margolis.\u201cWe can assure our members, and everyone in the law school community, that we are taking all perspectives into account as we consider these issues,\u201d the council\u2019s statement said.Advertisement"}

But \u201cBeer Money,\u201d the memoir of the fifth-generation family member Frances Stroh, is not quite a Detroit story.Stroh came of age among the manicured lawns and stately manors of Grosse Pointe, the most emblematic of old-\u00admoney Midwestern suburbs. The \u00adborder \u2014 in some places a physical barricade \u2014 separating the Pointes from Detroit\u2019s crumbling east side is still the country\u2019s most dramatic visual tableau of racial and economic segregation.Stroh\u2019s absorbing memoir suggests that most cocoons are permeable and that privilege is relative. One of four children growing up in an \u201call but bygone era of lakefront estates, Lilly Pulitzer dresses and big, strapping American cars,\u201d Stroh had a conflicted relationship with money. Her family was surrounded by wealth but haunted by a \u201cconstant sense of scarcity \u2014 a fear of impoverishment that had been part of our DNA before it became a self-fulfilling prophecy.\u201dThe children\u2019s privations were minor but keenly felt: Stroh\u2019s mother foraged for secondhand clothing, made the children come home from the country club for lunches of peanut butter and jelly and insisted on driving to vacations even in Florida and on Martha\u2019s Vineyard.Her father, Eric, on the other hand, spent the Stroh money recklessly, becoming a compulsive collector of antique revolvers, rare guitars and leather-bound first editions \u2014 as well as a volatile, depressive alcoholic. Despite his laissez-faire attitude, he knew how to instill certain fears. At regular intervals, Eric played the abductor in a cruel game designed to teach 7-year-old Frances how to avoid being kidnapped. And when the family car crossed into Detroit, he instructed the kids to lock their doors, \u201cbecause all the people on the street were black.\u201dDespite the fortress mentality, for Frances the money was more a structural promise than a daily reality. In her teenage years, insulation meant both safety and ennui: \u201cWe took risks \u2014 big ones \u2014 as a diversion from our boredom. .\u2008.\u2008. The trick was recognizing where the lines were and then letting someone else cross them.\u201d This \u201ctrick\u201d worked more often than not, but getting expelled from prep schools became a family tradition. Later, so did divorces.The impression of a safety net enables her to spend her 20s pursuing creative fulfillment. In flight from Michigan and the family\u2019s \u201clegacy of failure,\u201d she wins a Fulbright scholarship to London and finds marginal success as an installation artist, turning a broken inheritance into layers of moody abstraction.\u201cBeer Money\u201d sidesteps a comprehensive account of business mismanagement in favor of intimate family vignettes. Chapters are divided by stark, eerie photographs \u2014 some of them taken by Eric, a talented amateur portraitist who never fully developed his craft, and others taken by the author, emblems of her early search for an appropriate medium.Stroh isn\u2019t angry or mournful about the family\u2019s squandered nobility, which she experienced only as residue. The book offers an ambivalent understanding of a complicated birthright, and none of its drama feels like an airing of dirty laundry.Unfortunately, Stroh\u2019s sensitivity falters when she harnesses the family history to a romanticized, clich\u00e9-laden narrative of the neighboring city\u2019s deterioration. \u201cDetroit was an aftermath in the form of a city, a tragic defeat of all things American,\u201d she writes. \u201cPopulations, industries, architecture \u2014 collapsing in on themselves like decimated ruins. The wreckage of this city etched itself into my genetic code, I could feel it, the patterns engulfing every shape and color.\u201d She spells out the apparent narrative connection explicitly: \u201cMy family\u2019s arc was eerily parallel to Detroit\u2019s; we\u2019d boomed together and now .\u2008.\u2008. we were failing together.\u201dSurveying the city\u2019s decline, she blames the combative African-American mayor Coleman Young for disrespecting her family, saying he \u201cgloated as white businesses moved out.\u201d She also faults union leaders who tried to \u201cline their own pockets\u201d and notes that \u201ccrack cocaine, the cornerstone of the new economy, was a difficult commodity to tax.\u201d This is, to put it mildly, a partial and thinly sourced account of municipal history, one whose implied grievances retrospectively sour much of the observational wisdom that permeates this suburban story.\u201cBeer Money\u201d argues that \u201cthe brewery, the family and Detroit all tumbled together, a long-eroded cliff falling whole into that inland sea,\u201d while otherwise suggesting, much more convincingly, that not every downward spiral follows the same trajectory.Akiva Gottlieb has written for The Nation and The Los Angeles Times, among other publications.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greek Lawmakers Narrowly Approve Austerity Legislation", "Date": "2016-05-22", "News": "Supported byATHENS \u2014 After days of heated debate, Greek lawmakers voted narrowly on Sunday to approve a fresh set of financial measures aimed at ensuring that eurozone finance ministers will decide this week to unlock billions of euros in badly needed rescue loans from the country\u2019s third bailout.The legislation passed 153 to 145, with all of the government coalition members in Parliament voting in favor. It includes a one percentage point increase in the highest rate of sales tax to 24 percent, higher taxes on coffee, alcohol, fuel and other goods and new rules liberalizing the market for nonperforming bank loans. There is also a measure creating a privatization fund to sell off state assets and utilities, including public transport companies, the post office and the state power corporation.The legislation also introduces a so-called contingency mechanism that would cut state spending if Greece misses budget targets set by its creditors for the next three years.Addressing Parliament before the vote, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said he had \u201cnegotiated hard to secure the chance for the country to stand on its own two feet.\u201d He later added: \u201cToday, European leaders get the message that Greece is keeping its promises. Now, it\u2019s their turn to do the same.\u201dKyriakos Mitsotakis, the leader of the main opposition party, the conservative New Democracy, accused the leftist-led governing coalition \u2014 which first came to power on a pledge to reverse austerity before signing a third bailout \u2014 of \u201corganized political fraud.\u201d Mr. Mitsotakis, whose party is leading in opinion polls, said the new taxes would \u201cannihilate everyone\u201d and accused the government of \u201cplebifying the middle class.\u201dOutside the Parliament building, protesters gathered to express their exasperation at yet another round of austerity measures. The ones approved on Sunday came on top of pension cuts and increases to income tax adopted earlier this month.The vote came two days before eurozone finance ministers are to meet in Brussels to sign off on rescue loans for Greece and decide what kind of debt relief to offer.Greece and its European creditors have been locked in talks on how to reduce the country\u2019s debt burden, which the International Monetary Fund is insisting on before it joins Greece\u2019s third international bailout. The bailout agreement, signed last summer, is worth 86 billion euros, or $96.5 billion. It follows two bailouts worth a total of 240 billion euros that Greece\u2019s eurozone partners and the I.M.F. granted in 2010 and 2012 in exchange for a barrage of measures that have slashed the economy by a quarter and pushed the unemployment rate to 25 percent.Last week, the I.M.F. said that Greece would need a lengthy period free from debt repayments to put its finances on a stable footing. But eurozone nations, led by Germany, are reluctant to offer debt relief to Greece, fearing the political impact of obliging the taxpayers bailing out Greece to bear an even bigger burden for the country\u2019s past profligacy.Unless the I.M.F. and eurozone officials find a compromise \u2014 or agree to further postpone a decision on the I.M.F.\u2019s participation in the third bailout \u2014 a new crisis is likely.Greece needs fresh bailout loans to pay down some 3.6 billion euros of debt maturing in July. And the prospect of new upheaval in Greece is of particular concern as Europe faces other potentially destabilizing challenges, including a migrant crisis \u2014 with Greece a major transit country for thousands of desperate people \u2014 and a crucial vote in June on Britain\u2019s continued membership in the European Union.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "South Korea Accuses Nissan of Cheating on Emissions Tests", "Date": "2016-05-16", "News": "Supported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korean environmental officials accused the Japanese carmaker Nissan Motor on Monday of cheating on auto emissions tests, and authorities called for one of the company\u2019s executives to face criminal charges.The accusations against Nissan in South Korea mirror the emissions discrepancies that regulators in Europe have detected in a wide range of cars. While those discrepancies have not been considered illegal in Europe, regulators in South Korea say they violate local emissions standards, in the case of Nissan.After Volkswagen\u2019s deception emerged, South Korean officials started investigating the emissions systems of 20 diesel models in the country. As part of that effort, the Environment Ministry of South Korea said on Monday that it had discovered that Nissan had manipulated the emissions of its Qashqai diesel-power sport utility vehicle. The authorities said it had found problems with emissions levels in some other cars, but no cheating mechanisms like the one the Environment Ministry said it found in the Nissan model.Nissan disputed the accusations, adding that the model in question had passed European pollution tests. The cars are made in Britain. \u201cNissan has not and does not employ illegal defeat or cheat devices in any of the cars that we make,\u201d the automaker said in an email statement.The potential hit to Nissan is more reputational than financial.Officials ordered Nissan to recall 814 cars, the total sold in South Korea. The company was also ordered to pay a fine of 330 million won, or about $280,000, and to suspend sales of the Qashqai. The Environment Ministry also said it would ask prosecutors to indict the head of Nissan\u2019s South Korean operations, Takehiko Kikuchi, on criminal charges of violating the country\u2019s emissions law.The United States Justice Department is investigating Daimler, the maker of Mercedes vehicles, over emissions testing. As part of an inquiry into potential emission anomalies, French authorities collected documents from the PSA Group, the parent of Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn.German regulators last month recalled 630,000 cars over emissions issues, a group that includes vehicles by General Motors\u2019 Opel unit, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen. The country\u2019s officials are also looking into whether Opel and Fiat used manipulated software similar to the device found in Volkswagen vehicles. Opel officials are set to testify before an investigatory committee in Germany this week.South Korean authorities have been particularly proactive in the wake of the Volkswagen scandal, as officials look to address the growing health concerns stemming from pollution.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.Officials, who have raided the local offices of the German automaker, fined the company 14.1 billion won, or about $12 million, and ordered a recall of 125,000 vehicles. They have also asked prosecutors to indict two Volkswagen officials in South Korea on related charges. Prosecutors are still considering that request.During the broader inquiry into diesel vehicles, investigators found that the defeat device used in the Nissan Qashqai was set to turn off its exhaust reduction system automatically under regular driving temperatures, the ministry\u2019s statement said. It added that the system turned off when the engine\u2019s intake temperature reached 35 degrees Celsius, or 95 degrees Fahrenheit. Other models turned off at higher temperatures.\u201cOur priority is to protect the interests of U.K. consumers,\u201d the British Department for Transport said in a statement on Monday. \u201cThere is no evidence that Nissan has cheated emissions tests in the U.K., but we continue to monitor emissions investigations in other countries with interest.\u201dThe German Transport Ministry said in a report in April that vehicles from more than a dozen manufacturers, including Nissan, had engines that were programmed to turn down emissions controls in cold weather. As part of its investigation, the ministry tested the Nissan Navara.Officials ordered the recall of 630,000 cars. (The Navara was not part of that group.) The automakers will be required to improve the emissions performance of the vehicles.The ministry said that only Volkswagen had illegal software designed to produce artificially low emissions under testing conditions. Scaling back the emissions controls, according to German authorities, is allowed under certain conditions to protect the motor from damage.The vehicle at the center of the South Korean investigation, the Qashqai, was produced in Nissan\u2019s British plant, using a Renault diesel engine, the ministry said. Nissan and Renault are partners with a common management structure; Carlos Ghosn is chairman and chief executive of the alliance.Nissan said sales of the Qashqai, a compact crossover introduced in 2007 that resembles an S.U.V. and a hatchback, had reached one million vehicles by 2011. The Qashqai is sometimes marketed under the name Dualis.While it is not sold in the United States and it is being phased out in Japan, the car has been especially important in Europe. The Qashqai is credited with helping raise Nissan\u2019s market share in Europe, including Russia, to 4 percent last year, from 2.7 percent in 2009. That amounts to 715,000 units, out of Nissan\u2019s roughly five million annual total.Beyond the issues over emissions testing, automakers have admitted to other irregularities. Last month, in a separate scandal involving fuel efficiency, Mitsubishi Motors acknowledged using a testing method, banned in Japan, that tended to produce a more flattering assessment of fuel economy. But that method is approved in the United States.Jonathan Soble contributed reporting from Tokyo, Melissa Eddy from Berlin and Claire Barthelemy and Prashant S. Rao from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republican Party Unravels Over Donald Trump\u2019s Takeover", "Date": "2016-05-07", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisBy seizing the Republican presidential nomination for Donald J. Trump on Tuesday night, he and his millions of supporters completed what had seemed unimaginable: a hostile takeover of one of America\u2019s two major political parties.Rarely if ever has a party seemed to come apart so visibly. Rarely, too, has the nation been so on edge about its politics.Many Americans still cannot believe that the bombastic Mr. Trump, best known as a reality television star, will be on the ballot in November. Plenty are also anxious about what he would do in office.But for leading Republicans, the dismay is deeper and darker. They fear their party is on the cusp of an epochal split \u2014 a historic cleaving between the familiar form of conservatism forged in the 1960s and popularized in the 1980s and a rekindled, atavistic nationalism, with roots as old as the republic, that has not flared up so intensely since the original America First movement before Pearl Harbor.Some even point to France and other European countries, where far-right parties like the National Front have gained power because of the sort of resentments that are frequently given voice at rallies for Mr. Trump.Yet if keeping the peace means embracing Mr. Trump and his most divisive ideas and utterances, a growing number are loath to do it.The ties between Republican elites \u2014 elected officials, donors and Washington insiders \u2014 and voters have actually been fraying for years. Traditional power brokers long preached limited-government conservatism and wanted to pursue an immigration overhaul, entitlement cuts, free trade and a hawkish foreign policy, and nominees like John McCain and Mitt Romney largely embraced that agenda. Republican leaders also vilified President Obama and Democrats, stoking anger with rank-and-file conservatives.Many Republican voters trudged along with those earlier nominees, but never became truly animated until Mr. Trump offered them his brand of angry populism: a blend of protectionism at home and a smaller American footprint abroad. And he was able to exploit their resentments and frustrations because those same Republican leaders had been nurturing those feelings for years with attacks on Mr. Obama, Democrats, illegal immigrants and others.Mr. Trump, with his steadfast promises to deport immigrants who are in the country illegally and to build a wall with Mexico, may have done irreversible damage to his general election prospects. But he quickly earned the trust that so many of those voters had lost in other fixtures of America \u2014 not just in its leaders, but in institutions like Congress, the Federal Reserve and the big-money campaign finance system that Mr. Trump has repudiated, as well as in corporations, the Roman Catholic Church and the news media.12 PhotosAnd he has amplified his independent, outsider message in real time, using social media and cable news interviews \u2014 and his own celebrity and highly attuned ear for what resonates \u2014 to rally voters to his side, using communication strategies similar to those deployed in the Arab Spring uprising or in the attempts by liberals and students to foment a similar revolution in Iran.\u201cTrump leveraged a perfect storm,\u201d said Steve Case, the founder of AOL, in an email message. \u201cA combo of social media (big following), brand (celebrity figure), creativity (pithy tweets), speed/timeliness (dominating news cycles).\u201dMr. Trump is an unlikely spokesman for the grievances of financially struggling, alienated Americans: a high-living Manhattan billionaire who erects skyscrapers for the wealthy and can easily get politicians on the phone. But as a shrewd business tactician, he understood the Republican Party\u2019s customers better than its leaders did and sensed that his brand of populist, pugilistic, anti-establishment politics would meet their needs.After seething at Washington for so long, hundreds or thousands of miles from the capital, many of these voters now see Mr. Trump as a kind of savior. Even if he does not detail his policies, even if his language strikes them as harsh sometimes, his supporters thrill more to his plain-spoken slogans like \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d than to what they see as the cautious and poll-tested policy speeches of Mr. Ryan and other Washington Republicans.\u201cI love the death out of Paul Ryan, but honestly, I\u2019m going to vote for Trump anyways,\u201d said David Myers, 49, who attended a campaign rally for Mr. Trump in Charleston, W.Va., on Thursday night. \u201cBecause Paul Ryan, and I love him to death, but he\u2019s one of those career politicians.\u201dMr. Trump now feels so empowered that he does not think he needs the political support of the party establishment to defeat the likely Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton. He is confident that his appeal will be broad and deep enough among voters of all stripes that he could win battleground states like Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania without the support of leaders like Mr. Ryan, Mr. Trump said in an interview on Saturday.Although he plans to meet with Mr. Ryan and House Republican leaders on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he would not materially change his policies or style to win their endorsements. \u201cEverything is subject to negotiation, but I can\u2019t and won\u2019t be changing much, because the voters support me because of what I\u2019m saying and how I\u2019m saying it,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThe establishment didn\u2019t do anything to make me the nominee, so its support won\u2019t really make much difference in me winning in November.\u201d (Mr. Trump will, though, be somewhat dependent on the party\u2019s fund-raising muscle since he has indicated he will not fully self-finance his general election campaign.)One reason Mr. Trump takes a skeptical view of establishment support is that he does not believe much in the power of the Republican elite. He is the party\u2019s presumptive nominee, after all, because the political forces that once might have halted his rise have been enfeebled. Leaders such as Mr. Romney warned in the direst terms that Mr. Trump\u2019s nomination would stain the party and lead it to ruin. Venerable media outlets on the right, like National Review, sought to reprise their role as arbiters of who is fit to carry the banner of conservatism. Their pleas fell on deaf ears.Mr. Trump\u2019s arsenal was far more fearsome. Combining modern-day fame and an age-old demagogy, he bypassed the ossified gatekeepers and appealed directly to voters through a constant Twitter stream that seemed interrupted only by television appearances.In doing so, he seemed to grasp that a new twist on direct democracy was in the offing: that disaffected voters who tune out the traditional modes of political communication might be reachable through their smartphones, and Twitter messages or Reddits might be more relevant to those voters than the findings of a more scientific poll.On the left, too, Senator Bernie Sanders has built his own movement with millions of voters, and $210 million in fund-raising, by using online tools as simple as email to seek support. Yet Mr. Trump\u2019s celebrity has been an enormous asset with voters who feel gratified and inspired that he would lavish them with attention and bluntly express some of the ideas and attitudes they share.For 12 consecutive years, polls have indicated that Americans believe the country is on the wrong track, and Republicans have been especially vulnerable to a political campaign like Mr. Trump\u2019s that seeks to channel voter anger. In every state where the question was asked in exit polls during the primary season, 50 percent or more of Republicans said they felt betrayed by their leaders.The adhesive that once held Republicans together \u2014 a shared commitment to a strong national defense and limited government \u2014 was weakened by the demise of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War. But internal divisions were papered over when new, unifying threats emerged after the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.It was not until near the end of President George W. Bush\u2019s second term that those fissures broke open again, first with Mr. Bush\u2019s attempt at an immigration overhaul, including a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, and then after the financial rescue of big banks from the 2008 financial collapse.Alongside the turbulent economy were signs of something more profound plaguing blue-collar white communities, which have increasingly become core Republican constituencies: an increase in children born to single parents, higher rates of addiction and suicide, and shortened average life spans.\u201cThe economic deprivation of the last 30 years for working-class whites, combined with growing social isolation, was really dry tinder,\u201d said Robert D. Putnam, the Harvard political scientist who wrote \u201cBowling Alone.\u201d And Mr. Trump, Mr. Putnam contended, \u201clit a spark.\u201d\u201cHe constructed a series of scapegoats that these folks would find plausible,\u201d said Mr. Putnam, citing Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on Muslims and immigrants. \u201cHe was willing to say things that might have always been popular, but you couldn\u2019t say it.\u201dWith Mr. Trump now saying it loudly and clearly, many Americans feel deeply unsettled by the nation\u2019s politics. Not since Mr. Bush invaded Iraq have so many liberals been murmuring about moving to other countries. And many Republican officials and donors just hope to get through the election with their party intact.\u201cThe party has never been more out of touch with our voters,\u201d Vin Weber, a former Minnesota congressman, said of the two factions, acknowledging that Republicans could splinter completely after this election. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you reconcile a lot of them.\u201dMr. Weber expressed hope that Mr. Trump and Mr. Ryan would find some common ground. But few in the party now deny that the threat of an enduring split is real.\u201cI think there\u2019s a pretty clear Trump wing of the party coming to life,\u201d said Barry Wynn, a prominent fund-raiser who supported Jeb Bush for president and has not yet fallen in behind Mr. Trump. \u201cBut I have to think that four or eight years from now, the Trump wing will be a little more traditional, a little less hard-edged, and will be blended into the party just like the evangelical Pat Robertson voters were after the 1988 election.\u201d\u201cAt least,\u201d he added, \u201cI hope that\u2019s what\u2019ll happen.\u201dNick Corasaniti contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Chief Fund-Raiser Heads Straight for Las Vegas", "Date": "2016-05-12", "News": "Supported byLAS VEGAS \u2014 Less than a week after being recruited by Donald J. Trump to be his campaign fund-raiser, Steven Mnuchin did not waste any time looking for big-money donors.On Wednesday, Mr. Mnuchin met with hedge fund managers at the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas, where the nation\u2019s largest hedge fund conference, the SkyBridge Alternatives Conference, or SALT, is being held.On the sidelines of the conference, Mr. Mnuchin sat with Scott Brown, the former Republican senator from Massachusetts, as he shook hands with prospective Trump donors.Later, Mr. Mnuchin attended a dinner that included the billionaire hedge fund manager Kenneth C. Griffin, David H. Petraeus, the former C.I.A. director and general, and John A. Boehner, the former House speaker. The host of the dinner was Anthony Scaramucci, who runs the investment firm SkyBridge Capital and who last week publicly endorsed Mr. Trump.It is hard to avoid presidential politics this year at SALT, where prominent hedge fund managers weigh in on subjects like the economy and geopolitics and tax policies in the United States. It is the main topic in the speeches delivered on the brightly lit stage and in the closed-door meetings and Champagne-filled after-hours events.Mr. Trump picked Mr. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs executive who is a hedge fund veteran, to be his finance chairman to help him raise as much as $1.5 billion for his campaign.For many on Wall Street, however, publicly supporting Mr. Trump is awkward. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee has been vocal in speaking out against hedge fund managers, talking tough about their pay and saying they \u201cget away with murder.\u201d He has also said he plans to put an end to a tax advantage called carried interest that enables private equity and hedge fund executives to treat their income at the lower capital gains rate, rather than having it taxed as ordinary income.Many of the biggest political backers in the financial world have put sizable amounts of money into the failed campaigns for other Republican presidential hopefuls, like Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush. While many have said they would never support a Democratic candidate, they have also publicly objected to Mr. Trump.Before becoming one of the first on Wall Street to back him, Mr. Scaramucci had been one of Mr. Trump\u2019s loudest critics. Less than a year ago, he called Mr. Trump a \u201chack politician,\u201d warning that his politics were divisive.Mr. Scaramucci had served as Scott Walker\u2019s top fund-raiser and his national finance co-chairman. After Mr. Walker dropped out of the political race in September, urging some of his rivals to follow his lead so that the party could unite against Mr. Trump, Mr. Scaramucci became a fund-raiser for Mr. Bush.But at SALT, Mr. Scaramucci took a very different approach.Mr. Trump, he said, was \u201csaying cuckoo-la-la things to insult the intelligentsia because what he\u2019s discovered is that the average American, the red-meat eating Middle American, loves the swipes at the know-it-alls and I think Donald Trump is enjoying doing that.\u201dMr. Scaramucci met twice with Mr. Trump to talk about his election campaign. The two even discussed the possibility of Mr. Trump coming to speak as a surprise guest at the SALT conference this week.The oil tycoon T. Boone Pickens said at the conference that he expected most Republicans to eventually fall in line and back Mr. Trump.\u201cYou sit there and you say, well, Donald Trump wasn\u2019t who I wanted \u2014 but you have no other choice,\u201d Mr. Pickens said in an interview. Next month, Mr. Pickens will hold a fund-raiser at his ranch in Texas to raise money for Mr. Trump, but he declined to comment on how much he might be willing to donate.Speaking to an audience of money managers on Wednesday, Mr. Pickens said that he agreed with Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal to ban Muslims unless they were vetted.\u201cI\u2019m tired of having politicians as president of the United States,\u201d he added. Yet a year ago, Mr. Pickens announced he would back Mr. Bush, the former governor of Florida.In private and public, hedge fund managers here in Las Vegas have expressed concern that the possibility of Mr. Trump as president could pose a risk to the economy and markets.Others have lamented a decision by Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, not to run for president.Mr. Bloomberg, who addressed an audience in the ballroom of the Bellagio on Wednesday, considered entering the political arena as an independent candidate but decided not to run out of concern that he would help Mr. Trump to secure the nomination. He declined to endorse any candidate when pressed onstage.Mr. Boehner, the former House speaker, made the rounds of the conference, speaking onstage and in private sessions about his views on the apparent unraveling of the Republican Party as Mr. Trump won primary after primary.\u201cWhen you look at Donald Trump and you look at Bernie Sanders, what it tells you is that there is a lot of frustration in America,\u201d Mr. Boehner told a small group of money managers in a session held by Morgan Stanley.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "5 Family Vacations That Don\u2019t Involve Disney World", "Date": "2016-05-31", "News": "Supported byPursuitsI have never understood the hoopla over Disney World.To me, teaching moments and travel go hand in hand. So our family vacations are designed to incorporate elements of enrichment: exposure to foreign culture, a brush with history, interaction with nature, discovery of new foods, engaging in activities that make us step outside our comfort zones. Sure, Disney is fun. But school breaks are few and handled with extreme care.Spending precious vacation time in a manufactured kingdom bent on bringing fantasy story lines to life through relentless entertainment feels like a waste of time. And money. So it\u2019s not surprising that I have avoided the Mousetrap for decades, opting instead for getaways that inspire me and ignite curiosity in my two daughters, ages 10 and 14. Have I denied them some sacred rite of passage? Hardly. They have never even asked to go.So, why do I diss Disney? Foremost, I can\u2019t stand princess culture. The implicit message to young girls that beauty equals a busty blonde in a gown is a stereotype that I refuse to perpetuate. Case in point: the Frozen Makeover, a $164.95 package involving a fairy godmother transforming your daughter (with makeup and a braided hairpiece) into a princess that feels more Honey Boo Boo than royal. Ditto for the myth that a prince will sweep deserving girls off to a life of happiness. The theme park environment with its endless lines, awful food (mammoth turkey leg, anyone?) and stimulation overload inevitably invites tantrums in children and anxiety in parents.And then you have the financial element. Disney is expensive. Between flights, food, hotel, souvenirs and four-day passes to the Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Animal Kingdom, Hollywood Studios and water parks, a family of four (with two children under 10) will easily spend $5,000 (base park entry price plus a \u201cpark hopper\u201d add-on to visit another park is $436.13 for adults and $414.83 for children 3 to 9 per person; water park entry is a one-time fee).The all-inclusive four-day package I put together came in at $4,271, for the park passes, water park and dining plan including popular character experiences and other perks, in one room at a moderately priced Disney Resort hotel.With that in mind, here are five vacation alternatives that deliver hefty doses of fun while broadening your child\u2019s cultural playbook through real-world experiences. Even better, all are based on a budget similar to a four-night stay at Disney World.If the Midwest had a version of the Hamptons, it would be the coastal resort town of Lake Geneva. Celebrity sightings are nil. But sun-drenched afternoons lazing on the water are guaranteed. Another attraction is estate ogling. For over a century, the rich and famous (Wrigley, Schwinn, Maytag, Rockefeller and Sears) have been vacationing in Lake Geneva.There are just nine guest cabins, so by the end of the first day, the staff will know everyone\u2019s name and your children\u2019s snack preferences. On the final night, there is a campout under the stars (or you can sleep in a tepee) complete with fiddlers by the campfire and s\u2019mores. Adults, $980; children 6 to 18, $825; 5 and under, $200 (rates slightly higher in July and August) for the three-night packages.A sample itinerary from Chicago with stops in Memphis and New Orleans looks like this:Advertisement"}

Once more attempting to shake off the old socialist dude hammering her with a sickle, Clinton insisted to Chris Cuomo on Thursday: \u201cI will be the nominee for my party, Chris. That is already done, in effect. There is no way that I won\u2019t be.\u201dIt\u2019s a vexing time for the Clintons. As Bill told a crowd in Fargo, N.D., on Friday, it\u2019s been an \u201cinteresting\u201d year: \u201cThat\u2019s the most neutral word I can think of.\u201dAfter all, why should Bernie Sanders get to be the Democratic nominee when he isn\u2019t even a Democrat? And how is Donald Trump going to be the Republican nominee when he considers being a Republican merely a starting bid?It must be hard for Hillary to look at all the pictures of young women swooning over Bernie as though he were Bieber.She assumed that the fix was in, that she and the D.N.C. had arranged for the coronation that she felt she was robbed of in the tulip craze of 2008.Everyone just laughed when Sanders, a cranky loner from Vermont with a nondescript Senate record, decided to challenge Queen Hillary. Clinton and her aides intoned \u2014 wink, wink \u2014 that it would be healthy to have a primary fight with Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley.But Bernie became the surprise belle of his side\u2019s revolutionary ball. And now he has gotten a taste of it and he likes it and he won\u2019t let it go. He\u2019s bedeviling the daylight out of Hillary.Hillary and her allies are spinning a narrative that Bernie is less loyal to the Democratic cause than she was with Obama. And Trump does delight in quoting Bernie\u2019s contention that Hillary lacks the judgment to be president. On Friday, when he accepted the endorsement of the N.R.A. at its convention, Trump mischievously urged Sanders to run as a third-party candidate and said he would love to have a debate with both Hillary and Bernie onstage.Hillary says Sanders needs to \u201cdo his part\u201d to unify the party, as she did in 2008. But even on the day of the last primaries in that race, when she was the one who was mathematically eliminated unless the superdelegates turned, she came onstage to Terry McAuliffe heralding her as \u201cthe next president of the United States.\u201d She then touted having more votes than any primary candidate in history as her fans cheered \u201cYes, she will!\u201d and \u201cDenver!\u201dSeeing Trump\u2019s soaring negatives, Sanders thinks, if he could just get past Hillary, he could actually be president.The Bernie bro violence \u2014 chair throwing, sexist name-calling and feral threats \u2014 at the Nevada state party convention last weekend was denounced as \u201ca scary situation\u201d by his Senate colleague Barbara Boxer.Sanders condemned the violence while stoking the outrage, urging the Democratic Party to \u201copen the doors, let the people in.\u201d He flashed a bit of Trump, so sure in his belief that the system is rigged that he fed off the nasty energy.Boxer had to call Sanders several times before he called back. She and other Democratic Senate women are fed up with his crusade, feeling enough is enough.I\u2019ve talked to several former Clinton and Obama White House aides who don\u2019t enjoy checking in with the joyless Clinton campaign in Brooklyn. \u201cIt\u2019s the Bataan Death March,\u201d one says.Hopeful acceptance of Hillary has shifted to amazed disbelief that she can\u2019t put away Bernie. Given dynasty fatigue and Hillary\u2019s age, many Democrats assumed that their front-runner would come out of the gate with a vision for the future that gave her campaign a fresh hue, instead of white papers tinkering around the edges. She should have been far over her husband\u2019s bridge to the 21st century and way down the highway by now.Instead, her big new idea is to put Bill in charge of the economy again (hopefully, with less Wall Street deregulation). Again with the two for the price of one. And please don\u2019t deny us the pleasure of seeing Bill choose the china patterns.The 2016 race is transcendentally bizarre. We have two near-nominees with the highest unfavorables at this point in the race of any in modern history. We seem to have a majority of voters in both parties who are driven by the desire to vote against the other candidate, rather than for their own.Hillary can\u2019t generate excitement on her own so she is relying on fear of Trump to get her into the White House. And Trump is relying on fear of everything to get him into the White House.So voters are stuck in the muck of the negative: What are you most afraid of?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tsai Ing-wen Sworn In as Taiwan\u2019s President, as China Watches Closely", "Date": "2016-05-19", "News": "Supported byHer early days in office will be closely watched around the region for signs of her approach to relations with China. Taiwan\u2019s powerful neighbor claims it as part of its territory, and has threatened to use force to prevent Taiwan from taking steps toward formal independence.In the January election, Ms. Tsai easily defeated her closest challenger in a campaign that featured deep concern over the economy. Taiwan has now had three quarters of economic contraction and exports have declined for 15 months in a row.The exiting president, Ma Ying-jeou, of the Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang, had pushed for closer relations with China during his eight years in office. But voters grew increasingly wary of that approach, and large protests erupted in 2014 against a trade pact with China.Ms. Tsai has said she will maintain the cross-strait status quo, but is expected to be far more reserved than Mr. Ma in pursuing trade and other agreements with China.Even before she was inaugurated, China showed clear indications of increasing pressure on Ms. Tsai\u2019s incoming government.\u201cThe honeymoon for Tsai Ing-wen is going to be very short, if it\u2019s not already over,\u201d said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor of government and international studies at Hong Kong Baptist University.Chinese state media outlets have called on her to endorse the \u201c92 Consensus,\u201d under which the Kuomintang and China\u2019s ruling Communist Party both recognize Taiwan and the mainland as part of \u201cone China\u201d but each side has its own understanding of what that means.\u201cIf there is a cross-strait deadlock, or a crisis emerges, the person who changed the current situation should bear responsibility,\u201d Ma Xiaoguang, a spokesman for China\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office, said at a news conference last week.Taiwan\u2019s invitation to participate as an observer in the World Health Organization\u2019s annual assembly this year included, for the first time, a mention of \u201cone China.\u201d The new government said it rejected the organization\u2019s interpretation of the terms of its involvement, but would still participate out of concern for public health.In recent days, China\u2019s military has conducted drills along the Taiwan Strait. While China\u2019s Ministry of National Defense said the exercises were not directed at anyone in particular, many analysts in Taiwan said the timing was connected to Ms. Tsai\u2019s inauguration.Because of an editing error, an article in some editions on May 20 about the inauguration of Tsai Ing-wen as president of Taiwan referred imprecisely to the \u201c92 Consensus,\u201d which Chinese state media outlets have called on Ms. Tsai to endorse. Under the consensus, the Kuomintang and China\u2019s ruling Communist Party currently recognize Taiwan and mainland China as part of \u201cone China,\u201d but each has its own understanding of what that means; it is not the case that the parties have yet to reach the consensus and that doing so would bring them to a common understanding.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Taiwan President Takes Cautious Line on China at Inauguration", "Date": "2016-05-20", "News": "Supported byTAIPEI \u2014 Taiwan\u2019s new president called on China to look beyond the divisions of history for the benefit of people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, as she pledged in her inauguration speech on Friday to promote local industry and push the island\u2019s global trade links to help revive a stagnant economy.But President Tsai Ing-wen\u2019s call got a cool reception from the island\u2019s powerful neighbor. Even before she took office, Beijing had begun putting pressure on Taiwan\u2019s new leader, who is more skeptical of ties with China than her predecessor was.Her inauguration speech was closely watched around the region, particularly in Beijing, for signs of how she will lead and her stance on relations with China.Ms. Tsai offered few surprises in her address outside Taiwan\u2019s Presidential Office in central Taipei. She emphasized domestic issues, like the need to change Taiwan\u2019s pension, education and judicial systems, provide better job opportunities for young people, protect the environment and ensure food safety.\u201cThe people elected a new president and new government with one single expectation: solving problems,\u201d she said.In discussing the relationship with China, she steered a cautious line between the demands of her base in the Democratic Progressive Party, which has traditionally supported Taiwan\u2019s independence, and China\u2019s longstanding threats of force to block any move to formalize such a position.Chinese officials have indicated that they want Ms. Tsai to accept the so-called 1992 Consensus that Taiwan and the mainland are part of one China, each side with its own interpretation of what that means. That understanding formed the basis of the warming ties between the Kuomintang, or Nationalist Party, in Taiwan and the Chinese Communist Party over the past eight years.Ms. Tsai acknowledged the history of discussions between the two sides on Friday, though she stopped short of endorsing the consensus.The 1992 meetings between unofficial representatives of the two sides were \u201cdone in a spirit of mutual understanding and a political attitude of seeking common ground while setting aside differences,\u201d she said. \u201cI respect this historical fact.\u201dThe foundations of cross-strait relations, she said, are the 1992 talks and the 20 years of negotiations that followed; the constitutional system of the Republic of China, Taiwan\u2019s official name; and the island\u2019s democratic principles.\u201cThe two governing parties across the strait must set aside the baggage of history, and engage in positive dialogue, for the benefit of the people on both sides,\u201d she said.In a lengthy statement released Friday afternoon by Xinhua, China\u2019s official news agency, the country\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office noted Ms. Tsai\u2019s comments but said she did not go far enough. The statement said the \u201cTaiwan authorities\u2019 new leader\u201d had \u201cadopted a vague attitude, and didn\u2019t clearly acknowledge the \u201992 Consensus.\u201dIt called her remarks \u201can incomplete examination paper.\u201dMs. Tsai has pledged to maintain the cross-strait status quo, but she is expected to take a much warier approach to relations with China than did her predecessor, Ma Ying-jeou of the Nationalist Party.Under Mr. Ma, trade and contacts with China expanded, but voters in Taiwan grew concerned about the mainland\u2019s growing influence over the island. That contributed to the defeat of the presidential candidate from Mr. Ma\u2019s Nationalist Party and its loss of control of the legislature.Taiwan has been separately governed since 1949, when Chiang Kai-shek fled to the island after his Nationalist forces lost China\u2019s civil war to Mao\u2019s Communists. Mainland China claims Taiwan as part of its territory and says they must eventually be unified.The Taiwan Strait has been a tinderbox at times over the past half-century, but the last eight years saw a period of d\u00e9tente, as Mr. Ma promoted deepening ties between the two sides. Still, the Pentagon warned last week that China\u2019s military capabilities have grown dramatically and that its defense budget is now about 10 times that of Taiwan\u2019s.Since Ms. Tsai\u2019s election, China has taken steps indicating that it would take a much more aggressive approach to her government and renew its challenges to Taiwan\u2019s limited international recognition. (Taiwan is recognized by 22 states, including the Vatican.)In another development that was seen here as resulting from Chinese pressure, Taiwan\u2019s invitation to participate as an observer in the World Health Organization\u2019s annual assembly, first extended during Mr. Ma\u2019s initial term, came this year with an explicit reference to the principle that Taiwan and mainland China are part of \u201cone China.\u201d A spokesman for Ms. Tsai\u2019s government said it would participate in the event in the interest of public health, though it does not accept the \u201cone China\u201d principle and said the W.H.O. was mistaken to mention it.Just days before the inauguration, China\u2019s military conducted large-scale drills on the mainland\u2019s southeastern coast, near Taiwan. While China\u2019s Defense Ministry said the exercises had no particular objective, in Taiwan they were widely considered another signal to the incoming government.And finally, visits by tourists from the mainland dropped 10 percent in March from the previous month, raising concerns that China was beginning to wield its vast economic clout to punish Taiwan.Many observers expect cross-strait ties to deteriorate during Ms. Tsai\u2019s tenure. But they note that both China and Taiwan face slowing economies and other domestic issues, giving them incentives to avoid serious damage to their relationship.\u201cI think we\u2019re going to have sort of a cold peace for a while,\u201d said Bonnie S. Glaser, a senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.The inauguration ceremony on Friday was filled with evocations of the long road to democracy in Taiwan, which first directly elected its president just 20 years ago. Performances included depictions of an infamous 1947 massacre of civilians by government forces, as well as recent student-led protests.\u201cOnce again, the people of Taiwan have shown the world through our actions that we, as a free and democratic people, are committed to the defense of our freedom and democracy as a way of life,\u201d Ms. Tsai said.Ms. Tsai said she would establish a truth-and-reconciliation commission in the presidential office to examine the legacies of Taiwan\u2019s authoritarian era. She also said the new government would take an \u201capologetic attitude\u201d in dealing with the concerns of Taiwan\u2019s indigenous peoples.But Ms. Tsai\u2019s priority will be bolstering Taiwan\u2019s economy, which has contracted for three consecutive quarters. Exports have fallen for 15 straight months.She cited her campaign pledge to focus on developing the biotech, green technology, advanced manufacturing and defense industries. She also said she would push for Taiwan to join trade blocs including the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.China could also try to keep Taiwan out of regional trade agreements. \u201cBeijing was willing to look the other way under Ma but not under Tsai,\u201d Sean King, a senior vice president at Park Strategies, a consulting firm based in New York, said in an email.But Ms. Glaser, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said further efforts to challenge the new government would probably harm China\u2019s long-term goal of courting the people of Taiwan, with an eye toward eventual reunification.\u201cThe Chinese seem to believe they can pursue a harsh policy towards the government here and continue to woo the hearts and minds of the people, that somehow they could have two different policies,\u201d Ms. Glaser said. \u201cI think they really believe that, and to me that\u2019s complete nonsense.\u201dAdam Wu contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Broken Bargain With College Graduates", "Date": "2016-05-21", "News": "Supported byEditorialIt was an important reminder, well suited to the times and the occasion. But it also came across as if the economic benefits of college were a given. In fact, the familiar assumption \u2014 graduate from college and prosperity will follow \u2014 has been disproved in this century. College-educated workers have not seen meaningful pay raises, and public policy has failed to address the stagnation.It is true that as a group college graduates make more than high school graduates. This gap is one reason that politicians like Mr. Obama, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump want to make college more affordable. College affordability is thus linked to equality of opportunity. Since 2002, however, inflation-adjusted pay for college graduates has risen a measly 64 cents an hour, to about $31 on average. That\u2019s surely better than the 49-cents-an-hour drop for high school-educated workers in the same period, to a little less than $17. But standing still while others regress is no cause for celebration.Federal help in paying for college is vital. But it is incomplete without commensurate federal efforts to create good jobs at good pay. Mr. Obama listed some reforms that could create new jobs and raise pay in existing jobs \u2014 and, in that way, help to power the economy. Modernize infrastructure. Raise the minimum wage. Reverse the dynamics that increase executive pay and depress employee pay. Close tax loopholes that enrich the wealthy, and give tax breaks to families to help pay for child care. Ensure that women earn equal pay for equal work.That list is Mr. Obama\u2019s unfinished agenda. It will take all that and more to make full use of the nation\u2019s human capital. Until then, college graduates will struggle, and high school graduates will lag even further behind.Advertisement"}

Sandra Martinsone, a Latvian, said she might apply for citizenship or buy property. Julie Miquerol, from France, has sped up her plans to open a start-up company in Spain.For years, Britain\u2019s relatively vibrant economy has attracted a steady flow of young people fleeing a lack of opportunity in their home countries on the Continent. London in particular is full of young Europeans, who have helped give the city its dynamic, global feel. From entrepreneurs, bankers and fashion designers to artists, waiters and students, all are free to resettle in Britain and make their futures here without so much as a visa.No one knows for sure what would happen to them if Britain voted to leave the European Union \u2014 their immigration status would have to be worked out in the negotiations that would follow \u2014 but the debate itself has left some of the young people feeling fearful, frustrated and even angry.\u201cMaybe I\u2019m too much of a drama queen, but I feel that it\u2019s such a bold statement against immigrants and Europeans,\u201d said Alejandro Mac\u00edas, 31, a Spaniard who lived in Germany before moving to Britain to work in an audience research company.There are concerns that London in particular would suffer if the flow of skilled immigrants fell. About a million European Union citizens from other countries work in London, a city of more than 8.5 million people.Young Europeans interviewed for this article said they were worried that they may no longer be able to live and work in Britain. Entrepreneurs, many of whom flocked to London because of the relative ease of creating start-ups, said they were concerned that they may have to put their business plans on hold.Some said they might leave if Britain rejected the European Union, while others were scrambling to apply for British citizenship or get full-time employment before the June deadline.Rose Carey, the head of immigration at Charles Russell Speechlys, a global law firm based in London, said she had seen an \u201cunprecedented amount\u201d of applications for British citizenship in the last few months.\u201cHistorically, E.U. nationals didn\u2019t really bother applying for a British passport,\u201d she said. \u201cIt used to be a couple a year to now five queries a week.\u201dThere is so much uncertainty about the consequences of withdrawing from the European Union that \u201cthey just want to get the passport so it doesn\u2019t matter what will happen\u201d to Britain, Ms. Carey said.She said she did not expect the government to just kick out all the European nationals living here, but to \u201cput in place transitional arrangements to protect the people who are already here.\u201d\u201cThey are very active in taking measures to make sure they will be able to stay, to actively prove their worth to the U.K. and to the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not passive and waiting to see what will happen. They are engaging in pre-emptive strategies to maximize their opportunities to stay.\u201dIndeed, the contortions many young people have gone through to get here may now be matched only by the schemes they are hatching to remain, even though no one really knows exactly what steps yet to take.Ms. Luis\u2019s path to London is emblematic of the migratory patterns of young people seeking greener pastures while much of the Continent is struggling.She grew up in Cascais, Portugal, and was the first in her family to learn English and attend a university. Her father, a manual laborer, moved to France for a more stable job and to help pay for his daughter\u2019s studies.Eight months ago, she packed her bags for London because her university in Lisbon could not muster the funds to run a master\u2019s course in the field she wants to enter: criminal psychology.She started working at Pod, a London sandwich shop \u2014 in the kitchen first, because her English was not good \u2014 but eventually graduated to working at the cash register and dealing with customers after her language skills improved.Britain will hold a referendum on Thursday on whether to leave the European Union, a decision nicknamed \u201cBrexit.\u201dDesperate to stay in Britain, Ms. Luis, 23, said she hoped to be accepted by a top-ranked criminal psychology program at a Scottish university. She said Scotland was especially appealing to her because Scots seemed determined to stay in the European Union, and have threatened to hold a second independence referendum on breaking away from the United Kingdom should Britain vote to leave.But none of that is guaranteed.\u201cOf course I\u2019m worried,\u201d Ms. Luis said, referring to Brexit. \u201cI want to stay here to work and have my career.\u201d She added that friends who had stayed back home were in dead-end jobs, and that \u201cI don\u2019t want to be like that.\u201dIf Britain votes out, someone like her would not be here, and may not be eligible to remain.Current immigration rules require non-European Union nationals to have graduate-level skill sets and a minimum salary of 20,800 British pounds per year to be eligible for what is known as a Tier 2 visa to work in Britain. The government plans to raise the salary threshold to \u00a330,000, or about $43,000, by next spring.\u201cThe requirement of working in a graduate-level occupation, combined with the earnings thresholds, mean that most jobs in the U.K. labor market do not currently qualify for Tier 2 visas,\u201d the report by the Migration Observatory said.Even those with high-level skills are making plans in case of Brexit \u2014 and even Plan Bs and Cs.Proficient in five languages, Ms. Martinsone, 34, who is from a rural town in Latvia, started her career at Latvia\u2019s Foreign Ministry but took a sabbatical to pursue a master\u2019s degree in political economy in Britain in 2008.When the financial crisis struck, she was asked not to return, she said, because the ministry could no longer afford her. She worked for several months in restaurants, but felt embarrassed by having to polish knives and forks. She used her experiences to blog about Britain\u2019s service industry for a Latvian audience.\u201cIt became quite depressing,\u201d she said, \u201cespecially as I had just gotten my master\u2019s degree.\u201dYet in the midst of tough job market, Ms. Martinsone felt strangely comforted by the knowledge that other workers had good degrees, too. \u201cI felt, \u2018I\u2019m not the only one,\u2019 though it did not make me less eager to prove that I could be valued in London.\u201dShe now works at a charity and said she was considering applying for British citizenship and buying property to forestall the potential consequences of Brexit, which \u201cwould be quite dramatic.\u201d\u201cIf you own something, you might be treated differently,\u201d she said.Short of citizenship, the potential complications have some young entrepreneurs considering leaving altogether.Julie Miquerol, 30, moved to London seven years ago from Champagne, France. She recalled how she had started out living in a room too tiny to fit even a desk. Little by little, she worked her way up, first to a bigger room, and now to a full apartment.Today, she runs her own events company, which caters to French tourists in Britain. London is \u201ca very tough city because life is very, very expensive,\u201d she said. \u201cBut really, if you make it in London, you make it everywhere.\u201dStill, even after so much sacrifice, talk of Britain\u2019s exit caused her to accelerate plans for a sister start-up in Barcelona, Spain, where the European Union\u2019s rules would protect her.That the referendum is taking place at all has deeply offended many Londoners from other European countries, who are not allowed to vote and feel they have contributed a great deal to the life of a deeply international city.\u201cI can\u2019t avoid taking it personally,\u201d Mr. Mac\u00edas, the Spaniard, said. He spends his evenings tearing up leaflets that call for Britain to leave Europe, he said.\u201cThe British speak as if they\u2019re their own continent, floating in the middle of the sea,\u201d he added. \u201cYou\u2019re European. Deal with it.\u201dAn earlier version of this article quoted Ms. Carey incorrectly as she described the number of citizenship applications handled by her firm. She said it used to be \u201ca couple a year,\u201d not \u201ca couple hundred a year.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Venezuela Fell Into Crisis, and What Could Happen Next", "Date": "2016-05-27", "News": "Supported byQ. and A.Here are some basic questions and answers on how Venezuela got to this point under President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and what could happen next.How could this happen in a country that has the largest reserves of oil in the world?The price of oil, Venezuela\u2019s only significant export, has plummeted, which means revenue could fall by 40 percent this year. The government\u2019s huge borrowing, partly a legacy of the years when oil prices were far higher, has helped bring the crisis to a head because Venezuela now has far less money to repay its foreign debt, forcing Mr. Maduro to slash imports in order to avoid default.On top of that are the consequences of a drought, which has shriveled the country\u2019s hydropower generation, a critical source of electricity.Is the situation going to get worse or better in the coming months?The country owes roughly $120 billion to foreign creditors and must make a payment of nearly $7 billion this year, most of it in the final quarter. Speculation has persisted that Venezuela may default on the payment or have to default next year, especially if oil prices remain low.Venezuela\u2019s problems have been worsening for years, since well before Mr. Maduro took power. What is different now?With Mr. Ch\u00e1vez gone, Mr. Maduro\u2019s opponents have won a majority of seats in the national legislature and have collected nearly two million signatures on a petition to start a recall of Mr. Maduro.So why doesn\u2019t Venezuela just default on its foreign debt and force Wall Street creditors to renegotiate more favorable terms?Venezuela may have a lot to lose in a default, too.\u201cIf you default on PDVSA, you have Argentina 2, and nobody wants that,\u201d said Pablo Venturino, managing director of White-Bridge Capital Management, a New York investment firm that specializes in Latin American debt securities. PDVSA, he said, \u201cis the main generator of cash flow for your country.\u201dWhy is Venezuela\u2019s inflation rate so high?The cost of foreign goods has soared in Venezuela, which is importing far less as part of Mr. Maduro\u2019s effort to conserve dwindling central bank reserves.The government has sought to soften the impact by raising wages and printing more bol\u00edvars, the national currency. But that is a recipe for inflation, creating too much money chasing too few goods. By some estimates, the inflation rate could reach nearly 500 percent this year and 1,600 percent in 2017.While the official exchange rate is about 10 bol\u00edvars to the dollar, the black-market rate, which is regarded as more accurate, is about 1,100 bol\u00edvars to the dollar, though it shifts around. Many economists say this disparity is unsustainable.Why doesn\u2019t the government acknowledge that the bol\u00edvar is artificially overvalued and make the exchange rate closer to what it should be?A devaluation would sharply increase prices at state-run stores that many poor Venezuelans rely on to survive, and would make debts denominated in dollars far more expensive to repay. It would also be an admission by Mr. Maduro that an important Ch\u00e1vez-era policy has failed.How are we seeing this policy reflected in daily life?Why are they called bachaqueros?They are named after large, voracious ants, bachacos, which cut leaves and bring them back to their colonies. While this is a disparaging term, many Venezuelans supplement their income as part-time bachaqueros, and others have quit their jobs to be full-time bachaqueros.So Venezuelans have developed an inventive way to cope. Isn\u2019t this a good thing? Not really, many economists say. The amount of time ordinary Venezuelans spend to purchase life\u2019s daily necessities has frustrated and angered them. It has also created a new class of speculator-merchants who profit illicitly from government policy.Can Mr. Maduro really enforce his threat to seize private businesses to make them produce?Still, Mr. Maduro has not seized any businesses yet, which some political analysts attribute to the government\u2019s inability to take over anything more. \u201cIt\u2019s part of his rhetoric,\u201d said Risa Grais-Targow, director of Latin America at the Eurasia Group, a political risk consulting firm in Washington. \u201cHe\u2019s stayed very true to the message of economic war with the private sector. To what extent do people believe it? Not that much.\u201dWhy doesn\u2019t China, one of Venezuela\u2019s biggest benefactors and creditors, help bail out Mr. Maduro\u2019s government?China, a large customer of Venezuela\u2019s oil under guaranteed contracts, recently announced eased terms on its existing loans to Venezuela, roughly $50 billion. But, like other foreign powers, China is reluctant to grant new loans to the Venezuelans, possibly because of worries about Mr. Maduro\u2019s political longevity.A Q.-and-A. article on May 28 about the Venezuelan economic crisis misstated one consequence of a devaluation of the bol\u00edvar, the Venezuelan currency. It would make debts denominated in dollars \u2014 not bol\u00edvars \u2014 more expensive to repay.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "No Longer a Market Like No Other, Fairway Fades", "Date": "2016-05-07", "News": "Supported byBig CityAs business reporters have duly noted, Fairway\u2019s difficulties have stemmed in large part from the greed of private-equity investment, which has fueled an aggressive and miscalculated expansion. Despite its image of urbanity, Fairway now includes among its 15 locations a branch set a few paces from a Sears in a mall in Rockland County. A few years ago, another outpost opened in Chelsea, one block from a Whole Foods that had been in operation for more than a decade. Simultaneously, of course, came the guerrilla incursions from FreshDirect and Blue Apron and the countless other three-steps-to-vegetarian-cassoulet meal-delivery services that the Internet economy has facilitated.Arguably, though, Fairway has also fallen victim to a culture of increasingly tiered consumer experiences, for which it remains almost too quaintly ecumenical. Beginning in the 1990s, with the growth of stores like Target, cultural commentators spoke often of the democratization of design \u2014 the phrase was trotted out to the point of linguistic abuse \u2014 a reference to the notion that clothes, teapots, place mats and so on, created to the standards of elite tastes, were now available to a mass audience. If you had money and you were hip, you expressed your renegade affluence by positioning a West Elm vase on top of a $20,000 Biedermeier chest. In some sense, however, rising inequality has pushed the trend toward a reversal. In a city where $4 million apartments are so common that they begin to seem modest, shopping down risks an affliction of heightened status anxiety.Recently a friend sent me a photograph of an empty aisle at a Fairway on the Upper East Side, taken on a weekday evening at 5:30, when the store should have been flooded with shoppers waiting in line to buy wild Alaskan salmon on their way home to watch \u201cThe Night Manager.\u201d A large \u201cBig Sale\u201d sign loomed ominously. I held this image in my mind against the one I have of the Dean & DeLuca on Madison Avenue in the 80s, which I have never seen short of full \u2014 full of uniformed private-school children getting cookies in the afternoon, full of grown men and women in Barbour coats and Burberry and Herm\u00e8s nearly at every other time.Architects and urban planners say that, around the world, retail space will eventually be colonized by food vendors, because no matter how many rolls of toilet paper or value packs of LED light bulbs or 10-ply cashmere sweaters we can buy on Amazon, we, as human beings, will always crave the tactile pleasure of buying food when we are in front of it.Fairway catered to that instinct well. What the \u201cmarket like no other\u201d underestimated was the growing desire to feel as if you are living in the pages of Elle Decor when you are buying dried fruit.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China Lending Inflates Real Estate, Stocks, Even Egg Futures", "Date": "2016-05-01", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 China is pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into its economy in a new effort to support growth. Some of it is going into roads and bridges and other big projects that will keep the economy humming.And some of it is going into eggs.Egg futures have surged by as much as one-third since March, the sort of move that would be justified if investors believed China\u2019s chicken flocks were headed for an unfortunate fate.But the market\u2019s usual participants say the flocks are fine. In fact, the actual price of eggs in the country\u2019s markets has fallen from a year ago, according to government statistics.\u201cMany commodities prices have gone up crazily,\u201d said Du Shaoxing, a futures trader in Guangzhou, in southern China. \u201cWe surely hope for a more stabilized trend where futures can reflect economic fundamentals. The way in which recent commodity prices went up is worrisome.\u201dChina\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.China is the world\u2019s biggest producer of eggs, but it is not clear whether the investment surge in eggs will have an impact on real-world prices. Jumps in the futures prices on commodities markets can take months to trickle down to the real world, and if the commodities surge subsides, then the price of eggs in local markets may not budge.By mid-April, the frenzy made Shanghai futures contracts in steel rebar, the rods used in construction to reinforce concrete, the most actively traded in the world \u2014 overtaking trading volumes of two major oil futures contracts, West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude, that have helped set oil prices for decades, analysts at Citigroup said in a report last week.\u201cThere is very little rational or fundamental basis for why prices have gotten as out of hand as they have, or why volumes are so high, other than just irrational exuberance,\u201d said Alex Wolf, an emerging markets economist at Standard Life Investments in Edinburgh, who previously worked as an American diplomat based in Beijing and Taipei.Economists blame Beijing\u2019s new efforts to shore up its economy. Government officials increased lending by state-controlled banks and offered other support measures in the first few months of the year as economic growth slowed and longtime drivers like manufacturing and exports showed continued weakness.Saad Rahim, the chief economist at Trafigura, one of the world\u2019s biggest traders of metals and oil, calculates that China added about $1 trillion in new liquidity in the first quarter of the year \u2014 an amount that would be roughly equal to the entire quarterly economic output of Germany during the same period.\u201cThis kind of scale is unprecedented and some of it will leak into speculative investments,\u201d Mr. Rahim said.But in turning to its old playbook, China risks adding to its already fast-growing pile of debt, which by some estimates is nearly 300 percent of gross domestic product.But the renewed push for credit-fueled growth shows that policy makers\u2019 concerns about China\u2019s debt burden appear to have been set aside for now. By delaying efforts to wean itself off cheap credit, China may be setting itself up for some problems related to debt and industrial overcapacity.A property market bubble arose from the huge stimulus that Beijing deployed after the 2008 financial crisis, which set off a building boom.Stocks overtook property in investor interest last year. A raging bull market that was cheered on by official news outlets like People\u2019s Daily, the Communist Party\u2019s newspaper, skidded to a halt in June.Her company supplies eggs to KFC and McDonald\u2019s restaurants, and sells them at more than 10,000 supermarkets across China, including those of chains like Walmart, Carrefour and Metro.Hubei Shendan uses the futures market to hedge its bets against swings in actual egg prices. An abnormally volatile futures market makes that job more difficult.\u201cThe reason we are in the egg futures market is because the big swings in egg prices will affect our profitability, and a good futures market will help us in that regard,\u201d Ms. Chen said.Owen Guo in Beijing contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Pollution From Canadian Oil Sands Vapor Is Substantial, Study Finds", "Date": "2016-05-25", "News": "Supported byOTTAWA \u2014 The amount of pollution created by vapor from Canada\u2019s oil sands, which contributes to climate change, ranks on par with most major cities in North America, according to a new study by the country\u2019s environmental regulator that was published on Wednesday.The study was published just as several major oil sands operations were trying to reopen after being evacuated because of a massive wildfire in the Fort McMurray, Alberta area. Earlier efforts to restart operations were abandoned after the fire swung north and reached the perimeter of Suncor\u2019s and Syncrude\u2019s large mines and plants. Large fire breaks prevented any damage, however.The study takes a close look at what happens to the tarlike bitumen of the oil sands. Vapor from the bitumen is released into the air when it is dug up in open pit mines and later as the oil is separated out.Once in the atmosphere and exposed to sunlight, those vapors mix with other chemicals to become particles known as secondary organic aerosols, or S.O.A.s. Those aerosols, which form a major component of smog, are considered a risk to human health.John Liggio, a scientist with the air quality research division of Environment and Climate Change Canada, said the rate at which the oil sands created those particles was unexpected.\u201cThe chemistry tells us this should happen,\u201d said Mr. Liggio, who is based in Toronto. \u201cWe were surprised by the extent. It\u2019s greater than Houston.\u201dThe concentration of oil refineries around Houston makes it a particularly large source of the particles. But Mr. Liggio said the oil sands were rivaled by only the largest metropolitan areas, like Los Angeles, in North America when it came to creating the particles. Vehicle exhaust and electrical generation are the main sources of the particles in cities.The paper found that the rate of particle production related to the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico was about the same as that of the oil sands. \u201cBut the spill lasted only for a few months; the oil sands has been operated for decades,\u201d Mr. Liggio said. He added that the oil sands vapor also converts more easily into polluting particles than fumes from lighter grades of oil.Shao-Meng Li, another Environment Canada scientist and co-author of the study, said the S.O.A. particles tended to lower temperatures by reflecting energy back toward the sun. All atmospheric particles, he said, are know to harm cardiovascular and respiratory health.\u201cThis is all new information for us,\u201d said Terry Abel, the director of oil sands at the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. \u201cIt\u2019s one more piece of information about what\u2019s happening in the environment in and around these facilities.\u201d He said more research would be needed to determine the impact of the particles.The study was based on data gathered by specialized instruments on aircraft that flew around the major oil sands sites north of Fort McMurray. The researchers want to focus their future efforts on determining how and where most of the vapor is released. Other scientists are also studying the effects of the particles after they make their inevitable descent back to earth.The researchers on the study also want to look at whether oil sands projects that use underground injections of steam to release the bitumen are any better than those that use open-pit mining. While Mr. Liggio said limiting emissions from the plants that process the oils sands after they were dug up might be possible, what could be done with those mines was less clear.\u201cYou can\u2019t build a huge bubble over a huge open pit mine,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ultra-Luxury for the 1%", "Date": "2016-04-30", "News": "Supported byLettersReaders discuss how certain businesses, like cruise lines, are catering to the very wealthy.The privileged will always carve out enclaves of splendor. These are targeted by some of The Times\u2019s ads. The threat to democracy is not from a disparity in dining options on cruises, but from an entrenched gap in critical services. The article only touches on the real divide \u2014 where public services favor the wealthy. Forget the false dichotomy of luxury travel. Look at the bifurcated legal system, asymmetric political influence, and imbalances in education, medical options and, sadly, even potable water. This is where, and why, the income gap matters.MARGARET V. SIEBELWashingtonTo the Editor: A generation ago, only the very wealthy idle rich could take cruises. Now, cruising is within the reach of large segments of the population, and that democratization of the cruising experience should be celebrated, not scorned. With the demand so large and democratized, cruise companies can now segment the market and provide fancier amenities for those who want and can pay for them, while providing a vacation experience to tens of thousands that could only have been imagined a few decades ago. And that segmentation should also be celebrated because the higher profits from the luxury passengers effectively subsidize the mass-market passengers, making a cruise vacation more affordable for more people.Rather than illustrating some sort of fundamental unfairness or inequality, the article demonstrates how free markets benefit those of modest means by making goods and services more affordable.ROBERT ATKINSONSparta, N.J.To the Editor: To even suggest that this is news angers me. Ninety-nine percent of us have known this for decades. We shop at Sam\u2019s Club, drive an older vehicle, are knee deep in credit card debt and have a mortgage we can\u2019t afford. Many of us are paying off exorbitant college loans.

Your \u201cmoney-based caste system\u201d is not news to us. That businesses are catering to the wealthy is not news either. Businesses know that we, at the bottom of the income heap, are pumped dry.

What\u2019s next? An expos\u00e9 revealing that first-class passengers on airlines get preferential treatment, knee room, free drinks and almost edible food?JEAN VANDERVOORT CULLENNew YorkTo the Editor: To say the cruise industry has recently begun catering to the affluent at the expense of the rest of the public is wrong for at least three reasons.Special services for well-heeled guests is a long maritime tradition. Such opulence was well depicted in the movie \u201cTitanic.\u201d Given this tradition, Norwegian Cruise Line\u2019s Haven oasis and Royal Caribbean\u2019s super suites aren\u2019t anything particularly new.Another grand maritime tradition is that every new ship must outdo all ships previously built.

{"Headline": "Chasing Bigger High, Marijuana Users Turn to \u2018Dabbing\u2019", "Date": "2016-05-12", "News": "Supported byOn a recent bright afternoon, two teenage boys in boat shoes and shorts strolled up Fifth Avenue in Manhattan in a crowd of passers-by. At 56th Street they paused as one pulled an electronic pipe out of his pocket and held it to his friend\u2019s lips. Inside was a potent and little-studied drug made from distilled marijuana; they were emboldened, they said, by the fact that the gooey wax hardly has a smell, and is so novel in New York that, even if discovered, parents, teachers or even the authorities hardly seem to know what it is.As throngs walked by, the boys stood in front of the diamond-filled windows of Harry Winston, getting high.The practice of consuming marijuana extract \u2014 a yellow, waxy substance that can contain high levels of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the chemical in unprocessed marijuana that produces a high \u2014 appears to have risen rapidly in New York City over the past few years, according to federal law enforcement officials as well as people who use and sell the drug. Its rise crosses social lines, from experimenting teenagers to workers on Wall Street. And it is driven by many factors, including the Eastward-trickling effects of a much more permissive marijuana culture in the West, where it is now dispensed legally in some states.Medical experts have begun to raise alarms, saying the substance is too new to be fully understood and could pose unknown health risks. Critics cite its largely unregulated production, in a process that often involves home cooks who douse marijuana with volatile butane, which can lead to explosions.A spokeswoman for the Police Department said there were no records of any officers even encountering the extract; last year, 15,000 summonses were issued for possessing small amounts of marijuana.Federal law enforcement officials, however, say the drug, also known as shatter, butter and honey, is now on their radar. \u201cWe monitor any type of new twist on drug use in order to warn the public of its danger,\u201d James J. Hunt, special agent in charge of the federal Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s New York division, said in an email. Referring to the marijuana extract, he said, \u201cNot only is the method of production explosive, but the use has serious physical and psychological side effects.\u201dUnderscoring the drug\u2019s rise is a profound cultural shift: As social mores regarding marijuana have loosened, there is a sense among some that dabbing, as the practice of using the extract is popularly known, titillates because plain old pot has lost its edge.\u201cA lot of it is, we\u2019re doing it in disguise,\u201d said one of the teenagers on Fifth Avenue, both students at the Masters School, a private boarding school in Dobbs Ferry, New York. The two asked that their names not be used because they did not want get in trouble with the police or school administrators. The advent of vaporizers and the smaller \u201cvape pen,\u201d a device similar to an e-cigarette, users say, is also increasing the popularity of dabbing. Just squeeze the extract into a chamber inside the pen, one teenager said, and inhale. \u201cAnd we can do it so freely,\u201d he said.His classmate says the appeal is the ferocity of the high. Users can sometimes pass out after inhaling, and the stupefying effects can last for hours, and border on the hallucinatory. Marijuana, in its traditional plant form, has a THC concentration of about 20 percent, according to information distributed by the Drug Enforcement Administration. The wax used for dabbing can have a concentration of up to 80 percent.\u201cMarijuana,\u201d the teenager said, \u201cis the beer of THC, as dabbing is to vodka.\u201dThe extract is typically made by pouring a solvent over marijuana plants to extract the THC, then letting the solvent evaporate. The waxy substance that remains, and its variants, now make up a booming sector of the marijuana economy, according to the ArcView Group, a company that studies and invests in the cannabis industry.The product is so new that even in states where marijuana is permitted to some degree, there is frequently no regulation concerning its labeling or how it is made. \u201cThe laws haven\u2019t caught up with this part of the marketplace,\u201d said Paul Armentano, the deputy director of Norml, a national organization that advocates the legalization of marijuana.There has been little research on marijuana concentrates and whether they affect the body differently than other forms of marijuana. But what is known is cause for concern, according to Emily Feinstein, the director of health law and policy for the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse. \u201cThere is some evidence to suggest that the outcomes, like the effects, may be supercharged,\u201d Ms. Feinstein said in an email. \u201cSide effects can include: a rapid heartbeat, blackouts, psychosis, paranoia and hallucinations that cause people to end up in psychiatric facilities.\u201dEven among marijuana proponents, dabbing is a polarizing topic. On message boards and online forums, some say it is just another way to consume the drug, while others fear that it could be misused. \u201cWhen a product is more potent, and when the route of administration is conducive to people experiencing a very strong high very quickly,\u201d Mr. Armentano said, \u201cthen one can argue that the risk of abuse goes up.\u201dA man who sells marijuana on Craigslist, who identified himself as Tony Holl, said in an interview that his business had risen dramatically. \u201cI was surprised; once one person asked, then a whole bunch of people asked,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a trend.\u201dOne user, a 27-year-old man who lives in Midwood, drew a parallel with the technological advances that have shrunk computers into palm-size smartphones and as driving the fad for a smaller, more powerful punch. \u201cBack in the day, people had to find a way to smoke weed, to roll it into something,\u201d he said, adding that to do so now, in this era of concentrates, seems archaic.On a recent afternoon in SoHo, Mr. Holl, who is 40, produced manila envelopes he said he was on his way to deliver. A police officer walked nearby, but Mr. Holl said he was not concerned as he displayed his wares: white paper smeared with brownish wax. He said most people would not recognize it as a drug.One thing Mr. Holl says he will not do, however, is use his product. The high, he said, is too intense. \u201cThat\u2019s the only dangerous thing about it,\u201d he said. \u201cOpportunities can pass you by.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders Wins Oregon; Hillary Clinton Declares Victory in Kentucky", "Date": "2016-05-17", "News": "Supported byMrs. Clinton raced around Kentucky in the two days before the primary, hoping to fend off Mr. Sanders in a state that she won easily in 2008. In unofficial results late Tuesday night, Mrs. Clinton edged Mr. Sanders by about 1,900 votes, or less than half a percentage point, with all counties reporting. The Associated Press had not declared a winner by midnight.The close result meant that she and Mr. Sanders would effectively split the state\u2019s delegates. Nonetheless, winning Kentucky would give her a symbolic triumph that could blunt the effect of her loss in Oregon as she turns her attention to Donald J. Trump, her likely general election opponent.His continued strength has put a spotlight on her vulnerabilities as she heads toward a likely general election matchup with Mr. Trump, and on a lack of unity, and even fractiousness, within the Democratic Party.In an acknowledgment that she was still engaged in a primary battle, she faulted Mr. Sanders for voting against the auto industry bailout, a claim that is not as clear-cut as she suggested it was.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you this,\u201d she told patrons at the diner on Monday, \u201cI\u2019m not going to give up on Kentucky in November.\u201dMr. Sanders also spent time in Kentucky, with rallies over the weekend in Bowling Green and Paducah.He, too, looked toward the general election, arguing that he, not Mrs. Clinton, was the more formidable candidate to take on Mr. Trump, citing polls of hypothetical matchups.Speaking on Tuesday night at a rally in Carson, Calif., Mr. Sanders said: \u201cThere are a lot of people out there, many of the pundits and politicians, they say, \u2018Bernie Sanders should drop out. The people of California should not have the right to determine who the next president will be.\u2019\u201dAn interactive delegate calculator that lets you simulate how the 2016 Democratic nomination process could unfold.\u201cWell, let me be as clear as I can be,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe are in till the last ballot is cast.\u201dWith her overwhelming support from superdelegates, the party leaders who can vote as they wish, Mrs. Clinton could clinch the nomination by June 7, when six states vote or caucus, including California and New Jersey. But Mr. Sanders has said he would try to persuade superdelegates to back him instead, based on his strength against Mr. Trump.\u201cIf they want the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders is that candidate,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in Paducah.Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, have been treated well by Kentuckians in the past. Mr. Clinton won the state in both 1992 and 1996, and Mrs. Clinton won in a landslide against Barack Obama in the 2008 primary.Mr. Sanders noted that landslide on Tuesday in pointing out that this year\u2019s Kentucky primary ended in a virtual tie.In this year\u2019s campaign, Mr. Sanders has been embraced by white working-class voters and young people in many places, which has raised questions about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s ability to attract such voters in November\u2019s general election.As she campaigned in Kentucky, Mrs. Clinton recalled the prosperity of the 1990s and appealed to voters who have fond memories of her husband, saying on Sunday that he would be \u201cin charge of revitalizing the economy.\u201dShe also worked to recover from when she said in March, \u201cWe\u2019re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.\u201d Mrs. Clinton was discussing renewable energy, and she went on to say that coal miners should not be left behind, but the statement has haunted her.Kentucky is one of the nation\u2019s biggest coal-mining states, and Mrs. Clinton stressed her commitment to coal miners.\u201cWe can\u2019t and we must not walk away from them,\u201d she said on Sunday at a rally in Fort Mitchell. \u201cI feel such a sense of obligation.\u201dAfterward, Judy Gilbert, 55, said she would vote for Mrs. Clinton in Tuesday\u2019s primary. But asked if she thought Mrs. Clinton would win the state, Ms. Gilbert hesitated, and brought up coal. Mr. Sanders wound up doing well in Kentucky\u2019s coal regions, helping offset Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advantage in Louisville and Lexington.\u201cYou know, a person could say one bad thing and everybody remembers it, and she can say 10 good things and nobody remembers that,\u201d Ms. Gilbert said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the truth in life.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putting Grit in Its Place", "Date": "2016-05-10", "News": "Supported byWe all know why it exists, but the grade-point average is one of the more destructive elements in American education.Success is about being passionately good at one or two things, but students who want to get close to that 4.0 have to be prudentially balanced about every subject. In life we want independent thinking and risk-taking, but the G.P.A. system encourages students to be deferential and risk averse, giving their teachers what they want.Creative people are good at asking new questions, but the G.P.A. rewards those who can answer other people\u2019s questions. The modern economy rewards those who can think in ways computers can\u2019t, but the G.P.A. rewards people who can grind away at mental tasks they find boring. People are happiest when motivated intrinsically, but the G.P.A. is the mother of all extrinsic motivations.The G.P.A. ethos takes spirited children and pushes them to be hard working but complaisant. The G.P.A. mentality means tremendous emphasis has now been placed on grit, the ability to trudge through long stretches of difficulty. Influenced by this culture, schools across America are busy teaching their students to be gritty and to have \u201ccharacter\u201d \u2014 by which they mean skills like self-discipline and resilience that contribute to career success.Sure, she starts the book by describing grit as persevering through unpleasantness. She describes Beast Barracks, the physical ordeal that first-year West Point cadets have to endure.She writes about high school students who grind away at homework for hours and athletes capable of practicing in the most arduous way possible.And yet Duckworth notes that moral purpose also contributes to grit. People who are motivated more by altruism than personal pleasure score higher on grit scales. She also notes that having a hopeful temperament contributes to perseverance.Most important, she notes that the quality of our longing matters. Gritty people are resilient and hard working, sure. But they also, she writes, know in a very, very deep way what it is they want.This is a crucial leap. It leads to a very different set of questions and approaches. How do we help students decide what they want? How do we improve the quality and ardor of their longing?I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m really bad at being self-disciplined about things I don\u2019t care about. For me, and I suspect for many, hard work and resilience can only happen when there is a strong desire. Grit is thus downstream from longing. People need a powerful why if they are going to be able to endure any how.Duckworth herself has a very clear telos. As she defines it, \u201cUse psychological science to help kids thrive.\u201d Throughout her book, you can feel her passion for her field and see how gritty she has been in pursuing her end.Suppose you were designing a school to help students find their own clear end \u2014 as clear as that one. Say you were designing a school to elevate and intensify longings. Wouldn\u2019t you want to provide examples of people who have intense longings? Wouldn\u2019t you want to encourage students to be obsessive about worthy things? Wouldn\u2019t you discuss which loves are higher than others and practices that habituate them toward those desires? Wouldn\u2019t you be all about providing students with new subjects to love?In such a school you might even de-emphasize the G.P.A. mentality, which puts a tether on passionate interests and substitutes other people\u2019s longings for the student\u2019s own.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Erdogan Moved to Solidify Power by Ousting a Pivotal Ally", "Date": "2016-05-05", "News": "Supported byClearly shaken, but a loyal party soldier to the end, Mr. Davutoglu described his relationship with Mr. Erdogan as \u201cbrotherly.\u201d\u201cYou will never hear me say negative things about our president,\u201d he said Thursday, his voice quavering. \u201cMy loyalty to him will last until the end.\u201dMr. Davutoglu\u2019s resignation exposed a rift between the two men over Mr. Erdogan\u2019s moves to expand his power. Their split signals that Mr. Erdogan\u2019s transformation from democrat to autocrat is nearly complete, his ambition of establishing an executive presidency closer at hand.As an Islamist leader who presided over a growing economy and seemed serious about advancing democracy in Turkey, Mr. Erdogan was embraced by the West when he came to power in 2003. A dazzling and charismatic reformer, he seemed to embody the promise that Islam and democracy could coexist.In recent years, critics have argued that Mr. Erdogan never intended to become a liberal leader, citing an old quote attributed to him that \u201cdemocracy is like a bus, when you arrive at your destination, you step off.\u201dThe ouster of Mr. Davutoglu offered another vivid example of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s autocratic style and his mastery of power politics that Turks this week likened to characters from \u201cThe Godfather\u201d or \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201dMr. Erdogan is often compared to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia for his authoritarian style and his ability to keep winning elections while eroding the quality of Turkey\u2019s democratic institutions. Mr. Erdogan burnished that image when he switched from prime minister to president, something Mr. Putin had done to preserve his political supremacy.Mr. Davutoglu, long seen as subservient to Mr. Erdogan, was often compared to Dmitri A. Medvedev, Mr. Putin\u2019s loyal deputy. But Mr. Medvedev has stuck around and Mr. Davutoglu is out.\u201cMr. Erdogan doesn\u2019t even want someone like Davutoglu, who was pretty much singing his tune, with some nuances,\u201d said Suat Kiniklioglu, a former lawmaker with the A.K.P. and the chairman of the Center For Strategic Communication in Ankara. \u201cStep by step, he\u2019s making sure his political objective, which is the presidential system, is achieved.\u201dThe resignation of Mr. Davutoglu follows one of his greatest successes as prime minister: a deal with the European Union to stem the flow of refugees from Turkey to the Continent.Mr. Davutoglu, not Mr. Erdogan, was front and center in those negotiations, and the international attention he received angered Mr. Erdogan, analysts said. Mr. Davutoglu also sought a meeting with President Obama, according to Turkish news media reports, and though the meeting did not transpire, the analysts said it nevertheless raised the ire of Mr. Erdogan.In public, Mr. Davutoglu has largely been deferential to Mr. Erdogan. \u201cHe was praising him and glorifying him,\u201d said Mr. Kiniklioglu, the former lawmaker.But Mr. Davutoglu was known to be less enthusiastic than Mr. Erdogan in pushing for a presidential system, something that would have eliminated any remaining authority in the office of prime minister, which under Turkey\u2019s Constitution is the most powerful position.\u201cThere is no major ideological divide between the two,\u201d said Omer Taspinar, an expert on Turkey at the Brookings Institution. \u201cIt\u2019s a power struggle, with Erdogan pushing for total loyalty and full support for his presidential agenda and Davutoglu showing slight resistance in order to keep checks and balances to protect his role as prime minister.\u201dWhile his public comments indicated little distance between him and Mr. Erdogan, there were signs lately that Mr. Davutoglu was trying to assert himself and, at least modestly, challenge Mr. Erdogan\u2019s authority.\u201cThe basic problem is that Erdogan seeks to eliminate anyone in the party who has any ambitions of authority of their own,\u201d said Svante E. Cornell, a Turkey analyst with the Central Asia-Caucasus Institute, a research organization.The split between Turkey\u2019s top two political leaders added another element of turmoil at a time when the country is facing numerous challenges: a war in the southeast against Kurdish militants; spillover from the war in Syria, with cross-border shelling; and the arrival of millions of refugees.Mr. Davutoglu had been the chief architect of Turkey\u2019s Syria policy, which is widely viewed as a failure.For years, Turkey allowed its southern border with Syria to be an easy conduit for weapons and fighters, a policy criticized by the United States and other allies for allowing the rise of the Islamic State. The refugee crisis shows no signs of abating, and Syria\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad, remains firmly in power, backed by Russia and Iran.Analysts say Mr. Davutoglu will most likely be cast as the scapegoat for Turkey\u2019s Syria policy by Mr. Erdogan and his inner circle.The country also endured a period of political instability last year, after the A.K.P. lost its parliamentary majority before regaining control in a snap election. During this period, Turkish stocks fell and the Turkish lira lost value against the dollar, reflecting investors\u2019 concerns about Mr. Erdogan\u2019s unchecked power.Mr. Kiniklioglu said that Mr. Davutoglu\u2019s assertiveness on international issues very likely raised concerns among Mr. Erdogan and his inner circle that the prime minister was slowly trying to exercise his own authority.Referring to Mr. Erdogan, Mr. Kiniklioglu said, \u201cHe just wants someone who sits quietly in Ankara until the executive presidency is in place.\u201dMr. Davutoglu said he would step aside after a special party congress to choose a new leader to be held on May 22.Mr. Erdogan, who as president is supposed to be above party politics, is expected to help choose a successor to his former acolyte who will be subservient and lead his effort to rewrite the Constitution and establish a presidential system. That would most likely require new elections for the A.K.P. to gain more seats in Parliament to approve any constitutional changes.Mr. Davutoglu, a bookish and professorial counterweight to the brash and abrasive Mr. Erdogan, agreed in 2014 to be prime minister when Mr. Erdogan was elected president. Other top A.K.P. officials had demurred, fearing that they would have no authority under Mr. Erdogan.Analysts say Mr. Erdogan, given his power and his vast popularity among Turkey\u2019s pious masses, is unlikely to face much political cost in removing Mr. Davutoglu.Advertisement"}

Greek citizens were in the streets protesting the idea of more cuts. .But, Europe\u2019s finance ministers failed to agree on whether Greece had made enough progress, putting off a decision until they meet on May 24. They are also balking at an International Monetary Fund demand that Greece get debt relief when the bailout program ends in 2018. The I.M.F. is threatening to pull its support from the program if that relief is not offered.The problem is Germany, Greece\u2019s main national creditor: German federal elections will take place next year, and many German citizens feel their hard work and thrift should not be squandered on rescuing the Greeks from the pain of their fiscal sins.Last year, Germany threatened to oust Greece from the European Union and the euro if it didn\u2019t deliver on austerity measures.

There is still much to be done, including attracting private development without alienating the park\u2019s newfound fans. Yet Ms. Koch will not be there to enjoy it. After a decade on the job, and on the island, she will announce her retirement on Monday.\u201cThe summer of 2005, the year before I started, a grand total of 8,000 out of eight million people came,\u201d Ms. Koch said at a cafe in Lower Manhattan later on Thursday. \u201cThe buildings are vacant, you couldn\u2019t bring a bike, you couldn\u2019t eat or make art or dance. You couldn\u2019t do much of anything. Now we get 8,000 people every Saturday and Sunday.\u201dThe city had hoped to release a request for proposals by the end of the year for the island\u2019s remaining undeveloped parcels: two lobes of land covering 33 acres on the south end, as well as occupants for the nearly 1.2 million square feet of historic military structures on the north end. Now, the city will solicit expressions of interest this year, which will shape a formal proposal process next year.\u201cThe city\u2019s economy is spawning new companies and new ideas, and what could be a better place for that than this iconic entry to New York City, where the past can literally collide with the future,\u201d said Alicia Glen, a deputy mayor.\u201cI\u2019m always very careful to call this an island, not a park, because it\u2019s not \u2014 it\u2019s an economic development project,\u201d Ms. Koch said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing worse for a building than to sit vacant.\u201dShe pointed out that if the island were full of restaurants, cultural institutions, artisan shops, business incubators and an educational campus, the interview probably would have taken place on the island, instead of in Lower Manhattan, after the last ferry had returned at 6 p.m.\u201cYou need these kinds of active uses to both pay for and justify more frequent ferry service,\u201d Ms. Koch said. \u201cEvery hour is just a little too unpredictable, but if you knew there was a ferry every 20 minutes until 10 o\u2019clock, you might stick around for another drink.\u201dEarly on, Ms. Koch realized the only way to attract developers was to attract everyone else first.\u201cI grew up here, and I didn\u2019t even know what Governors Island was,\u201d Ms. Koch said. \u201cEveryone was asking what should go on the island, but Dan and I agreed that was the wrong approach. Instead, let\u2019s just get people to the island and let them help us figure it out.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard to believe it\u2019s only been a decade,\u201d said Jessica Lappin, president of the Downtown Alliance, a business group that has worked closely with Ms. Koch. \u201cAnd we\u2019re just getting a taste, because it\u2019s about to take off.\u201dAs for where she might set up next herself, Ms. Koch is waiting to figure that out.\u201cThe island is ready for its next chapter, and so am I. I just can\u2019t wait to have the summer off for the first time in 10 years,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Game of Thrones\u2019: Tyrion, Daenerys and the Art of the Deal", "Date": "2016-05-16", "News": "Supported byGame of ThronesThe president didn\u2019t elaborate as to why, though you could guess. Who doesn\u2019t love Tyrion? He\u2019s smart, he\u2019s witty, he likes a good glass of wine or three. What\u2019s more, he and the president share a favorite quote.What president wouldn\u2019t want to hear his worldview echoed in the smooth dialogue of Peter Dinklage? But by contrasting Tyrion\u2019s realism with the more incendiary leadership style of Daenerys (Emilia Clarke) \u2014 breaker of chains, mother of dragons and Tyrion\u2019s boss \u2014 \u201cStranger\u201d also suggested that Tyrion\u2019s pragmatism is a political tough sell, and that it has its limits.More broadly, Tyrion is arguing for realpolitik principles that, our own election has shown, never stop being controversial: choosing deals over ideals. It\u2019s the sort of approach that, in foreign policy, Donald J. Trump has attacked as making \u201ca terrible deal\u201d with an untrustworthy enemy, that in domestic policy Bernie Sanders has dismissed as \u201casking for half a loaf.\u201dTyrion\u2019s deal is morally complicated by the fact that it involves slavery. Dany, with her Unsullied and her dragons, overthrew the slavelords, who have started a bloody insurgency and taken back the cities outside Meereen. Tyrion offers them time and money: seven years to transition from a slave economy, and compensation for their losses.Pragmatic? Maybe, but Abe Lincoln, he ain\u2019t.The racial dynamics of American slavery may not map directly onto those in \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d \u2014 in the source books, slaves come from many countries, sometimes the same as their slavers. But \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d is made to be watched in our world, where the optics of a rich white man bargaining away the freedom of darker slaves is unsettling. (There\u2019s an Orientalist overtone to the whole Essos story line, in which Dany is often cast as a white savior and Tyrion is a kind of colonial viceroy, mangling the language and trying to tame the exotic East with Western efficiencies.)\u201cBook of the Stranger\u201d plays up this discomfort, focusing on the incredulous reaction of freed slaves Missandei and Grey Worm, even if they have little choice but to back Tyrion in the end. As Missandei points out, however sad a life Tyrion has had, his brief stint in chains doesn\u2019t mean he knows anything about spending a life as property.\u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d like the source books by George R. R. Martin, has a bias toward its horse-trading Tyrions and Littlefingers. The morally rigid, like Ned and Stannis, break where they can\u2019t bend.But Tyrion\u2019s worldview is also insufficient by itself. He\u2019s able to cut a deal \u2014 which may or may not work in the end \u2014 only because Dany had upended the slave economy in the first place. Would Tyrion ever have done that on his own?Doubtful. He\u2019s too practical, and practicality tells him, as he airily tells the slave masters, that the rich and poor will always be with us. During his stint as King Joffrey\u2019s Hand in King\u2019s Landing, his goal \u2014 and he was good at it \u2014 was to keep his monstrous nephew\u2019s worst impulses in check while trying to manage the crown\u2019s finances and keep House Lannister from being ousted.Better him than Joffrey \u2014 or Tywin \u2014 but in the end his impulse was to work within the system and thus keep the system going: to create a kinder, gentler Lannisterism. His talent is greasing the wheels, whereas Dany, in her own words, wants \u201cto break the wheel.\u201dThe pyrotechnic last scene of \u201cStranger\u201d contrasted Tyrion\u2019s style of accommodation with Dany\u2019s permanent revolution. Her imprisonment in Vaes Dothrak brought her back to where she started, geographically and figuratively.After leading and losing a khalasar, after conquering Meereen and fleeing it, Dany is still all about blowing up the system. Rather than escape quietly, she burns down everything, freeing the dosh khaleen and \u2014 again, but on an apparently bigger scale \u2014 becoming khaleesi. In case you didn\u2019t notice history repeating, the episode ends with Dany, fireproof breasts and all, stripped naked by the flames just as she was by the pyre in which her dragons were born in Season 1.Will this story end any better a second time? Has Dany grown, or is she destined to fly from revolution to revolution, leaving chaos behind? The show\u2019s head seems to be with Tyrion, but its heart is with Dany \u2014 certainly immolating a temple full of rapists feels better than plying slave traders with prostitutes.It may turn out that neither of them has an effective answer: Maybe Sansa or Jon or Arya will. But just as the world of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d is both ice and fire, \u201cStranger\u201d suggested that true leadership ultimately requires the head to work with the heart.In this contentious political season, the show suggests a kind of radically moderate unity ticket of revolutionary and functionary. You need Danys to change the world and Tyrions to fix it. Every wheel breaker needs her deal maker.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Student Question | Do We Need a Higher Minimum Wage?", "Date": "2016-05-10", "News": "Questions about issues in the news for students 13 and older.Is raising the minimum wage an effective way to address poverty? Does it reduce social inequality? Or does it hurt the economy and raise unemployment?   It is the Republicans who are playing politics. By opposing a $15 minimum, they are currying favor with corporations that keep wages low as a way to keep profits high. They ignore the economic arguments in favor of $15. They also are defying the majority of voters in New York who support it, according to recent polls.In addition, a $15 minimum in 2021 would meet, not exceed, the benchmarks accepted by most economists. A minimum wage is generally considered adequate if it is equal to at least half of the average hourly wage, which is now about $27 in the state. That means a $30 average wage and a $15 minimum in 2021 would be fair and reasonable.More important, any amount less than $15 in 2021 would be too little for most workers to live on. According to research from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, people in New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s poorest counties required nearly $10 an hour in 2014 to meet basic living costs. To cover the costs for one adult and one child took at least $22 an hour. To argue against a $15 minimum wage in 2021 is to argue for poverty-level wages.\nA higher minimum would undoubtedly raise the living standard of the majority of low-wage workers who could keep their jobs. That gain, it is argued, would justify the sacrifice of the minority who became unemployable. The argument isn\u2019t convincing. Those at greatest risk from a higher minimum would be young, poor workers, who already face formidable barriers to getting and keeping jobs.The standard argument against a higher minimum wage is that it will lead to job loss as employers, unable to pay more, lay off current workers or don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hire new ones.It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to state up front that research and experience don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bear that out. The minimum wage has been raised many times without hurting employment. Rather than cut jobs, employers have offset the cost of higher minimums through reduced labor turnover. Employers also cope with a higher minimum by giving lower raises further up the wage scale, raising prices modestly or other adjustments.\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Should the government raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour? Should states maintain a minimum wage that keeps workers out of poverty? Do you support the new laws passed in California and New York raising the minimum wage in those states?\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Or do you think there are better ways to diminish poverty? Do you believe the free-market principle of supply and demand should determine wages without government interference? \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Do agree with the 2016 editorial board\u2019s logic that the minimum wage should be half the average hourly wage, and therefore $15 by 2021? Or do you think it should be less or more? Why?\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Why do you think The New York Times editorial board\u2019s stance regarding the minimum wage has changed over the past three decades?

{"Headline": "Catching a Flight? Budget Hours, Not Minutes, for Security", "Date": "2016-05-02", "News": "Supported byItinerariesSecurity lines at airports are getting longer \u2014 much longer \u2014 and wait times could reach epidemic levels when air travel peaks this summer, according to airlines, airports and federal officials.A combination of fewer Transportation Security Administration screeners, tighter budgets, new checkpoint procedures and growing numbers of passengers is already creating a mess at airports around the country.While federal security officials say they are hiring and training hundreds of additional screening officers, matters are not expected to improve anytime soon.Airline and airport officials have said they fear that the current slowdown will last through the year, and could cause a summer travel meltdown when more than 220 million passengers are expected to fly during the peak travel months of July and August.\u201cThis is going to be a rough summer; there is no doubt about it,\u201d said Gary Rasicot, who was recently appointed to a newly created position as the T.S.A.\u2019s chief of operations. \u201cWe are probably not at the staffing level we would like to be to address the volume. This is why we are talking about people getting to the airport a little earlier than planned.\u201dTo deal with the expected crowds, Mr. Rasicot said the agency planned to assign 768 new officers to the busiest airports by June 15. The agency is also allocating an extra $26 million for overtime pay, and is looking for ways to move its explosive-sniffing dogs where they will have the most effect on reducing wait times.Already, passengers have reported epic lines.Travelers have seen lines stretching to the curb, snaking to other terminal levels or even extending into different concourses.Some have managed to handle the situation with humor.Others have not been quite as forgiving.At Charlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina, about 600 passengers missed their flights on March 25 because an inadequate number of screeners led to waits exceeding three hours, airport officials said. Brent D. Cagle, the airport\u2019s interim director of aviation, complained to the T.S.A., calling the episode a \u201cfiasco.\u201dThis was far from an isolated incident. Airports in Atlanta, Miami, New York, Seattle, Denver and Chicago, among others, have all experienced similar problems in recent months.Last month, Denver Airport advised travelers to get to the airport as much as three hours before their flights. Still, people waited for more than an hour and a half to clear security.T.S.A. officials say the main reason for the longer lines is an increase in the number of travelers this year.\u201cWhere it starts is actually a volume issue,\u201d said Mr. Rasicot, who was previously a senior official with the United States Coast Guard, as was the T.S.A.\u2019s administrator, Peter V. Neffenger. \u201cIt\u2019s really a good-news story. The economy is doing well, Americans are traveling more, and this equates with record numbers at our checkpoints.\u201dAt the same time, he said, the number of T.S.A. screeners has declined by about 5,800 because of tighter budgets. The agency currently has 42,350 agents assigned for security checks.\u201cWe need to stop losing people and we need to add more,\u201d he said.He said some airlines were helping by assigning their own employees to perform some tasks, like helping direct passengers to the right lanes or advising them on when to take off their shoes.Still, many passengers complained that the agency seemed ill prepared to handle the crowds.Ben Cheever, a support engineer for a cybersecurity firm, recently missed a flight in Seattle despite getting to the airport two hours ahead of his 6 p.m. departure to San Diego. Two lines spilled into the airport lobby, he said. A third was reserved for passengers who had signed up to a trusted traveler program called T.S.A. PreCheck that allowed them speedier access.After 90 minutes, the T.S.A. opened a couple of extra lanes, but he still missed his flight. \u201cIt was too little, too late,\u201d he said. The next day, he showed up three hours ahead of time. \u201cIt was the most miserable business trip I\u2019ve ever had.\u201dAmerican Airlines said that the slower security lines had forced it to delay flights and rebook passengers who had missed connections. For instance, in a one-week period in mid-March, the airline said, about 6,800 of its passengers missed their flights after being stuck in T.S.A. lines too long.\u201cT.S.A. lines at checkpoints nationwide have become unacceptable,\u201d said Ross Feinstein, a spokesman for American Airlines. \u201cLines grew in January, February and March, and now in April, too. We are really concerned about what happens in the summer.\u201dAnother factor that lengthens wait times is that passengers are carrying more bags on board to avoid paying fees for checked luggage.But there\u2019s not much airlines can do, except warn passengers to show up three hours before takeoff for international flights and as much as two hours ahead of their flights for domestic travel.In response, the T.S.A. stopped randomly processing some passengers who had not enrolled in a prescreening program to go through its expedited PreCheck lanes.It eliminated a program known as Managed Inclusion II, which let officers trained in behavior detection direct some passengers through the faster PreCheck lanes after checking them for explosives using trace detection samplings.Now, T.S.A. agents send unvetted passengers through the PreCheck lanes only if they have been checked by explosive-sniffing dogs while waiting in line. (That policy is called Managed Inclusion I.)Meanwhile, T.S.A. agents have been finding record numbers of guns and other weapons that passengers are barred from carrying on the plane.Both the airlines and the T.S.A. said that one way to alleviate the longer wait is to sign up for PreCheck, which allows eligible passengers to go through the speedier lanes without having to take off their shoes and belts or remove laptops and other electronic devices from their bags.So far, seven million people have enrolled in one of several trusted traveler programs, including 2.5 million in the T.S.A. PreCheck program and 2.5 million in Global Entry, a program run by Customs and Border Protection.There is an $85 application fee for the T.S.A. program, and a $100 fee for Global Entry. Both are valid for five years.The T.S.A. has added more PreCheck lanes, but the number of people enrolled still falls well short of the 25 million the T.S.A. would like to sign up.Even passengers with PreCheck have had close calls.Anne Marie Harrison, a wine saleswoman who has signed up for PreCheck and who flies out of Newark Liberty International Airport about twice a month, said she nearly missed her flight after waiting more than an hour recently.That day, the security line started downstairs, in the baggage check-in area. That was odd, she said, especially for a Sunday morning when the airport was usually empty.\u201cSomething needs to be done,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is just crazy.\u201dStill, not everyone is complaining.Martha C.

{"Headline": "New York Fed Chief Believes the Central Bank Is on the Right Track", "Date": "2016-05-08", "News": "Supported byWilliam C. Dudley, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York president, who helped pilot the Fed\u2019s post-crisis stimulus campaign, sounded pretty calm about the nation\u2019s current economic situation.It remains a \u201creasonable expectation\u201d that the Fed will raise its benchmark interest rate twice this year, Mr. Dudley said.\u201cI think the general story of the economy over the last few years is very much intact,\u201d he said during the conversation at the New York Fed\u2019s ornate fortress in Lower Manhattan. \u201cI think we\u2019re still on track.\u201dThe Fed in recent months has faced some criticism that it moved prematurely by raising rates in December for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis. In the months after the move, both domestic and global growth weakened unexpectedly, and volatility increased across a wide range of financial markets.The Fed had held rates near zero to encourage borrowing and risk-taking, which stimulated economic growth. As it increases rates, those incentives are dwindling.In Mr. Dudley\u2019s view, the Fed is keeping its balance by moving slowly.He said he still expected roughly 2 percent growth over the next year. He described the global situation as \u201cdramatically better,\u201d and said financial conditions have eased \u201cconsiderably.\u201dEven government spending is rising modestly now.\u201cIf that\u2019s how the economy plays out, then I think we\u2019re going to see further moves by the Fed to gradually normalize interest rates,\u201d Mr. Dudley said, though he emphasized that the pace would be determined by actual economic data.Mr. Dudley, 63, may well be the nation\u2019s most powerful policy maker who was neither elected nor confirmed by Congress. The New York Fed, a quasi-public institution, watches Wall Street and carries out the Fed\u2019s monetary policies. Mr. Dudley, its president since 2009, serves as vice chairman of the Fed\u2019s policy-making committee and is the only regional reserve president with a permanent vote.\u201cI can\u2019t wipe out my employment history,\u201d Mr. Dudley said in the interview. \u201cI hope people judge me on my actions, and I hope my actions are very much consistent with the view that I care completely about Main Street, not about Wall Street.\u201dMr. Dudley said the rescue of large banks during the crisis was deeply unfair yet necessary, and he cautioned that any changes should be focused on improving the Fed\u2019s ability to achieve its goals, not on punishing it.\u201cIf you look at how the Fed has actually behaved over the last few years, I would not want to trade places with a lot of other countries around the world,\u201d he said.The Fed is insulated by design from political pressure so that it can do unpopular things that are in the nation\u2019s long-term economic interest. Congress curtailed the Fed\u2019s emergency lending powers in the aftermath of the crisis, and some members of both parties continue to push for even stronger restrictions.Mr. Dudley does not, however, see any crises looming in the near horizon. Low interest rates can encourage excessive speculation and economic distortions, as in the years before the financial crisis, but the Fed\u2019s stimulus campaign so far has produced only a modest recovery, and there remain few signs of overheating.\u201cI would say at this point I don\u2019t see a lot of things that disturb me,\u201d he said.Mr. Dudley said the risk of a recession seemed \u201cquite low.\u201d The Fed is unlikely to raise rates aggressively, so the only danger is an unexpected shock to the economy.He also offered an upbeat take on the Fed\u2019s ability to revive economic growth whenever the next downturn inevitably arrives. \u201cIn some ways, we have more ammunition than we had 10 years ago because we\u2019ve developed new tools that we actually know are effective,\u201d he said. He was referring to the measures the Fed employed in the aftermath of the financial crisis, like promising to keep rates low for an extended period, or buying large sums of Treasuries and mortgage bonds.One thing he\u2019s not really considering, though, is the idea of imposing negative interest rates, as Europe and Japan have done. \u201cThis is not something I\u2019m spending any time thinking about and it\u2019s not something I contemplate doing now or in the future,\u201d he said, although he added he was not ruling out anything.Mr. Dudley listed standard reasons for the continued sluggishness of domestic growth: Borrowers are reluctant to borrow and lenders are reluctant to lend; the population is aging; the global economy is weak.Mr. Dudley offered a more optimistic view. He said the trajectory of growth remained quite shallow, so small changes in the outlook could lead the Fed to delay rate increases for months at a time. That has created a communication challenge for the Fed, which is trying to set aside its post-crisis practice of predicting when it will raise rates and instead encouraging investors to focus on economic data.\u201cI think the only forward guidance we\u2019re giving right now is very, very soft,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the notion that we expect the rate path is likely to be quite gradual.\u201dBut all the arrows \u2014 growth, inflation, interest rates \u2014 are still pointing up.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Japan\u2019s Slow Economy, Rare Price Rise Prompts Surplus of Remorse", "Date": "2016-05-18", "News": "Supported byTOKYO \u2014 One of the most talked-about television commercials in Japan this year advertises an unusual product: contrition.The ad shows a group of workers and executives from an ice cream company lined up in neat rows in front of their suburban Tokyo factory. As gentle folk music plays, they bow in apology.The company\u2019s transgression? Adding 10 yen, or about 9 cents, to the price of Garigari-kun, a hugely popular soda-flavor ice cream bar. About 500 million of the bright blue snacks are consumed every year, mostly by children.Increasing prices are a big deal in Japan. The country\u2019s sluggish economy means that the cost of most things has not risen in 20 years, and almost any increase makes headlines.Consumer prices are a painful economic headache for Japan. The country\u2019s officials have been trying to break this stubborn pattern of deflation by pumping money into the economy and bolstering public spending. Japan\u2019s economy, which has been oscillating between growth and contraction for years, picked up speed in the first quarter, according to government data released on Wednesday.But the price increases that do go through \u2014 like the cost of the Garigari-kun ice cream bar rising to \u00a570, from \u00a560 \u2014 do not reflect a more vibrant economy or a stronger consumer. They usually mean a company is facing higher costs cutting into its profit. The deflationary trends are still firmly in place. And wages are under more pressure than prices, so buying power for most Japanese has declined compared with a generation ago.\u201cGarigari-kun is meant to be something kids can easily buy with their allowance,\u201d said Fumio Hagiwara, a marketing executive at Akagi Nyugyo, the maker of the ice cream bar. \u201cEven grown-ups have less pocket money these days.\u201dAkagi last increased prices a quarter of a century ago, and it debated the recent rise for seven or eight years, Mr. Hagiwara said. The rising cost of raw materials finally forced Akagi\u2019s hand, he said. Tighter logging restrictions in China, for instance, meant it had to use more expensive Russian lumber for ice cream sticks.In stronger economic circumstances, Akagi\u2019s price increase would not stand out. Companies in other places routinely pass on higher costs to consumers. But in Japan, businesses that face rising costs feel they have less ability to do so because wages are flat. Instead, they take a hit to their profits or cut back rather than alienate consumers.\u201cWe don\u2019t have any more income, but taxes are rising,\u201d said Kazuko Ida, 65, who lives in Tokyo. As a result, she said, she is especially reluctant to spend more. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing if luxury items are expensive, but if cheap things aren\u2019t cheap anymore, it\u2019s a real problem.\u201dBut the results officials have been seeking \u2014 robust increases in borrowing and spending, and a sustained rise in prices \u2014 have been elusive. The Consumer Price Index is back below zero, after an upswing during Mr. Abe\u2019s first two years in office. Wholesale prices tumbled 4.2 percent in April, their sharpest decline in more than six years.A recent rise in the value of the yen, after several years of weakness under Mr. Abe, has made beating deflation harder. A weak yen means costlier imports, which helps drive overall inflation. But now imports on the whole are getting cheaper again.The economic report on Wednesday showed that Japan\u2019s economy expanded 1.7 percent in annualized, price-adjusted terms in the quarter that ended in March. That was significantly faster than forecasts. Still, economists urged caution: Spending by households and businesses was down, and so were exports \u2014 all crucial pillars of growth.Rather than rely on those, the economy benefited from higher government spending and a decline in imports. The extra day in February because of the leap year also helped, specialists said.\u201cReasons for the upside surprise were not encouraging,\u201d said Masamichi Adachi, chief Japan economist at JPMorgan Chase. He said the economy was likely to remain stagnant.Since Mr. Abe\u2019s conservative coalition was elected in December 2012, the economy has expanded in eight quarters and shrunk in five. Newspaper opinion surveys suggest that about half of voters are dissatisfied with his economic program, known as Abenomics. A disorganized political opposition has offered little in the way of alternatives, but an election for the upper house of Parliament in July is adding to pressure to turn things around.In the ice cream business, Mr. Hagiwara said Akagi had calculated that Garigari-kun\u2019s sales volume would drop by 7 percent as a result of raising prices. The sales hit, the company believed, would be more than counterbalanced by the higher price.But it appears that for his company, at least, an apology is an effective way to deal with the pain. Mr. Hagiwara said sales jumped by about 10 percent in the first month or so after the price increase in March, though they have since begun to fall back.\u201cWe figure it will take another year before we know how consumers really take to it,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s in a lush, secluded area, said Jennifer Cabot, one of the owners, whose primary home is on the island of Nantucket in Massachusetts.A winding road leads to the property, which sits on two and a third acres. The 3,700-square-foot house, built in 2010, is made up of three pavilions that are connected by open-air walkways.An antique mahogany door gives way to the central pavilion, which has the living room, dining room and kitchen. The d\u00e9cor of the living room includes surfboards affixed to the walls, Indonesian-style daybeds and African textiles. The kitchen has a 48-inch Viking range and double oven. The wall closest to the ocean is made of multiple bifold glass doors that lead to a terrace. \u201cAs soon as you walk in the front door, it\u2019s just ocean everywhere. You almost feel like you\u2019re on the bow of a big boat,\u201d Ms. Cabot said.To the left of the central pavilion as you face the ocean, a raised outdoor walkway leads to the master bedroom pavilion, which has an oceanfront terrace and an en-suite bath with two showers. One, combined with the bathtub, is inside, and the other is outdoors. To the right of the central pavilion, a walkway leads to the third pavilion, with two bedrooms, each having a terrace and an en-suite bath. The house is being sold furnished.Walls, floors and the kitchen counters of the house are made of concrete; the palm roof has weatherproofing beneath the leaves. For electricity, the property relies on solar power and a backup generator.The property has a swimming pool and a rocky area of the shoreline, reached by stairs, where swimming is sometimes possible, Ms. Cabot said, adding that the water there is often rough. There is also a detached garage. The current staff of six includes a cook and two security guards, their salaries paid by rental income from the house, Ms. Cabot said.MARKET OVERVIEWThe Dominican Republic\u2019s real estate market has not yet fully recovered from the 2008 global financial crisis, agents said. But Cesar Herrera Guti\u00e9rrez, the president and chief executive of Provaltur International, the exclusive affiliate for Christie\u2019s International Real Estate in the Dominican Republic, which has this listing, said prices for top luxury homes are stable, and in some cases have begun to rise. He defined these homes as being in the top 1 percent of their local markets and typically having an asking price of at least $5 million.\u201cThe bottom has been hit and now, up it goes,\u201d Mr. Herrera Guti\u00e9rrez said of the market for those most exclusive properties. For properties priced between about $1 million and $5 million, it\u2019s a buyer\u2019s market, with stable prices that are often negotiable, he said.Mr. Herrera Guti\u00e9rrez said that the prices per square foot of luxury homes in the Dominican Republic are among the lowest in the Caribbean. Supply is ample, he added.The Dominican Republic is a second-home market for North Americans, so its performance is tied to the United States and Canadian economies, said Sandy Parekh, an owner of Re/Max Coral Bay Realty. The volume of luxury transactions has picked up by about 10 percent in the last year, but it is \u201ccertainly nowhere near 2008.\u201d That trend also holds true for the general market, he said.Luxury home buyers want properties in gated beachfront developments and with amenities like security, restaurants and utilities included in a membership fee. Agents said Punta Cana, Casa de Campo, Cap Cana and Sosua are desirable.The lower end of the luxury market begins at around $100 per square foot and reaches around $420 per square foot for a prime oceanfront home, Mr. Parekh said. The highest-priced home he knows of is listed at $25 million, but typically listings do not top $5 million in the north and $9 million in the south, Mr. Parekh added.WHO BUYS IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLICMr. Parekh said most of his clients come from North America, because they are familiar with the Re/Max brand. There has been a slight drop in the number of Canadian buyers recently, and an increase in the number of United States expatriates moving from the Bahamas, Turks and Caicos, and Bermuda, which have a higher cost of living, he said.Mr. Parekh said that, as a rough estimate, 30 to 50 percent of homeowners in luxury developments are Dominican. Foreigners are split evenly between buying for retirement and for vacation, he added.Mr. Herrera Guti\u00e9rrez said that in the last six to eight months he has seen rising interest from Europeans. He has been working recently with prospective buyers from Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain and Italy, he said.BUYING BASICSHome sales in the Dominican Republic are handled by a lawyer, who customarily charges 1 percent of the purchase price, said Alfredo Guzm\u00e1n-Salad\u00edn, a partner with Guzm\u00e1n Ariza, a law firm with offices throughout the country. Each party hires its own lawyer. Services of a notary, for authenticating signatures before the title transfer, are usually included in the attorney fee, he said. (A new law mandates progressive notary fees, but its application is being disputed in court, he added.)Aside from those fees, the buyer also pays a title transfer tax, which is 3 percent of the property\u2019s government-appraised value.The Dominican Republic does not have a stamp duty, unlike many other Caribbean countries. The seller pays the real estate agent\u2019s commission.Mr. Guzm\u00e1n-Salad\u00edn urges buyers to ensure their lawyer performs due diligence. This includes, in particular, checking that the property\u2019s title is clean, meaning that there are no title liens, mortgages or third party rights, and that it is definite, meaning that its boundaries have been accurately surveyed. He also recommends checking for tax liens.Parties can choose their preferred currency. Transactions for high-end properties, whether buyers are local or foreign, are typically done in United States dollars, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n-Salad\u00edn said.WEBSITESLANGUAGE AND CURRENCYSpanish: Dominican peso ($1 = 46 pesos)TAXES AND FEESProperty taxes on this house are $1,500 per year, Ms. Cabot said.CONTACTAdvertisement"}

Tolchin, a political scientist who explored the workings of political patronage, women in politics and, most presciently, the electoral power of voter anger in several popular books, most of them written with her husband, Martin Tolchin, died on Wednesday at her home in Washington. She was 75.The cause was ovarian cancer, her husband said.Ms. Tolchin hit on the subject of patronage when Mr. Tolchin, then a reporter in the metropolitan news department of The New York Times, wrote a series of articles on the topic that several publishers urged him to turn into a book. Daunted, he turned to his wife for help.\u201cThe political-science literature had an enormous hole on the subject,\u201d she told The Washingtonian in 2011. \u201cIt\u2019s such a critical part of the political process \u2014 it was wonderful virgin territory.\u201dIn lively fashion, the book surveyed the history and examined the mechanisms of a system the authors described as \u201cone of the occupational hazards of democracy.\u201d They traced its influence, for good and ill, in city halls, statehouses, courthouses and, onward and upward, Congress and the White House.The picture it painted was often bleak, presenting government at all levels as \u201cone vast honey pot with thousands of ants lined up around the rim to get at the sweetener inside,\u201d according to a review in The Times.It was a rich subject to which the authors returned in \u201cPinstripe Patronage: Political Favoritism From the Clubhouse to the White House \u2026 and Beyond,\u201d published in 2011. Patronage is \u201cthe major reason people go into politics,\u201d Ms. Tolchin told The Washingtonian. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty radical thing to say, but people aren\u2019t going to get into it unless there\u2019s something in it. You can use it for good and for bad.\u201dSusan Jane Goldsmith was born in Manhattan on Jan. 14, 1941. Her father, Jacob, was a lawyer, and her mother, the former Dorothy Markowitz, taught fourth grade in the city\u2019s public schools.She grew up in Hollis Hills, Queens, and, after graduating from Jamaica High School, earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in political science from Bryn Mawr College in 1961. She went on to receive a master\u2019s degree from the University of Chicago in 1962 and, in 1968, a doctorate from New York University, where she wrote her dissertation on the politics of New York City police policy.She joined the political science department at Mount Vernon College in Washington in 1975 and in 1978 began teaching public administration at George Washington University in Fairfax, Va. She taught at the School of Public Policy at George Mason University, also in Fairfax, from 1998 until her retirement in 2007.In addition to her husband, a former congressional correspondent for The Times and the founding editor of The Hill, a newspaper covering Congress, she is survived by a daughter, Karen Tolchin, and a grandson.With her husband, she wrote several books that rang alarm bells about dangers facing the United States: \u201cDismantling America: The Rush to Deregulate\u201d (1983), \u201cBuying Into America: How Foreign Money Is Changing the Face of Our Nation\u201d (1988) and \u201cSelling Our Security: The Erosion of America\u2019s Assets\u201d (1992).As a subject, the dark arts of political patronage proved to be an inexhaustible resource. She tapped into an equally persistent theme in a book she wrote without her husband, \u201cThe Angry American: How Voter Rage Is Changing the Nation\u201d (1996).In that book, she identified deep-seated voter anger, fueled by an uncertain economy, cultural divisions and disenchantment with government, as a potent force that politicians needed to understand and harness. \u201cPeople hate government,\u201d she wrote, \u201cbecause they expect more than government can possibly deliver, particularly in this era of budget constraints.\u201dIn a sense, the book offered a preview of the current political climate. \u201cRemember Peter Finch flinging open the window in the movie \u2018Network\u2019 and screaming, \u2018I\u2019m mad as hell, and I\u2019m not going to take it anymore!\u2019\u201d she wrote in her introduction. \u201cThe question of the decade is, What happens now that the window has been opened?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "King Felipe of Spain Dissolves Parliament, Clearing Way for New Elections", "Date": "2016-05-03", "News": "Supported byThe repeat election is now scheduled for June 26, but opinion polls suggest that the outcome of a new vote could look much like the first, which split ballots among four main parties, with no single one close to a majority.Turnout, however, could fall amid growing frustration about the intense but fruitless party squabbling.Whatever the outcome in late June, Patxi L\u00f3pez, the Socialist president of the lower house of Parliament, called on Tuesday for an electoral overhaul to tighten future deadlines for forming a government and to ensure that Spain does not spend so much time again in political limbo. He also urged party leaders to draw lessons now from their failure to break the deadlock since December.\u201cWe haven\u2019t managed to fulfill the citizens\u2019 mandate,\u201d Mr. L\u00f3pez told a news conference after meeting the king on Tuesday morning. \u201cI hope that these four months have served to understand a few things.\u201dThe repeat of elections was virtually guaranteed a week ago, when Felipe\u2019s final round of consultations with party leaders ended in failure.Since then, the party leaders have instead opened a new round of mutual recriminations over who should be held responsible for leaving Spain without an elected government at a time of economic, social and political challenges.On Tuesday, the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, also warned Spain about its budget deficit and soaring debt, as well as unemployment, even as the country\u2019s economy continues to recover at about twice the growth rate of most other European nations.Without additional budgetary tightening, Spain will most likely fail to meet its European obligation to lower its deficit below 3 percent of gross domestic product until 2018, according to the European Commission\u2019s latest forecast.The financial crisis exposed growing economic imbalances in Spain and also brought to the surface several corruption scandals involving kickbacks, mostly from the construction industry, paid to politicians from established parties during a property boom, which collapsed in 2008.Such scandals helped two emerging parties challenge the traditional two-party system and alternation of power between the conservative Popular Party of Mariano Rajoy, the caretaker prime minister, and the main opposition Socialist party.But after the Dec. 20 elections, the two newcomers \u2014 the center-right Ciudadanos and the far-left Podemos \u2014 also ended up in an acrimonious standoff that played a significant part in the overall deadlock that stalled forming a coalition government.The latest polls indicate that the Popular Party will once more win the most votes in June, but not enough to regain the parliamentary majority that it had until December\u2019s elections.Even though Mr. Rajoy\u2019s party recently got entangled in more corruption scandals, particularly in the eastern region of Valencia, it could benefit from a low turnout, as the conservative electorate is seen as a more disciplined force when it comes to voting.In fact, after turning down the king\u2019s offer to try to form a coalition government in January, Mr. Rajoy has largely stayed on the sidelines of the negotiations \u2014 as well as the debating in Parliament. He and his ministers have refused to appear before lawmakers, while openly questioning the legitimacy of an assembly that did not elect the government and was in any case likely to be short-lived.Since the elections, Spain\u2019s main party leaders have not only failed to form a coalition government but have also struggled to maintain their party stewardship.In fact, \u201call the main parties except Ciudadanos face internal divisions that they will try to contain ahead of the vote,\u201d Antonio Barroso, a Spanish political analyst at Teneo Intelligence in London, said in a recent analysis.The turmoil in Spain comes as politicians in the northeastern region of Catalonia are forging ahead with plans to secede from the rest of the country.The Spanish vote could also be affected by Britain\u2019s referendum on whether to leave the European Union, scheduled for June 23, just three days before Spain\u2019s new election, according to Antonio Rold\u00e1n, a lawmaker from Ciudadanos.Should British voters decide to leave the European Union, the shock waves would be felt across the 28-nation bloc, but perhaps particularly in countries like Spain that already face fiscal challenges and that were on the front line of the euro debt crisis, he said.If Britain exits the bloc, \u201cthe countries on the periphery will look particularly vulnerable, and Spain will stand out as the only country without a government as well as a large deficit hole,\u201d Mr. Rold\u00e1n said. \u201cThis will be a very fragile situation.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe to Remove 500-Euro Bill, the \u2018Bin Laden\u2019 Bank Note Criminals Love", "Date": "2016-05-04", "News": "Supported byFRANKFURT \u2014 A suitcase stuffed full of cash may soon be worth a lot less.When it comes to moving money nefariously, the \u20ac500 note has been especially handy.It is a large denomination in a widely circulated and easily convertible currency. In the United States, the largest denomination is $100, after the Federal Reserve discontinued the $500, $1,000, $5,000 and $10,000 bills in 1969. Switzerland has a 1,000-franc note, worth about $1,050, but its supply is limited.After the European Central Bank phases out the \u20ac500 note by the end of 2018, the next highest denomination will be \u20ac200. That same $1 million would weigh roughly two and half times as much.And using $100 bills is just downright bulky. That would clock in at roughly 22 pounds and require an entire briefcase to carry.Getting rid of the \u20ac500 bill \u201cwill make life harder for criminals, raising their costs and increasing their detection risks,\u201d Peter Sands, the lead author of the Harvard study and a former chief executive of the British bank Standard Chartered, wrote in an emailon Wednesday.There are still many ways to hide illegal transactions, like using offshore banks and shell companies. Digital currencies like Bitcoin also allow financial transactions outside the purview of central banks and regulators.But Robert Palmer, an expert on money laundering at Global Witness, an advocacy group, said cash remained an important element in the criminal economy.\u201cThere is a range of ways that people launder money,\u201d Mr. Palmer said by telephone from London. \u201cSome are new and innovative, and some are old fashioned. Hard cash is still a common way of moving dirty money.\u201dThe decision Wednesday to phase out the notes by the European Central Bank\u2019s Governing Council does not immediately remove from circulation the roughly \u20ac300 billion worth of the purple \u20ac500 notes, which depict an unidentified modern building on one side and a bridge on the other.The decision simply means that, beginning at the end of 2018, central banks in the 19 countries of the eurozone will no longer replace \u20ac500 bills that are returned for sorting or other reasons.The European Central Bank said it would not take the more radical step of declaring that \u20ac500 bills are no longer legal tender. Such a move would have meant the notes could no longer be legally used for transactions. People with \u20ac500 notes would have had to bring them back to a central bank to be exchanged for smaller denominations.Mr. Sands said the central bank could take steps to discourage use of the notes still in circulation, for example, by requiring banks to ask questions when customers present \u20ac500 bills for deposit.To critics, the steps taken on Wednesday were seen as an infringement on personal freedoms, as they make it harder for people to opt out of the traditional financial system.One leading German economist also accused the European Central Bank of ulterior motives. With fewer large bills, it will be easier for the central bank to push interest rates to new lows, said Clemens Fuest, president of the Ifo economic research institute in Munich, which has been critical of the central bank\u2019s cheap money policies.That is because for almost two years the European Central Bank has been charging lenders a so-called negative interest rate to keep money in its virtual vaults, which are considered the ultimate safe haven. The policy is intended to push down market interest rates and force banks to lend money rather than hoard it. Currently the central bank deposit rate is minus 0.4 percent.In theory, banks can avoid this de facto rent on their deposits by holding cash in their own vaults. But in practice it is expensive to store large amounts of bills safely \u2014 and it would become even more so if the denominations were smaller.With fewer \u20ac500 notes available, the banks might be even more likely to do what the European Central Bank wants them to do, which is lend money rather than sitting on it. \u201cIt would be significantly more expensive for banks and savings banks to store lots of smaller bank notes, \u201d Mr. Fuest said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Economic Promises a President Trump Could (and Couldn\u2019t) Keep", "Date": "2016-05-21", "News": "Supported byIn the hills and hollows of Mingo County, W.Va., where unemployment is nearly triple the national average, it\u2019s coal. On the southwest side of Chicago, where the landscape couldn\u2019t be more different but the economic fears are much the same, it\u2019s Oreo cookies. Elsewhere, it is cars, computers and air-conditioners.And whether it is through rolling back regulations, imposing tariffs or making some none-too-discreet phone calls from the Oval Office to the C-suites, Donald J. Trump has vowed to bring back the vanishing jobs of miners, bakers and assembly-line workers, beginning on Day 1 of his administration.\u201cIt\u2019s going to happen fast,\u201d Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, recently told a cheering crowd in Charleston, W.Va. \u201cThis is so easy.\u201dIf only that were true.For all of the appeal his message might have for residents there (Mr. Trump captured almost 90 percent of the vote in Mingo County), much of what he is promising to do \u2014 on his own, and through congressional legislation \u2014 couldn\u2019t be accomplished in the first 1,000 days of a Trump administration, much less the first 100.For example, Mr. Trump has suggested easing clean-air regulations enacted by Democrats and Republicans alike that have hurt the coal industry. But King Coal is unlikely to ever recapture market share lost in recent years to natural gas made cheap by the fracking boom, not to mention fast-growing alternative energy sources like wind and solar.Nor could Mr. Trump, a billionaire businessman, force steel makers to buy coal from Appalachia to heat furnaces in Asia, Europe and North America that have been idled by weak demand.\u201cI will not say he can\u2019t do anything, but it\u2019s very unlikely he\u2019ll be able to restore coal to where it was,\u201d said John Deskins, director of the West Virginia University Bureau of Business and Economic Research. With production and employment in the mines down by about a third since 2008, Mr. Deskins said, \u201ceven in our most optimistic scenario, we don\u2019t expect a big bounce back.\u201dOf course, a Trump presidency is far from certain. And any president\u2019s sway over the national economy is debatable.But a big part of what has gotten Mr. Trump this far are his outsize promises. And while the case of coal and clean air illustrates the limits of a president\u2019s power in the economic arena, there are other places where Mr. Trump would have considerably more room to maneuver.Like much of his speechifying, Mr. Trump\u2019s economic and business agenda is a mixture of opening bids and dog-whistle messages as well as some nuts-and-bolts proposals he might be able to put in effect as president, even without congressional approval. Sorting out what\u2019s what, though, isn\u2019t simple or safe. Just ask the pundits who wrote off Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy as a sideshow even as he won one primary after another.For his part, Mr. Trump warns it would be a mistake to underestimate his ability to change the rules of the game.\u201cIn my whole life, I\u2019ve gotten things done,\u201d he said in an interview on Saturday. \u201cWhether it\u2019s getting a city built on the West Side of Manhattan or getting zoning board approvals, my whole life has been finding a consensus.\u201dBut when it comes to companies moving jobs out of the United States, he said a tougher tone was in order.\u201cI\u2019m not Obama, and there are stupid people in our government,\u201d he said. \u201cWith me, there will be consequences if you move, and the consequences will be severe.\u201dIn terms of coal and recovering all of those vanished jobs in West Virginia, Mr. Trump acknowledged that price competition from cheaper natural gas was fierce.\u201cBut coal is still less expensive, and it has a major place in terms of energy,\u201d he said. And regulatory relief \u2014 whether in terms of environmental rules or workplace safety \u2014 would benefit the industry, he said.\u201cI have become very well versed on coal,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThe regulations are brutal, and they are sending inspectors into the mines two and three times a day. Even the miners say it\u2019s out of control.\u201dIn law firms, corporate boardrooms, lobbyist watering holes and think tanks in Washington and beyond, experts are quietly assessing what a Trump presidency might actually look like in practice. Or to put it more bluntly, business is business. So whether they find Mr. Trump politically abhorrent or a welcome antidote to the status quo, these insiders also want to know what he might mean for their bottom line.National debate: \u201cTrump would put the bully in bully pulpit.\u201dPerhaps the greatest opportunity for Mr. Trump lies in the extraordinary ability of any president to direct the tone and contours of the national debate, especially on issues he has highlighted, like how American companies should treat their American workers. And unlike most past Republican candidates, Mr. Trump has not been reluctant to criticize big business on that topic.\u201cDonald Trump would put the bully in bully pulpit,\u201d said Seth Harris, who served as a top official in the Labor Department under Democratic presidents.Immigration: \u201cWhere the president\u2019s power is least restricted.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a reason why so many of Trump\u2019s proposals revolve around the idea of denying visas to people,\u201d said William A. Stock, a lawyer in Philadelphia who is the president-elect of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. \u201cThat\u2019s where the president\u2019s power is least restricted, if he asserts it.\u201dThe Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, Mr. Stock said, gives the president \u201cthe ability to suspend the entry of foreign nationals whose entry is deemed to be detrimental to the interests of the U.S.\u201dNoting that recent administrations have invoked the law to forbid entry to individuals from the former Yugoslavia accused of human rights violations, as well as to Cuban and Iranian government officials, Mr. Stock said, \u201cThis is a tool that is pretty powerful, but it\u2019s usually been used in more limited instances.\u201dFinancial reform: \u201cWhen it comes to regulation, people are policy.\u201dRepealing the law might be difficult, but experts who helped draft the regulations agreed that Mr. Trump could defang them through selective enforcement \u2014 appointing different officials to the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission \u2014 and by issuing new executive orders.A President Trump would have wide latitude to name his own people to oversee less conspicuous but powerful agencies like the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and to seed Treasury and other government departments with like-minded officials.\u201cWhen it comes to regulation, people are policy,\u201d said Aaron Klein, a top official at the Treasury Department from 2009 to 2012 and helped draft the Dodd-Frank bill. \u201cRegulators who don\u2019t want to regulate can thwart the will of Congress.\u201dBut the president\u2019s reach isn\u2019t unlimited. Nor is it speedy. And however stupendous Mr. Trump\u2019s deal-making skills may be, the forces of gridlock in the nation\u2019s capital are no less awesome.\u201cThe system doesn\u2019t change,\u201d said Tom Korologos, a longtime Republican strategist and an adviser at the law firm DLA Piper in Washington. \u201cTrump can say, \u2018I\u2019m going to repeal this or I\u2019m going to repeal that,\u2019 but it\u2019s going to take longer than 100 days.\u201dMr. Korologos, who served on the transition teams of President Ronald Reagan and President George W. Bush, isn\u2019t supporting Mr. Trump this year. He added that while the presumptive Republican nominee\u2019s promises might make \u201cfor nice talking points, it will be harder than he thinks.\u201dTax cuts: A Republican Congress is unlikely to accept a $10 trillion deficit over 10 years.That\u2019s especially true when it comes to the macroeconomic picture. Mr. Trump claims his proposal for sweeping tax cuts for individuals and businesses wouldn\u2019t bust the budget and could lift the economy\u2019s annual growth rate to 6 percent.More sober-minded experts say that\u2019s magical thinking, a 2016 version of \u201cvoodoo economics,\u201d as President George H. W. Bush famously described what came to be known as Reaganomics in the 1980s. They estimate Mr. Trump\u2019s tax plan could create a $10 trillion shortfall at the Treasury over the next decade, and note that annual economic growth has topped 5 percent only once in the last 35 years.\u201cI have a hard time believing that even a Republican Congress would enact his tax plan, because it would create enormous deficits,\u201d said William G. Gale, an economist under the first President Bush who is now co-director of the Tax Policy Center in Washington.Mr. Trump responded that \u201cthose tax cuts go hand in hand with many other things.\u201dAs a result of getting tough on trade policy and what he considers currency manipulation by China, Mr. Trump argues that more jobs would return to the United States, which in turn would spur economic growth and therefore tax revenues.Whether or not that\u2019s realistic, any significant alteration in trade or tax policy means winning over the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee, both of which zealously guard their turf. \u201cThis is what makes them tick,\u201d Mr. Korologos said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take more than just a bunch of rhetoric to change things.\u201dLabor: An ebb and flow when administrations change hands in Washington.Like Mr. Korologos, Mr. Harris, the former Labor Department official, has seen the ebb and flow when administrations change hands in Washington. Except he was on the opposite side of the aisle, having served on the Democratic transition teams after President Bill Clinton was elected in 1992 and after President Obama\u2019s victory in 2008.At Labor, where he was a top adviser under Mr. Clinton, and then as deputy secretary in the Obama administration, Mr. Harris saw firsthand just how much influence the president could have.Tasked with enforcing regulations on whether companies are abiding by minimum wage requirements, child labor restrictions, affirmative action guidelines, workplace safety rules and a web of other laws, Mr. Harris said, the Labor Department has never been very popular with big business or the Republican candidates it supports.And when George W. Bush succeeded Bill Clinton, the change was swift, Mr. Harris said. Budgets were cut, and travel to inspect factories and mines decreased. There was less emphasis on enforcement, going into workplaces and punishing violations, he said, and more on educating employers about potential infractions.After Mr. Harris returned to the Labor Department in 2009, budgets were increased, and surprise workplace inspections were resumed.\u201cWe investigated more deeply, enforced procedures, and were more likely to find violations,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was no executive order or action by Congress or the White House. We just did it. The laws existed \u2014 it was a matter of whether you were going to solve the problem aggressively or be more passive.\u201dRepublicans, including Mr. Trump, have long argued that regulatory zeal kills jobs and undermines economic growth. Democrats maintain it is necessary to protect employees from abuses and risks, while imposing checks on the power of big companies.Both arguments contain elements of truth. But Mr. Harris said that what was critical was that rank-and-file civil servants quickly adapted to the message coming down from the Oval Office.\u201cThe president sets the tone for how our government is going to relate to our country,\u201d said Mr. Harris, who is now a lawyer in private practice in Washington. \u201cHow the laws are implemented and enforced, how the money is spent and how motivated people are to do their job.\u201dHealth care: \u201cSelling insurance isn\u2019t like selling credit cards.\u201dDodd-Frank isn\u2019t the only big Obama-era law Mr. Trump has talked about repealing. The other prominent target of Mr. Trump\u2019s ire \u2014 the Affordable Care Act \u2014 would be trickier to dispose of.The problem, said Nicholas Bagley, a professor of law at the University of Michigan, is that insurers don\u2019t want to do it because it\u2019s not practical. \u201cSelling insurance isn\u2019t like selling credit cards,\u201d Mr. Bagley said. \u201cOut-of-state health insurers don\u2019t have networks of doctors and hospitals in place. The problem isn\u2019t legal restraints, and it\u2019s not a solution to what ails the health care economy.\u201dMr. Trump responded that deregulation is still the answer, despite the skepticism of experts like Mr. Bagley.\u201cThe problem is rules, regulations and restrictions,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have rate increases that are catastrophic, and the deductibles are so high people can\u2019t even use the health care. If it was really open and you got competition going, amazing things will happen.\u201dEnvironment: Sending \u201ca chill down the spine\u201d of people who enforce the laws.Environmental regulation offers a more promising target for Mr. Trump, who has called the Environmental Protection Agency a laughingstock and a disgrace, and has promised to cut its budget.In fact, in the absence of congressional action, the Trump administration could target many other environmental regulations by simply going after the people who enforce them, said Don Barry, who spent two decades at the Interior Department and directed the United States Fish and Wildlife Service under President Clinton.Decades later, Mr. Barry still recalls how a round of firings in the Interior Department at the dawn of the Reagan administration signaled a turnabout in policy. \u201cThe single biggest thing they can do is send a chill down the spine of career survivors in the bureaucracy and bring things to a halt,\u201d he said.Similarly, a Trump administration might be willing to approve state environmental plans that are more friendly to fossil fuels, said Kevin Book, head of research at ClearView Energy Partners. Proposed, but not completed, clean-water regulations aimed at restricting mountaintop-removal mining for coal in West Virginia could be eased, he said.Trade: Trump can punish countries, but jobs are unlikely to return.Still, even if Mr. Trump were to win in November and roll back some environmental regulations, it wouldn\u2019t significantly alter the fate of Mingo County and much of the nation\u2019s depressed coal industry.\u201cTaking a more lenient stance on clean-air or clean-water rules would do nothing to help coal demand,\u201d Mr. Book said. \u201cCoal-fired power plants have been mothballed and are being disassembled, and that capacity is gone. It\u2019s not even close to something you could reverse by administrative fiat.\u201dIf Washington\u2019s ability to gridlock even the most ambitious of presidential agendas were to block Mr. Trump\u2019s White House plans, he would still have the bully pulpit, of course. And unlike Theodore Roosevelt, who coined that term, Mr. Trump probably wouldn\u2019t speak softly.Announced in July 2015, the Nabisco layoffs in Chicago continued during the Illinois primary in March, despite jabs from Mr. Trump and both Democratic presidential contenders, Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders.United Technologies is similarly unlikely to rethink Carrier\u2019s move out of Indianapolis. And in an era when Apple is willing to fight the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to unlock an iPhone on national security grounds, more corporate defiance may become the norm.Blanketing countries from China to Mexico with import duties would be a tall order without congressional approval. The White House, though, does retain plenty of leeway to punish countries it thinks are engaged in currency manipulation, dumping of products below the cost of production and other free-trade abuses.The problem for Mr. Trump \u2014 or any president who wants to get tough on trade violators \u2014 is that, in the global economy, imposing tariffs on competitors abroad could have serious economic consequences at home by sharply raising prices on imported goods.Cheaper flat-screen televisions, computers, clothes, furniture and other products from Walmart, Amazon and elsewhere have been a rare bright spot for struggling working- and middle-class Americans. And trade wars cut both ways: Retaliatory tariffs on American-made products from countries like China would prompt howls of pain at still strong domestic manufacturers like Caterpillar and Boeing.But for all the uncertainty around what might happen after Jan. 20, 2017, the lawyers and lobbyists who are now trying to gauge a Trump presidency are already emerging as winners. Mr. Trump\u2019s much-talked-about unpredictability, Mr. Korologos said, is proving to be a boon for Washington\u2019s legions of lobbyists.\u201cCorporate America hates the unknown,\u201d he said. \u201cGod only knows what the hell Trump is for. And corporate America is going to want someone to save them.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Companies invest billions of dollars improving IT systems and reworking business processes to gain crucial seconds and remove other barriers that impede a deal\u2019s closing. Yet many overlook a major source of efficiency-sapping friction: paper documents.In today\u2019s digital economy, seconds can mean the difference between a happy customer and a lost sale. Companies invest billions of dollars improving IT systems and reworking business processes to gain crucial seconds and remove other barriers that impede a deal\u2019s closing. Yet many overlook a major source of efficiency-sapping friction: paper documents.Paper-based transactions, such as contracts and mortgages, that require signatures and multiple approvals are handed, faxed or overnighted from company to customer and back again, where they are routed through multiple departments.Digital transaction management systems guide customers and companies through automated, pre-defined processes, where signatures and approvals are captured securely and electronically, saving time and money while delighting customers in the process.Quite simply, paper is no longer the way to do business when every second counts.Speed is a major benefit of moving from paper-based to digital transactions. Paper documents requiring ink signatures must be mailed back and forth \u2014 taking days, weeks or even months longer to complete than digital processes accomplishing the same task in seconds.The Nevada Department of Transportation (NDOT) has gone digital for the execution of contracts related to road construction and repair projects. Teresa Schlaffer, a business process analyst at NDOT, says that contracts executed digitally get completed weeks faster than those approved using paper. After conducting a pilot in which NDOT tested five digital contracting processes, the organization is now moving documents through 200+ digital processes \u2014 each of which may require up to 60 different approvals and digital signatures. As a result, the department has reduced the number of days required to execute a road-repair contract from 28 to just four.In September 2014, a flash flood washed out almost 50 miles of Interstate 15, a major artery linking Nevada with Utah. The road had to be reconstructed as quickly as possible to get cars and trucks through. Fortunately, NDOT had already begun using paperless transactions for road repair contracts. Even in an emergency, a surety bond must be issued and the offices of the attorney general and the governor must sign off on Nevada road repair contracts. Using paper, the process can take weeks. Using digital processes, NDOT executed the I-15 repair contract in just 45 minutes. A contractor completed enough of the work to get a lane open in each direction between Nevada and Utah in only five days \u2014 much less time than it would have taken just to get the work approved, when using paper documents. Digital transactions are not only more efficient than paper transactions, but they are also more secure. Digital signatures can be verified by multiple factors such as email, SMS and phone call confirmation, and are protected by bank-grade encryption.The New York Stock Exchange is the world\u2019s largest stock exchange, as measured by market capitalization of its listed issues. As a cornerstone of the world economy, speed and security matter both when executing trades and communicating that information to the world. The NYSE licenses data to 900 market data vendors and 270,000 professional subscribers. The licenses, which previously took up to a week to process using paper documents, are now granted in less than 24 hours using DocuSign. The digital process, which has built in bank-grade encryption and multi-factor authentication for digital signatures, passed stringent requirements for security and enforceability at the NYSE. \"The feedback,\" says Peggy Sullivan, director for market data administration at NYSE, \"has been outstanding.\"Paper documents are routinely lost in transition as they are moved from place to place and person to person, and sometimes never reach their intended destinations. In contrast, digital documents can be accessed anytime, anywhere, by any authorized individual.Dr. BJ Rimel, a gynecologic oncologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, had a problem. She and her colleagues couldn\u2019t find enough participants for cancer research studies. That changed in 2013, when they did away with paper consent forms. Instead of having to fill out paperwork in the doctor\u2019s office, interested participants could sign up online to be contacted about research opportunities. The result, says Rimel, is more applications and much greater participation in research that can save lives. \u201cWe were able to close some studies that had been open for years without being able to find the right people,\u201d she says. \u201cWe were able to find participants very quickly online to complete our research faster and accelerate new treatments.\u201dPeople enrolled per month in Dr. Rimel\u2019s cancer research registry at Cedars-Sinai through paper forms.Minutes needed to process paper applications for cancer research studies at Cedars-Sinai.Increase in monthly cancer research registry enrollments after moving to online applications.Gain in efficiency after switching to online cancer research applications at Cedars-Sinai; processing takes just 10 minutes.Because of the way DocuSign works, there\u2019s an audit trail for every document that\u2019s sent and that\u2019s really helped strengthen our compliance.With paper, it\u2019s not always clear what needs to be signed where, and by whom. With digital processes, users are guided where to initial and sign without missing a field. Documents are then automatically routed to the right people.Fox & Roach Realtors, an affiliate of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices, is transforming its business \u2014 from agents toting stacks of file folders around from customer to customer, to using digital signature software and virtual transaction rooms. These days, agents and all other parties to a real estate transaction \u2014 including the clients \u2014 can access a secure online portal to review, sign and send documents related to individual home purchases without having to handle paperwork. \"This provides a truly ubiquitous solution for everyone involved,\" says BHHS Fox & Roach CIO Scott Crowley. As a result, DocuSign is providing a better overall customer experience throughout the home buying process.The efficiency adds up: Fannie Mae estimated that an electronic mortgage process could shorten the time it takes to close by 30 days and save about $1,100 per mortgage, or about $1 billion per year.Once you go through one signing experience, the buy-in is pretty much immediate. Everyone sees that it\u2019s going to make their lives so much easier.In an age when speed of access, service and execution make all the difference between success and failure for organizations of every size and stripe, and efficiency is being pursued at every level, digital transactions are emerging as the new standard for creating a truly frictionless economy. Transactions that require paper documents and ink signatures to be mailed back and forth, scanned or faxed simply can\u2019t compete with more efficient and secure digital transactions.Illustrations by Ryan ToddThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
{"Headline": "How Many People Support Trump but Don\u2019t Want to Admit It?", "Date": "2016-05-11", "News": "Supported byDoes he share our values and our principles on limited government, the proper role of the executive, adherence to the Constitution?As the speaker of the Republican-dominated House, Ryan could have posed a harder question: Do Republican voters \u201cshare our values and our principles\u201d?The answer to this question, based at least on the 10.7 million votes cast for Trump in Republican primaries and caucuses so far, is \u201cno.\u201dBut that\u2019s not all. There is also strong evidence that most traditional public opinion surveys inadvertently hide a segment of Trump\u2019s supporters. Many voters are reluctant to admit to a live interviewer that they back a candidate who has adopted such divisive positions.Why is this important? Because an online survey, whatever other flaws it might have, resembles an anonymous voting booth far more than what you tell a pollster does.Trump\u2019s advantage in online polls compared with live telephone polling is eight or nine percentage points among likely voters.This difference, Dropp notes, is driven largely by more educated voters \u2014 those who would be most concerned with \u201csocial desirability.\u201dThese findings suggest that Trump will head into the general election with support from voters who are reluctant to admit their preferences to a live person in a phone survey, but who may well be inclined to cast a ballot for Trump on Election Day.I asked a number of experts about the disparity between online and phone polls. All of them \u2014 Alan Abramowitz, John Sides, Michael Tesler and Lynn Vavreck, political scientists who specialize in the analysis of poll data \u2014 agreed that in the case of highly contentious issues, respondents can be more willing to express their real views anonymously, to a computer rather than to a human.may be due to social desirability bias \u2014 people are more willing to express support for this privately than when asked by someone else.The accompanying chart, which uses data provided to The Times by Marc Hetherington and Drew Engelhardt, political scientists at Vanderbilt, shows that white Republicans are the most ethnocentric of all voters, but also that there are substantial numbers of ethnocentric white Democrats and white independents.This suggests that Trump could potentially find significant levels of support not only among Republican voters, but also among white Democrats and independents.What should prove worrisome for Democrats is that 42 percent of white independents also fall into the four most resentful categories, as do 22 percent of white Democrats.Even polls using traditional phone survey methods find notable support for issues high on Trump\u2019s agenda. You can see this, for example, in attitudes toward the Chinese, Muslims and Mexicans \u2014 all of whom Trump has demonized.Or take another Trump theme: Islam. The P.R.R.I. values survey asked whether they agreed or disagreed with the statement \u201cthe values of Islam are at odds with American values and way of life.\u201d Among all voters, 56 percent said that they agreed. Republican were strongest at 76 percent, but independents came in at 57 percent, with Democrats trailing at a still robust 43 percent.There are a few conclusions to be drawn.First, the way Trump has positioned himself outside of the traditional boundaries of politics will make it unusually difficult to gauge public support for him and for many of his positions.Second, the allegiance of many white Democrats and independents is difficult to predict \u2014 cross-pressured as they are by the conflict between unsavory Trump positions they are drawn to and conscience or compunction. The ambivalence of many Republicans toward Trump as their party\u2019s brazenly defiant nominee will further compound the volatility of the electorate.Finally, the simple fact that Trump has beaten the odds so far means that it is not beyond the realm of possibility that he could beat them again. If he does take the White House, much, if not all, of his margin of victory will come from voters too ashamed to acknowledge publicly how they intend to cast their vote.Thomas B.

For the most part, leaders failed to create diversified economies capable of withstanding slumps. The welfare and pension programs that kept voters loyal proved unsustainable. Leaders in Venezuela, Ecuador and Bolivia flouted democratic traditions by expanding or eliminating term limits and co-opted independent institutions with networks of patronage.The shifting political landscape has opened the door for a new generation of leaders to chart a different course for Latin America. That offers the United States an opportunity to jump-start its relationship with several neighbors that have historically regarded Washington as neglectful, imperial \u2014 or both.Yet, a brighter future for struggling Latin Americans cannot depend on the United States. Ultimately, that will require leaders who are accountable to their citizens, are willing to invest in long-term prosperity rather than their political brands and stand ready to acknowledge the colossal mistakes of their predecessors.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jobs Data Could Be Bad News for Democrats", "Date": "2016-05-23", "News": "The national report also showed that only 160,000 jobs were created last month, a slowdown from the earlier pace of job growth. The state report shows that nearly 60 percent of those new jobs were in California and Florida, indicating that slower job growth is an on-the-ground reality in most states.The states with the largest increases in unemployment from January to April, Wyoming and Pennsylvania, have economies that are tied to oil and energy. The states that lost the most jobs last month \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Wyoming, North Dakota and Alaska \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are also energy dependent.At this point in the campaign season, there is no avoiding a political spin on jobs data. Republicans are sure to blame any weakness on President Obama and the Democrats. Democrats are likely to respond with the litany of job-creating policies they have tried to enact in the past several years, only to be blocked by congressional Republicans.The Democrats have the stronger argument. But if the slowdown continues, they may find they have the weaker political hand. Simply put, no incumbent party wants the economy to be slowing as an election nears.For now, there is no way to know if the job market will improve or worsen.

{"Headline": "Outspoken Fed Official Frets About Following Japan\u2019s Path", "Date": "2016-05-04", "News": "Supported byMonetary PolicyJames Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, doesn\u2019t know when the American economy will fall into another recession. But he says it\u2019s increasingly likely that it will happen before the Fed has a chance to return its benchmark interest rate to a historically normal level.Indeed, Mr. Bullard has fretted for years that the United States and other major economies may be stuck with low interest rates for some time to come. In an interview last week, Mr. Bullard said he wants to raise rates. He really does. It just seems as if the necessary conditions keep slipping away.After pushing to raise rates at the beginning of the year, he voted against a rate increase in April and he said he\u2019s still thinking about June. \u201cIf you talk to people in Tokyo, they say, \u2018Well, we\u2019ve been through this and tried all these things and you guys are just following us,\u2019 \u201d he said in the interview. \u201cI hope that\u2019s not exactly true.\u201dMr. Bullard also talked about his distaste for the Fed\u2019s \u201cdot plot\u201d and why he\u2019s not afraid of a little Brexit.And I asked Mr. Bullard, the most talkative of the Fed\u2019s current crop of officials, whether he talks too much. Read on for his answer. The text of our conversation is lightly edited for clarity.And one thing you can say about them is, \u201cGee, they seem to be very highly correlated with oil prices and so they\u2019re not as meaningful as you think they are.\u201d And certainly for about a year, 18 months, after oil prices started to decline \u2014 so this is summer of 2014 \u2014 all the way through the end of last year, I kept saying, \u201cYes, but they\u2019re highly correlated with oil prices.\u201d I was expecting prices to decorrelate. And it still hasn\u2019t happened. We\u2019re coming up on two years. I\u2019m starting to feel like you just have to take the signal at face value.Now, when we lifted off, we did the same thing. And if you look at past behavior of the Fed, once we start moving we keep moving in the same direction. That\u2019s the way the Fed works. So it looked like a quasi-commitment to raise rates four times in 2016. And we put language around it saying, \u201cThis is all data dependent.\u201d But from the market\u2019s point of view they were saying: \u201cIn the past, whenever you started moving, you kept moving. So you\u2019re giving us guidance about what you\u2019re going to do and you\u2019re going to stick with it.\u201dIt was very hard for us to break that off in the January-February time frame, to convince markets that we really are data dependent. So this whole experience convinced me that there is more commitment embedded in the dot plot than we would really like, and certainly more than what has been the norm for the Fed in other eras when we\u2019ve had successful policy-making. Greenspan never said anything about what the committee might do in the future. The norm in central banking, away from the zero bound, is to say, \u201cWe have set the policy rate exactly where we think it should be for today, given everything that\u2019s going on in the economy, and in the future we\u2019ll look at the data.\u201d You didn\u2019t do this kind of dot-plot thing.I\u2019ve wondered if we should get back to something that\u2019s more akin to that. We don\u2019t want to give unintentional commitments. We\u2019re doing it with good intentions. We\u2019re trying to be transparent. We\u2019re saying this depends on the economy. But I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s really working all that well.I\u2019ve always been worried that the long run here is the Japanese outcome. I still hold out hope that that\u2019s not the case, but I am worried about it, and it\u2019s been going on for a very long time. If you talk to people in Tokyo, they say, \u201cWell, we\u2019ve been through this and tried all these things, and you guys are just following us.\u201d I hope that\u2019s not exactly true. I do think we\u2019ve been able to do better than the B.O.J. did in implementing some forms of unconventional monetary policy. I thought QE2 was particularly effective. We\u2019ve been able to keep expectations of inflation relatively high. I still hold out some hope.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Disproving Beliefs About the Economy and Aging", "Date": "2016-05-13", "News": "Supported byRetiringWhy is the American economy stuck in low gear?Among economists, two major culprits get most of the attention. First is anemic productivity growth. Productivity, output per worker hour, has increased at a disappointing average annual rate of 1.3 percent since 2005 compared to the 2.8 percent annual pace recorded in the previous 10 years. The reasons behind the productivity slowdown \u2014 especially the economic impact of technological innovations and lower levels of business and public investment \u2014 are heavily debated.But little controversy shadows the second major factor: the demographics of an aging population. The oldest members of the baby boomer generation are filing for Medicare. About 8,000 boomers will celebrate their 65th birthday each day until 2030. Labor force growth is slow in a society with fewer young people and growing numbers of retirees.To a large extent, of course, demographic forces are inevitable. There isn\u2019t much dispute about the Census Bureau prediction that all baby boomers will be 65 and over in 2029, accounting for more than 20 percent of the total population. The 65 and above age group is projected to become larger than the population 18 and under by 2056.Compared to forecasting the future pace of productivity growth, demographics are reassuringly predictable. Or are they?\u201cWe observe the world how it is today and make these very simple projections and turn them into a terrible scenario,\u201d said Johannes Koettl, senior economist at the World Bank\u2019s Social Protection and Labor Global Practice. \u201cThis approach fails to take into account that the world is changing.\u201dIt is long past time to shed three pernicious myths about the United States economy and aging.You have most likely seen variations on the old-age dependency ratio. The ratio compares the number of people ages 15 to 64 (workers) with people 65 and older (retired, not working). It paints the familiar picture of an increasing number of nonworking older adults. The ratio is alarming since it assumes everyone 65 and over isn\u2019t working.But millions of older Americans are staying employed or looking for work well into the traditional retirement years. There are a variety of reasons: Boomers are well educated and healthier than previous generations. Work is less physically taxing in a service-dominated economy. More older people need an income to supplement slim savings.The World Bank has developed an alternative ratio, the adult dependency ratio, that incorporates working longer. This ratio compares the number of inactive people (not working and not looking for work) with active people (working or looking for work) in the adult population, age 15 and older.The projections take into account past trends of increased participation of women and older people in the work force until 2030 and assume an additional rise in effective retirement age by 10 years from 2030 to 2060. This ratio is more or less constant until it eventually declines, painting a reassuring forecast compared to the old-age dependency ratio.For example, Axel B\u00f6rsch-Supan and Matthias Weiss of the Munich Center for the Economics of Aging analyzed data from a German truck assembly plant owned by Mercedes-Benz. Looking at standard error rates at the plant, they found statistically significant evidence of higher error rates for workers under 30 but no evidence of more mistakes as workers age into their 60s.Productivity improved all the way up to retirement at 65.For many knowledge-based companies, the rewards to experience and collaboration are even more critical. \u201cThe bottom line is that older people do things differently, but they don\u2019t do it worse,\u201d said Mr. Koettl, the World Bank economist. \u201cThey have different advantages vis-\u00e0-vis young people.\u201dIris Shiraishi would most likely agree. For 14 years she was the artistic director of the Taiko ensemble at Mu Performing Arts in Minneapolis, one of the largest Asian-American performing arts organizations in the country. Two years ago, in her early 60s, she decided it was time start her own Taiko, or Japanese drumming, group. She is tapping into two decades of her Taiko experience to take creative risks with her compositions, experimenting with different instrumentations and performance techniques.The notion that the job market is a zero sum game \u2014 more jobs for one group translates into fewer jobs for another group \u2014 is deeply ingrained. Economists call the belief that there are only so many jobs in an economy the \u201clump of labor fallacy.\u201dBut the truth is that growth in the number of jobs for older people tends to run in parallel with gains for younger workers. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a fixed number of jobs,\u201d Ms. Carstensen said. \u201cYou grow the pie.\u201dOlder workers still have a lot to contribute. C. Eugene Steuerle, an economist at the Urban Institute in Washington, captures the underlying dynamic: \u201cIf labor supply increases, the nation gets additional work and larger output. More output means more income for workers. More income means more revenue at any given tax rate. With more revenue, government can pay for more spending at the same tax rates, or lower tax rates.\u201dThe bottom line? One way to help get the economy out of its rut would be to embrace policies that encourage older Americans to stay employed and for employers to appreciate their aging work force.An article on Saturday about myths involving the United States economy and the increasing size of its older population misstated the frequency of 65th birthday anniversaries among baby boomers. It is 8,000 a day, not 8,000 a month.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton, in Kentucky, Fights to Avert a 2-Loss Tuesday", "Date": "2016-05-16", "News": "Supported byHOPKINSVILLE, Ky. \u2014 Hillary Clinton raced on Monday to fend off Senator Bernie Sanders on the eve of Kentucky\u2019s Democratic primary, hoping to avoid another show of weakness as she heads into an almost certain general-election fight with Donald J. Trump.Mrs. Clinton snaked through a smoke-filled diner, and then she hopscotched around the state holding a series of rallies, where she urged Kentuckians to turn out to vote.The fast-paced day, which included a combative exchange with an audience member who objected to her criticism of Kentucky\u2019s Republican governor, might have suggested a candidate fighting for survival.Instead, Mrs. Clinton is all but certain to claim her party\u2019s nomination. But in the meantime, she would prefer to stop losing primaries, even if they are of little mathematical consequence.After visiting Kentucky last week, Mrs. Clinton on Monday wrapped up a two-day tour. She started her day in the western part of the state with a visit to the Lone Oak Little Castle restaurant in Paducah, where she was joined by Kentucky\u2019s secretary of state, Alison Lundergan Grimes.\u201cI\u2019m excited about the primary tomorrow, but we got to turn a lot of people out,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll tell you this: I\u2019m not going to give up on Kentucky in November.\u201dMr. Sanders campaigned in Puerto Rico on Monday, but over the weekend, he made several stops in Kentucky, including visits to Frankfort, Elizabethtown and Bowling Green.At a rally in Paducah on Sunday, Mr. Sanders argued that he was the stronger candidate to defeat Mr. Trump. He also took aim at Kentucky\u2019s governor, Matt Bevin, a foe of the Affordable Care Act, saying they had stark differences over health care and education.\u201cIf anybody in this room or in this state wants to know what kind of president I will be, take a look at Governor Bevin and what he is doing,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cAnd then think about the exact opposite, and that\u2019s Bernie Sanders.\u201dMrs. Clinton, too, criticized Mr. Bevin, while showcasing the backing of his Democratic predecessor, Steve Beshear. At a rally here in Hopkinsville on Monday, she said Mr. Bevin was \u201cjust bent on destroying so much of what Kentucky has achieved.\u201dNot long after, when a woman in the crowd objected to her criticism, Mrs. Clinton held her ground. \u201cYou are entitled to your opinion, but you\u2019re not entitled to your own facts,\u201d Mrs. Clinton fired back, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s time people stop listening to Republican propaganda about the economy, education and health care.\u201dKentucky\u2019s primary is one of two Democratic contests on Tuesday. Oregon, which votes by mail, requires ballots to be received by Tuesday night, and the state\u2019s demographics favor Mr. Sanders. Kentucky is more competitive, and it poses another test of how much Mrs. Clinton can attract white working-class voters, who have been receptive to Mr. Sanders\u2019s populist message.On Monday, Mrs. Clinton appealed to voters who have fond memories of her husband\u2019s administration. \u201cI want to help bring back the kind of economy that worked for everybody in the 1990s,\u201d she said at the diner.Losses in Kentucky and Oregon would not imperil her grip on the Democratic nomination, but Mrs. Clinton is in the awkward position of running two campaigns at once: urging voters to turn out in the primary while also laying out arguments geared toward a face-off with Mr. Trump in November.At the same time, Mrs. Clinton devoted considerable attention to Mr. Trump, criticizing him over issues like taxes and foreign policy. In Bowling Green on Monday, she told the crowd to imagine she was on a debate stage with Mr. Trump, and provided a sample question: \u201cSo what is your plan to create jobs?\u201dMrs. Clinton offered an impression of the businessman.\u201cHis answer is, \u2018I\u2019m going to create them, they\u2019re going to be great, I know how to do it, but I\u2019m not telling you what it is I\u2019m going to do,\u2019 \u201d she said.At the Lone Oak Little Castle, where the menu includes staples like biscuits and gravy, Mrs. Clinton saw signs of loyal support for her and her husband, as well as of the resistance she is likely to face in November from some voters.Residents peered in the windows of the restaurant to observe the commotion inside as Mrs. Clinton slowly made her way through the crowd, greeting admirers like Debbie Patterson, 60, who wore a shirt saying, \u201cAnything Bill can do Hill can do better.\u201d\u201cThat is so cute!\u201d Mrs. Clinton said.Mrs. Clinton also encountered DiAnna Dooley, 66, a supporter of Mr. Trump\u2019s who made a miniature Trump sign by scrawling his name on a slip of paper. Before Mrs. Clinton made the rounds, Ms. Dooley described her as \u201cjust a carbon-copy Obama.\u201dLater, Ms. Dooley told Mrs. Clinton that she would never vote for her. Mrs. Clinton was unruffled. \u201cThat\u2019s O.K.,\u201d she replied. \u201cYou vote for whoever you want.\u201dYamiche Alcindor contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bill Clinton, Economy Czar?", "Date": "2016-05-23", "News": "Supported byEditorial ObserverBILLINGS, Mont. \u2014 On a warm Friday night, Montana Democrats filed into a middle school gym for a Hillary Clinton rally that was all Bill and no Hillary.Mrs. Clinton was never on the marquee for this one. Montana, South Dakota and North Dakota all vote on June 7, the last big Tuesday on the presidential primary calendar that includes the critical state of California, with many times more Democratic delegates than all three Western states put together. So it was that Mrs. Clinton dispatched her husband to traverse the Great Plains, speaking at rallies in Sioux Falls, S.D., Fargo, N.D., and Billings.Mr. Clinton\u2019s solo appearance gave a glimpse of how he might approach the job his wife has proposed for him if she wins \u2014 that of an in-house jobs czar \u201cin charge of revitalizing the economy.\u201d It also inspired discussion among voters here about whether her promise of two smart Clintons for the price of one was smart or foolish. A similar promise from Mr. Clinton in 1992 elevated Hillary and seemed a nod to gender equality. But to women in Billings, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s two-for-one offer seemed to diminish her.The economy fuels voter anger like no other issue. Last week, Bernie Sanders\u2019s rally here drew some 2,000 people, and Donald Trump\u2019s rally on Thursday will most likely draw many more. On Friday, however, the Will James Middle School gym was half-full. A few hundred faithful, mostly women, were elated to see an old friend, but not at all sure that he should play a role in the White House.Inger Curtis had brought her 12-year-old daughter, Kendra, and a classmate, Annalie Whitney, to the rally. \u201cI think it\u2019s great that Bill is supporting his wife,\u201d she said. But a policy job? No. I don\u2019t think that would be the best, having him pulled back into the fray. We need fresh blood.\u201dPete Timm, a retiree in line ahead of Ms. Curtis, interrupted. \u201cWith his charisma and the appeal he has among minorities, he is gonna help Hillary tremendously, kicking butt.\u201dMr. Timm\u2019s wife, Carol, demurred. \u201cI don\u2019t mind if he helps with the economy, but certainly not as the head of anything. Just with a bit of advice.\u201dMr. Clinton\u2019s presentation did little to ease such disquiet. It focused on economic ideas, and while he carefully prefaced his prescriptions with \u201cHillary says,\u201d \u201cHillary proposes\u201d or \u201cHillary\u2019s deal is,\u201d he made clear that he is and will be the half of the partnership focused on jobs, wages and investment, and with restoring the good times of the first Clinton administration.He suggested further that as the campaign unfolds he\u2019ll be smoothing ruffled feelings among struggling voters, like those who objected to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s recent comment that her clean-energy policies would put \u201ca lot of coal companies and coal miners out of business.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what Hillary asked me to work on, to go to the areas that are left out, left behind and overlooked,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd in West Virginia, she sent me down there to places where they don\u2019t like Democrats because they think we\u2019re trying to put them out of business because we want to do something about climate change.\u201d\u201cAnd I told them, I said, you can be mad if you want, because Hillary told you the truth. But here\u2019s what she wanted me to tell you. Whoever you vote for, she\u2019s not gonna leave you behind.\u201dAfter his speech, Mr. Clinton signed autographs, posed for selfies and engaged in extended banter. As his fans filed out, Melissa Smith, a volunteer in both of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaigns, said she thought Mr. Clinton would be \u201c fabulous\u201d at whatever he did.\u201cBut I\u2019m voting for Hillary.

The setting was the 69th annual Cannes Film Festival, and Mr. Weinstein, on the French Riviera for two weeks to make film deals, would later host a party onboard the Odessa II yacht with the billionaire businessman Len Blavatnik.\u201cYou are constantly at work in Cannes, morning, noon and night,\u201d Mr. Weinstein said, cellphone in hand. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t stop.\u201dIndeed, although Cannes has long been the film festival with the most star power and glimmering parties, this year more than any other the power of the red-carpet economy has been on show for all to see in an ever-spinning carousel of premieres, news media junkets and high-wattage events. Charles Finch of Finch & Partners, a consultancy that advises brands on Hollywood partnerships, said that as the movie industry has shrunk, the big sponsorships that were once the province of major studios have been co-opted by major luxury houses instead, with the related transformation of the Croisette into a catwalk.Megabrands such as Dior and Chopard spend millions of dollars on five-star hotel suites on this busy stretch of Mediterranean seafront, grooming, dressing and bejeweling starlets for a moment in the spotlight a stone\u2019s throw away at the Palais.\u201cThe studios came to Cannes for cultural gravitas and indie credentials that would give their movies added weight, spending a great deal of money doing so,\u201d Mr. Finch said. The festival\u2019s focus on international cinema meant a more global spotlight than American-centric award ceremonies, he said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s the turn of big brands to step up and do the same thing.\u201dMr. Finch would know. He hosted his annual star-studded dinner Friday night, alongside the watch brand Jaeger-LeCoultre, on the palatial terraces of the hotel.Clive Owen rubbed shoulders with George Miller, the director of \u201cMad Max\u201d and this year\u2019s main competition jury president, while his fellow juror Mads Mikkelsen mingled with the likes of Heidi Klum, Charlotte Tilbury, Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal, Jack O\u2019Connell and Johnny Coca, the perennially kilted Mulberry creative director. Dominic West held court at the center of the room, and at dinner the actress Rebecca Hall giggled with Mick Jagger, who was resplendent in a crushed plum-hued jacket, and later shamelessly cut the line at the buffet.Just 24 hours later, a lucky few hundred guests traveled once again along the winding coastal roads back to the H\u00f4tel du Cap-Eden-Roc for the Vanity Fair party, hosted by the magazine\u2019s editor, Graydon Carter.32 PhotosAfter a lavish dinner upstairs, co-hosted by Richard Plepler, the chairman of HBO, the scene headed downstairs and onto the decks for an after-party that resembled a 1950s movie set: The hotel\u2019s lush gardens had been uplit in misty pinks and yellows, elegant sandy-hued umbrellas positioned amid the rocks, and the Vanity Fair logo gleamed like sunken treasure from the bottom of the pool. Dozens of security heavies with earpieces lurked discreetly in the bushes, ready to boot any foolhardy crashers willing to try their luck. (There were plenty.)\u201cIt\u2019s so much fun tonight,\u201d said the model-of-the-moment Kendall Jenner in a midnight blue satin wrap gown with sparkling black tassels by Mathieu Mirano. \u201cI feel like all my friends are here.\u201dNearby, Kate Hudson chatted with Peter Dundas, the creative director for Roberto Cavalli, and Kirsten Dunst, who was full of praise for the designer of her gown, the London-based Michael van der Ham.\u201cHe is one of the most talented guys in the business, and I want him in the spotlight,\u201d she said, while leaning by the bar. \u201cTell everyone about this amazing outfit.\u201dThis was not a problem for a flat-capped Leonardo DiCaprio, who charged scowling through the crowd at lightning speed before setting up a base in the shadows.The party was co-hosted by the jewelry brand Chopard, also an official partner of the film festival, as well as the co-host of its own yacht party earlier. Along with Colin Firth and his wife, Livia, Chopard celebrated the latest Green Carpet collection as part of a collaboration with Gemfields, the precious stones supplier, to produce ethically sourced emeralds. Julianne Moore wore several pieces to the opening ceremony, which glimmered among the gold sequins on her Alexander McQueen gown.\u201cThe great thing about Cannes is that beyond the glitz and glamour, the red carpet can be used to promote important causes in a public arena that has unparalleled reach,\u201d said Mrs. Firth, the founder and creative director of Eco Age, a brand consultancy that helps companies become more sustainable.Kering, the French luxury conglomerate that owns such names as Gucci, Stella McCartney and Alexander McQueen, had the same idea. In addition to creating the \u201cWomen in Motion\u201d series of talks that explore the position of women in the film industry, the group hosted the Cannes presidential dinner Sunday night honoring the work of Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis, 25 years after the release of \u201cThelma & Louise.\u201dAs the actresses took selfies, Ms. Sarandon said that the female-centric road-trip classic would most likely never have been made today given what she called \u201ca lack of imagination\u201d by male film executives.\u201cIt would probably end up as an animation,\u201d she said, after having whipped off her heels to collect her award, her comment cheered by Juliette Binoche, Vanessa Paradis and Jean Paul Gaultier. \u201cWhereas women can see a woman or a man in a leading role,\u201d she added, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s as easy for a guy to see a woman in a leading role and say, \u2018I\u2019ll get behind that.\u2019 It is still a cultural thing.\u201dHer seatmate at dinner, Salma Hayek, gave the subject a more positive spin.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work to be done still, I know,\u201d Ms. Hayek said, before sitting back in her rose pink ruffled Gucci gown. \u201cBut I truly believe that this is an issue that is part of more conversations that ever before.

{"Headline": "Egypt Sentences 152 to Prison for Protest Over Transfer of Islands", "Date": "2016-05-14", "News": "Supported byThe tough sentences come at a time when Mr. Sisi has appeared unnerved by a sudden wave of criticism over Egypt\u2019s faltering economy, and has become intolerant toward even playful opponents.On Monday, the police arrested five members of a satirical performance group who posted videos online that mocked Mr. Sisi. They joined a wave of writers, poets and activists jailed since January. The government has also barred prominent human rights campaigners from leaving the country or has frozen their assets.The arrested satirists, ages 19 to 25, face a number of charges, including incitement of terrorism. In response to the crackdown, some Egyptians have struck back at Mr. Sisi on the Internet with mocking slogans that suggest he fears mobile phones.At least 400 other demonstrators still face prosecution over the two protests in April about the Red Sea islands, Tiran and Sanafir. Sameh Samir, a lawyer representing some of the 51 people convicted on Saturday, said many had been randomly picked off the street, and would appeal their sentences.Thousands of Egyptians have been jailed since 2013, including many who are languishing in pretrial detention. Others have fled the country, fearing arrest. On Saturday, Sanaa Abdel-Fattah, a prominent activist, started a six-month sentence for insulting the judiciary.Even so, Mr. Sisi\u2019s government has sought to project itself as a key ally in the West\u2019s fight against Islamist extremism across the Middle East.

{"Headline": "The Miserable French Workplace", "Date": "2016-05-11", "News": "Supported byParis \u2014 A FELLOW I know arrived at work recently to find that his company had hired someone new, and given the woman his exact job title. Soon afterward, he said, higher-ups cut his department\u2019s budget and stopped replying to his emails.The man suspects he\u2019s headed for that infamous place in French companies known as \u201cle placard,\u201d or the closet. Many workers here have permanent contracts that make it very hard to fire them. So some companies resort to an illegal strategy: They try to make someone so miserable, he\u2019ll quit. \u201cWhat happens next is, I\u2019ll lose my team and my staff, and therefore I\u2019ll have nothing to do,\u201d the man predicted. \u201cYou still have to come to work every day, but you have no idea why.\u201dLabor laws are the main topic of conversation here. The government has battled unions and other groups for months over a bill that would, among other things, make it easier to fire people when a company is losing money. This week, short of votes, it forced the bill through the lower house by decree (if a measure on Thursday to block this move fails, the bill will go on to the Senate).It\u2019s obvious that the current system isn\u2019t working. The bill\u2019s supporters argue that business owners are reluctant to hire employees, because it\u2019s so complicated and expensive to fire them when times are bad. And times are pretty bad: France has 10 percent unemployment, roughly twice the levels in Germany and Britain. For young people, it\u2019s around 24 percent. President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has said he\u2019ll run for re-election next year only if he succeeds in reducing unemployment.While many other European countries have revamped their workplace rules, France has barely budged. The new labor bill \u2014 weakened after long negotiations \u2014 wouldn\u2019t alter the bifurcated system, in which workers either get a permanent contract called a \u201ccontrat \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e,\u201d known as a C.D.I., or a short-term contract that can be renewed only once or twice. Almost all new jobs have the latter.And yet it isn\u2019t just unions that oppose the bill. So do more than 60 percent of the population, who fear the bill would strip workers of protections without fixing the problem. Young people took to the streets to oppose it, demanding C.D.I.s, too.Why are the French so wedded to a failing system?For starters, they believe that a job is a basic right \u2014 guaranteed in the preamble to their Constitution \u2014 and that making it easier to fire people is an affront to that. Without a C.D.I., you\u2019re considered naked before the indifferent forces of capitalism.At one demonstration in Paris, young protesters held a banner warning that they were the \u201cg\u00e9n\u00e9ration pr\u00e9caire.\u201d They were agitating for the right to grow up. As Jean-Beno\u00eet Nadeau and Julie Barlow point out in their new book, \u201cThe Bonjour Effect,\u201d getting a permanent work contract is a rite of adulthood. Without one, it\u2019s hard to get a mortgage or car loan, or rent an apartment.Mainstream economic arguments can\u2019t compete. \u201cBasic facts of economic science are completely dismissed,\u201d said \u00c9tienne Wasmer, a labor economist at Sciences Po. \u201cPeople don\u2019t see that if you let employers take risks, they\u2019ll hire more people.\u201d Instead, many French people view the workplace as a zero-sum battle between workers and bosses.Economic debates are also framed as political showdowns. It\u2019s hard to separate opposition to the labor bill from dislike of President Hollande, whose approval rating has sunk to 14 percent. It doesn\u2019t help that Mr. Hollande was elected on a skewer-the-rich platform (remember the 75 percent income tax?). By backing the bill, he now appears to be siding with C.E.O.s.France\u2019s rising political star, the economy minister Emmanuel Macron, is a labor reformer, too, but at least he presents a coherent worldview: He said France needs young people who want to become billionaires.In a forthcoming European Working Conditions Survey, 12 percent of French respondents said they\u2019d been bullied or harassed at work in the past month, far more than in any other European country. C.D.I.s alone don\u2019t cause harassment, but they make it harder to escape. This problem is at least being aired. The vice president of France\u2019s national assembly resigned this week, following accusations that he\u2019d sexually harassed women as far back as 1998 (he denies it). In response, hundreds of politicians and activists published a letter decrying a culture of \u201comerta\u201d in which victims are told to just carry on.No matter what the government does, the workplace is becoming less secure. If French taxi drivers are outraged by competition from Uber, what will they do when self-driving cars arrive? \u201cIt is not going to get better,\u201d warned Jean Tirole, a Frenchman who won the 2014 Nobel in economic science. \u201cThe digital society increases uncertainty about the nature of jobs, so in the future firms will be even more reluctant to make permanent job offers.\u201dI don\u2019t want to confront capitalism while naked either. But there\u2019s got to be a middle ground between the streets and the closet.Pamela Druckerman is the author of \u201cBringing Up B\u00e9b\u00e9: One American Mother Discovers the Wisdom of French Parenting\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "No, the Battleground States Are Not a Terrific Fit for Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-05-10", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceNate Cohn, The Upshot\u2019s politics analyst, and Toni Monkovic, an Upshot editor, discussed the polls and other battleground states in a Slack chat that has been lightly edited:On the one hand, the preponderance of evidence suggests that Clinton has a comfortable edge in the battleground states. Quinnipiac, for good measure, has been pretty tough on the Democrats over the last few cycles. You can see some sign of that in the racial composition of the surveys. In Florida, for instance, Quinnipiac\u2019s registered voters are 69 percent white, 11 percent black and 15 percent Hispanic. The official data from the Florida secretary of state (since voters are asked their race when they register to vote) is 65.7 percent white, 13.3 percent black and 14.8 percent Hispanic. Similarly, the census\u2019 current population survey in 2014 found that 64.3 percent of registered voters were white, 15.2 percent were black and 17.9 percent Hispanic.On the other hand, this can be a pretty volatile period in the race. The polls typically get a lot more accurate between the end of the primaries and the few weeks after the conventions. The parties unify, the electorate gets a bit more polarized. You could imagine something similar benefiting Donald Trump, who has just wrapped up the nomination and has an opportunity to consolidate Republican voters. So I think we should keep an eye out over the next few months to see whether he benefits from the end of the primary process.These Quinnipiac polls are among the first since he wrapped up the nomination. We can\u2019t rule out the possibility that there\u2019s some real movement here.If all of the polls start turning toward Trump, that would be far more important.I\u2019d probably just watch the national polls right now.But white working-class voters in the Upper Midwest seem a bit more reluctant to embrace the modern conservative G.O.P. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because of lower levels of racial resentment, lower levels of evangelical Christianity, the stronger economy, some combination of all of it, or something else. But it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise if this proved to be a problem for Trump again.Current polls show an uphill battle for Donald Trump should he and Hillary Clinton face off in the general election.Of all the close battleground states, I might be more surprised by a Trump win here than anywhere else. I\u2019d also note that the affluence and establishment-friendly politics of Northern Virginia probably blunt Trump\u2019s appeal more here than anywhere else.I think there\u2019s a real case that Florida could save Democrats in a close election \u2014 the sort of election where they\u2019re in danger of losing whiter states where Democrats have more room to lose ground, like Pennsylvania or Iowa.If black turnout is high \u2014 and I expect it will be \u2014 North Carolina is going to be very close, regardless of what happens nationwide.Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019ll win places that a lot of people say you\u2019re not going to win, that as a Republican you can\u2019t win. Michigan is a great example; nobody else will go to Michigan. We\u2019re going to be encamped in Michigan because I think I can win it.\u201dAlso, Michigan is not just a state of autoworkers. Black voters represent an above-average share of the electorate. There are a lot of well-educated white voters around Detroit, or Lansing and Ann Arbor. Trump did very poorly in the primary in heavily Dutch Western Michigan, which is the real conservative base in the state.To me, Trump does have opportunities to make inroads among Democratic-leaning white voters in Michigan, much as he does in Pennsylvania and Ohio. The difference is that Obama won Michigan by more than nine points in 2012; the Democrats have a big cushion. They can lose a lot of ground and still squeak it out, like Kerry and Al Gore did.That said, I\u2019d note that Missouri, Indiana and Arizona all have second-tier Senate races that might come in play along with the presidential race, if Democrats are so fortunate.Advertisement"}

Work provided income, but that was about it. Rogers and McKendree realized what each wanted from their lives and what they needed to achieve it. They quit the idea of 9-to-5 life to pursue what was most important to each of them, be it family or pursuing a passion, and succeeded.  This change in thinking begins with the optimistic desire for something in their lives that was lacking. In each case, this need triggered a shift in ambition, allowing Rogers and McKendree to achieve a livelihood they were content with. Years ago, the idea of quitting a job to create the life one wanted was unheard of. But more and more in our dynamic society, the way we live and work is changing to reflect turning points in our lives. The transformation is being led by millennials, immigrants and families, and enabled by technology. As this change spreads to create a better workplace, it's being set in stone by policies.  Shifts in ambition often begin with newcomers to the work force. Millennials and immigrants may not seem to have much in common, but each has encountered obstacles in connecting with the mainstream economy.  When fleeing Cuba in the 1960s as teenagers, Alberto and Betty Calvo were permitted to take nothing but two changes of clothing. That initial struggle kept the two grounded as Alberto Calvo studied engineering and Betty created a wholesaling business in the Boston area importing Latin foods.  Eventually Alberto, now 69, joined the business, and today is the president of Stop and Compare specialty supermarkets, which was built from the foundations built by Betty.  \u201cImmigrants have proven to be entrepreneurial, willing to take risks and are overall, good for the U.S. economy,\u201d says Victor Romano, associate professor of sociology at Barry University, in Miami, Fla.  Through their desire to achieve the American Dream, the Calvos forged their own path by wanting to satisfy the needs of other immigrants like themselves.  A similar path is being followed by millennials, whose ambitions were formed by economic hardship and a desire to help others.  At 23, Meghan Navoy was living and working hard in New York toward what she thought were her career goals. But she began to think about her values more and more.  \u201cI try to live as intentionally and authentically as I can,\u201d she says. She knew then that working her way up the corporate ladder wasn\u2019t for her. Navoy quit, moved back to the Midwest and, with the help of technology, started A Wool Story, an online business where she repurposes wool clothing into fashionable knit accessories. \u201cKnowing this is my life and I know I can live it as I see fit, I don\u2019t feel like putting in endless hours for a cause I don\u2019t believe in.\u201d  \u201cYou can\u2019t talk about millennials without discussing the Great Recession and how it impacted them,\u201d Romano says. \u201cBut they have made substantial investments in higher education and ... have an ability to adapt to changes within society.\u201d  They\u2019re more willing than previous generations to move jobs \u2014 or start new businesses \u2014 if they feel their needs aren\u2019t being met, he says.  \u201cMillennials have this self-confidence, so they feel they have options,\u201d says Ron Alsop, author of \u201cThe Trophy Kids Grow Up: How the Millennial Generation is Shaking Up the Workplace.\u201d  McKendree, 31, another millennial, left his job and moved to Rhode Island, where he pursued his passion of surfing while creating a line of American-made shirts called Huxter.  Partly due to necessity and partly due to choice, both groups of newcomers are charting unique paths through the economy through their hard work. Women have also helped power the broader shift in ambition. Fifty years ago, women such as Navoy might not have dreamed of careers in New York, let alone starting their own business halfway across the country.\u201cMore educated women are still having children, but they\u2019re doing it a little later in life, and it leads to a career interruption,\u201d says Paul Taylor, author of \u201cThe Next America: Boomers, Millennials and the Looming Generational Showdown.\u201d \u201cAnd that\u2019s where the work-life challenge comes in \u2014 not when you\u2019re hiring someone at 24, but at 30 or so, when they start to have kids.\u201dIn 1980In 2000couplesIn 2010In 2010couplesThis is often the time when people like Rogers are faced with the decision of choosing between work or family. But technology has allowed the workplace to shift \u2013 giving individuals an opportunity for a work-life balance, allowing parents like Rogers to work when and where they want \u2014 or in her case, making sure she\u2019s there for her daughter\u2019s stage performances.While technology has helped society make the shift to a more mobile work force, society itself is changing as the ambitions of millennials, immigrants and women pass to the next generation.Companies are hearing this message and responding. The Society of Human Resource Management found that employers are expanding opportunities to volunteer, implementing sustainability and social responsibility programs and providing flexibility. While these are steps toward positive change, there is still room to grow. Employers who hesitate may be overrun by societal changes, as public shifts in values lead legislators to implement new policies. These kinds of changes are just the beginning of a larger shift in society. Technology continues to provide those with a thirst for knowledge the means to educate themselves as well as a means for forging their own path. And while policies may take some time catching up to all the progress being made, optimism is what keeps the ambition alive. \"So many young people are starting their own business(es) and trying to create positive change \u2014 it's really inspiring,\" Navoy says.

{"Headline": "Why Filipinos Are Voting for a New \u2018Dictator\u2019", "Date": "2016-05-06", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorMANILA \u2014 A carnival-like atmosphere has descended on this country ahead of the presidential election on Monday: dancing showgirls at campaign events, candidates inviting one another to \u201cslap me,\u201d and reports of cash distributed in exchange for cheers. The Philippine system of government, inherited from our American colonizers, is unique, with its raucous collection of political parties based not on ideology but on personality.Many Filipinos are fed up. That\u2019s why they are turning to candidates who promise an iron fist or a return to the glory days of a dictatorial past.The front-runner for the presidency is Rodrigo Duterte, the tough-talking mayor of Davao, the Philippines\u2019 third-largest city. He threatens to dissolve Congress and impose a \u201crevolutionary government\u201d if his reforms meet resistance. \u201cI am a dictator? Yes, it is true.\u201d he said. He also vows that if he is elected he will end crime in six months. \u201cIf I fail, kill me,\u201d he said.Meanwhile, many voters have been misled by nostalgic tales of the dictatorship of Ferdinand E. Marcos, who ruled from 1965 to 1986. His son, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., known as Bongbong, a senator, is leading the race for vice president and taking advantage of the short memory in a country where the median age is 23. \u201cI am a beneficiary of the good work that was done in my father\u2019s time,\u201d said Mr. Marcos, who praises his father, the ousted strongman, as the country\u2019s best president.The years after Philippine democracy was restored in 1986 were a time of festive optimism. My family, like many others, returned from exile abroad, excited by a new elected government and a new Constitution. But since then, the hope has faded thanks to a succession of discredited presidents and, moreover, the incompetence of a resurgent oligarchy.Of this year\u2019s five presidential candidates, three are backed by the wealthy Cojuangco family, which has influenced politics for the last four decades. One candidate is the grandson of a president, another a former mayor who established a dynasty that is accused of being grossly corrupt, while the third is a neophyte senator allied with a president who was ousted for plunder.Some economists estimate that 40 of the Philippines\u2019 richest families control 76 percent of gross domestic product. Senator Miriam Santiago, who promoted an unsuccessful anti-dynasty bill, said 178 dynasties ran the country\u2019s politics, with 73 of the nation\u2019s 80 provinces ruled by clans. The Center for People Empowerment in Governance, a think tank, found that roughly 80 percent of the 229 congressional seats were controlled by dynastic politicians.It\u2019s little wonder that many Filipinos now question the value of democracy.Mr. Duterte\u2019s campaign symbol is a fist \u2014 intended for lawbreakers, but seemingly also aimed at the oligarchy. \u201cHe is the only man who offers radical change,\u201d said one of the many petitions urging him last year to run for president. The message resonates with the frustrated poor who feel let down by the government, but his fans span all classes. Mock elections at universities consistently pick him as the winner, while a chamber of commerce of wealthy Filipino-Chinese business leaders lauded him as \u201cthe man who gets things done.\u201dThis image as a brash, no-nonsense leader explains why nothing he says is able to damage him. He repeatedly described a rival using a homophobic slur. He called Pope Francis \u201ca son of a whore.\u201d He told human-rights groups to \u201cgo to hell.\u201d He joked that he should have been first in the gang rape of an Australian missionary. \u201cThat\u2019s how men speak,\u201d Mr. Duterte explained. \u201cI am not a son of the privileged class.\u201d His supporters, who often threaten his critics on social media with death and rape threats, defended him with an offensive, but telling, rhetorical question: How can people get so upset at a rape joke when politicians have been raping the country for so long?Mr. Duterte has energized Filipinos in a historic way. One of his slogans is \u201cchange is coming.\u201d It\u2019s the exactly right message from the completely wrong messenger. His and Mr. Marcos\u2019s campaigns are fueled by frustration, but other candidates offer reason and hope: Leni Robredo, a vice-presidential candidate who recently overtook Mr. Marcos, has surged thanks to her advocacy for gender equality. Walden Bello, a former student radical who is now a respected academic, has been lauded locally and internationally for his integrity and democratic activism in the Legislature.Filipinos should look to such politicians for inspiration. But they should also look to themselves. As Jose Rizal, our hero of national independence, once wrote, \u201cThere are no tyrants where there are no slaves.\u201dFor my whole life I\u2019ve witnessed a tendency among Filipinos to elect people who pose as saviors. We long for a disciplinarian, but meanwhile we squabble among ourselves, willingly pay bribes and flout rules. We choose candidates based on regional ties or entertaining personalities. All of us recognize that our government, dominated by an oligarchy, is severely broken \u2014 but we need to select leaders who will educate and empower us to fix it ourselves. More, real, democracy is necessary, not less.Outside the headquarters of the Philippine National Police, a sign declares: \u201cThis is your police. We serve and protect.\u201d Continued, in red spray paint, is scrawled: \u201c\u2026 the ruling class.\u201d Whoever wrote it voices what so many feel. Only the people themselves can change that.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Boko Haram Be Defeated?", "Date": "2016-05-18", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorToday, Boko Haram is no longer occupying large parts of Nigeria. Instead, it has morphed into a group of well-organized bandits. The military\u2019s successes changed Boko Haram\u2019s threat, but didn\u2019t eliminate it. In fact, vanquishing the group may be a quixotic goal. But there are concrete ways Nigeria can minimize the menace posed by the militants.Boko Haram is unrecognizable from the proselytizing group it was 15 years ago, and from the semi-guerrilla army it was two years ago. With its fighters frequently being killed by the military, Boko Haram has resorted to mass kidnapping and extortion to replenish its ranks. The cadre of hard-core members inspired purely by devotion to a jihadist vision is being reinforced by child soldiers, forced conscripts and criminals.As ideology has become less important for recruitment, other incentives \u2014 money and jobs, access to loot and women \u2014 have become bigger draws. As a result, the group now seems to spend as much time engaged in banditry as it does fighting \u201cWestern education.\u201d When officials from Nigeria\u2019s Office of the National Security Adviser interviewed Boko Haram prisoners, they were told that most of the group\u2019s soldiers \u201chave never read the Quran.\u201dThis doesn\u2019t mean that Boko Haram isn\u2019t dangerous. The group still has the potential to harm Nigeria\u2019s neighbors, Cameroon, Chad and Niger. And Boko Haram\u2019s pledge of allegiance to the Islamic State in March 2015 could be a magnet drawing foreign jihadist fighters to West Africa.Something must change if Nigeria is to adequately address the problem posed by Boko Haram. The military cannot remain on a war footing forever without turning the country into a police state. The three states in northeastern Nigeria worst hit by the insurgency have been under a state of emergency for three years. The military is overextended. In July 2013, Lt. Col. Sambo Dasuki, national security adviser to the president at the time, Goodluck Jonathan, revealed that the military was deployed in 28 of Nigeria\u2019s 36 states.The military deserves some praise for learning on the job. Last month, it announced a program called Operation Safe Corridor for insurgents who surrender. A team of behavioral psychologists is working to deradicalize and rehabilitate detained Boko Haram members. This is a good start. But for this program to succeed, the security forces must behave with uncharacteristic restraint, avoid summarily executing Boko Haram adherents (as they have been accused of doing in the past) and keep them alive long enough for the psychologists to do their work.The Nigerian government could also try to set off a mass defection from Boko Haram by granting amnesty to its foot soldiers who enter the rehabilitation program. But it\u2019s unlikely that all of the group\u2019s members, especially the hard-core jihadists among them, would accept such an offer. And even if they did, it would teach Nigerians a dangerous lesson: Violence pays.For now, Nigeria can use the de-radicalization program to dry up the reservoir of disenchanted youths from which Boko Haram recruits. Then the military can continue fighting the inveterate ideologues who are unlikely to lay down their arms voluntarily. This selective application of force and persuasion will help deal with this longstanding insurgency.But they are not the entire solution. An \u201ciron fist in a velvet glove\u201d strategy will significantly degrade Boko Haram\u2019s ability to carry out mass-casualty terrorist attacks, but it will not guarantee harmony. Isolated pockets of violence will remain for years. Boko Haram remnants are likely to fracture into isolated rural bandit groups roaming Nigeria\u2019s borders for several years. Boko Haram may eventually become similar to Uganda\u2019s Lord\u2019s Resistance Army: a wandering, religiously inspired cult that periodically lashes out. That would be a problem, but it would not be an existential threat to the country.Max Siollun is the author, most recently, of \u201cSoldiers of Fortune: A History of Nigeria (1983-1993).\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Placement Is Politics in Brooklyn Museum Reinstallation", "Date": "2016-05-19", "News": "Supported byArt ReviewArt museums are political, whether they want to be or not. Through the objects they acquire and exhibit, and in the ways they interpret those objects \u2014 what they say about them, what they don\u2019t say \u2014 the institutions make statements about the relative value of cultures, meaning groups of people, and about who is important and who is not.The Brooklyn Museum is a political hotbed at the moment. It drew vociferous protests from anti-gentrification neighborhood groups last November when it rented space to the Brooklyn Real Estate Summit. Two weeks ago, there were further protests decrying the content and funding of a current photographic exhibition, \u201cThis Place,\u201d about Israel and the West Bank.The Egyptian collection reboot is primarily cosmetic, and as such very welcome. The former installation, in the 1893 McKim, Mead & White hall, was a clutter of faux-Pharaonic architecture and Vegas colors, an obstacle course. Two curators in the Egyptian art department, Edward Bleiberg and Yekaterina Barbash, working with the designer Lance Singletary, have cleared out the clutter and let the art breathe, unfettered, under the hall\u2019s soaring ceiling and high windows.They\u2019ve also set up a spacious introductory gallery that gives basic historical information (\u201cWho were the ancient Egyptians?\u201d) and answers a few frequently asked questions (\u201cWhy do so many Egyptian sculptures have broken noses?\u2019\u2019). Egypt\u2019s globalist credentials are affirmed in the presence of objects and influences that arrived there from Crete, Western Asia and Rome. But the installation\u2019s most interesting assertion, that Egyptian culture was fundamentally African rather than Mediterranean, is barely explored.And a single contemporary selection \u2014 a 1994 photographic series by the American artist Lorraine O\u2019Grady \u2014 added to the mix presumably in the interest of audience engagement, is inadequately explained and feels tacked on. Visitors might have been far more intrigued to learn that most of what they\u2019re seeing here was created for, and represents the values of, a social elite and a rising moneyed class that together formed a near equivalent to the segment of society that buys high-end art and controls the inequitable economy in America today.The rehanging of the European collection is even more Spartan than that of the Egyptian galleries, though the exhibition space itself \u2014 basically, the walkway surrounding the rotundalike Beaux-Arts Court on the third floor \u2014 is a continuing problem. Because the museum uses the space for social events, paintings must be sealed behind protective glass, which reflects light filtering down from the skylight. Richard Aste, a curator of European art, has dealt with this handicap as best he can, partly by placing some of the collection elsewhere, in an anteroom right off the third-floor elevator.There, you get a quick hit of the variety and quality of the museum\u2019s holdings in a jaunty little painting of a female nude by Lucas Cranach the Elder; a major, dusky one by Degas; and a gender-teasing Egon Schiele self-portrait, accompanied by a distinctly un-Met wall label commenting on Western art\u2019s relentless objectification of women. (Schiele objectified himself, which is different.) And in front of this textured ensemble stands Rodin\u2019s bronze Balzac, a monument to defiantly out-of-shape middle age.There\u2019s more Rodin around the court \u2014 the museum owns a ton \u2014 and a selection of paintings arranged by no-nonsense themes: religion, portraiture, landscape. Nardo di Cione\u2019s great 14th-century altarpiece really does look great. Brooklyn itself gets a nod in portraits of Washington A. Roebling and his wife, Emily Warren Roebling. (He initiated construction of the Brooklyn Bridge; she saw it to completion.)Of the landscapes, Vasily Vereshchagin\u2019s circa 1877 eyewitness view of prisoners\u2019 freezing to death on a snow-clogged road during the Russo-Turkish War is the least familiar and most memorable. With its barely visible corpses it\u2019s a whited-out horror scene, like the photographs taken of the Lakota dead on the battlefield at Wounded Knee just over a decade later.Native art comes right at the start of the American collection reinstallation, the largest of the three and by far the most provocative and incisive. The section builds on its predecessor, titled \u201cAmerican Identities,\u201d which caused a fuss when it opened in 2003. With objects piled up in dense cross-cultural, genre-mixing profusion, and ideas ricocheting around the rooms, it left some viewers feeling confused about where to look and what to think. I found it hugely stimulating and I like the new one, too, which is far more orderly and puts more trust in individual objects, or contrasted ones, to deliver meaning.You get a sense of the method in the first gallery, with its cases of pre-Columbian gold work and Hopi ceramics glowing against dark walls, within clear sight of Gilbert Stuart\u2019s full-length 1796 portrait of George Washington, a colonialist colossus, in the bright room beyond. The installation hinges on such visual links. Some are subtle and witty, as in the pairing of Miguel Cabrera\u2019s portrait of Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda de la Luz Padilla y G\u00f3mez de Cervantes, of Mexico City, with John Singleton Copley\u2019s likeness of Mrs. Sylvester Gardiner (born Abigail Pickman) of New England.As exemplars of provincial high chic, south and north, these women are utterly unalike, though each still has one fashionable foot, not to mention her heart, planted in Europe.Women as image makers as well as subjects play a conscientiously plotted role in the installation. The first thing you see off the fifth-floor elevator is a group of carved marble female nudes, most of them classic 19th-century emblems of chaste-white passivity. One of the last works in the installation\u2019s chronological route, a 2007 painting by the African-American artist Mickalene Thomas, also depicts a nude woman, but this one is dark-skinned, reclining on a rhinestone-spangled couch and looking straight at us as if we, not she, were the inert element here.In between these two poles come images, explicit or otherwise, embodying violence, acquisitiveness, wealth accumulation and an American faith, still very much alive, in Manifest Destiny. This is, in other words, an exercise \u2014 and an unsystematic one, to be sure \u2014 in history as told through art, a kind of telling that museums too seldom make pointed and explicit.Here, for example, Edward Hicks\u2019s early utopian-pacifist 1830s \u201cThe Peaceable Kingdom\u201d is set beside a later George Caleb Bingham painting of men, apparently frontier settlers, competing in a rifle match for a prize beef cow, which awaits its fate nearby.An 1864 copy of the Emancipation Proclamation, on temporary loan to the museum, is displayed near Eastman Johnson\u2019s painting of a slave family escaping into the night, and with a label pointing out that the proclamation did not, in reality, eradicate slavery.A silver medallion called the \u201cThomas Jefferson Indian Peace Medal,\u201d with an embossed image of a handshake, is near two faint drawings on paper torn from a notebook. From around 1890, the time of the massacre at Wounded Knee in South Dakota, the drawings, by an unknown Cheyenne man, depict scenes from the so-called Indian Wars. We can find such ledger drawings in the permanent collection displays of other museums. What we find less often is an accompanying label that reads, as the one here does: \u201cGovernment pogroms attempted to wipe out Native peoples by deliberately spreading disease and by killing off the life-sustaining buffalo and native sheep.\u201d And concludes: \u201cThe wars continued until all native peoples were driven onto reservations.\u201dBy itself, this statement of fact is harsh. Illustrated with images related to such devastation and recorded by someone who quite possibly died as a result, the words become something else: alive, immediate, personal. The museum\u2019s American reinstallation \u2014 designed by Matthew Yokobosky and organized by a curatorial team led by Connie H. Choi and including Barry R. Harwood, Nancy Rosoff, Susan Kennedy Zeller and Mr. Aste \u2014 is, conceptually, still just the start of something. It\u2019s a model in progress, one that should begin addressing, among other things, the painful, shameful histories of the ways, sometimes criminal, that art came to museums, and is still, despite legal safeguards, arriving.The Brooklyn Museum is at least broaching such histories, and doing so with real, if sporadic, force. This wouldn\u2019t work so effectively if the art in its great collections wasn\u2019t itself forceful in manifold ways. But it is, and like all art, it\u2019s political to the core.Brooklyn Museum Reinstallation: American, Egyptian, European Art; 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn; 718-638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Brexit\u2019 Vote Stokes Fear on the Rock", "Date": "2016-05-05", "News": "Supported byMemo From GibraltarGIBRALTAR \u2014 A referendum in June over Britain\u2019s membership in the European Union has generated an intense debate, with recent opinion polls suggesting the outcome is too close to call.But in Gibraltar, a British territory at the tip of the Iberian Peninsula, nobody seems to question European Union membership. Only a handful of people attended a recent rally by anti-union campaigners visiting from London. The only badge worn by residents here bears a simple and clear message: \u201cI\u2019m in.\u201dIf anything, the referendum has helped unite Gibraltar\u2019s political parties and 33,000 inhabitants around the fear that this unique place \u2014 a British low-tax jurisdiction bordering Spain and within sight of North Africa \u2014 could face more uncertainty than the rest of Britain should voters choose to leave the European Union, or \u201cBrexit\u201d as Britain\u2019s possible exit has been nicknamed.Jos\u00e9 Manuel Garc\u00eda-Margallo, Spain\u2019s foreign minister, said in March that if Britain left the union, Spain would require \u201cco-sovereignty\u201d with Britain for maintaining Gibraltar\u2019s access to the European Union market. In practice that would require flying the Spanish flag on the Rock, the dominant feature of this promontory of 2.6 square miles.Gibraltar stands as a case where the European Union, for all its shortcomings, has acted as something of a salve for a lingering dispute over territorial sovereignty between two members. Removing it runs the risk of reviving old conflicts.Britain will hold a referendum on Thursday on whether to leave the European Union, a decision nicknamed \u201cBrexit.\u201dFears of even greater disruption are widely shared among the 10,000 workers who commute daily to Gibraltar from nearby Spanish towns, an economically depressed area collectively known as the Campo de Gibraltar that is home to 267,000 people.Some of Gibraltar\u2019s concerns about the referendum have to do with how Gibraltar entered the European trade bloc in the first place.When Britain joined the European common market in 1973, a precursor to the union, Gibraltar negotiated a special deal reflecting its isolation and precarious situation.Four years earlier, in 1969, the dictatorship of Francisco Franco that ruled Spain closed the border with Gibraltar, leaving Gibraltar reliant on supplies and funding from Britain \u2014 similar to the Berlin airlift the United States conducted during the Cold War, said Fabian Picardo, the chief minister of Gibraltar.The result was that Gibraltar was granted something of a hybrid European membership. As a free port, it was excluded from Europe\u2019s customs union, allowing it to build up its trading and services activities on advantageous transit and taxation terms.Once Spain returned to democracy and fully reopened the border in 1985, Gibraltar\u2019s economy gained. In recent years, it has been a standout example of economic growth in southern Europe, even withstanding the euro debt crisis. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to thank Franco for something,\u201d Mr. Picardo joked.Britain secured control of Gibraltar in the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. To this day, the British government handles Gibraltar\u2019s defense and international relations, while Gibraltar\u2019s government has significant autonomy over trade and industry issues, as well as the ability to set its own tax rates, including a 10 percent corporate tax that is half that of Britain\u2019s.Miguel Ferre, the Spanish secretary of state for budgetary issues, said in an interview in April with ABC, a Spanish newspaper, that \u201cthe goal is that there is no territory left that can be considered fiscally opaque, in particular Gibraltar.\u201dGibraltar, however, says that it developed financial services, as well as a big online gambling sector, thanks to fiscal incentives similar to those used by Ireland and some other European countries.Gibraltar\u2019s location, at the entrance of the Mediterranean Sea, has also made it an obvious hub for bunkering \u2014 where ships avoid docking costs and instead refuel and change crews off Gibraltar\u2019s coast.Four-wheel-drive vehicles made by Toyota that are used by the United Nations and other nongovernmental organizations in Africa travel through Gibraltar to be customized, without entering the European Union and having to comply with European regulations.\u201cGibraltar has a unique status within the European Union,\u201d said John Isola, the vice president of the Gibraltar Chamber of Commerce. \u201cOur whole economic model is based on the sales pitch that you can take advantage of low tax and an Anglo-Saxon legal system and then sell services to European countries.\u201dThat marketing pitch would suffer should Britain leave the union. Gemma Vasquez, a corporate lawyer who is coordinating the pro-union campaign Gibraltar Stronger in Europe, said investors were already growing wary.\u201cWe are drafting clauses into contracts to say that, if Brexit would happen, it would be an element of force majeure,\u201d she said, which would limit investors\u2019 liabilities and obligations should Britain leave the union.Gibraltar\u2019s membership in the union, Mr. Picardo argued, has protected it from Spain\u2019s conservative government by ensuring that Europe opposes any sanctions that would violate its treaty obligations.But, he said, \u201cif we denuded ourselves of the protection of the treaties, it really would be down to, \u2018Who is in charge in Madrid?\u2019 \u201dYet, should Spain squeeze Gibraltar, it would also significantly hurt Spaniards like Miguel Valencia, 51, who crosses from the border town of La L\u00ednea de la Concepci\u00f3n every day to work for a Gibraltar beverage distributor.Mr. Valencia said he had recently been retraining as an electrician and had done some odd jobs in Spain \u201cjust in case I lose this job and really need to find work in Spain.\u201dMr. Valencia said that his father had once worked for the same company in Gibraltar, but that he lost his job in 1969, when Franco\u2019s government pressed Spanish sovereignty claims and closed the border.\u201cIt was a major blow, especially since my father was our family\u2019s only breadwinner,\u201d Mr. Valencia said. \u201cIf that happened again, when you look at Spain\u2019s labor situation now, it could be even harder to find another job than it already was for him then.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Austin Beat Uber", "Date": "2016-05-12", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorAustin, Tex. \u2014 ON Monday morning, ride-sharing customers in America\u2019s 11th-largest city awoke to a disconcerting message on their phones: \u201cUber not currently available in Austin.\u201dHaving lost a referendum over whether they would be regulated by the local government, the ride-sharing companies Uber and Lyft followed through on their threat to effectively fire 10,000 drivers and strand thousands of customers who had come to rely on them for transportation in this hot, spread-out, car-centric city.In the weeks leading up to the vote, the companies spent nearly $9 million, one of the largest amounts ever spent on an Austin election. And yet by making this an all-or-nothing referendum, Uber and Lyft made it about much more than, well, Uber and Lyft. It became a referendum on who is in the driver\u2019s seat (pun intended) when it comes to the public weal: new-economy powerhouses out to \u201cdisrupt\u201d society for fun and profit, or the people they\u2019re seeking to disrupt. In Austin, it wasn\u2019t even close.Uber and Lyft arrived in the Texas capital in 2014, and it probably seemed like a perfect fit. The metro area has more than two million people and attracts 20 million visitors a year, many to its two huge music festivals. There are lots of young people and a strong tech economy that would flock to ride sharing. But Austin probably also looked like a pushover, as a city \u2014 even now it retains a certain sleepiness, a vestige of its provincial college-town past, before anyone thought it even necessary to remind us to \u201ckeep Austin weird.\u201dThe companies certainly made a splash. The celebrity chef Paul Qui hitched the first ride, and both Uber and Lyft gave free rides for two glorious weeks. The city has too few cabs, and with several college campuses and the endless blocks of bars along Sixth Street, Uber and Lyft seemed to fit right in.But what they failed to appreciate was that Austin\u2019s long and storied counterculture wasn\u2019t just a marketing pose. Thirty years ago, the city became an oxbow in the river of American culture, rejecting the Reagan era\u2019s go-go \u201980s and embracing rebel musicians and as much weed and as little hard work as possible. Punk rock found a home here, as did Richard Linklater, who encapsulated the era in his classic 1991 movie \u201cSlacker.\u201dA new culture came along in the 1990s, as tech companies tried to harness the brain power coming out of the local colleges. New sections of the city sprang up, threatening the familiar, worn fabric of old Austin. But since 1992, locals, including young tech workers, repeatedly dealt \u201cnew Austin\u201d bone-crushing defeats in rejecting developments that would threaten the endangered Barton Springs salamander.That spirit continues today, even if most of the country thinks of Austin through the corporatized lens that is the South by Southwest festival. Locals know different. We are obsessed with our city\u2019s identity and sense of community, and we are particularly wary of outsiders who come in promising to change us. That\u2019s not because we don\u2019t like outsiders, mind you. But as a rebellious patch of blue in a deep-crimson state, we learned a long time ago that there are people who are eager to change who we are, and not for our benefit.And here is where Uber and Lyft made their first mistake. A collision of communitarian social activism with Ayn Rand-style technology disruption was probably inevitable. \u201cWrong fight. Wrong time. Wrong town,\u201d said Ron Marks, an alum of the old punk rock scene who had a role in \u201cSlacker.\u201dTo be clear: The city never told Uber and Lyft to leave. But it did insist that they play by our rules and have drivers be fingerprinted, just like cabbies \u2014 particularly after the police investigated at least seven alleged sexual assaults by ride-share drivers in 2015. Instead, the companies responded by helping to put Proposition 1 on the ballot: They would be absolutely exempt from fingerprinting by the city. Period.That was the second mistake. They arrogantly confused a convenience for a few as a necessity for the many. Sure, over-served music fans and run-of-the-mill drunks got home safe and sound. Hipster techies from New York and San Francisco jetted in, summoned \u201ctheir\u201d drivers and jetted back out.Uber and Lyft have claimed they will reduce the nation\u2019s traffic, but in Austin they just added to the aggravation. \u201cTheir drivers stop on the road, no matter where they are, at any time, to pick up people,\u201d fumed my friend Laura Bettor, a psychologist. \u201cAustin already has an anxiety problem about traffic.\u201dThe ultimatum was Uber and Lyft\u2019s third and fatal mistake. We don\u2019t take kindly to threats. Right before the election they announced that if they didn\u2019t get their way they would maroon all the customers and leave. As my friend Mark Seiler said, \u201cThat just brought out my inner gorilla.\u201dWill the Battle of Austin become a model for other cities looking to regulate ride-sharing companies? Maybe. What it does show, though, is that Uber and Lyft will have a harder time bullying cities with strong local identities, places where convenience is not the same as necessity, especially when the price is selling out a large chunk of public control.If nothing else, folks in Austin are feeling pretty good about themselves this week. We may be slackers, but we\u2019re not pushovers.Richard Parker is the author of \u201cLone Star Nation: How Texas Will Transform America.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Get Americans Moving Again", "Date": "2016-05-20", "News": "Supported byWALT WHITMAN\u2019S beautiful \u201cSong of the Open Road,\u201d begins, \u201cAfoot and light-hearted I take to the open road, / Healthy, free, the world before me, / The long brown path before me leading wherever I choose.\u201dThat could have been my grandfather\u2019s anthem. He grew up in Illinois, moved to New Mexico, then back to Illinois and out to California. When his kids left home, he got rid of his permanent physical address entirely and lived with my grandmother in a trailer they towed around the country.I inherited my grandfather\u2019s wanderlust, albeit in a strain that\u2019s more Kerouac than Whitman. Since growing up in Seattle I have moved between states or countries 10 times as a musician and academic. Ask \u201cWhere do you consider home?\u201d and I will have to check my driver\u2019s license.So who is the outlier \u2014 me or my grandfather? You might think he was. People in the old days stayed put, while folks today are less rooted, right? Wrong.Through census data, we know that Americans are less geographically mobile today than at any point since 1948. Other scholarship suggests that the decline stretches back further. This might help explain why our country is having such a hard time getting out of its national funk.Mobility is more than just a metaphor for getting ahead. In America, it has been a solution to economic and social barriers. If you descended from immigrants, I\u2019m betting your ancestors didn\u2019t come to this country for the fine cuisine. More likely they came in search of the opportunity to work hard and get ahead.Even for those already here, migration has long been seen as a key to self-improvement. As Horace Greeley so famously advised in 1865: \u201cGo west, young man, and grow up with the country.\u201d (What preceded that advice was almost as interesting: \u201cWashington is not a place to live in. The rents are high, the food is bad, the dust is disgusting and the morals are deplorable.\u201d)What explains the decrease in American mobility? It isn\u2019t simply an aging population. The mobility decline since the Great Recession has actually been the most pronounced among millennials. As the first rungs of the economic ladder became more slippery, young adults began to delay major steps into adulthood and became less likely to relocate for college or careers.How do we solve the immobility problem? We can start by reshaping education to prepare people to move where good jobs are found. This entails reviving vocational and technical training in high schools. State and local governments could experiment with trade school vouchers, or offer tax credits to businesses that support apprenticeships. But culture will have a larger impact than policy: We need to get over the elitist id\u00e9e fixe that a bachelor\u2019s degree is for everyone, and get serious about training people for important, interesting, dignified work that is difficult to outsource.Second, we should reform place-based welfare programs to reduce the incentive to stay put. The social safety net should be designed to promote mobility and earned success, not to anchor people within struggling communities or to make full-time work harder to find. Additionally, it would not be particularly expensive to fund experimental programs to provide relocation allowances.Finally, we need leaders who extol the American spirit of courage, adventure, optimism and the willingness to break from the moribund past. Instead of vowing to insulate Americans from economic trends, our leaders should encourage the traditional ruggedness that Alexis de Tocqueville found here in the 19th century. In 1835, he observed with admiration that Americans did not view \u201cinstability\u201d as a disaster to be feared; rather, it was welcomed and seen as the source of \u201cnothing \u2026 but wonders.\u201d In our society, he wrote, change is understood as the \u201cnatural state of man.\u201dMuch of today\u2019s political populism on both left and right feeds on the forlorn stagnation of people at the bottom of the American economy. But American decline doesn\u2019t need apologists; it needs solutions. One of those solutions is to help people get out of Dodge. And over to Concord or Fargo.Arthur C.

{"Headline": "Philippine Election Decends Into Sideshow Amid Serious Issues", "Date": "2016-05-07", "News": "Supported bySUBIC BAY, the Philippines \u2014 Rodrigo Duterte, the outspoken mayor of Davao City and the front-runner in the Philippines\u2019 presidential election, told voters recently that he would settle territorial disputes in the South China Sea by taking on the Chinese Navy on a Jet Ski.The candidate\u2019s bravado worries some voters. \u201cIf Duterte wins, it will be frightening,\u201d said Joyce Asilo, 30, a Manila resident who was visiting Subic Bay, a former American base. \u201cHe could start a war with China. He\u2019s very inconsistent in what he says.\u201dThe country\u2019s relationship with China is one of the issues facing voters in the Philippines on Monday, when they will elect hundreds of government officials \u2014 from president to mayors \u2014 to address a raft of problems that threaten to derail the Philippine economy, one of the fastest growing in Asia. But the presidential race has descended into a series of off-color jokes, threats, name-calling and allegations about hidden bank accounts.\u201cI don\u2019t know what to believe,\u201d said Carla Yanga, a 25-year-old resident of Pasig, on the outskirts of Manila. \u201cI like Roxas, but my parents are voting for Duterte. I don\u2019t know.\u201dThe talk of scandals, allegations and ferocious social media posts has overshadowed the challenges facing the country. Despite strong economic growth and resurgent foreign investment, the Philippines still has high levels of poverty and unemployment, crumbling infrastructure, and a raging war in the southern part of the country against insurgents and kidnap-for-ransom gangs.The new government must also grapple with territorial claims by China in the South China Sea, in an area that includes much of the Philippines\u2019 200-mile exclusive economic zone along its western coastline. Mr. Aquino, who cannot run again because of term limits, has responded by challenging China\u2019s claims in a United Nations arbitration court and by making a deal with the United States that would increase the number of American ships and aircraft operating in the Philippines.Mr. Aquino has refused to talk directly to China about the issue and has insisted that multilateral forums, like the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, deal with the matter so the claimants can present a united front against China.The main presidential candidates support Philippine claims in the South China Sea and back the case against China at the international court, but Mr. Binay and Mr. Duterte also support holding direct talks with China. None of the candidates are calling for the cancellation of the military deal with the United States, though some have called for it to be re-examined.Mr. Bower argued that such an approach would weaken the claims of other nations in the region and increase the likelihood of conflict. He said the international court was the best forum for resolving competing claims.\u201cIf the decision is released and a new administration ignores it to pursue the bilateral negotiations that China has demanded all along, it decreases the incentive for other small nations to turn to international law and arbitration,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs other avenues for fair resolution of disputes are shut, states will increasingly turn to military buildup in order to defend their interests with force.\u201dOthers have a more optimistic view. Julio S. Amador, the deputy director general of the Foreign Service Institute in Manila, a government-run think tank, said none of the candidates had indicated that they would abandon the international arbitration case.\u201cI do believe that the presidency will change whoever is elected, and his or her foreign policy will be more nuanced than the general statements that were let loose during the campaign,\u201d Mr. Amador said. \u201cAfter all, during elections in the Philippines, it\u2019s common that the intended audience is internal.\u201dGregory Poling, the director of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, which tracks developments in the South China Sea, said support for international arbitration and the military deal with the United States was unlikely to change.\u201cNo matter who is elected, the new president isn\u2019t going to be able to engineer any sharp policy turns on the South China Sea,\u201d Mr. Poling said. \u201cIt is simply too prominent an issue with the electorate.\u201dHe added, however, that he was concerned about comments Mr. Duterte had made about the reliability of the alliance with the United States. It \u201ccould affect his decision making in any future crisis with Beijing, or his willingness to seek an eventual accommodation, if he assumes the United States doesn\u2019t really have the Philippines\u2019 back,\u201d Mr. Poling said.In Subic Bay, less than 200 miles from a shoal claimed by the Philippines but occupied by China, a taxi driver, Pete Simpao, seemed perplexed when asked about the South China Sea dispute.\u201cI don\u2019t know about that,\u201d Mr. Simpao, 74, said. \u201cWe need to control the drugs, the killings, the rapes, the corruption. I have a kid in Manila, and I\u2019m always worried about the crime there. I\u2019m for Duterte.\u201dAdvertisement"}

This is not a reality show. This is a contest for the presidency of the United States.\u201dThe president suggested that Mr. Trump\u2019s statements and proposals would wither under \u201cexacting standards and genuine scrutiny,\u201d saying that particular attention must be paid to campaign promises made by Mr. Trump \u2014 or any other candidate \u2014 on issues like the budget, the economy and foreign policy.\u201cYou know, if they take a position on international issues that could threaten war or has the potential of upending our critical relationships with other countries or would potentially break the financial system, that needs to be reported on,\u201d Mr. Obama said.\u201cWhat I\u2019m concerned about is the degree to which reporting and information starts emphasizing the spectacle and the circus,\u201d he added, \u201cbecause that\u2019s not something we can afford.\u201dTaking questions from reporters at the White House for the first time since Mr. Trump became the presumptive nominee on Tuesday, the president chided the news media over its coverage of the campaign, saying it had not yet focused on serious issues.\u201cOne thing that I\u2019m going to really be looking for over the next six months is that the American people are effectively informed about where candidates stand on the issues, what they believe, making sure that their numbers add up, making sure that their policies have been vetted and that candidates are held to what they\u2019ve said in the past,\u201d Mr. Obama said.The comments, though restrained in tone, were a preview of what aides say will be a vigorous presence by Mr. Obama in the general election. Mr. Trump and Mr. Obama have a tense history that includes Mr. Trump\u2019s leading role in the \u201cbirther\u201d movement, which falsely suggested that the president was not born in the United States.Mr. Obama has so far held back from entering the fray on the Democratic side, in part because of the continuing contest between Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders. Asked whether it was time for Mr. Sanders to concede, the president once again demurred.He said both Democratic candidates agreed on issues like raising the minimum wage, investing in infrastructure, improving the immigration system, using the military prudently and providing health care to all Americans.\u201cLet\u2019s let the process play itself out,\u201d he said.But Mr. Obama seems increasingly impatient to weigh in on the Republican side, amid a contest in which millions of voters have rejected more than a dozen traditional candidates in favor of a hotel mogul and former reality TV star.The president\u2019s comments came during what had been billed as a statement on the economy and financial corruption. But after making his remarks on those topics, the president took questions from reporters, knowing that he would undoubtedly be asked about Mr. Trump.He said Republican voters must now confront the choice they have made.\u201cTheir standard-bearer at the moment is Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cRepublican voters are going to have to make a decision about whether this is the guy who speaks for them and represents their values.\u201dIn particular, he added, \u201cRepublican women, voters, are going to have to decide, \u2018Is that the guy I feel comfortable with representing me and what I care about?\u2019 \u201dHe also suggested that reporters covering the campaign \u2014 including some sitting in the room \u2014 had not done enough to expose the weaknesses in Mr. Trump\u2019s policies.\u201cHe has a long record that needs to be examined,\u201d the president said, adding that \u201cthe American people, they\u2019ve got good judgment, they\u2019ve got good instincts, as long as they get good information.\u201d\u201cHe has beaten the odds; he\u2019s surprised everybody,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cI think we all make a mistake when we don\u2019t take him seriously.\u201dThe vice president said that Mr. Trump could hire some \u201creally significant\u201d advisers and propose policies that \u201cwould make people think, \u2018Well, maybe this guy can actually be president.\u2019 \u201dMr. Obama, like many of his predecessors, has often criticized the news media for focusing on frivolous subjects that produce good images instead of the more weighty subjects that are central to governing.As if on cue, a television reporter in the briefing room asked the president about a Twitter post by Mr. Trump in which he professed his love of Hispanics and was pictured eating a taco bowl. Mr. Obama seemed amused, if not surprised, by the question.\u201cI have no thoughts on Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets,\u201d the president said bluntly. \u201cAs a general rule, I don\u2019t pay attention to Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets.\u201dJulie Hirschfeld Davis contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Narendra Modi and India\u2019s Dashed Economic Hopes", "Date": "2016-05-27", "News": "Supported byNEW DELHI \u2014 May is a month of haunting heat in this city. The temperature hovers over 100 degrees. There are dust storms and, despite the white skies, the trees are heavy with flower. The apocalyptic climate serves as a fitting backdrop to political upheaval.Two summers ago I witnessed one: After a long campaign, Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., won the first outright majority in India\u2019s Parliament since 1984. It had come at the end of 10 years of Congress Party rule, the last five of which were marred by corruption and an economy that left many people frustrated. I have followed campaigns since I was a child \u2014 my mother is a journalist \u2014 and Mr. Modi\u2019s election was one of the most hopeful of my lifetime.What Mr. Modi understood was that India\u2019s conception of itself had changed. It was not yet a middle-class country, but it had begun to think of itself as one. When I first heard Mr. Modi speak in September 2013, what surprised me most was the change in the average voter. A new kind of person had emerged, young and energetic, representing the happy conjunction of denim, phone and television. For many people I spoke to these were their prized possessions. (They didn\u2019t have cars or houses.) Their restlessness revealed a hunger and they had none of the fatalism of old India.Mr. Modi was the first Indian politician to speak seriously of prosperity. In a country with a socialist past whose first prime minister is said to have described profit as \u201ca dirty word,\u201d Mr. Modi made making money sexy. He has a way of explaining complex economic ideas in direct terms. \u201cI don\u2019t want my cotton grower to wander from place to place, trying to sell his cotton,\u201d he said in an address to the Sri Ram College of Commerce in 2013. \u201cI have a \u2018five F\u2019 formula: farm to fiber, fiber to fabric, fabric to fashion, fashion to foreign.\u201dIt was revolutionary. No candidate for prime minister since economic liberalization began in 1991 had bothered to explain the global economy to the average Indian voter, to connect the dots in its supply chain, to speak of its possibilities. The Congress Party, famous for its \u201creforms by stealth,\u201d had made liberalization seem like something done at the expense of the poor. Mr. Modi sold it as essential to the fight against poverty. The response was electrifying.Two years later, India is still waiting to turn a corner. At times it can feel close, but the socialist mind-set still has an outsized influence.What worries me is not the state of the economy, or the slow pace of reform. It\u2019s not the government\u2019s failure to privatize large public companies like Air India, even though Mr. Modi has said that \u201cgovernment has no business to be in business.\u201d It\u2019s not that the \u201cretroactive tax,\u201d which allows the government to collect back capital gains taxes and has been used to hound foreign companies, remains in place, belying the B.J.P.\u2019s promise of welcoming foreign investment. It\u2019s not that major pieces of legislation reforming the economy now seem permanently stuck. It\u2019s not that job growth is slower than it should be.My deeper fear is that Mr. Modi lacks a free-marketer\u2019s natural suspicion of the state. He seems wedded to the third-way politics he developed in Gujarat State, where he was chief minister from 2001 to 2014, in which the machinery and assets of an overburdened socialist state are left intact, but the bureaucracy is cleansed of inefficiency and corruption. Not surprisingly, all that has been achieved in his first two years in office is clean government at the top, while the rest remains more or less unchanged.A young businesswoman who supports the prime minister put it well. \u201cHe goes to the West and sees prosperity in terms of jobs and physical infrastructure, which he is trying to emulate,\u201d she wrote to me in an email. \u201cBut he fails to see the invisible underpinnings of Western civilization, which are political and economic liberty.\u201dMr. Modi\u2019s election unleashed passions that only a roaring economy can contain. As I traveled through India recently, from Varanasi to Mumbai to Delhi, I was moved by how much people still trust the prime minister. When I asked them what happened to the \u201cgood days\u201d he had promised, they invariably replied, \u201cIt will take time.\u201d But I sense an anticipation that could turn sour.Aatish Taseer is the author, most recently, of the novel \u201cThe Way Things Were\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

Originally a long farmhouse with living quarters on the top floor and stables below, it now has two large bedrooms and one bathroom, a living room with a balcony, and two wood-burning stoves. Around the cottage, there are old stables and barns, now used for storing garden equipment.The grounds have several cultivated garden areas surrounded by stone walls, featuring azaleas, hybrid rhododendrons, fruit trees and Japanese maple trees. There are two greenhouses and separate workshops. A boat house has been converted into an office, with a wood-burning stove and French doors leading to a deck and a dock. A castellated bridge leads to the island, which is deserted except for a contemporary decorative turret.The furniture and art on the property are not part of the asking price, but select pieces are available for sale, including furniture dating to the 17th century, the owner said. Nineteen acres of pasture adjacent to the property are also available for sale, although the land is currently rented to a sheep farmer, according to the owner.The nearest village, Aberdovey, is about a mile and a half away and has a post office, grocery stores, pubs and restaurants. Buses passing the house provide connections to Aberdovey and to local towns. The nearest international airports are Manchester and Birmingham, which are both about two and a half hours away by car or train. The train trip to London is about four and a half hours.MARKET OVERVIEWWales is a much different market from the rest of Britain, according to agents. Sales activity and pricing tend to be steadier than in the roller-coaster markets of London and other areas.\u201cWe haven\u2019t had the highs, so we probably won\u2019t see the lows,\u201d said Anthony Clay, a partner with Knight Frank, the real estate company.Over all, prices for large country homes in rural Wales are often a fraction of the price of properties closer to London. But they are also hard to find. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a massive turnover,\u201d Ms. Hutchinson-Smith said. Many of the bigger estates in rural Wales are passed from generation to generation and rarely come on the market, she said.\u201cFor something exceptional, the market is still very good,\u201d she said. \u201cThe really special ones don\u2019t tend to be sold very often.\u201dIn recent months, the higher-priced homes have been selling more than the lower range of the market, according to Julie Elliott, an associate in the Swansea office of Fine & Country, the real estate company. \u201cA lot of buyers are second-home buyers,\u201d she said.Many were buying before a new Stamp Duty increase on second homes went into effect in April, she says. \u201cNow it will probably slow down slightly,\u201d Ms. Elliott said.WHO BUYS IN WALESWales doesn\u2019t attract the wealthy foreign buyers found in many areas of Britain, agents said. It\u2019s too remote for many international buyers, who \u201clike to be in range of Heathrow,\u201d the London airport, Mr. Clay said.Around the cities, investors are active buying homes to lease. But they are less interested in the rural and coastal areas. Anything beyond Cardiff in southern Wales and Bristol in southwest England is \u201cjust harder work\u201d to sell, Mr. Clay said.A majority of the buyers in the coastal and rural areas are looking for a second home or a place to retire, agents say. Wales\u2019s beautiful scenery and wildlife also attract hikers, bird watchers, hunters, fishing enthusiasts and sailors.\u201cA lot of buyers are coming home to Wales,\u201d Ms. Elliott said. They left and now they are returning to either buy a second home or relocate to Wales, she said. \u201cPeople are buying second homes who probably will end up living in them.\u201dBUYING BASICSWales follows the same basic buying procedures as the rest of Britain, agents said. There are no restrictions on foreign purchases. Mortgages are generally available. Typically buyers search for property without an agent and then hire a lawyer to complete the transaction, agents said.WEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCYEnglish, Welsh; British pound (1 pound = $1.46)TAXES AND FEESBritain charges a Stamp Duty ranging from 2 percent to 12 percent on properties of more than 125,000 pounds, or around $182,500, depending on the purchase price. In April, a new law went into effect charging an extra 3 percent for a home that is not a primary residence. Agent commissions are typically 1.5 percent of the purchase price, paid by the seller. Annual property taxes on this estate are about $8,000, according to the owner.CONTACTAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Seeking Economic Jolt, Sleepy Hollow Embraces Development", "Date": "2016-05-18", "News": "Supported bySLEEPY HOLLOW, N.Y. \u2014 It would seem ripe for an eruption of not-in-my-backyard furor \u2014 an enormous development along the water.But instead, many in this corner of Westchester County welcome the project, believing it will provide the economic adrenaline that has long been needed, while resurrecting a long derelict industrial site that reflected the unraveling of manufacturing in the region.The site \u2014 nearly 100 acres along the Hudson River here where General Motors once assembled 11 million cars \u2014 has had a protracted gestation period. On Wednesday, however, ground finally broke on the $1 billion development, which will feature 1,177 units of housing, more than 200,000 square feet of commercial space and a 140-room hotel.The ambitious plans are helping heal the wounds caused by the closing of the plant in 1996, which represented such a psychic shift for the village that officials changed its name \u2014 to Sleepy Hollow from North Tarrytown.The name change evoked Washington Irving\u2019s tale of \u201cThe Legend of Sleepy Hollow,\u201d which has as its backdrop the village\u2019s Old Dutch Church and churchyard. But the new moniker also signaled a changing economy, one based not on industry, but on history, the river \u2014 and housing.\u201cPeople are happy that it\u2019s finally happening,\u201d the village mayor, Ken Wray, a Democrat, said of the start of construction. \u201cWe\u2019ve been looking at this empty slab for 20 years now. Plans and approvals are one thing, but it\u2019s not the same as seeing someone out there with a jackhammer.\u201dThe complex is expected to increase the population by a quarter and add an estimated 225 students to the school district. It could also lead to gentrification, especially along a stretch where low-rent housing sits close to the former General Motors site.But residents and local officials, who have suffered through years of anemic tax revenue, are eager for the property to generate income. At one time, G.M. accounted for half of all tax revenue in the village. That fell to less than 5 percent after the company negotiated a deal in the 1980s that was designed to keep the plant in operation.Right before G.M. sold the property to a development team in 2014, Sleepy Hollow, which has an annual budget of $21 million, received only $140,000 a year in taxes from the site. (After the plant closed, officials were forced to raise property taxes 20 percent in a single year.)Now, with the site still a blank slate, tax revenue has already jumped to nearly $800,000 a year. That has enabled the village government to cut property taxes.The new open space will effectively expand the county park by 40 percent. \u201cKingsland Point Park will flow seamlessly into the park space for this development,\u201d said Amy Kacala, a senior planner at Scenic Hudson. \u201cThat\u2019s very exciting.\u201dIn addition, local officials years ago had agreed on a plan that required any developer to give a large chunk of land to the village. Because Metro-North Railroad train tracks cross over the site, the most valuable land \u2014 from a developer\u2019s perspective \u2014 is on the west side of the tracks along the river, with its majestic views.About 30 acres of land on the east side of the railroad tracks has already been transferred to the village, which plans to build a new Department of Public Works building, along with a baseball diamond, an all-purpose athletic field and a recreation center.Under the development agreement, SunCal and Diversified Realty Advisors have committed to paying the village $11.5 million to help finance those amenities.\u201cMy partners outvoted me and we terminated the contract,\u201d Jonathan D. Stein, a former partner in Roseland, said.But Mr. Stein remained bullish about the site. Now a managing partner of Diversified Realty Advisors, he teamed up with SunCal, and the two firms together bought the property from G.M. for $39.5 million.Over the next year, the developers will prepare the site for construction by ripping out acres of concrete foundation \u2014 all that remained after G.M. demolished its plant \u2014 and laying down utility lines.By contrast, the portion of the site that overlooks the rugged Hudson Highlands, where a lighthouse stands just offshore, was designed in a looser style, with native plantings and winding paths.\u201cAs you turn the corner and pass the lighthouse, you see the Hudson River Valley and the pristine, undulating landscape in the distance,\u201d said Mr. Tinson, whose firm is also the project\u2019s master planner. \u201cThe parkland on our site becomes more organic and natural.\u201dUnlike some gated communities that have risen on the river, Edge-on-Hudson is intended to invite people to use the parkland, including a sandy beach for launching kayaks, and to patronize the shops and restaurants.That is reassuring to Mr. Wray, the mayor. But he still wonders about the development\u2019s repercussions on the village, where annual household incomes range from below the poverty line to over $1 million. (About 60 units in Edge-on-Hudson, or about 5 percent of the total, will be set aside for affordable housing.)\u201cWe\u2019re rightfully proud of who we are as a village and the diversity we have,\u201d said Mr. Wray, who heads a foundation in New York City that promotes affordable housing. \u201cI think gentrification will definitely happen, but the challenge of village government will be to maintain that diversity.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Government Must Play a Role Again in Job Creation", "Date": "2016-05-10", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneAmerica has been here before.Notably, the jobs of the new industrial economy were generally more productive and better paid than the jobs it left behind.For politicians on the campaign trail and in Washington struggling to come up with a credible strategy to improve the fortunes of America\u2019s understandably angry working class, that shift poses an unanswered question: Where will new, better jobs come from?Epochal transformations like these are complicated. They are difficult to understand, let alone manage, and are driven not only by domestic forces but also by global dynamics over which American politicians have limited control. During much of the 19th and 20th centuries, government at multiple levels played an essential role in shaping the nation\u2019s transition from farms and small towns to cities and factories. It could do so again. What has stopped it is not the lack of practical ideas but the encrusted ideological opposition to government activism of any kind.The construction jobs once fueled by the housing bubble that burst so violently in 2008 are unlikely to return anytime soon. The jobs picking up the slack today are in retail sales or cleaning buildings, paying little more than $26,000 a year; they are cashier positions paying $21,000, or food-prep jobs paying less than $20,000.Though the decline of well-paid working class jobs is often portrayed as the inevitable consequence of globalization and technological change, it is in large part the result of a failure of government.An observation has recently popped up in the academic debate \u2014 in books such as \u201cConcrete Economics\u201d (Harvard Business Review Press) by J. Bradford DeLong and Stephen Cohen, and in \u201cAmerican Amnesia\u201d (Simon and Schuster) by Jacob S. Hacker and Paul Pierson. They point out that for all our love of rugged individualism, government played a large and underappreciated role in reshaping the American economy before \u2014 and it could do so again.Start with high tariffs against imports imposed from the time of Alexander Hamilton, to help foster America\u2019s industrial development. Then huge grants of land to build railways in the 19th century not only opened up the West, they vastly increased productivity in agriculture. From catalog retailing to centralized meatpacking, the railways enabled innovations that spawned entire industries.The government also played a crucial role on the other side of this transformation: bolstering workers\u2019 human capital. From the Land-Grant College Act of 1862, which created a network of public universities, to the offer in the G.I. Bill of Rights to pay for the college education of veterans returning from World War II, the federal government invested aggressively in higher education.In the early decades of the 20th century, local governments across the country poured money and resources into an impressive expansion of secondary education. Between 1910 and 1940, the high school graduation rate of American 18-year-olds increased to 50 percent from 9 percent.Finally, the government directly created jobs \u2014 whether in the burst of infrastructure investment in the 1930s that gave us the Hoover Dam, among other huge projects, or the tenfold increase in federal spending from 1939 to 1945 as the government built up the military-industrial complex to fight Germany and Japan.Why American politics turned against this successful model of pragmatic policy-making remains controversial. Perhaps it was the increasing footprint of money in politics, which has given more clout to corporate interests lobbying for smaller government and lower taxes. Maybe desegregation led to increasing distrust in government by white voters. Perhaps it was the combination of a recession and high inflation of the 1970s, which discredited interventionist government policies.In any event, there is much the government could do.Start with investment in the nation\u2019s crumbling infrastructure: Lawrence Summers, once the top economic adviser to President Obama, never tires of repeating that this not only is urgently needed but is almost guaranteed to be profitable, given rock-bottom interest rates. While it might not increase employment by tens of millions, as these jobs tend to require high skills, even a relatively small number of construction jobs would provide a needed economic boost.Then there are health care and education, critical sectors that are growing as a share of the economy and will provide many of the jobs of our future. For both good and ill, they are already deeply entwined with the government.To be sure, that raises additional challenges: Republican governors refusing to expand Medicaid, for example. But it also offers an opportunity for the government to shape, through its power as a regulator and a contractor of private services, the kinds of jobs these industries will offer.Why not insist that home health aides acquire a certain set of skills and be paid accordingly?\u201cThe huge issue going forward is, are we going to care for the elderly with a bunch of minimum-wage workers or people with a better certification offering better care for better pay?\u201d asked Lawrence F. Katz of Harvard University. \u201cThere is a potential win-win situation where workers and patients end up in better shape.\u201dThe good news is that the United States may have the best opportunity in decades to overcome its anti-government political biases. Donald J. Trump, the admittedly unusual Republican standard-bearer, has publicly called for extensive public investment in infrastructure. More orthodox Republicans, like the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, are also expressing interest in using government levers to tackle the lack of prospects for so many American workers.There are several levers available. The federal government could try to rebuild a quality bureaucracy, rather than subcontract so much of its work to expensive consultants and bottom-end contractors that employ the cheapest workers available.So what\u2019s holding us back? The loss of a vision, once shared across much of the ideological spectrum, of what government can accomplish, when it is allowed to do its job.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: The Rise of the \u2018Matchmakers\u2019 of the Digital Economy", "Date": "2016-05-20", "News": "Supported byBook EntryMany of the young giants of the digital economy share a common characteristic. They are platforms that provide valued connections among their participants. The nature of those connections and the value they provide vary widely.Both Google and Facebook \u2013 together approaching $1 trillion in market value \u2014 are in the business of connecting advertisers to consumers, but their platforms and business models are very different.Another trillion-dollar pair, Apple and Microsoft, have followed similarly divergent paths in monetizing their respective platforms: Both own operating systems that connect application developers and users. And \u201cplatform\u201d businesses of various stripes seem to represent a disproportionate share of the market\u2019s hot tech start-ups, like Uber, Airbnb, Pinterest and Snapchat.A surprising number of business books have been published in the last few months that seek to explore the origins and implications of the emergence of the platform paradigm. The great virtue of the best of these, \u201cMatchmakers: The New Economics of Multisided Platforms\u201d (Harvard Business Review) by David S. Evans and Richard Schmalensee, is that it reminds us that there is nothing new about multisided platforms \u2013 which the authors call matchmaker businesses.The \u201cnew economics\u201d mentioned in the subtitle refers to what the authors misleadingly call the \u201cdiscovery\u201d of multisided businesses by fellow economists in 2000. Although the research cited was certainly important in understanding the dynamics of multisided markets, advertising-based media businesses have successfully operated in these environments for literally hundreds of years.An old-world media example quickly makes clear the unusual management challenges of operating multisided-platform businesses. To be successful, newspaper and magazine publishers need to attract both readers and advertisers, who represent the two sides of the platform. In most instances, however, to optimize overall profits, publishers must subsidize one side of the market. Rarely does the price of a subscription cover even the incremental cost of printing and distribution of the publication.This does not reflect a rookie mistake but a nuanced understanding of the tradeoffs between circulation and advertising revenue. If managers ignore the interaction between the different sides of a multisided market in developing pricing strategies, they will inevitably arrive at erroneous conclusions. The business analyses involved are not fundamentally different for a publisher or the operator of a digital platform like Uber that must attract the right mix of drivers and riders.But what has changed in the world to make these models apparently so much more prevalent? \u201cMatchmakers\u201d identifies \u201csix turbocharging technologies\u201d that it claims have \u201cturbocharged the ancient matchmaker model.\u201dSpecifically, the authors argue that the combined impact of improvements in computing power, bandwidth, networking and storage capacity have allowed the establishment of \u201ctwo foundational multisided platforms\u201d that support all the others that have rapidly emerged: Internet service providers (who provide the fixed and mobile connections among platform participants) and operating systems (which provide the common language that allow app developers to achieve mass adoption).History aside, the heart of \u201cMatchmakers\u201d is an entrepreneurial playbook of sorts for \u201cbuilding, igniting and operating matchmakers.\u201d The strongest part of the book is the detailed description of diverse platform business models, both new and old, some of which readers might not have even previously thought of as \u201cmatchmakers.\u201dFor instance, South Florida\u2019s upscale Aventura Mall is really a platform for commerce between retailers and shoppers. To succeed, the developer had to take into account land values, local demographics, nearby alternatives, which retailers and entertainment services to target and what and how to charge them, and the physical design. Similar complexity faced the founders of M-Pesa, a mobile money transfer service in Kenya that in the course of three years counted 42 percent of the adult population as registered users and transformed that economy.The problem with many of the books about the rise of the so-called platform economy is that they are filled with an unbridled optimism about the collective attractiveness of these businesses, particularly in their digital incarnations. Sure, they argue, incumbents will be disrupted, but in their stead will be bigger, stronger competitors in winner-take-all markets.They focus on \u201cnetwork effects,\u201d which can create a virtuous circle \u2013 sometimes called a flywheel effect \u2013 as new users on one side of a platform attract more on another and vice versa. The crucial attribute of network effects businesses is that every new participant increases the value of the network to existing participants.Alex Moazed and Nicholas L. Johnson are the consultants turned authors of \u201cModern Monopolies: What It Takes to Dominate the 21st Century Economy\u201d (St. Martins). Their book promises the same \u201cframeworks and insights we use to help our clients become modern monopolies.\u201d In their telling, the history of \u201cplatform capitalism\u201d appears to have started with eBay, which in part explains the inability of their \u201cframeworks\u201d to deliver on the assurance of market domination.\u201cPlatform Revolution: How Networked Markets Are Transforming the Economy and How to Make Them Work For You\u201d (Norton), another book written by industry consultants \u2014 these mostly with day jobs in academia \u2014 provides an even more expansive vision of the \u201crevolution\u201d wrought by the emergence of network effects as \u201cthe Internet-era source of market power,\u201d which \u201cis likely to strengthen a market\u2019s winner take all tendency.\u201dThe book\u2019s authors \u2014 Geoffrey Parker, Marshall W. Van Alstyne and Sangeet Paul Choudary \u2014 argue that the ascension of platform business models requires a fundamental rethinking of things as diverse as basic business strategy and government regulation. Their wide-ranging vision and predictions are undermined by frequent factual errors. For example, Sony does not own Time Warner movie and television studios, and Netflix does not have strong network effects.Even \u201cMatchmakers,\u201d which offers the most balanced picture of the challenges and opportunities of multisided platforms, plays down the structural fragility faced by all of the \u201cturbocharged\u201d matchmakers described. Mr. Evans and Mr. Schmalensee insist that \u201cnetwork effects power all multisided platforms.\u201d What\u2019s more, according to them, the digital developments recounted \u201chave resulted in a huge increase in the power and reach of these effects.\u201d Neither statement is true.First, plenty of multisided platforms do not have any significant network effects to speak of. A popular TV show attracts both viewers and advertisers, but it is the quality of the programming, not the presence of more advertisers, that keeps the audience coming back. TV and cable broadcasting networks, like most ad-based media businesses, are multisided platforms, but they have negligible network effects. Google, the mightiest exception to the digital fragility rule, is a platform business that does not benefit primarily from network effects but rather from traditional economies of scale.Second, the strength of network effects is often a function of the existence of reinforcing competitive advantages like economies of scale and, notably, customer captivity. The digital economy has undermined both of these barriers to entry by lowering both customer switching costs and the fixed-cost base that drives scale economies.So the Aventura Mall benefits from the long-term leases signed by retailers on the one hand and the fact that local shoppers need to go out of their way to find a comparable experience. Operators of digital malls, by contrast, rarely secure long-term commitments from either advertisers or sellers, and shoppers have multiple alternatives just a click away. And the fixed costs expended to build a traditional mall could easily fund many dozens of digital retail platforms.Even the authors of \u201cModern Monopolies\u201d concede that \u201ca modern monopoly\u2019s dominance\u201d is likely to be short-lived given \u201cthe competitive threat it faces from adjacent competitors and a constant onslaught of new entrants.\u201dAll three books provide useful, and mostly consistent, insights into how to build more resilient and valuable platforms. The diversity of businesses and outcomes described, however, suggest that the differences among platform businesses are far more important than their commonalities. This is at least good news for consumers who will benefit from multiplying innovations that reduce the annoying frictions of everyday life and the consultants who will be kept busy helping managers devise ways to prolong their increasingly tenuous perch as master of a modern monopoly.Jonathan A.

They\u2019ve noticed that, and they\u2019re fuming now. At election time a few politicians (from both parties) pretend to care, pretend to like pork rinds, pretend to be on the working class\u2019s side \u2014 but it\u2019s mostly baloney.I was raised in a working-class union household. I am very lucky to have gotten a good college education and now live in an elite economic bubble, from which I can see both perspectives. For the last 30 years I have been flinching at the disrespect and mistreatment of the working class that I hear and see every day. I have been wondering when they might fight back, and now they are.It\u2019s taken a terrifying form; Donald Trump is just one more in a long line of pretenders. But he\u2019s paying them the respect of saying it simply and mirroring what they feel. Although I would never vote for him, this does make him a more qualified candidate than most.Please stop hearing only elite voices.

When I was a boy early in F.D.R.\u2019s third term we celebrated a holiday then called I Am an American Day.We had our differences back then, but World War II had made us one people. It should not take a war to do that, but it would be hard to imagine such a holiday today, and almost impossible to say what many Americans share in common beyond citizenship and a reverence for money.Donald Trump astutely used our dissonance to gain the Republican nomination, demeaning many of the qualities we claim to value in our elected leadership and also hope to see in our children: decency, honesty, tolerance, respect for others, regard for women.Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers say we\u2019ll see a different Trump after the conventions. Maybe. But his nomination will present an opportunity in this election to decide not only who we want, but also who we are.DAVID KERNISTrumbull, Conn.To the Editor:Nate Cohn says that maybe he underestimated Donald Trump.

Journalism somehow managed to get the Trump phenomenon wrong, wrong, wrong, while writing more and more about Trump, Trump, Trump.Mr. Rutenberg urges journalists to resist the urge to put \u201cratings, clicks and ad sales\u201d above, well, good journalism. I hope The Times takes his advice to heart, but I am not optimistic.Mr. Rutenberg\u2019s article on the home page of the digital edition was accompanied by four (four!) other stories about Donald Trump. It was wall-to-wall Trump for breakfast. If the Fourth Estate is serious about making amends, a good start would be to stop feeding the monster.MISHA RASOVICHLos AngelesTo the Editor:The first few words of this article gave me hope that it would be a thoughtful analysis of the role of the media in the presidential primaries. After the first powerful three words \u2014 \u201cWrong, wrong, wrong\u201d \u2014 I realized that the point of the article was that the media made incorrect predictions. That they did.But there is a more fundamental wrong to be explored. Jim Rutenberg and the rest of the media seem to think that an important part of their role is to make predictions. In my view, predictions are a powerful tool that influences the outcome of elections and works against what we desire in a democracy.The absence of predictions would encourage individuals to vote their consciences. The role of journalists is to draw out from the candidates the truth of their convictions and clarify their implementation plans if they are elected. It is also to confront them when they make misleading or contradictory statements. What is wrong, wrong, wrong is that the media makes predictions.HANAN WATSONNew YorkAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Rift Between Labor and Environmentalists Threatens Democratic Turnout Plan", "Date": "2016-05-16", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Two of the Democratic Party\u2019s most loyal constituencies, labor and environmentalists, are clashing over an effort to raise tens of millions of dollars for an ambitious voter turnout operation aimed at defeating Donald J. Trump in the November election.The rift developed after some in the labor movement, whose cash flow has dwindled and whose political clout has been increasingly imperiled, announced a partnership last week with a wealthy environmentalist, Tom Steyer, to help bankroll a new fund dedicated to electing Democrats.That joint initiative enraged members of the nation\u2019s biggest construction unions, already on edge about the rising influence of climate-change activists. The building-trades unions view Mr. Steyer\u2019s environmental agenda as a threat to the jobs that can be created through infrastructure projects like new gas pipelines.The dispute, laid bare in a pair of blistering letters sent on Monday to Richard L. Trumka, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., underscored the tensions between the two pillars of the Democratic coalition.For decades, organized labor was among the most powerful forces on the left, financing Democratic candidates and reliably delivering working-class votes, and political foot soldiers, for the party in crucial states and districts.The letter demanded that the A.F.L.-C.I.O. cut its ties with Tom Steyer, a hedge fund manager who has spent millions promoting efforts to combat climate change.But with blue-collar white voters shifting to the Republican Party and Democrats growing more reliant on higher-income voters and liberal donors like Mr. Steyer, environmental activists are increasingly muscling out unions.Nowhere was this more evident than during the tense debate over the Keystone XL oil pipeline, in which President Obama and Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, ultimately came down on the side of the environmentalists by opposing a project that some of the so-called hard-hat unions fervently wanted.The friction is not just confined to the Democratic Party: The labor movement itself is changing. As manufacturing has declined, power has flowed away from the unions representing factory and construction workers and toward public- and service-sector workers. The unions that formed the alliance with Mr. Steyer included the two largest teachers\u2019 unions and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.The goal of the new voter turnout \u201csuper PAC,\u201d announced last week with an initial goal of raising $50 million, was to ensure that liberal groups did not duplicate their efforts, as had happened in some elections. Some unions were asked to give as much as $1 million. Mr. Steyer, founder of the advocacy group NextGen Climate, announced that he would give $5 million and said it was \u201chighly likely\u201d other unions would participate.But Mr. Steyer has opposed oil and gas projects like the Keystone pipeline, and the construction unions assailed the A.F.L.-C.I.O.\u2019s willingness to make common cause with him as an abandonment of their members and the federation\u2019s principles.In one of the two letters sent on Monday, presidents of seven of the nation\u2019s biggest construction unions threatened to boycott the new get-out-the-vote effort, called For Our Future PAC.\u201cIt saddens us that the very labor movement we have fought for and supported for over a century seems to have lost sight of its core mission and has moved away from us and our membership in the interest of headline-grabbing political expediency,\u201d wrote the leaders of the operating engineers, plumbers, elevator constructors, roofers, laborers, plasterers, and heat and frost insulators.Mr. O\u2019Sullivan, the president of the 500,000-member laborers union, called the partnership a \u201cpolitically bankrupt betrayal\u201d of union members.In a separate and even more harshly worded letter to Mr. Trumka, the president of the 500,000-member laborers union, Terry O\u2019Sullivan, called the partnership a \u201cpolitically bankrupt betrayal\u201d of union members. \u201cWe object to the political agenda of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. being sold to a job-killing hedge fund manager with a bag of cash,\u201d he wrote.Both letters were provided to The New York Times by a labor official who insisted on anonymity.The schism comes as Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, is running a populist campaign that could appeal to some union members, castigating free trade agreements and illegal immigrants while vowing not to cut entitlement spending.Some of the building-trade unions have already gotten behind Mrs. Clinton, but some labor holdouts remain: The Teamsters, for example, have yet to endorse a candidate. And among rank-and-file workers, Mr. Trump could well outperform Mrs. Clinton with the unions that signed on to the letter, a heavily working-class and white male demographic.Membership in most private-sector unions has steadily declined, leaving organized labor under pressure to find new ways to demonstrate its influence. Mr. O\u2019Sullivan, in his letter, zeroed in on this challenge.\u201cYears of financial distress have left the A.F.L.-C.I.O. desperate for cash, and it appears that the answer is to sell out to a billionaire who not only has little or no stake in our movement, our members or their work but who has actively fought against our members\u2019 interest,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Sullivan wrote.Told of the criticism of Mr. Steyer, an executive at NextGen, Sky Gallegos, underscored the new super PAC\u2019s goals of \u201cpreventing climate disaster and promoting prosperity.\u201d\u201cOur new unified effort will help elect progressive leaders who are committed to a just transition to a clean-energy economy that will benefit working families across the nation,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Global Push to Address Trade and Inequality", "Date": "2016-05-26", "News": "Supported bySpecial Report: Global TrendsPARIS \u2014 \u201cFree trade\u201d have become dirty words in the United States and much of Europe, seen as the source of a host of ills traced to the globalized marketplace, from the loss of manufacturing jobs to the rise of immigration to the threat of dubious food imports.Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican Party nominee for president, gives these themes their most virulent spin when he accuses China of \u201craping\u201d the United States, or threatens to build a wall on the Mexican border. In the Democratic Party, Bernie Sanders has pilloried Hillary Clinton for her support of past trade treaties.In Europe, particularly in Germany and France, the campaign against a proposed free trade treaty between the United States and the European Union has taken to the streets, as protesters raise the specter of American chlorine-washed chicken, and hormone-fed beef invading their supermarkets.Yet most experts agree that free trade is not entirely to blame for the dislocations and anxieties now so prevalent in the developed world. Nor, they say, should the remedy be a rejection of globalization, but rather a concerted international effort to address deeper and broader economic changes that many people see as unfair.The long, and jumbled, list of charges against free trade \u2014 broadly defined \u2014 comes at a time when many citizens feel that their interests have been sacrificed to global corporate profits.In a speech in Frankfurt on April 5, Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, addressed the growing perception that \u201cthe cards are stacked against the common man \u2014 or woman \u2014 in favor of elites.\u201dThese frustrations, she said, have led to a questioning of \u201cestablished institutions and international norms,\u201d leading some to say, \u201cWell, why don\u2019t we look inward? Why don\u2019t we hide behind our borders?\u201d Such a retreat to protectionism, she warned, would be a \u201ctragic course,\u201d as history has proved time and again.Yet the facts of growing inequality are undisputed, even as experts debate whether global competition is to blame.Ms. Lagarde cited a shocking statistic from a January report by Oxfam, the anti-poverty organization: The world\u2019s 62 richest people now own the same wealth as the poorest 3.6 billion.Other studies show that in industrialized societies, low-wage workers have been losing not only jobs, particularly in factories, but also their share of the national income, in stark contrast to the very rich \u2014 often their former bosses.In a 2012 report, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development found that incomes for the top 1 percent of earners in advanced economies had increased 20 percent in the last two decades, while low-wage workers have seen incomes fall. In the United States, the average pay plus bonuses for a chief executive officer of the top 350 companies in the United States was $16.3 million in 2014, up 54.3 percent since 2009.As the Oxfam report concluded, \u201cFar from trickling down, income and wealth are instead being sucked upwards at an alarming rate.\u201dThere is a large caveat to this conclusion, often overlooked in the political debate in Europe and the United States. Between 1990 and 2010, the proportion of the world\u2019s population living in extreme poverty fell from 36 percent to 16 percent.The decline in inequality between nations is largely due to global trade, which has fueled economic growth in China, Southeast Asia and India in particular. But inside those countries, the gap between rich and poor has grown, chipping away at gains by low-wage workers.Now, experts are warning that a slowdown in global trade, propelled by dropping commodity prices, could slow the convergence between rich and poor countries.In most advanced economies, experts agree that free trade plays a minor role in the widening gap between labor and capital. The real culprits are broader, deeper changes in the labor market in industrialized countries, mostly linked to technology, which have left unskilled workers unable to compete.In the United States, for instance, the impact of competition from China is the most significant, accounting for one-fifth of the loss of six million factory jobs between 1999 and 2010, whereas the loss of jobs to Mexico, following the 1995 North American Free Trade Agreement or Nafta, has had little statistical impact, given the small size of the Mexican economy.That does little to ease the pain in communities where laid-off workers have still not found work, undercutting arguments of economists who said back in the mid-1990s that free trade would eventually benefit everyone.The failure of low-wage workers in some regions to find new jobs has amplified the popular narrative against Nafta in particular, according to Robert Lawrence, a Harvard economist and expert in deindustrialization.\u201cPeople find examples, and certain regions and cities have been affected,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the bottom line is, Nafta is not a big deal.\u201dIn his view, the problem for America\u2019s laid-off factory workers is not so much global competition, but a failure of government to address deeper, more systemic shifts in the labor market that have nothing to do with trade deficits. Rather, the explanations have to do with new technologies, including automation, which have led to greater labor productivity, cheaper prices and fewer manufacturing jobs. \u201cWhat is stunning is that virtually every major industrial economy is witnessing the same trend,\u201d Mr. Lawrence said. He cited the case of Germany, a manufacturing powerhouse with a healthy trade surplus, which has seen the share of factory jobs drop from 36.7 percent in 1973 to 21 percent in 2010.Addressing the irreversible trend \u2014 which Mr. Lawrence compares to the loss of agricultural jobs in the 1960s \u2014 would involve a series of measures that, for the most part, have been overlooked in the United States, including a more progressive tax system, better training for unskilled workers, changes to a system of higher education to give college students the skills they need, without crippling debt.In her Frankfurt speech, Ms. Lagarde made similar proposals, urging the United States to expand tax credits to lower-income workers, raise the minimum wage and offer more government assistance to families. In Europe, she said, governments should do more to give workers, especially the young, the skills they need.\u201cEvery country has something to do,\u201d she said, running through a list of fiscal as well as structural changes needed to correct the inequality and disequilibrium in the global economy. \u201cThe answer to the reality of our interconnected world is not fragmentation. It is cooperation.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the number of people who own the same wealth as the world\u2019s 62 richest people, according to an Oxfam report. It is the poorest 3.6 billion, not 3.6 million.Advertisement"}

It has also committed to legalizing same-sex marriage within 100 days of entering office, and enacting policies to help fight climate change.If the Liberal coalition returns to power, Mr. Shorten said, Australians will see another \u201cthree years of dysfunction, of dithering and disappointment.\u201dThe campaign will be a long one by the standards of Australia, where a typical election campaign runs four to five weeks, and voters are already weary. Mr. Turnbull has squandered an early lead his party held in polls after unseating the staunchly conservative Mr. Abbott.Voters had expected Mr. Turnbull to be bolder and more progressive. But the government\u2019s flat-footed approach to issues like tax overhauls and education funding, and Mr. Turnbull\u2019s decision to stick with a conservative party line on same-sex marriage and climate change, have damaged his party\u2019s standing.\u201cHe has squandered his party\u2019s lead,\u201d said Jessica Elgood, a director of Ipsos.Geoffrey Robinson, a lecturer on politics at Deakin University in Geelong, Victoria State, said, \u201cPeople expected something new from the government when Mr. Turnbull took over, and he has not delivered.\u201dBoth leaders have said they would maintain Australia\u2019s strict policies against asylum seekers who arrive by boat.

{"Headline": "Trump and Taxes", "Date": "2016-05-13", "News": "Supported byOn the first mystery: Mr. Trump\u2019s excuse, that he can\u2019t release his returns while they\u2019re being audited, is an obvious lie. On the contrary, the fact that he\u2019s being audited (or at least that he says he\u2019s being audited) should make it easier for him to go public \u2014 after all, he needn\u2019t fear triggering an audit! Clearly, he must be hiding something. What?It could be how little he pays in taxes, a revelation that hurt Mitt Romney in 2012. But I doubt it; given how Mr. Trump rolls, he\u2019d probably boast that his ability to game the tax system shows how smart he is compared to all the losers out there.So my guess, shared by a number of observers, is that the dirty secret hidden in those returns is that he isn\u2019t as rich as he claims to be. In Trumpworld, the revelation that he\u2019s only worth a couple of billion \u2014 maybe even less than a billion \u2014 would be utterly humiliating. So he\u2019ll try to tough it out. Of course, if he does, we\u2019ll never know.Meanwhile, however, we can look at the candidate\u2019s policy proposals. And what has been going on there is just as revealing, in its own way, as his attempt to dodge scrutiny of his personal finances.Now, the inconsistency between Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetoric and his specific proposals didn\u2019t seem to hurt him in the Republican primaries. Neither did the wild irresponsibility of those specifics, perhaps because all the major contenders for the G.O.P. nomination were proposing huge, budget-busting tax cuts for the rich. True, none of them were quite as off the charts as the Trump plan, but such distinctions were probably lost on primary voters \u2014 $4 trillion, $10 trillion, who cares?Having secured the nomination, however, Mr. Trump apparently feels the need to seem more respectable. The goal, I suspect, is to bring the headline numbers down enough to let the media\u2019s propensity for false equivalence kick in. Hillary Clinton has a plan that actually adds up, while Donald Trump has a plan that will cost $4 trillion, but which he claims is deficit-neutral? Hey, it\u2019s the same thing!Oh, and meanwhile he suggested once again that he might raise taxes on the rich, then walked it back, with credulous media eating it all up.So why would Mr. Trump turn to these of all people to, ahem, fix his numbers?It could be a peace offering, an attempt to reassure insiders by bringing in Mr. Kudlow and Mr. Moore, who are influential members of the Republican establishment \u2014 which incidentally tells you a lot about their party.So he probably just went with a couple of guys he\u2019s seen on TV, assuming that they must be there because they know their stuff.Now, you might wonder how someone that careless and incurious was such a huge success in business. But one answer is, how successful was he, really? What\u2019s in those tax returns?David Brooks is off today.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Subtract One Clinton", "Date": "2016-05-19", "News": "Supported byBill Clinton should go home.It\u2019s easy to see why his wife\u2019s campaign is giving him a major role. His political skills are legendary. And he\u2019s the spouse, for heaven\u2019s sake. Presidential candidates always rely on their families to fill out the schedule, show up where they can\u2019t, spread good cheer.But we all know this is different. Campaigning in Kentucky \u2014 where her husband is more popular than she is \u2014 Hillary Clinton told voters that Bill would be \u201cin charge of revitalizing the economy\u201d in her administration. At another stop she promised that if they returned to the White House, \u201cI\u2019ll expect him to go to work \u2026 to get incomes rising.\u201dShe presented herself as part of a duo that knows \u201ca little bit about how to create jobs. I think my husband did a heck of a job.\u201dHillary wants to be the first woman ever elected president of the United States. The economy is the central issue in the campaign. The fact that she\u2019s assuring voters that Bill will take care of it is \u2026 totally wrong.It would be better if he wasn\u2019t on the scene at all. Let us count the ways:\u2014 Implanting a husband in the center of White House policy-making is just a bad idea. All other advisers, from the vice president to the chief of staff to the cabinet members, fade in authority when there\u2019s one person sitting at the table who happens to be married to the boss. It didn\u2019t work very well when the Clintons were offering \u201ctwo for the price of one\u201d in the 1990s. Turn the marital partner into a former president and it\u2019s like adding a blue whale to the goldfish bowl.If Hillary wants Bill in her administration, she can give him one of the useful-but-largely-symbolic roles a first spouse traditionally plays. The Clinton Foundation, for all its messes, has done good work in developing countries. Let him be international ambassador to the poor.\u2014 The sex scandal issue isn\u2019t really central, since Americans have a long record of voting for the candidates they think can deliver, regardless of private peccadilloes. And Donald Trump has a history of boorish public behavior that could even overshadow the marital baggage Hillary has to tote. However, she\u2019d be in a much stronger position if she was toting on her own.\u2014 It\u2019s not surprising that the first serious female presidential contender would be someone attached to a famous male name. For most of our history, women who rose in American politics were generally filling in for a deceased (or sometimes indicted) husband. But some still rose to do fantastic things on their own. Margaret Chase Smith got into Congress as a replacement for her late husband, but she became the foremost opponent of McCarthyism in the Senate all by herself. That\u2019s the spirit the Clinton campaign needs. Not running as part of a team with your male predecessor.Our country is now full of women who\u2019ve become senators, governors, C.E.O.s, diplomats without familial assistance. If they have spouses, they\u2019re off doing their own thing. Or \u2014 yes! \u2014 taking care of the family. It\u2019s a new world order Hillary has always championed. But the way she\u2019s running her campaign isn\u2019t doing the new world any favors.Bill isn\u2019t the only man overshadowing her political life. Hillary has also been campaigning as a sort of Barack Obama surrogate who\u2019ll carry on the president\u2019s legacy for another term or two. During a debate in South Carolina, she brought up Obama 10 times \u2014 more than the other two candidates on the stage combined. In another debate, she laced into Bernie Sanders for disloyalty. (\u201cThe kind of criticism that we\u2019ve heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.\u201d)All this identifying with the last two Democratic presidents has left her own political image fuzzy. She\u2019s pledged to do more to crack down on Wall Street, but she hasn\u2019t really said whether the deregulation during her husband\u2019s administration was a mistake. She\u2019s disagreed \u2014 briefly \u2014 with Obama on matters like immigration, trade and Arctic drilling, but the details are very hard to pin down.What we haven\u2019t gotten is a vision of how a Hillary Clinton administration would be different from either of her predecessors\u2019. That\u2019s been the great weakness of her campaign from the start. She\u2019s become the opposite of change. (Continuity You Can Believe In?)Even if she keeps going the way she\u2019s been going, voters may be so horrified by Donald Trump that she\u2019ll win in November. But you don\u2019t want the first woman president elected by default.This is one of the most qualified people ever to run for the office, and she doesn\u2019t need to hold on to anybody\u2019s coattails. It\u2019s time for Hillary to stand alone.Nicholas Kristof is off today.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Eternal Magic of Beirut", "Date": "2016-05-02", "News": "For many of us, it\u2019s synonymous with war and strife. But for the artists, chefs, designers, architects and scholars who live there, Beirut will always be a place where ideas and beauty flourished ... and flourish still.Supported byTHE DAY I ARRIVED in Beirut I was collected at my hotel by Huda Baroudi, a cheerful woman who had offered to show me around. It was a lazy Sunday, grim and gray, and I was jet-lagged. But her eyes were shining and she was eager to take me to the Bechara el-Khoury Mansion, a 19th-\u00adcentury villa that long ago \u2014 before it had been abandoned, pillaged and finally shelled during the civil war \u2014 was one of Beirut\u2019s grand residences.As I settled into the passenger seat of her S.U.V., Ms. Baroudi, an influential designer of textiles and furniture, propelled us at high speed toward what looked like a four-way stop. Beirut\u2019s streets are narrow, potholed and anything but straight; a car was approaching rapidly from the opposite direction, but Ms. Baroudi seemed unconcerned.At the last moment, the other driver swerved to let us pass. I was unable to speak, but Ms. Baroudi laughed sweetly. \u201cI looked into his eyes,\u201d she explained with a smile and a shrug. \u201cAnd I could see that he would yield the right of way.\u201dSomehow, I was not comforted. \u201cThis is how we do it in Beirut,\u201d she continued. \u201cAll the road signs are in people\u2019s eyes.\u201dThat turned out to be true, not just literally, but figuratively. There is something singular about Beirut. It has one foot planted in the Middle East and the other in Europe, but it doesn\u2019t quite belong in either place. Nothing seems permanent there; it is a perpetual transit point. Generations have passed through its borders in search of fun, or out of desperation. And for both reasons, they continue to come.Perhaps alone among great cities, Beirut has earned, and manages to maintain, reputations both for wanton licentiousness and for utter terror. \u201cThere it stands, with a toss of curls and a flounce of skirts, a Carmen among the cities,\u201d Jan Morris wrote in her great love letter to what she described as \u201cThe Impossible City.\u201d \u201cIt is the last of the Middle Eastern fleshpots.\u201dThat essay was written in 1956, soon after Beirut hosted the World Water Ski Championships in Saint George\u2019s Bay. Like all clich\u00e9s, the image of the city as the Paris of the Middle East, was, at least in part, a fact. From the time France reluctantly ended its mandate in 1943, and particularly in the decades between the close of World War II and the disaster that tore Lebanon apart in the 1970s, Beirut was more cosmopolitan, more tolerant and, perhaps above all, more self-indulgent than any Arab city. No other place could serve so effortlessly as a luxurious pit stop for rich Europeans, Arab royalty and celebrities like Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor. The cafes were filled with radical intellectuals, oil sheikhs and every kind of huckster. Even the notorious have always felt at home in Beirut: Kim Philby, the MI6 officer who became the 20th-century standard-bearer for treachery, spent many an evening at the bar of the Saint-George Hotel. The city was a free port in the purest sense, a place where bars and clubs often seemed at least as consequential as churches and mosques.Even today, Beirut, which is washed gently by the Mediterranean Sea and ringed by mountains, remains unremittingly hedonistic. The city has high-end restaurants like Le Sushi Bar, and, until very recently, a Skybar and a nightclub named after the 1972 porn classic \u201cBehind the Green Door.\u201dBeirut has Uber and a farm-to-table movement. There are Prada and Herm\u00e8s outlets on the Corniche, the city\u2019s magnificent seaside promenade, and a Virgin Megastore, too. In a single week, I saw two lime-green Maseratis: one at the dealership, and another parked outside Barbar, a snack bar in Hamra, widely considered to make the best chicken shawarma in town.Yet Beirut is also the place where the car bomb and suicide vest emerged as the quotidian weapons of jihad. It is the capital of a country that has been without a president for two years. Hezbollah, based in Beirut\u2019s southern precincts, and the role model for many of the world\u2019s terrorist groups, is Lebanon\u2019s only truly powerful and unchallenged political organization. Today, more than a million Syrian refugees have swarmed into the region, having fled the 10th-century carnage little more than 100 miles away. It is this constant tension that makes the city so hard to understand \u2014 and such a fascinating place to visit.\u201cIn Beirut, precariousness is a form of identity,\u201d said Christine Tohme, a curator and director of Ashkal Alwan, a research, production and study space that emerged in the 1990s as a place for artists to reclaim a public identity. We were having fair-trade espresso at one of the city\u2019s many fine cafes. \u201cNothing works here \u2014 from communism, to socialism to the big free market, to finding ways of being hipsters, or becoming designers or artists or being in groups that are driven by social media.\u201dThose words, echoed often by people I met, certainly sound bleak. But Tohme wasn\u2019t so much complaining as explaining. This is common. Read a transcript of what people say and you can see despair running through every sentence. But if you listen to them speak, or better yet, decipher their eyes, that desperation often vanishes. I asked if she ever considered leaving the city where she has spent the bulk of her life. \u201cOf course,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t, and I am pretty sure I never will. This kind of turmoil, this kind of volatility, this kind of precariousness ... \u201d She let the thought drift for a while. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say that life in war zones forces us to be creative,\u201d she continued. \u201cI know that is banal. But Beirut is a demanding city, and that makes it vital and alive. And vitality produces greatness.\u201d16 PhotosBEIRUT\u2019S GREAT INTELLECTUAL passion, the search for identity, is on display in almost every shop, museum and gallery. At Bokja, Ms. Baroudi and her partner, Maria Hibri, create Modernist furniture with lavishly embroidered textiles culled from dozens of regional sources. At the recently renovated Sursock Museum, I saw an exhibition that presented visions of the emerging city, from 19th-century Orientalist fantasies to David Hockney\u2019s arresting 1966 pen-and-ink rendering of the Rivoli, Beirut\u2019s Modernist cinema, which was demolished following the civil war. But the show that most poignantly captured the effects of arbitrary identity in Beirut was at the Sfeir-Semler Gallery. \u201cBlazon\u201d took Marwan Rechmaoui years to produce. It consists of 59 ornamental shields, and more than 400 flags \u2014 all elaborately embroidered by workers at Bokja \u2014 and arranged by the city\u2019s corresponding electrical districts.While I was in Beirut, I stayed at the Villa Clara, an idiosyncratic hotel run by Olivier Gougeon, a French chef, and his wife, Marie-H\u00e9lene Moawad. The hotel, really a house from the 1920s, has just seven guest rooms, each decorated with antique furniture and paintings by local artists. The floors are covered with boldly patterned artisanal Lebanese tiles, most of them more than a century old, scooped up from houses also on the verge of destruction. The public rooms are full of aesthetic non sequiturs: There is an Andr\u00e9e Putman table, hand-painted wallpaper in the restaurant, a sculptured pink flamingo and a set of chairs that had once occupied the French Senate. Each guest room is lit by a hand-blown Damascene chandelier, all purchased from the old souk of Damascus.For people who prefer small hotels that require visitors to think about the city that surrounds them, Villa Clara is a treat. Most mornings, I woke to the sound of twin songbirds at my window, then gazed across the quiet, leafy street at a dilapidated villa, a remnant of the civil war that somehow seemed more like a Brutalist sculpture than a house. The surrounding neighborhood, Mar Mikhael, has the feel of Williamsburg in the 1970s, before it became a hipster theme park, when big rigs still rumbled through the streets at dawn. For every stylish bar and boutique that sells copies of Nylon magazine, there is an industrial machine shop, a tool warehouse or a company that wholesales lighting fixtures. Like many neighborhoods in Beirut, Mar Mikhael could be swallowed any day by the moneyed classes; for the moment, though, aided no doubt by the difficult economy and a general reluctance to travel to the region while so much of it is at war, young artists and writers can still afford to live and work there.The food at Villa Clara is exceptional, particularly the breakfasts of homemade labneh, the thick Lebanese yogurt that has been strained to remove its whey, the freshly baked Levantine bread called manakish and the eggs from chickens raised in gardens that the couple rents from the Maronite Order in the nearby Chouf mountains. They cure their own ham in the cellars of the St. Jean Maron Monastery \u2014 which had been closed since the civil war. The hotel\u2019s French restaurant is reliably considered to be among Beirut\u2019s best (and most expensive). Gougeon, an ex-pastry chef at the Grand V\u00e9four in Paris, arrived in Beirut in 1999, to work as a cook at the French Embassy. He soon realized there would be no turning back. \u201cHere, there is total anarchy,\u201d he explained, with a look of pleasure in his eyes. \u201cChaos. You have to fight on a daily basis for everything you get.\u201d And like so many others I encountered, he regarded that daily struggle as a benefit rather than an obstacle. \u201cIn France everything is regimented,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are hours and rules and long vacations. Here there are no days off. And very little rest. But we have something they no longer have: energy, desire and complete freedom.\u201dIT HAD BEEN NEARLY 20 years since I last visited Beirut. By then, the hostilities, which ground on mercilessly from 1975 to 1990, had turned the very name of the city into a synonym for war zone. More than a hundred thousand people died; a far greater number were ripped from their homes. Infrastructure \u2014 the telephone networks, the water system, roadways \u2014 and most of the economy had all been crippled.By the 1990s, politics, war and hatred had run their course, at least for a while. It was the perfect moment for the emergence of Rafik Hariri, the blustery businessman who had moved to Saudi Arabia at the age of 21. Hariri entered the Saudi construction industry, advanced rapidly and was soon running his own firm, becoming the personal contractor for Prince Fahd. By the time he returned to Lebanon in 1992, to become the country\u2019s prime minister, he was a billionaire.Hariri set out at once to rebuild Beirut\u2019s shattered urban center. An affable man who liked things to be big and shiny and new, he had little interest in sectarian fighting, but perhaps even less in preserving the essence of what many people had long regarded as the Middle East\u2019s most alluring city.Hariri, who was killed by a devastating truck bomb in 2005, loved yachts and planes and, more than anything else, enormous real estate projects, which is what the center of Beirut eventually became. To remake the city, he created a company called Solidere, which is a French acronym for the Lebanese Company for the Development and Reconstruction of Beirut Central District. Squatters were removed from the city center, which was then essentially demolished. In addition, more than half a million square meters of land were reclaimed from the nearby sea.Solidere\u2019s stated goal was to attempt to revive the memory of the days before 1975, when Beirut was pluralistic, prosperous and throbbing with intensity. The company did retain and restore some of the bullet-riddled facades that had withstood the rampages of the various militias. But the development also wiped away centuries of history and most of Beirut\u2019s rich architectural heritage. To get a sense of that, one only has to wander over to the Beirut Souks, which had functioned as a center of commerce at least since the time of the ancient Phoenicians. Solidere rebuilt the souks along its historical grid plan, which was supposed to assure continuity. It didn\u2019t: The souks today are filled with shiny objects and marble floors. It is a great place to buy moisturizer, a $10,000 handbag or a Patek Philippe watch. But the new souks have far more in common with the Mall of America than with the many Levantine bazaars that have dominated the Arab marketplace for thousands of years.\u201cThe most urgent question here is not how a collection of Pizza Huts, Safeways, McDonald\u2019s and Body Shops gathered together as a \u2018souk\u2019 will recapture any lifestyle other than that of a shopping mall,\u201d Saree Makdisi, who is professor of English and comparative literature at UCLA, has written. Mr. Makdisi is of Lebanese descent and often writes about the development and preservation in the Arab world. \u201cThe point is not that this is a misnomer, nor that a traditional souk is necessarily more genuine and authentic than a shopping mall, but that something strange is happening to our sense of history when we can confuse a shopping mall with a souk.\u201dGeorge Arbid agrees. A bearlike man with an oval face and a commanding beard, Arbid is director of the Arab Center for Architecture, and an associate professor at the American University of Beirut. Late one afternoon, he took me on a walk in the center of the city, not far from his office. Too often, he said, the word heritage has been used solely to describe Roman ruins and ancient times: \u201cWhen I studied architecture\u201d \u2014 which he did both in Beirut at the Acad\u00e9mie Libanaise des Beaux-Arts and at the Harvard University Graduate School of Design \u2014 \u201cthe only modern architecture you could find in books was in the West. We were the ancient place. But look around. This is a modern society, and you can see that in the buildings, here and throughout the Middle East.\u201dModernism is Arbid\u2019s passion, and he recoils when people act as if the only choices for Beirut are to become another faceless airport city or remain frozen in a long-forgotten past. He knew that I was staying near the headquarters of Electricit\u00e9 du Liban, which was built in 1965, and asked me if I had noticed it. It would have been impossible to miss. Electrical service in Lebanon may not be something to brag about, but the building itself is magnificent. And yet there is no public access. \u201cIt survived the war,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy on earth wall it off now?\u201dI asked Arbid about the Hariri years and the Solidere construction. \u201cWe were coming out of a ruinous war,\u201d he said. \u201cHariri was perceived as a savior, a man of the free market who would help Beirut rise from the ashes. He did that for some people. But the question is for whom? Not for the middle classes, and certainly not for the poor. The new Beirut City Center is a development project.\u201dThe project and its aftermath have raised an issue that has been debated with great urgency in the past decade: How do you prevent development from interfering with a civic discourse that has prevailed for centuries? As we walked down the streets of Ashrafieh, toward the sea, Arbid showed me how space has gradually given way to a sort of anonymous vertical compound. Up to the 1970s, modern architecture like that of the Electricit\u00e9 du Liban had reflected the local traditions of outdoor living. Buildings had arches and plenty of room for people to mingle. Pockets of green flourished. \u201cThat is the traditional Lebanese construction,\u201d he said, \u201copen and inviting.\u201dThen came the era of darkness. Literally. \u201cNow we have 40-story buildings that are put together with one thought in mind: price per square foot,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not opposed to tall buildings in neighborhoods that can afford them, but the terraces of Lebanese tradition are gone, and so are the shops and meeting places on the ground floor.\u201dHe was right. There are cleaners, banks, bakeries and restaurants threaded through the old residential blocks. The newest towers, many of which hover ominously above graceful old villas, are nothing but giant walls of glass. Many terraces have been replaced with windows that can\u2019t even be opened. \u201cEvery one of these places is a gated community, a vertical gated community,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are no shops, no public space, no place to chat.\u201dTHESE DAYS, IT\u2019S HARD to conjure a vision of Beirut\u2019s permanent leisure class, or the world in which they lived, but it is still possible, barely, for those who spend some time with Lady Yvonne Sursock Cochrane. The only daughter of Alfred Bey Sursock and his Italian wife, Donna Maria Theresa Serra di Cassano, she lives in the Sursock Palace, which is on the Rue Sursock, just down the road from the newly renovated Sursock Museum, in the neighborhood most commonly called Sursock. The palace, miraculously untouched by 15 years of mortar fire, was built in the 19th century, soon after the Egyptians dredged the harbor and turned Beirut into a booming port.The Sursocks are among the oldest and richest of the Christian families in Lebanon. And at the age of 94, Lady Cochrane, a Sursock by birth, may be the last great dame of the Levant. Lucid and acerbic, she seems like a cross between the Dowager Countess of Grantham and one of the less savory Mitford sisters. We had tea late one afternoon in her library, which, because it is the \u201ccoziest\u201d place in the house, also serves as her sitting room. (This particular cozy room has 33-foot ceilings and mahogany walls and enormous 17th-century paintings. A collection of Flemish tapestries lines the entrance vestibule and dining room.)Lady Cochrane, dressed crisply in a brown blouse, silk salmon foulard and houndstooth skirt, met me in the middle of the great hall, which features a double flight of marble stairs at its center. I asked the most obvious question first: Were you here during the civil war?\u201cAlways,\u201d she replied, as if my question was slightly insulting. \u201cIt\u2019s where I live.\u201dEven today it is hard to walk three blocks in Beirut without seeing a building pockmarked with machine gun fire or mortar rounds, and yet the Sursock Palace was pristine. I wondered how that was possible.\u201c I believe we were somehow respected,\u201d she said matter-of-factly. \u201cBecause one day I was in the middle of the hall where you came in.\u201d A crowd of what she referred to as \u201cyoung ruffians\u201d walked into the house. \u201cI knew that these people would go from house to house, burgle and ruin them,\u201d she said. (I wondered whether the words \u201cruffian,\u201d and \u201cburgle\u201d had ever before been used to describe the vengeful packs of murderers that held sway in Beirut during the war.)\u201cI was alone,\u201d she said, \u201cand I thought, this is terrible. There must have been 50 of them. With big guns. I thought, they are just going to murder me. They saw me at a distance, and then they all went upstairs,\u201d she said. \u201cI tried to stay calm as best I could. After a time, they came down and I thought they must have just destroyed everything or stolen things.\u201d She said this all with a kind of effortless serenity.\u201cBut they did not pinch one single thing,\u201d she continued, shaking her head in amazement 30 years later. \u201cExcept for an old poniard that had been hanging on the wall. There were two of them with exquisite Chinese handles. Very rare. They stole one and left the other where it was. I have always felt quite certain they didn\u2019t care about the handle. Probably threw it away. They only wanted the dagger itself.\u201dLady Cochrane explained that her staff had buried most of the valuables at the start of the hostilities. And there were a lot of them to bury. (\u201cAfter it was over my own butler had trouble finding everything,\u201d she said. \u201cHe hid it all so well.\u201d)She is horrified by the city she now inhabits. \u201cWhen I was a child, Beirut was the most beautiful city. Full of gardens. Then bad government got a hold of the place. Now, after years of war and neglect it is nothing but a generalized slum.\u201dIt was perhaps not the most nuanced analysis, but I had to ask one more question: What had happened?\u201cDemocracy, young man,\u201d she said. \u201cDemocracy. We never had a proper leader, and eventually the place began to fall apart.\u201dMY VISIT WITH LADY COCHRANE left me in need of an infusion of hope, and so I went to see Marwa Arsanios, a 37-year-old art professor at the American University, who co-founded an organization called 98 Weeks, and who has shown her own artwork throughout the world. Arsanios wanted to create a place where artists could focus on interdisciplinary collaboration and begin to address the questions that consume so many of them: \u201cHow do you build a community in a time when the traditional leadership is gone?\u201d she said. \u201cHow do you establish something that lasts in a place that only changes?\u201d\u201cThis is a really weird moment,\u201d she continued. \u201cNobody really knows what will happen here, but everybody thinks something will happen.\u201d Like so many of her creative friends, she stays in part because of the city\u2019s fragility; Beirut, whatever else it is or may become, still has possibilities. Like Arsanios, most of the elite \u2014 particularly the many wealthy members of the diaspora \u2014 could flee in an instant if they had to. But (again, like Arsanios) many among them continue to see Beirut as a special place, and, despite its surroundings, exhilarating and alive. Although the euphoria of the Arab Spring has faded, replaced for many with fear and confusion, Arsanios is hopeful. \u201cWhen we started, political life was frozen,\u201d she said. \u201cJournalism was bad and universities were dead. The art community became a refuge. And it has given us strength.\u201dThe following night I had drinks with Arsanios and several of her colleagues from the American University. They were cleareyed but not glum. Each was committed to the future of the city \u2014 as a place for art, civic discourse and free inquiry. But they all realized the path might not be simple. I thought about what The Economist recently described as the \u201cglobal empathy gap\u201d between sufferings of the West and those in Beirut. Last November, the shootings and bombs that killed 130 people in a series of attacks in Paris set off an international wave of sympathy and regret. The night before, the same group, ISIS, devoted, among so many other hatreds, to war against Hezbollah, claimed responsibility for exploding bombs that killed 43 people in Beirut. The world seemed to shrug.Nonetheless, I walked back to my hotel, alone and in silence \u2014 as I had every night since I arrived. Despite the fact that the crime rate in most of Beirut is low, nobody who lives according to the dictums of the State Department would do that. \u201cThe Lebanese government cannot guarantee the protection of U.S. citizens in the country against sudden outbreaks of violence,\u201d its travel alert warns. \u201cPublic demonstrations occur with little warning and may become violent.\u201d Of course, this is also true in many American cities. But on the alert went: \u201cU.S. citizens traveling or residing in Lebanon despite this Travel Warning should keep a low profile, assess their personal security, and vary times and routes for all required travel.\u201dI did none of those things \u2014 nor was any of it necessary. There are parts of Beirut that are clearly unsafe; but tourists don\u2019t, as a rule, hang out in Hezbollah-controlled territory. The city I visited was peaceful, even serene, and nobody I spoke to suggested it wasn\u2019t. The loudest noise usually came from the most energetic nightclubs.But as I neared my hotel that night I suddenly heard the rapid fire of heavy machine guns, and the harsh whistle of mortar rounds. I was about to dive under the nearest car when I saw several old men, standing on the street next to the giant warehouse that seemed to be under attack. They were all laughing. At me.\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d I screamed into the dark as I realized that none of those mortars had actually hit anything. An old man who sold motor oil on the side of the road walked up to me. He wrapped his arm around my shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s only a movie,\u201d he said, clearly delighted. \u201cThey are shooting it inside the warehouse. The guns aren\u2019t real.\u201dA picture caption on Page 144 this weekend with an article about the cultural resilience of the people of Beirut in the face of continuing political strife misstates the time of day the photograph was taken.

{"Headline": "Lining Up for Change in Venezuela", "Date": "2016-05-07", "News": "Supported byEditorialLate last month, Venezuelans lined up in droves to support a petition for a referendum that could force President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro out of office. Opposition leaders had a month to collect at least 200,000 signatures, the first step of a complex and lengthy process.Within a few days, they had gathered more than 1.8 million, evidence of mounting frustration in a country that is being led by an incompetent autocrat. The effort to recall Mr. Maduro, whose current term ends in 2019, has the potential to deepen the standoff between his socialist government and the opposition. It would be catastrophic if the struggle were to result in widespread violence.Mr. Maduro has no sound ideas for addressing the crisis, which is largely of his making; mostly he blames his government\u2019s failures on foreign conspiracies.The path to oust Mr. Maduro through peaceful and constitutional means is narrow, in large part because the president and his predecessor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, have weakened the country\u2019s democratic institutions by doing away with term limits and packing key institutions with loyalists.Opposition leaders hope that rallying international support for their efforts can put pressure on Mr. Maduro to leave. At the Organization of American States, Secretary General Luis Almagro is expected to call for a special session in the next few weeks to debate the perilous state of democracy in Venezuela. This could force the country\u2019s neighbors to vote on measures that could include expelling Venezuela from the diplomatic body. While expulsion is unlikely, the session could cause Venezuela\u2019s neighbors \u2014 many of whom have been publicly silent \u2014 to rebuke the Maduro government.Meanwhile, Vatican officials are considering stepping in to play a mediating role between Mr. Maduro\u2019s government and the opposition. Pope Francis recently sent Mr. Maduro a letter expressing concern about the crisis, and the Vatican\u2019s top diplomat, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, is well acquainted with the political leaders in Venezuela, having been posted there from 2009 to 2013. It may be too late for international mediation to bridge the divide between the government and the opposition, but it\u2019s worth trying.As opposition leaders push forward on a referendum to hold early presidential elections, they also need to articulate a plan to address the country\u2019s problems. As long as they remain fractured and primarily defined for their loathing of the ruling party, they won\u2019t be able to end the chaos even if they succeed in ousting Mr. Maduro.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Puerto Rico\u2019s Fiscal Fiasco Is a Harbinger of Mainland Woes", "Date": "2016-05-10", "News": "Supported byTo tourists, Puerto Rico means pi\u00f1a coladas and sunbathing. To Puerto Ricans, it looks very different: The unemployment rate is over 12 percent, schools and hospitals are closing, and the government debt is so huge it makes Detroit\u2019s look modest.Puerto Rico is now supposed to pay an unfathomable $2 billion to bondholders on July 1 \u2014 which it cannot do \u2014 even as it accrues pension obligations to its workers and lets public works lapse. A relief bill is expected to be introduced in Congress on Wednesday, but even if it passes and works, the island will not be able to pull out of its financial tailspin for years.But mainland residents should not look smugly at Puerto Rico. Across America, dozens of cities, counties and states may be heading down the same financial rabbit hole. Illinois, New Jersey, Philadelphia, St. Louis and Jacksonville, Fla., to name just a few, are all facing their own slowly unspooling financial disasters.The new debt relief law is stirring colonial resentment, as Puerto Rican officials denounced the \u201cjunta\u201d \u2014 or federal control board \u2014 that will soon direct this island\u2019s failing governance and finances.The blame lies with what economists call \u201cdeferred costs.\u201d Generous pension promises made decades ago, without enough funding, are now coming due as baby boomers retire. Bonds issued in the distant past to build bridges, highways and other projects also must be paid \u2014 even as the projects themselves could by now use expensive makeovers.You cannot necessarily see deferred costs, lurking in a shadowy realm known as \u201coff the balance sheet.\u201d But deferring them doesn\u2019t make them go away. They actually compound.\u201cNew York City has $85 billion of retiree health obligations all by itself,\u201d said Richard Ravitch, the former lieutenant governor of New York State and an informal adviser to Detroit\u2019s financial control board. He helped New York City resolve its financial crisis in 1975; today he worries about possible replays across America.\u201cWe\u2019ve promised more than we can pay without confiscatory levels of taxation,\u201d Mr. Ravitch said. \u201cPuerto Rico is just, arithmetically, the most egregious example of borrowing to cover up deficits.\u201dSimilarly, in Michigan, Flint\u2019s nightmare of contaminated water has its roots in a decrepit local water system that was built decades ago during boom times, and is now too costly for the shrunken city to fix or replace.The streets and lighting system of East Cleveland, Ohio, are so far gone and repairs so out of reach that the dwindling city recently sought permission from the state to file for Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy \u2014 just in time, as luck may have it, for the Republican National Convention in Cleveland next door.In Puerto Rico, signs of desperation include a highest-in-the-nation sales tax \u2014 raised to 11.5 percent last year, up from 8 percent \u2014 and the mortgaging of the Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn International Airport. Named for \u201cthe father of modern Puerto Rico,\u201d the tourism hub was recently hocked to a Mexican investment firm to make sure planes could keep landing.\u201cWe have over 30 dams in Puerto Rico, and I think only one works,\u201d said Eduardo Bhatia, the island\u2019s senate president, in an interview earlier this year. \u201cWe\u2019re here in the rain forest, and we have plenty of water. It\u2019s insane.\u201dYesteryear\u2019s spending decisions are coming to haunt officials around the country. Illinois, for instance, has come to grief over a century\u2019s worth of deferred pension obligations: Last year, the State Supreme Court said it had found warnings from \u201cas long ago as 1917\u201d that the pension system was veering toward insolvency.The warnings did little good, and by 2003 the state was so hopelessly far behind on paying its pension costs that it opted for the same magic bullet Puerto Rico uses: borrowing to pay bills. From 2003 to 2011, Illinois borrowed more than $17 billion to try to replenish its pension system. It did not work. Today Illinois has a bigger pension gap than ever, officially $111 billion but probably much bigger in real-world terms \u2014 plus the additional $17 billion of bond debt.Another cautionary tale comes from Jefferson County, Ala., which in 2011 filed what was then the biggest municipal bankruptcy in American history. The immediate cause? Deferring the cost of fixing an aging sewer system for more than 100 years, to the tune of $3.1 billion in sewer bonds.Kicking the can that far down the road was a community effort: 20 cities and towns in Jefferson County, large and small, had shoved responsibility for their decrepit sewer systems onto the county, avoiding having to take heat from their residents for raising rates to pay for maintenance.Finally a federal judge ordered the county to fix the system, which had become a health hazard. And the cost of borrowing enough to cover a century\u2019s worth of deferred maintenance was what ultimately sank the county.In Puerto Rico, where the island\u2019s $72 billion bond debt is out in the open, even now there is a tendency to overlook its unfunded pension obligations, stated at $46 billion.For years, when its government was faced with bills it could not pay, Puerto Rico issued new bonds to get the money \u2014 a little like a homeowner taking out a second mortgage to buy groceries. The practice is widely known to be unsustainable.At this point, conservative Republicans see taxpayers being liable for a big bailout. Democrats say the proposed reforms will punish ordinary Puerto Ricans who did nothing wrong. Elected officials on the island see federal oversight as neocolonial rule.

The Freedom Party seeks to curb immigration, particularly from the Middle East, to shrink welfare benefits to non-Austrians and to curtail what it calls political Islam in the country. The Freedom Party has said it does not wish to leave the European Union, despite voicing strong criticism of the bloc\u2019s handling of refugees and borders.Frauke Petry, the former leader of the party, has said border guards might need to turn guns on anyone crossing a frontier illegally. The party\u2019s policy platform says \u201cIslam does not belong in Germany\u201d and calls for a ban on the construction of mosques.The anti-European Union, anti-Islam Party for Freedom, led by Geert Wilders, failed to win a plurality in a March 15 election in the Netherlands, finishing in second place.While the results were a setback for a party that had been leading in the polls for much of the campaign, the party is predicted to gain five more seats, 20, than it won in the last election. The party also succeeded in pushing many right-leaning parties to adopt tougher stances on immigration and is likely to influence policies in the new government.A new right-wing party, the anti-European Union Forum for Democracy, won two seats.Jobbik wants to increase government spending on ethnic Hungarians living abroad and to form a new ministry dedicated to supporting them. In a 2012 bill targeting homosexuals, the party proposed criminalizing the promotion of \u201csexual deviancy\u201d with prison terms of up to eight years.In a February interview, Gabor Vona, the party\u2019s leader, denied persistent rumors that Jobbik receives money from the Kremlin, but he did say he would welcome warmer relations between Moscow and Washington.Because none of the mainstream parties would form a coalition with the Sweden Democrats, which is led by Jimmie Akesson, the country is governed by a shaky minority coalition of Social Democrats and the Green Party.The Sweden Democrats\u2019 platform calls for heavily restricting immigration, opposes allowing Turkey to join the European Union and seeks a referendum on European Union membership.The country has recently tightened its immigration rules, making reunification of refugee families more difficult, among other changes.The party, which the Council of Europe\u2019s human rights commissioner described in 2013 as \u201cneo-Nazi and violent,\u201d holds extreme anti-immigrant views, favors a defense agreement with Russia and said the euro \u201cturned out to be our destruction.\u201dGolden Dawn again won 18 seats in parliamentary elections in September, making it Greece\u2019s third-largest party.Party leaders, since released from custody as their trial continues, have said Golden Dawn is planning numerous protests around the country against what they warn is the \u201cIslamization of Greece.\u201dThe National Front is a nationalist party that uses populist rhetoric to promote its anti-immigration and anti-European Union positions.The party favors protectionist economic policies and would clamp down on government benefits for immigrants, including health care, and drastically reduce the number of immigrants allowed into France.The party was established in 1972; its founders and sympathizers included former Nazi collaborators and members of the wartime collaborationist Vichy regime. The National Front is now led by Marine Le Pen, who took over from her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, in 2011.She has tried to soften the party\u2019s image and broaden its appeal. Mr. Le Pen had used overtly anti-Semitic and racist language and faced repeated prosecution on accusations of Holocaust denial and inciting racial hatred.Polls show that she is very likely to reach at least a second round of voting in France\u2019s two-stage electoral process this spring. The party is closer than it has ever been to gaining power in France after over 40 years of existence.Note: The charts shows parliamentary election results.

{"Headline": "U.S. Economy Better Than Thought, but Still Weak", "Date": "2016-05-27", "News": "Supported byThe American economy is picking up speed after a slow start to the year, with resilient consumer spending and a buoyant housing market just about making up for a falloff in investment by cautious companies.But the overall gains are still likely to fall short of what many experts \u2014 not to mention ordinary workers \u2014 would hope to see as the recovery nears the end of its seventh year.These crosscurrents highlight the challenge facing policy makers at the Federal Reserve as they weigh whether to raise interest rates when they meet in mid-June, or wait until July or later in the year.On Friday, the Commerce Department raised its estimate of the pace of growth in the first quarter of 2016 to 0.8 percent, a move driven mostly by better data on inventories and housing. Other areas of the economy, especially manufacturing and mining, still face significant headwinds.One explanation for the hesitancy of businesses to spend is pressure on earnings after several years of expanding margins. The Commerce Department said corporate profits rose just 0.3 percent in the first quarter, after a 7.8 percent drop in the fourth quarter of 2015.\u201cIt just confirms that we had a soft start to the year but not quite as bad as we thought,\u201d Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said on Friday. \u201cBusiness investment was very weak, but the one bit of positive news was a surge in home construction. We\u2019re still in the recovery stage in the real estate market, especially for multifamily buildings.\u201dFor the second quarter, which covers April, May and June, most experts forecast that the pace will pick up to about 2.5 percent.The reports on Friday also suggest that 2016\u2019s economic trajectory will follow an arc that has bedeviled forecasters for years: a soft first quarter followed by a turnaround in the spring even though underlying conditions remain largely the same throughout the period.\u201cThere is better momentum now, but it\u2019s still a bit of a head fake,\u201d said Diane Swonk, an independent economist based in Chicago.In 11 of the last 15 years, a listless January, February and March were followed by a snapback in economic expansion in the next quarter, a trend Ms. Swonk said could not be explained by \u201cpolar vortexes and other one-off factors.\u201d\u201cIt could be everything from a change in the structure of the economy to mismeasurement,\u201d Ms. Swonk said. Government agencies are working to improve their methods, she said, but budgets are tight in Washington and it has been difficult for federal statisticians to keep up with the broader shift from manufacturing to services as a growth engine in recent decades.The seasonal kinks in the data can \u201ccreate a false sense of security,\u201d she said, obscuring the continuing paucity of real economic gains for many Americans over time. \u201cIt was still a tepid quarter even if it was less bad. That doesn\u2019t equal good growth.\u201dAlthough revisions and statistical quirks are nothing new for economists, Ms. Swonk explained that they appeared much larger these days because the overall level of economic growth was low to begin with. \u201cYou notice it much more when you\u2019re skating so close to thin ice,\u201d she said.Just how thin that ice really is has prompted considerable debate within the Federal Reserve and on Wall Street as Fed officials ponder a possible interest rate increase when they meet in mid-June.Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said positive recent indicators like retail sales and buoyant home prices in April strengthened the hand of Fed hawks, although they could wait, because markets remained anxious before Britain\u2019s June 23 referendum on whether to leave the European Union.Next week should provide greater clarity on the economy\u2019s real momentum. On Tuesday, the Commerce Department will report on consumer income and spending in April, and Friday will bring the Labor Department report on May unemployment and hiring, a crucial metric for the Fed.Buried in the details of the gross domestic product report on Friday were signs that inflation was picking up to more normal levels after years of dormancy, Mr. Harris said. In particular, he said, the so-called core measure of consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 2.1 percent in the first quarter, just above the Fed\u2019s 2 percent target.\u201cThis nudges the Fed closer to a rate hike, although June is still very much up in the air,\u201d Mr. Harris said. \u201cThey want to see clear evidence that the second quarter is stronger than the first quarter.\u201dMr. Shepherdson also called the decision a close call in a note to clients on Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019re sticking to our September base case,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we fully accept that June and July are also very real possibilities.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still somewhat startling how different the data are from the widespread impression.So where did the impression come from? One thought: we tend to look at real exchange rates of peripheral economies vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis the European core, which would be sufficient if the euro exchange rate hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t moved much and/or if euro countries were equally affected by euro depreciation. In fact, however, the euro has fallen a lot, and this has very differential effects: it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a big gain for countries like Ireland that do a lot of their trade with non-euro (and non-European) partners, much less for countries like Greece that are more locally focused.In any case, the raw correlation between real exchange rates and trade adjustment is much stronger than I thought, and probably than most people think.Paul Krugman is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times.Advertisement"}

First there were attacks against the Charlie Hebdo newspaper and a kosher supermarket in January 2015 that left 17 victims and three jihadist gunmen dead. Then came much more deadly and extensive attacks in November that targeted a stadium, a concert hall and neighborhood bistros and bars, claiming the lives of 130. President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande declared that France was at war and imposed a nationwide state of emergency that is still in effect.Brussels was attacked in March; reports that those responsible had links to the November Paris attacks and had first wanted to attack Paris have left the impression that the city is not safe.All of that, on top of broader economic trends that have depressed business in many luxury-oriented industries, has resulted in empty tables at some of the city\u2019s finest and best-known restaurants. Lively bistros that cater to local French diners seem to be full; formal, expensive restaurants much less so.To attract clients at lunchtime, Mr. All\u00e9no has introduced a slimmed-down menu of no starter but a perfect main course: for example, a poached fillet of turbot in its juice; pearls of potatoes seasoned with dry fish skin; and cucumber ravioli with smoked cottage cheese. A spiced seaweed tea, bottled water and coffee are included but wine is extra. Yet at 72 euros, it is hardly a bargain for everyday diners.And so the Paris restaurant universe has become more complicated. Luxury hotels are suffering from a downturn because of both fear of terrorism and an increase in short-term apartment rentals, which means fewer concierge restaurant referrals, according to Philippe Faure, the French foreign ministry\u2019s diplomat in charge of promoting tourism. The state of emergency means that many foreign insurance policies will not cover business travelers to France, he said.More foreign visitors who stay in rented apartments rather than hotels are following the lead of some Parisians who are using new high-quality meal delivery services or even hiring private chefs.Michelin-starred restaurants, particularly those in luxury hotels, are suffering the most. \u201cPeople walk in, see that the dining room is empty, and walk to the bistro across the street,\u201d Mr. Faure said.\u201cIt\u2019s creating an atmosphere of anxiety and stress for everyone \u2014 the chefs, the owners, the diners,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois-R\u00e9gis Gaudry, the dining critic for the weekly L\u2019Express, who eats at Paris restaurants daily.\u201cI was in New York after Sept. 11, and your mayor was perfect \u2014 he assured all of us with businesses there that life must and would go on,\u201d he said. \u201cThis message of fear here in France is terrible for restaurants and for the whole economy.\u201dBut for Mr. Faure, there is no choice except to wait it out. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s Paris, only Paris, that is suffering,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rest of France \u2014 the mountains, the sea \u2014 are packed.

{"Headline": "This Was a (Mildly) Disappointing Jobs Report", "Date": "2016-05-06", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsHillary Clinton should be feeling pretty good about the economy, but a little less good than she did before the report\u2019s release at 8:29 a.m. If Donald Trump wants to make assailing the Obama economy a centerpiece of his campaign, he has a bit more of a leg to stand on than he did previously.This was a mildly disappointing report. The total of 160,000 jobs added last month was below the 200,000 forecasters expected, and revisions subtracted 19,000 from the last two months\u2019 previously announced job gains. But those numbers are volatile and probably mean nothing; job gains were even weaker in August and September of last year, and that didn\u2019t signal any meaningful economic slowdown, just the usual ups and downs of these numbers.And for the rubber-meets-road dimension of the economy for most workers \u2014 compensation \u2014 the new data are solid. Average hourly earnings rose by 0.3 percent in April, and are up 2.5 percent over the last year. That\u2019s within the range where wage gains have hovered for years now, but in a time of low inflation it signals meaningful improvement in American workers\u2019 purchasing power.The real bad news in the new data isn\u2019t in the headline numbers but in the details of the survey of American households that generated the (unchanged) 5 percent unemployment rate. For six straight months, the labor force had been growing, including a gangbuster start to 2016 in which 1.5 million more people were counted as either working or looking for work. That was promising news. It suggested that many of the millions who left the labor force during the 2008 recession and the long, slow, recovery were returning.Those numbers reversed in April, though, as the labor force shrank by 362,000 people and the labor force participation rate fell by 0.2 percentage points.This too may turn out to be a statistical blip, but it suggests the buoyant story that was told by the first three jobs reports of the year \u2014 of a big return of disaffected workers to the labor force \u2014 isn\u2019t quite true. Including the April drop, the labor force has increased by an average of 273,000 a month so far in 2016, which is still an excellent result \u2014 but a good bit less excellent than the 484,000 monthly gain that was evident from January through March.For the Federal Reserve, this report will cut two ways. Softer job growth and the reversal on the labor force will weaken the case for raising interest rates in June, while steady wage growth will support the case. On net that will probably make the central bank a little less inclined to move forward with a rate increase than previously, but it\u2019s a close call.But this is the kind of report that shouldn\u2019t lead anyone to radically rethink assumptions about how the economy is doing. Job growth is steady. Wages are rising, faster than inflation but not as fast as workers might prefer. The basic trend of workers rejoining the labor force remains valid, but isn\u2019t as robust as it had seemed based on the first three months of 2016.Only six more months of job numbers to go before the Nov. 8 election. Mark your calendars now as we wait to see whether that basic pattern holds for another half a year.Advertisement"}

Mr. Gove, who is also the justice minister, ruled out a deal like the one that Norway has, which gives the country duty-free access to the 500 million consumers of the European Union in return for financial contributions to the bloc\u2019s budget and agreements to allow European Union citizens freedom of travel and labor.One of the strongest arguments of the campaign to leave centers on immigration: Only if Britain is free of the Brussels bureaucracy, the argument goes, can it truly control its borders. That is why Mr. Gove ruled out the Norway model, although the campaign to leave has not been consistent on this issue. Mr. Gove asserts that Britain could retain duty-free access to the bloc, which some European Union member states have said would not be possible.Britain will hold a referendum on Thursday on whether to leave the European Union, a decision nicknamed \u201cBrexit.\u201dGeorge Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer and the most powerful government official after the prime minister, said that Mr. Gove\u2019s plan \u201cwould be catastrophic for people\u2019s jobs, their incomes and their livelihoods.\u201d Mr. Osborne said that \u201csome people think wrecking the economy is a price worth paying \u2014 I absolutely reject that.\u201d On Monday, Mr. Cameron called Mr. Gove\u2019s plan \u201creckless and irresponsible.\u201dProponents of leaving the bloc have argued that the campaign to remain has been resorting to a \u201cProject Fear\u201d to scare voters into staying.He called the campaign to leave the bloc \u201cProject Fantasy,\u201d saying that the argument that Britain could renegotiate its own trade deals with large countries is \u201crisible.\u201dHe said his \u201ctemporary political alliance\u201d with Mr. Cameron stemmed from their agreement on the importance of the issue.Advertisement"}

That\u2019s the latest nomenclature.\u201dKnown for her grasp of policy, Mrs. Clinton has spoken at length in her presidential campaign on topics as diverse as Alzheimer\u2019s research and military tensions in the South China Sea. But it is her unusual knowledge about extraterrestrials that has struck a small but committed cohort of voters.Mrs. Clinton has vowed that barring any threats to national security, she would open up government files on the subject, a shift from President Obama, who typically dismisses the topic as a joke. Her position has elated U.F.O. enthusiasts, who have declared Mrs. Clinton the first \u201cE.T. candidate.\u201dMrs. Clinton, a cautious candidate who often bemoans being the subject of Republican conspiracy theories, has shown surprising ease plunging into the discussion of the possibility of extraterrestrial beings.\u201cI think we may have been\u201d visited already, she said in the interview. \u201cWe don\u2019t know for sure.\u201dWhile Americans typically point to issues like the economy and terrorism as top priorities for the next president, a desire for answers about aliens has inspired a passionate bloc of voters, who make their voices heard on social media.\u201cThat was a storm, and now it\u2019s like a steady drip,\u201d Mr. Bassett said.The movement viewed Mrs. Clinton\u2019s decision to correct Mr. Kimmel\u2019s use of the term U.F.O., which some view as loaded and rooted more in science fiction than in science, as a breakthrough because it \u201csuggested she\u2019d been briefed by someone and is not just being flippant,\u201d Mr. Buchman said.\u201cThe time to pull back the curtain on the topic is long overdue,\u201d Mr. Podesta wrote in his foreword for the 2010 book \u201cUFOs: Generals, Pilots and Government Officials Go on the Record,\u201d by Leslie Kean, an investigative journalist.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s position is not a political response to public sentiment \u2014 63 percent of Americans do not believe in U.F.O.s, according to an Associated Press poll. But it reflects the decades of overlap between the rise to power of Bill and Hillary Clinton and popular culture\u2019s obsession with the universe\u2019s most mysterious questions.The Clinton presidency also coincided with the hit television series \u201cThe X-Files\u201d and movies like \u201cIndependence Day,\u201d which gave way to an era of fascination with the existence of aliens and the possibility of a government cover-up.Mr. Podesta, an \u201cX-Files\u201d fanatic, ran a fan club for the show in the Clinton White House. \u201cThe \u2018X-Files\u2019 fan club would like to invite you and Mulder to lunch at the White House. Don\u2019t let the boss know,\u201d he wrote in a 1998 email, referring to the show\u2019s fictional F.B.I. agent Fox Mulder, according to White House documents. In 1999, Mr. Podesta had an \u201cX-Files\u201d-themed 50th birthday party that the Clintons attended.When Mr. Podesta left the White House last year, he posted on Twitter: \u201cFinally, my biggest failure of 2014: Once again not securing the #disclosure of the U.F.O. files. #thetruthisstilloutthere.\u201dMr. Podesta declined to comment for this article.He will \u201cwant to talk to you about his interest in extrasensory perception, paranormal phenomena and U.F.O.s,\u201d Mr. Gibbons wrote.The meeting enthralled conspiracy theorists and, in turn, inspired Hollywood writers.When Mrs. Clinton started to talk openly about U.F.O.s and government disclosure in her 2016 campaign, some activists traced the remarks back to the 1995 meeting with Mr. Rockefeller.To this subset of Americans who say the government is covering up what it knows about aliens, and who are incredibly vocal on social media, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s discussion of extraterrestrials signaled an important turn.Other activists do not care as much about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s vow to \u201copen the files,\u201d but do want prominent politicians to seriously acknowledge that humans may not be the only intelligent life in the universe. A major victory, some say, would be for the candidates to be asked about the topic in a presidential debate.\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be a source of embarrassment to discuss it,\u201d said Christopher Mellon, a former intelligence official at the Defense Department and the Senate Intelligence Committee. \u201cWe should be humble in terms of recognizing the extreme limits of our own understanding of physics and the universe.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But the department has a number of tools it can use to try to force compliance, including denying federal funds or asking a court to do so, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.The ultimatum escalated a contentious national debate over North Carolina\u2019s new legal stance on transgender and gay people, and set up what could be a lengthy showdown between the state and the Obama administration.In a statement, Mr. McCrory, a Republican, said: \u201cThe right and expectation of privacy in one of the most private areas of our personal lives is now in jeopardy. We will be reviewing to determine the next steps.\u201dPhil Berger, the president pro tempore of the State Senate, accused the Justice Department of \u201ca gross overreach\u201d that he said \u201cdeserves to be struck down in federal court.\u201d Tim Moore, the speaker of the House, called the letter an attempt to \u201ccircumvent the will of the electorate and instead unilaterally exert its extreme agenda.\u201dThe state measure, House Bill 2, known as HB2, was signed into law in March and says the bathroom a person uses is determined by his or her biological gender at birth. That requirement \u201cis facially discriminatory against transgender employees\u201d because it treats them differently from other employees, Ms. Gupta wrote.As a result, \u201cwe have concluded that in violation of Title VII, the state is engaged in a pattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment of Title VII right by employees of public agencies,\u201d she said. The letter was first reported by The Charlotte Observer.The law has become an issue in the presidential campaign and has prompted boycotts of North Carolina from celebrities like Bruce Springsteen, as well as calls for repeal by a number of businesses, some of which have canceled plans to create new jobs in the state.Opponents cheered the Justice Department\u2019s move.\u201cI think it makes clear what we\u2019ve known all along, which is that HB2 is deeply discriminatory and violates civil rights law in all kinds of manners,\u201d said State Representative Chris Sgro of Greensboro.Matt McTighe, executive director of Freedom for All Americans, an L.G.B.T. rights group, said in a statement Wednesday that \u201cactions have consequences, and Governor McCrory and his legislative allies are now paying the price for this anti-transgender law that they so hurriedly enacted.\u201cHB2 is a solution in a search of a problem that simply doesn\u2019t exist, and lawmakers must take immediate action to fully repeal it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe state\u2019s economy and reputation have suffered enough, and now students all across the state stand to lose out on nearly $1 billion in critical funding because of HB2. The livelihoods of North Carolina\u2019s families are at stake, and there is no excuse for inaction.\u201dIn December 2014, the attorney general at the time, Eric H. Holder Jr., directed the Justice Department to begin including gender identity \u2014 including transgender status \u2014 as a basis for discrimination claims under federal civil rights law.That decision reversed a policy at the Justice Department that specifically excluded transgender people from federal protection. Mr. Holder called the decision \u201can important shift,\u201d meant to affirm the Justice Department\u2019s commitment \u201cto protecting the civil rights of all Americans.\u201dIn addition, the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission held last year that \u201cequal access to restrooms is a significant, basic condition of employment\u201d and that denying access to transgender individuals was discriminatory, Ms. Gupta noted, in her letter to Mr. McCrory.The Justice Department\u2019s threat was not the only front opened Wednesday in the battle over transgender bathroom rights.In Illinois, a group calling itself Students and Parents for Privacy filed a lawsuit against the Department of Education, the Justice Department, Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch and the school directors of Township High School District 211 in Cook County, Ill., seeking to stop the district from \u201cforcing 14- to 17-year-old girls to use locker rooms and restrooms with biological males.\u201dIn November, federal education authorities ruled that the school district, near Chicago, violated Title IX, the federal law that forbids discrimination on the basis of sex in public education, when it did not allow a transgender student who said she identifies as a girl to change and shower in the girls\u2019 locker room without restrictions.The fact that the student, who is biologically male, now uses the bathroom and locker rooms at William Fremd High School, the lawsuit states, creates an \u201cintimidating and hostile environment\u201d for girls, according to the lawsuit, which was filed Wednesday in the United States District Court in the Northern District of Illinois.The suit also asks the court to set aside a Department of Education rule in which transgender students are covered under Title IX.Meanwhile, in Oxford, Ala., the City Council on Wednesday rescinded an ordinance it had passed the week before that forbade people to use a public restroom that did not match their gender at birth, according to the Alabama news website al.com.The news service reported that at least one of the three members who voted to rescind the ordinance in the 3-2 vote was influenced by a city attorney\u2019s opinion that the ordinance might be illegal under Title IX.Eric Lichtblau reported from Washington, and Richard Fausset from Atlanta.

{"Headline": "Entrusted to Save Brazil: The Party That Ruined Rio", "Date": "2016-05-22", "News": "Supported byBut what Mr. Temer did not mention is that his political party and its allies have wielded immense power here in the oil-rich state of Rio de Janeiro for most of the past decade \u2014 and this place needs a whole lot of saving, too.In other words, critics lament, the same party that created a mess in Rio is now running the country.\u201cRio is evolving into a mini-Venezuela as its leaders find new ways to squander Brazil\u2019s greatest oil bonanza,\u201d said Marcelo Portugal, a Brazilian economist.\u201cThis is everything that we did not want happening at this moment,\u201d said Rio\u2019s mayor, Eduardo Paes, a prominent member of Mr. Temer\u2019s party. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to host the Olympics in the current Brazilian environment.\u201dRio\u2019s leaders had promised that the Olympics would showcase Brazil\u2019s triumphs. Instead, as Mr. Temer scrambles to put Brazil\u2019s economy on stronger footing, Rio is emerging as a cautionary tale of what a government led by his Brazilian Democratic Movement Party could mean for the rest of the nation.Some of the top leaders in Mr. Temer\u2019s party \u2014 including the head of the Senate and the former speaker of the lower house of Congress, who was forced to step down this month to face graft charges \u2014 have been accused of accepting enormous bribes.But their party, known as the P.M.D.B., is also coming under fire over accusations of mismanagement and graft involving the Olympics.\u201cRio\u2019s politicians are absolutely disgusting,\u201d said Leonardo Siqueira, 37, a cosmetics distributor. He cited the collapse of the bike path, graft scandals involving public works projects and streets that flood with sewage during rains.\u201cRio is in this crisis because of the P.M.D.B.,\u201d Mr. Siqueira said. \u201cThey are politicians who govern first and foremost for themselves, not for the citizens.\u201dIn a statement, Mr. Cabral said that he never took bribes and that his security advisers suggested using public helicopters to avoid potential attacks from drug gangs.Under Mr. Cabral, Rio carried out a polarizing \u201cpacification\u201d campaign to police the city aggressively and alter its notorious reputation for crime.Then there is Rio\u2019s financial crisis, which is occurring despite the revenue from deep-sea oil fields off its coast. The undersea wealth helped turbocharge the regional economy just a few years ago, thanks to legislation giving state and local governments access to a trove of royalties.Now Brazil\u2019s oil industry is in turmoil as Petrobras, the national oil company, reels from bribery scandals and low energy prices.Rio\u2019s leaders say the fiscal crisis has forced them to delay pension payments to retired state employees. The education budget was slashed, prompting teachers to strike and high school students to occupy more than a dozen schools to protest deplorable conditions.Some factors in Rio\u2019s crisis are beyond the state\u2019s control, like global oil prices and the weak national economy. But wings of government have preserved their privileges while services suffer.Judges recently won a ruling requiring the state to pay them before honoring other obligations. At the other end of the social spectrum, leaders are cutting back. A program created five years ago to provide cash subsidies of about $22 a month to about 200,000 of the state\u2019s poorest residents ran out of money this month.In 2007, Mr. Cabral took the helm of the state government, which oversees major functions like the police. Altogether, the State of Rio has a population of 16.5 million, almost the size of Chile.Mr. Cabral, 53, nurtured an alliance with the governing Workers\u2019 Party of Ms. Rousseff, enabling Rio to land the Olympics and secure federal funds for projects like a subway expansion.In 2009, the P.M.D.B. also took control of the City of Rio, which has about 6.3 million people. The mayor, Mr. Paes, 46, embarked on a frenetic urban overhaul to highlight Rio on the global stage, refurbishing parts of the old center and installing light rail.In the P.M.D.B.\u2019s favor, most venues for the Olympics have been completed, easing concerns about Rio\u2019s preparations for the Games, in August. On a national level, Mr. Temer has named respected economists from outside the party to important posts. And party leaders say they have provided a \u201cmoderating force\u201d in Brazil\u2019s tumultuous democracy.\u201cThe P.M.D.B. is a pillar of governability,\u201d said Renan Calheiros, the head of the Senate.Here in Rio, Mr. Paes emphasizes that the city\u2019s finances are in better shape than the state\u2019s. Still, his administration faces accusations of ineptitude involving some Olympic projects, highlighted by the collapse in April of part of the new coastal bike path.Protesters in Rio, as elsewhere in Brazil, have long complained that their leaders have prioritized lavish mega-events like the Olympics and the World Cup while neglecting essentials like hospitals and schools. It was a central grievance in the protests that shook the nation three years ago.Now, people wonder about Rio\u2019s capacity to solve its problems.Mr. Cabral\u2019s successor, Luiz Fernando de Souza (known by his nickname, Pez\u00e3o, or Bigfoot), who took office in 2014, also came from the P.M.D.B. As Rio\u2019s problems intensified, Mr. de Souza seemed unusually focused on a painting that hung in his office, \u201cDeath of Est\u00e1cio de S\u00e1,\u201d depicting the agony of the Portuguese military officer who founded Rio in 1565.His absence left the lieutenant governor, Francisco Dornelles, in charge. A veteran from the Progressive Party \u2014 which hews to conservative ideas and is closely allied with the P.M.D.B. \u2014 Mr. Dornelles, 81, has suggested suspending interest payments on Rio\u2019s debt to ease the state\u2019s woes.\u201cThe P.M.D.B. and its allies have simply run Rio into the ground through their mixture of corruption and stunning incompetence,\u201d said Marcelo Freixo, a prominent state legislator.The self-described pro-business leaders of the P.M.D.B. in Rio are now embracing policies commonly found in leftist countries. To raise money, the state\u2019s leaders approved taxes of nearly 20 percent on offshore oil production in Rio\u2019s waters.At a time of low oil prices, opponents say, the measure could destroy Rio\u2019s oil industry. \u201cThe tax makes most of the projects in Rio unviable,\u201d said Antonio Guimar\u00e3es, the director of the Brazilian Association of Oil Producers.Despite the grim assessments, some in Rio draw on the city\u2019s history of resilience. Ruy Castro, 68, an author, told the magazine Veja that Rio had an \u201cunrivaled capacity to frustrate those who root against the city.\u201dHe then added a dash of skepticism. \u201cWe\u2019re good at partying,\u201d Mr. Castro said. \u201cNot at legacies.\u201dPaula Moura contributed reporting from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, and Mariana Sim\u00f5es from Rio de Janeiro.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Greece, Some Jewelers Trust in the Future but Others Despair", "Date": "2016-05-12", "News": "Supported byNikos Koulis is an optimist.The Athens-based fine jewelry designer established his namesake brand in 2006, shortly before the global economy nosedived. But over nearly a decade of financial crises that have hit hard in his native Greece, Mr. Koulis has watched his luxury business thrive.\u201cIn a crisis, people who can will spring for value and design as an investment,\u201d Mr. Koulis said, \u201cand those people are coming to us.\u201d He is the best known and most upmarket in a wave of fine jewelry designers to emerge from Greece in recent years.At the Baselworld trade show in March, Mr. Koulis \u2014 classically dapper with a thick mustache, side-swept hair, a neat dress shirt and blazer \u2014 presented new pieces with a graphic quality that is rare in fine jewelry: the Eden collection, with apatite and rubellite checkered with white diamonds and black onyx; and new bridal jewelry with emerald-cut diamonds framed in black or grey enamel.The effect is strikingly contemporary, but Mr. Koulis pointed to Art Deco and geometric patterns from Ancient Greece as source material.While meticulously wiping down his cases at the Basel show (\u201cI love making things perfect,\u201d he said), the designer considered why his jewelry \u2014 high-priced and nontraditional \u2014 has struck a chord even in a difficult economy. \u201cMy designs revisit classic ideas, and that gives people a sense of familiarity,\u201d he said, \u201ceven if they look very modern.\u201dHis aesthetic and his fabrication both rely on links to the past. Mr. Koulis, who produces the majority of his jewelry at his atelier in Athens, gratefully cites the extraordinary talents of his artisans and the long survival of the Greek jewelry craft for his success. The country\u2019s jewelry roots reach back millennia to the Cycladic, Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations and some of the world\u2019s first great goldsmiths, and to the extraordinary jewelry craft of Alexander the Great\u2019s era. \u201cGreece is an ancient country,\u201d Mr. Koulis said. \u201cIts traditions will outlast hard times.\u201dThe designer was born into a family of diamond traders. \u201cI spent my childhood in the shop, playing with gold and stones,\u201d he said. He studied German literature, but was soon drawn back to jewelry and studied at the Gemological Institute of America. Now, as a connoisseur of gems, he travels the world to find the right stones for his jewelry.Mr. Koulis introduced his first bridal line in 2014, seeking to inject freshness into a field he saw as repetitive and unadventurous. He paired geometric diamonds and large, jungle-green emeralds \u2014 \u201cI have a Mediterranean mentality; I like color\u201d \u2014 with his black enamel frames to produce pieces unlike any labeled \u201cbridal.\u201d At the following edition of the Las Vegas Couture show, he won the top prize in the bridal category for his daring approach to the form.In the summer of 2014, he opened his first store, on the island of Mykonos, and his second a few months later in Athens. It seemed like an auspicious period, Mr. Koulis said, as Greece was pulling out of its economic crisis \u2014 but then, in January 2015, with a new government, the country again teetered on the edge of economic dissolution. \u201cIt could have gone badly,\u201d Mr. Koulis said airily, \u201cbut it was our best year yet.\u201dOn Mykonos, luxury travelers visited the new store, and in Athens, the shop was overwhelmed with Greeks looking to put their assets into high-quality jewelry with certified gemstones. \u201cGreeks love buying jewelry \u2014 it\u2019s how they show happiness for special occasions, and it\u2019s how they like to invest their money,\u201d he said.This summer, Mr. Koulis will open his third boutique, on the Greek island of Santorini, another favorite among international tourists.\u201cThe general environment is negative here, and the bureaucracy makes things difficult, but our business is growing, and we\u2019re taking advantage of the best things about living in Greece: the craftsmanship, the culture, the passion for jewelry,\u201d Mr. Koulis said. \u201cPlus we have the sun, the sea and good weather, so how can we not be optimistic? Everything will be great.\u201dA market viewHow does a country in financial turmoil become a hotbed of cutting-edge fine jewelry?\u201cThere were always exciting talents in Greece, but no one ever bothered to export before, because there was a lot of money in the country,\u201d said Yannis Sergakis, who spent 10 years designing for other brands before introducing his own line in Athens in 2014. \u201cWith the crisis, everyone in Greece has had to look abroad for markets, but at least it\u2019s giving firepower to designers to go international.\u201dHe now belongs to Hellenic Wave, a collective that represents Greek designers like Ileana Makri, Venyx and Michael Pelamidis internationally. Its first effort presented the jewelers\u2019 work together at the 2015 Baselworld trade fair.Greece has the European Union\u2019s highest unemployment rate: 24 percent in December, according to the most recent figures from the union\u2019s statistical agency Eurostat. And the government has introduced some extreme measures in an effort to make up for tax shortfalls. Capital controls are limiting transfers and withdrawals of money, as well as diamonds and gold that are vital resources for jewelry businesses, Ms. Makri complained.Mr. Sergakis said business taxes have risen, but the government has not repaid the 23-percent value-added tax on European sales owed to business owners like him. \u201cSometimes I wonder if this is what life in Venezuela is like,\u201d he said. When he opened his first shop in 2014, he added, he believed the country was coming out of its crisis.Ms. Makri opened her Athens flagship store in the same period, and with similar hopes for Greece. She said she had managed to find success, thanks to tourists and wealthy private clients, plus a well-timed introduction of a lower-price line in sterling silver.\u201cIf the situation stays the same for another year, maybe I\u2019ll move to France,\u201d said Mr. Sergakis, who has a strong market there. \u201cBut I love Greece. I don\u2019t want to leave. I want the government to leave.\u201dIt is a stalemate that jewelry designers, even those finding success against the odds, hope will end soon. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to look forward because this cycle must turn upwards at some point,\u201d Ms. Makri said, \u201cbut for now, tough is the new normal.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Real Source of Terror in Bangladesh", "Date": "2016-05-19", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorOn Friday, a doctor in western Bangladesh was hacked to death. Last weekend, it was a Buddhist monk, in the southeastern part of the country. The week before, it was a Sufi Muslim leader, up north. Less than two weeks earlier, it was an L.G.B.T. activist. Just days before that, an English professor.Some of these attacks have not yet been claimed, but they follow a gruesome pattern: There have been at least 25 violent, sometimes public, killings of religious minorities, secularists and free-speech advocates in Bangladesh since February 2015. A dozen more people have been assaulted in similar ways and survived.Of these attacks, more than 20 have been claimed by the Islamic State, about half a dozen by Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent and one each by the indigenous Bangladeshi extremist groups Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh and Ansar al-Islam.The surge is worrying Western governments, which fear that local Islamist terrorists may now be competing for the attention of international jihadist networks or cooperating with them. Several Western countries have responded with antiterrorism measures: Japan is providing aviation security; the United States has called for strengthening cooperation with the Bangladeshi authorities to counter terrorism and violent extremism.This is a predictable reaction, but it is misguided, and dangerous, because it proceeds from the wrong diagnosis.The recent string of vicious killings in Bangladesh is less a terrorism issue than a governance issue: It is the ruling Awami League\u2019s onslaught against its political opponents, which began in earnest after the last election in January 2014, that has unleashed extremists in Bangladesh.A zero-sum mentality has been the rule of Bangladeshi politics since the end of the military dictatorship in 1991. Between then and 2007, the country\u2019s two main parties, the Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (B.N.P.), traded power every term. Whichever one was leading the government focused on enriching itself and weakening the other. That left the private sector largely alone to invest in economic expansion and NGOs to provide education, health care and other social services the government wasn\u2019t delivering.In some respects, the government\u2019s failure to do its job served the country well: The economy has grown by an average of 5-6 percent annually over the last two decades; Bangladesh has outdone India and Pakistan on various social development indicators, such as health care and education. But the country\u2019s political culture steadily deteriorated.Major protests broke out in late 2006, after the then-ruling B.N.P. tried to rig elections scheduled for 2007. The army took over for a time. The Awami League was voted back into office in 2009 and in 2011 used its vast majority in Parliament to remove from the Constitution a clause providing that general elections be overseen by nonpartisan caretaker governments.The B.N.P. boycotted the 2014 election, largely in response to that amendment, and since winning that one-party election the Awami League has been hellbent on turning Bangladesh into a one-party state. The B.N.P. has become the primary \u2014 really, the only \u2014 target of the government\u2019s so-called law enforcement efforts. The Awami League routinely deploys the judiciary and the police against its political opponents and any dissenting voices in civil society.The Awami League\u2019s relentless campaign against the political opposition and civil society has allowed violent radicals of all stripes to let loose. Concentrating the state\u2019s limited judicial and police powers on the B.N.P. and its supporters reduces the resources that can be devoted to preventing terrorism and crime. Using illegal means to quiet perceived opponents undermines the rule of law, creating an atmosphere of impunity that emboldens extremists.The first machete killing \u2014 of a secularist blogger \u2014 occurred in February 2013, before the last general election. The Awami League reacted as you would expect from an incumbent party: Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina left her office to offer condolences to the family and vowed to catch the culprits. But since the party was re-elected, its response to similar attacks has become constructively evasive.Bangladesh has a history of fringe extremist groups. Some of those are a legacy of the war in Afghanistan, in which some Bangladeshis fought; others are byproducts of the Wahhabi influence that Bangladeshi workers in the Persian Gulf brought back when they returned home. But before the string of attacks that started last year, the last known terrorist attack in Bangladesh (by Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh) dated back to 2005.It\u2019s difficult to gauge the current terrorist threat in Bangladesh, especially any links between local and international groups. Whatever its exact nature, however, it is largely the result of the government\u2019s repression against mainstream dissent. Responding to this wave of attacks as though it were principally a security issue, rather than a governance problem, would only make matters worse.This article has been updated to reflect news developments.William B.

{"Headline": "The Gray Swan Theory of Trump", "Date": "2016-05-26", "News": "Supported byBut the unforeseen does have a way of happening. So with the race in a temporary dead heat, it\u2019s worth pondering what unexpected events might pave Trump\u2019s still-unlikely path to the White House.A lot of people would start with the economy, where the idea that we\u2019re just one financial meltdown away from a Trump presidency has become the pessimist\u2019s conventional wisdom lately.The same logic might hold for a mass-casualty terrorist attack on American soil, another oft-cited Trump-versus-Clinton black swan. Of course the details would matter: A mass-casualty terrorist attack perpetrated by a Benghazi-based terrorist cell that slipped its men across the United States-Mexican border would presumably be less than ideal for Team Clinton. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a simple case of \u201cthe worse the blow, the better for Trump.\u201d The Man From Mar-a-Lago is many things, but he isn\u2019t a reassuring figure or a steady hand, and the prospect of putting him in charge in the midst of an enormous national security crisis might give many undecided voters pause.What Trump benefits most from, I suspect, is a more limited sense that things are out of control \u2014 a feeling of anxiety about the world that pulses through your TV set or your computer screen but hasn\u2019t yet hit your neighborhood or family or bank account directly.If this theory is right, then in the fall campaign Trump would benefit more from economic jitters \u2014 stock market hiccups, a spike in gas prices \u2014 than he would from a sudden recession. He would benefit more from another spate of Islamic State beheadings than he would from a terrorist attack that required a major military response, and more from a continuing sense of immigration-driven instability in Europe than from, say, a real confrontation with Vladimir Putin over the Baltics.The same might hold for what Trump needs from the Clintons and their scandals. He probably isn\u2019t going to get the kind of bombshell that actually knocks Hillary out of the running and into federal court. But in a way he wouldn\u2019t necessarily want that, because anything bad enough to wreck her campaign could force her out of the race entirely. Does Trump really want to campaign against a late-entering Joe Biden? I suspect not.A steady drip-drip of scandal, then, might suit his purposes a little better. \u201cIt\u2019s always a mess with Hillary,\u201d Trump has taken to saying, and that\u2019s the narrative he wants confirmed, cycle after cycle, week after week.None of these imagined crises and scandals are at all implausible. What is unlikely is that there will be enough of them, enough of a permanent cascade, to make Trump\u2019s \u201cthere\u2019s something going on, and it\u2019s bad\u201d resonate day in and day out, and overwhelm all the normal reasons people have to vote against him.But that\u2019s probably what he needs: not a black swan, you might say, but a flock of gray ones, startling enough to make his fearmongering seem like wisdom, but never quite so frightening that they dissuade voters from taking a flyer on a man who by rights should instill a different, deeper sort of fear.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lesbos, a Greek Refuge for the War Weary and Vacationers", "Date": "2016-05-24", "News": "Supported byPursuitsOn the island of Lesbos, the slow and rustic rhythms of Greek life rule. Sheep block traffic as they amble across mountain roads, bells clanking. At a seaside tavern, diners nibble on freshly caught calamari under the generous boughs of an old mulberry tree.This is a routine Sunday afternoon at Myrivilis\u2019 Mulberry tavern in Skala Sikaminias, a fishing village of about 100 residents on the northern tip of Lesbos, Greece\u2019s third-largest island. It\u2019s a sharp contrast from last autumn, when the restaurant\u2019s calamari fisherman was busy hauling sea-soaked asylum seekers to dry land, and waiters turned tables into makeshift hospital beds for shipwrecked survivors treated for hypothermia.Since last year, more than a million Middle Eastern migrants (mostly Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis) fleeing war and uncertain futures have risked their lives crossing the Aegean Sea from Turkey on flimsy boats to reach Greece. More than 1,100 people drowned on the way. Nearly 60 percent of migrants landed on Lesbos, thrusting a quiet vacation island into newspaper headlines.The people of Lesbos looked at the newcomers and saw themselves. Most locals are descendants of people who also braved the Aegean Sea, fleeing Turkey or forcibly displaced in the aftermath of World War I. The two brothers who run Myrivilis\u2019 Mulberry are the grandsons of a refugee. They and the majority of Lesbos\u2019 residents received the recent arrivals with almost bottomless generosity. \u201cEverybody asks why,\u201d said Lefteris Stylianou, a tavern owner. \u201cIt\u2019s normal. It\u2019s our mentality.\u201dIslanders call it philoxenia, Greek for \u201clove of the other,\u201d but it has come at a price: Summer tourism bookings are down about 70 percent. Potential tourists fear spending their vacation near refugee camps.They are making a mistake.Lesbos (locals pronounce it Lesvos) remains an enchanting getaway, attracting bird-watchers and orchid obsessives in spring and lesbians in September for the annual International Eressos Women\u2019s Festival at the birthplace of Sappho, the ancient poet who wrote about her love for women and inspired the term \u201clesbian.\u201dIn recent months, aid groups and thousands of international volunteers descended on Lesbos to feed and shelter the migrant arrivals, bringing a festival-like spirit to improvised camps \u2014 even importing food trucks and pagoda tents used in European festivals. \u201cWe saw the similarity between a refugee camp and a party event,\u201d said Adil Izemrane, a Dutch volunteer. \u201cPeople need to drink, people need to have food, people need to go to the toilet.\u201dPope Francis and celebrities like Angelina Jolie and Susan Sarandon also came to show their support. Yet new European Union steps to curb migration mean arrivals have plummeted to fewer than 100 a week, down from the thousands last fall, and many volunteers have packed up and moved to help the bulk of migrants marooned on mainland Greece. Now, even as the sun seekers have been scared away, many of the aid groups and volunteers who replaced them have moved on as well.Lesbos residents say this is a perfect time to visit. Vacationers should not feel as if they are being callous about a pleasure trip to a place still dealing with the migrant influx, residents say, because they would provide vital support to an economy doubly strained by a collapse in tourism and Greece\u2019s financial crisis. A tourist who knows where to look can find monuments to earlier dramas: the graveyard of discarded orange life jackets piled in a field, and a few small graveyards of migrants who drowned on the way.The roughly 4,000 migrants who remain on Lesbos are mostly detained in camps. There is still plenty to do to help. Travelers can volunteer in a large-scale effort to remove boat parts and life jackets from miles of beaches and sea floor, or help distribute food and clothing to migrants stuck on Lesbos. But most of the island remains tranquil, unaffected by the crisis.The two of us, American journalists reporting out of Jerusalem, wanted to meet the people fleeing wars on our doorstep. We felt a personal pull, too, as the descendants of Eastern European immigrants who crossed the sea for a better life in America. And we heard that the island\u2019s ouzo and sardines were among the world\u2019s best. We experienced both faces of Lesbos, an asylum seeker\u2019s portal and a sanctuary of slow Greek rhythms, and came away enriched.A 45-minute flight from Athens landed us in Mytilene, the capital of Lesbos, in late February. We rented a car and headed north for Molyvos, a picturesque town of stone homes and wisteria-covered alleyways that cascade down a hill under a Byzantine fortress, within sight of the Turkish coast. We ambled along the small harbor where octopus tentacles hang to dry before grilling, arriving at the seaside Captain\u2019s Table fish restaurant for dinner. Donations from tourists helped the restaurateur Melinda McRostie found the Starfish Foundation, one of the first grass-roots aid groups on the island. Volunteers unwind in the small dining room, where a bulletin board advertises yoga classes and sharing circles where volunteers can debrief one another about their experiences.The next morning, we joined a retired Canadian teacher, an Australian road tripper and other Starfish volunteers to greet about 50 Syrians and Iraqis in waterlogged shoes, brought ashore by the Hellenic Coast Guard. We distributed bottled water and dry socks, and activated an iPhone\u2019s Wi-Fi hot spot so Mahmoud Qadi, 21, could let his father in Syria know that he and his teenage brother had made it. Boat arrivals are rare now, so Starfish\u2019s international volunteers have been making about 1,000 sandwiches a day for migrants held at a closed facility in the village of Moria.Elsewhere in the Molyvos area, visitors can join the Dirty Girls of Lesvos Island, an islandwide laundry operation founded by an Australian tourist to wash and dry clothing and blankets for people in camps, or the Swedish group Lighthouse Relief, which is leading one of several efforts to clear the beaches of items migrants discarded on their arrival. A short walk from the Lighthouse home base is charming Skala Sikaminias, the village made famous by its fishermen\u2019s valiant rescues.We wound back to Mytilene, a bustling port city, to chop carrots and onions in a food truck that the Dutch group Movement on the Ground drives around Lesbos, serving hot curries at camps. Volunteers are still needed to cook and hand out food, said Mr. Izemrane, a founder of the group. Near Mytilene is the Kara Tepe camp, where the Humanitarian Support Agency seeks volunteers to distribute food, tea and supplies. Although hotel reservations have fallen in most of Lesbos, in Mytilene many budget hotels were filled with volunteers and aid workers.A short drive from Mytilene is Therma Spa Lesvos at the Gera Bay hot springs, one of the island\u2019s five natural thermal baths. We soaked in the quiet, stonewalled chambers, showered with a scented scrub and relaxed in an airy reception hall facing the bay. For five euros (about $5.50) each, it was a steal.We wanted to explore a quieter corner of Lesbos and gambled on Plomari on the southern coast. All we knew was that it is the source of some of Greece\u2019s best olive oil and aniseed-flavored ouzo. We called Myrta Kalampoka, who runs the organic Eirini Plomariou olive oil company with her husband, Nikos, to arrange a tour of their orchards. But when we pulled into the town square, she insisted we first meet them for a glass of ouzo at To Sokaki, a taverna on a narrow side street near the Aegean Sea.Take out your batteries, Ms. Kalampoka instructed, and get on Greek time. So we recharged her way, savoring the locally distilled Barbayanni ouzo alongside a steady march of mezze brought to our sun-drenched table: wild asparagus with eggs; smoked mackerel; and tiny fried red mullet, called barbounia, that we ate whole, head and all. The bill was 10 euros each.Slightly hazy, we climbed into the Kalampokas\u2019 pickup truck and drove to their hillside olive grove to taste their award-winning peppery oil. Ms. Kalampoka said marketing the oil as premium and organic kept their business afloat during Greece\u2019s financial crisis. We spent the evening watching the sun set over a pale blue chapel from the balcony of their simple guesthouse, the Irini Plomari Apartments, perched over a secluded part of the Plomari shore (40 euros).Our lazy getaway ended abruptly the next morning in a forest clearing where Sigrid van der Zee of Pandora Travel Lesvos urged us into her red Jeep for a boisterous ride through muddy mountain roads, beeping for fun as we splashed through puddles. She is a Greek-speaking veteran transplant to the island with a shock of cropped blond hair revealing her Dutch roots, and she wants visitors to experience Lesbos as an adventure, not a crisis. \u201cNo one will come for holidays just because they pity us,\u201d she said.Our first stop was the Myrsiniotissis Convent, built in 1523 and still home to a few elderly nuns. We hiked the hills, following in the footsteps of medieval monks along a weathered stone path lined with wildflowers, to reach the Limonos Monastery, the largest on Lesbos. We explored its tiny rooms where monks once lived and prayed, most notably St. Ignatius, who founded it in the 16th century and is a venerated figure on the island.Leaving the trail, we descended to verdant farmlands along the Gulf of Kalloni and stopped to photograph a flamboyance of pale flamingoes in seaside marshes. In the evening we pulled into Toumba Eco Farm, a cluster of comfortable stone cottages on a mountain overlooking the sea. Horses roamed near the reception lodge. Margarita Niziskioti, the innkeeper, poured us red wine next to a wood-burning stove before we burrowed under down comforters in our cabin for a deep night\u2019s sleep.We left the island just before Europe began to close its doors to migrants in March. The volunteer universe that sprang up on Lesbos has thinned out and largely moved with most of the migrants to mainland Greece. What remains is the warmth, the kind welcome that the locals of Lesbos extended to Middle Eastern strangers \u2014 and to us.Take Tony Petrou, a 75-year-old guesthouse owner. We met him at the Sarandos restaurant in Anaxos, a coastal village 20 minutes southwest of Molyvos. He was nursing a small bottle of Macedonian wine across from our table, and he ordered one for us. We struck up a conversation.Mr. Petrou said he was recovering from surgery at a Lesbos hospital when a Syrian in his 20s stumbled into his room, shivering after a four-hour swim from Turkey. So he gave the young man his jeans and sweater, several sizes too big. \u201cI wanted him to have something warm,\u201d he said. Then Mr. Petrou called his sister: Could she bring him some pants?Mr. Petrou shrugged off his act of kindness. But now that he faces a summer of reduced bookings, it is he who is looking for a lifeline: renewed tourism.\u201cWe need the help,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the island deserves it.\u201dAid groups ask volunteers to contact them in advance to see how they can help, and caution against \u201cvoluntourists\u201d arriving to take selfies rather than helping.These volunteer groups update their activities online and on Facebook:Daniella Cheslow and Daniel Estrin are American journalists covering the Middle East.

{"Headline": "Starry Nights in the Canary Islands", "Date": "2016-05-05", "News": "Astrotourism is taking hold in the Spanish territory, long a favorite of astronomers who have perched powerful telescopes on volcanic peaks.Supported byWay, way out in the Atlantic Ocean, at a point where one of Earth\u2019s four cold water currents meets the searing African desert winds, nights are dark as prehistory. Once the sun sets on the volcanic archipelago known as the Canary Islands, a misty net of extraterrestrial white light blankets the sky from horizon to horizon. Until dawn, every ray of visible starlight in the entire Northern Hemisphere and much of the Southern Hemisphere gathers overhead. That sprawl of sky over a small island speck on the black ocean suggests, like few other experiences, the nanosecond that is human life.Such black nights and clear skies have beckoned astronomers to install some of the world\u2019s most powerful telescopes on volcanic peaks in this archipelago off the northwestern coast of Africa. As scientists use these state-of-the-art observatories to search out signs of the Big Bang, at sea level 8,000 feet below, tens of thousands of mostly British pensioners and brides-to-be on \u201chen parties\u201d are getting drunk and sunburned.Five million tourists annually visit this Spanish territory from colder climes to bask in Europe\u2019s only subtropical weather. The port at Tenerife, the largest island, is the third-most-visited cruise ship destination in Europe.Behemoth floating parties disgorge thousands of passengers daily in wintertime, the high season. Most of them are oblivious to the fact that they have just disembarked on an island with three official, Unesco-sanctioned Starlight Reserves \u2014 locations where efforts are being made to preserve darkness and fend off light and air pollution to protect access to starlight. Only a small percentage of tourists make the two-hour nauseating and twisting ascent to the telescopes \u2014 giant, bulbous white towers, perched at the windy top of Mount Teide.Island officials and the Spanish government are trying to cement the islands\u2019 reputation as a key destination for both amateur and professional astronomers. In 2007, scientists and policy makers from some 50 countries met on the smaller island of La Palma for the first International Conference in Defense of the Quality of the Night Sky, producing a declaration on \u201cprotecting the sky as a basic right for all humanity.\u201dThe Canary Islands telescope sites are run by astronomers at the Institute of Astrophysics (IAC) in Tenerife, a local research organization that operates the European Northern Observatory. The islands have also hosted telescopes from 28 nations over the last few decades.Mount Teide forms a black pyramid at the center of the half-barren, half-green island of Tenerife. Teide is a Unesco World Heritage site and also a designated Starlight Reserve. Teide Natural Park on and around the mountain, with its abundant hiking and proximity to beaches, is said to be the most visited natural park in Spain, according to Unesco, thanks to numerous daily flights into Tenerife\u2019s airports from Barcelona and London.On the highest point on the nearby island of La Palma, at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory, hundreds of researchers work at the Gran Telescopio de Canarias (Great Telescope of the Canary Islands).La Palma, population 70,000, is home to a large colony of scientists and the remnants of a 1960s German commune, and it is also a tiny center for astrotourism. The economy revolves around astronomy, and besides the telescope and research center, there are 13 sky-viewing points on La Palma. Vacationers can even rent telescope-equipped holiday houses and sip a vintage called \u201cstellar wine\u201d from local grapes.By day from some points near sea level on Tenerife, one can see the white columns of the telescopes perched miles high on the old volcano. Researchers use them to literally look back in time at starlight generated millenniums ago, and to advance humanity\u2019s developing perceptions about space and time. The stars they seek out are so far away it takes millions of years for their light to reach our eyes, and for all we know, they may have died already.Tenerife\u2019s astrotourism lure was bumped up in the last few years with the Starmus Festival, headlined by the likes of the late American astronaut Neil Armstrong and other stars of the space world. In the fall of 2014, in a vast conference hall in the Ritz Carlton\u2019s Abama resort, a terra cotta red Moorish-styled compound, Garik Israelian, a Canarian astrophysicist, stood before 600 science aficionados from all over the world, with music from Pink Floyd\u2019s \u201cDark Side of the Moon\u201d blasting from speakers all around.A few hundred yards away, the Atlantic crashed into jet-black rocks and split the blazing afternoon sunlight into spray diamonds, but down in the conference room, travelers from as far away as Canada and China couldn\u2019t have cared less about sun and sea. Everyone had their iPhones aimed at the wheelchair mounted with a black Intel laptop that almost obscured the small, slumped figure of the Cambridge physicist and best-selling author Stephen Hawking.Dr. Hawking, along with Brian May of the band Queen, who earned a doctorate in physics from the Canary Islands astrophysical institute sometime after recording \u201cAnother One Bites the Dust\u201d and other rock anthems, the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, and several astronauts, were among the headliners at the second Starmus Festival in 2014, the pet project of Dr. Israelian.Dr. Israelian is a rocker-scientist who had his own punk band and studied astrophysics in Armenia before emigrating to Spain with his family in the 1970s. He moved to Tenerife and began researching supernovas at the observatories \u2014 with Pink Floyd, Peter Gabriel, Brian Eno and other \u201970s rockers blasting on his earphones.He welcomed attendees standing before a giant LED backdrop of a beam of light slicing through a triangle and splitting into a prism, homage to the cover of Pink Floyd\u2019s \u201cDark Side of the Moon\u201d album, and the sounds of the band\u2019s \u201cBreathe\u201d reverberating through the floor. When the music died down, he talked about the telescopes a few hours uphill.\u201cThe huge eye looking out into space seems to me to be an uplifting symbol of humanity\u2019s eye looking out into the vast universe where we live in such a small corner,\u201d Dr. Israelian said. \u201cBut our species is capable of looking beyond.\u201dThe islands are essential to extraterrestrial exploration now, but they played a key role in earthly exploration as well. Columbus stopped there in 1492, that banner year in the human enterprise of looking beyond. Drifting down the coast of Africa before steering west to discover the Americas, the explorer dropped anchor and fueled up on fresh water and fruit here.The islands were not exactly new to mainland Europeans when Columbus arrived. The origin of their name is the Latin word for dog \u2014 cane \u2014 possibly because, as the ancient Roman author and naturalist Pliny the Elder wrote, early Roman visitors to the islands encountered huge dogs. The small tropical birds we call canaries, native to these islands and others, are named after the islands \u2014 not the other way around.But when Columbus dropped anchor, the islands were still inhabited by a tall, white-skinned people called the Guanches. They lived in the mountain caves, wore goatskins and mummified their dead in the Egyptian fashion. Teide, capped with snow in the winter, and the island\u2019s name, Tenerife, are both words that come from the indigenous people\u2019s name for \u201cwhite mountain.\u201dOn the nearby island of La Gomera, schoolchildren are still taught an indigenous whistling language that those inhabitants of the island used to communicate over distances before the arrival of the telephone.But other than those few words and traditions, for the lost goatskin-wearing natives, Columbus\u2019s arrival heralded the end of language, culture and time. Within two years of the explorer\u2019s stopover, the Spaniards had colonized the islands and eradicated the Guanche, selling the survivors as white slaves on the Continent. What remains of them today are some of their names, like Teide, and words for some of the flowers that grow only along its rocky ridges.After Columbus, the great German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt landed here in the 18th century and explored the islands, identifying one of the four cold water currents in the world drifting past the islands, which partly accounts for the near-perfect weather. The sky is literally cloudless 90 percent of the year.While one side of Tenerife is gray rubble, the islands are mostly fertile, producing kiwi, bananas, mangoes, apples, tobacco and wine. Tenerife is filled with microclimates, green toward the north and barren to the south. In winter, it is possible to swim on the beaches and, an hour later, ascend the volcano and stand in three feet of snow.The islands\u2019 bounty and idyllic \u2014 and strategic \u2014 location made them a colonial prize by the 18th century, and it was here that the Spaniards shot off Admiral Horatio Nelson\u2019s right arm with a cannon while defending Tenerife against the British Navy in 1797. He survived and went home with a condolence prize of casks of sweet Canarian wine, for which the British developed a taste that has not abated to this day. George Washington supposedly toasted the revolution with a glass of it.For modern-day American visitors, the Canary Islands resemble the Caribbean, but possess facilities and characteristics of Europe \u2014 hospitals, low crime, relatively high standard of living, Spanish culture and healthy, delicious food (great tapas, olive oil, indigenous white goat cheese and a local delicacy, \u201cwrinkled potatoes\u201d boiled in salted water until the water evaporates). But the chief difference between Tenerife and, say, Aruba or the Bahamas is the island\u2019s role in international space endeavors.Dr. Israelian conceived Starmus, the island\u2019s science and rock festival in 2011, and its name is short for \u201cstar music.\u201d The concept of music from stars \u2014 unlike the medieval \u201cmusic of the spheres\u201d \u2014 actually has some basis in science and Dr. Israelian has made a study of it.\u201cWhen the first sound waves were detected in stars, about 10 years ago, I realized this whole new branch of astronomy was starting,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have tools to detect those sound waves. They are low frequency, infra-sounds, the timbre is different, but I can take the sound \u2026 and I can move it to our domain, so we can hear it. It\u2019s playing the piano, 10 octaves down.\u201dDr. Israelian, who is compiling a library of the star sounds, likes to think big (he\u2019s working on projects to help Armenian and other orphans in Syria).Dr. Hawking is again expected, along with 10 Nobel laureates, a gaggle of American and Russian astronauts, and Neil deGrasse Tyson, the American astrophysicist, author and television personality, a rock star himself.Among the science-lovers who trekked across the planet for the last Starmus were two Canadians, Gordon MacLaren and Greg Davies. The men, a marketing executive and an engineer, are among Richard Dawkins\u2019s million-plus Twitter followers, and when Mr. Dawkins tweeted about the event, they thought it sounded cool. They each forked out $5,000 for full access tickets, and undertook a 36-hour odyssey, arriving from Toronto just in time to hear Mr. Dawkins give his talk on \u201cA Taxonomy of Alien Life.\u201dWhen told that a single tweet had enticed a pair of Canadians to travel to the remote island, Mr. Dawkins asked if they had traveled together. When told they had, he replied dryly: \u201cThat\u2019s a single data point.\u201d The curmudgeonly atheist biologist was later spotted in a Hawaiian shirt, poolside, amiably chatting with the reborn Christian American astronaut Charlie Duke and his wife, Dorothy, who had come to Tenerife armed with Creationist literature to share with the attendees.The surreal spectacle of the geekfest in paradise reached a peak when more than a thousand people packed a hall for Dr. Hawking\u2019s lecture, and Dr. Israelian produced a 1970s style rock \u2019n\u2019 roll entrance. Dr. Hawking, eyes closed, was wheeled onstage to form the human centerpiece of a flashing light and sound show accompanied by a thundering rendition of \u201cA Hole in the Sky,\u201d by the doom metal band Atoma. Dr. Hawking later said he thoroughly enjoyed the Starmus festival. \u201cIt is a combination of science and rock music, both of which I love,\u201d he wrote in an email. He said he hoped that he would be invited back \u2014 and he was.An article on May 8 about astrotourism on the Canary Islands overstated Columbus\u2019s connection to the islands. While he stopped there in 1492, he did not discover the islands. Other European navigators visited the islands before him.An earlier version of this article incorrectly spelled the surname of an astrophysicist who conceived a science and rock festival in the Canary Islands. He is Garik Israelian, as the article initially indicated, not Israelien.Nina Burleigh is national politics correspondent at Newsweek.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Attacks in Kabul Keep Wall Builders Busy, Turning City Into Labyrinth", "Date": "2016-05-16", "News": "Supported byKabul JournalKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 After bombings in Kabul these days, new concrete blast walls go up, taller than the ones before. Streets leading to V.I.P. homes are blocked to traffic. To drive in certain neighborhoods is to delve into a frustrating game of maze navigation, with surprise barricades popping up overnight.In a grim reflection of life in the Afghan capital, the small blast-wall factories lined up on the city\u2019s outskirts are among the few businesses that have managed to stay basically viable despite the reeling economy. Mixers churn out concrete, and laborers cast it in wooden molds. Trucks ferry the T-shaped walls to spots around the city, one of the most barricaded in the world.\u201cIt is our sad reality: After a suicide bombing, we get more work,\u201d said Noor ul Haq, who has been managing one such small business for six years.\u201cThe week before the bombing, we had no customers,\u201d he said.The dull structures used to be mainly about 11 feet tall, but newer walls are as high as 20 feet, both to repel the force of larger explosions and to block the sightlines of any Taliban snipers.The blast walls have become such an integral part of Kabul\u2019s identity that they blend into the cityscape. Most residents have accepted the narrowing of the roads and roundabouts, the blocking of the views of iconic buildings, as facts of life.\u201cI am proud of my father \u2014 he is not corrupt,\u201d reads one message, in bold black letters, next to an ArtLords mural. It is painted on the blast walls of a building belonging to the Finance Ministry, long considered one of the most corrupt institutions in Afghanistan.In one of Kabul\u2019s main squares, the blast walls protecting a military base are painted light olive. A tiny park, with two benches and some grass and rosebushes, has seemingly grown in front of the walls, providing a respite for visitors to one of the city\u2019s busiest hospitals, around the corner, or the Public Health Ministry, across the road.But the view from the benches is largely blocked by a makeshift rest stall for the police officers stationed at the roundabout. The stall is boxed by blast walls. Beyond the stall, one can see only the taller blast walls of the United States Embassy, a 36-acre complex. The only spot of color in view is the blue tip of the minaret at the roundabout, dedicated to the prominent victim of a suicide bombing.But not for long. As violence in and around Baghdad has picked up again, with bombings a nearly daily occurrence, the Baghdad Operations Command has decided to use the blast walls to build a protective belt around the city. The first phase of the project, which began in February, stretches 62 miles.In Kabul, there has been no serious effort to move the walls out \u2014 security has been getting only worse in recent years.Despite the walls\u2019 hold on the city\u2019s landscape and consciousness, though, the businesses dedicated to them are not exactly thriving. Their best days are over after the drawdown of American forces, whose need to protect their bases was the engine for the wall industry.Around 2010, the Khwajazada Construction Company had contracts for as many as 1,000 blast walls at a time, loading trucks day and night, said Behdar Kohistani, a former teacher who is the company\u2019s office manager. Now the company is left with piecemeal orders from government officials who do not pay on time. The prices have also dropped, to less than $200 per wall from around $400 at the peak.\u201cIt\u2019s been two years that we provided blast walls to three senior officials, and they still haven\u2019t paid,\u201d Mr. Kohistani said.Unlike the Americans, who paid as soon as the walls were delivered, the government is cheap and resorts to recycling, said Mahdi Shahi, who manages a company down the road from Khwajazada. \u201cThey don\u2019t buy new blast walls \u2014 they just bring it from one minister\u2019s home to the next,\u201d he said.To pass time until the next order, after the next blast, Mr. Kohistani, also a prolific poet, composes verses on company stationery.My rising up, for ages now, has shattered doors and walls But only a small corrupt voice shatters my heart.Omar Al-Jawoshy and Tim Arango contributed reporting from Baghdad.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Plan to Raise Taxes on Rich: Just Kidding", "Date": "2016-05-11", "News": "Supported byTax PolicyThe 1 percent can breathe a small collective sigh of relief.In a phone interview on Monday, I sought clarification from Mr. Trump on his remarks about raising taxes on the rich. I asked him whether the highest earners would be paying more than 39.6 percent if he were president.\u201cNo, in fact, you\u2019d be lower than that,\u201d Mr. Trump said.But how, given that he had said that taxes would be going up for the wealthy? Mr. Trump explained that he meant he might have to accept a top tax rate that is higher than the 25 percent his plan calls for. To get his tax plans through Congress, he would probably have to compromise, but even after such concessions, the top rate would be lower than it is now, he said.Congress has not passed some of President Obama\u2019s more ambitious tax proposals, and it may be only slightly more receptive to the next president. Mr. Trump, for instance, would find it particularly hard to slash tax rates if the Democrats controlled the Senate after November. And Mrs. Clinton is highly unlikely to get all she wants if the Republicans keep majorities in both houses.That doesn\u2019t mean that tax issues won\u2019t be prominent in the election. Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton can use their tax plans to define themselves \u2014 and their opponent \u2014 as they woo undecided voters.Mr. Trump\u2019s tax cuts may help win over voters who are concerned about his other ideas or the tone of his campaign.Still, some of his support comes from people whose economic prospects have dimmed as the wealthy have gotten richer. And according to tax analysts, the rich would have a bigger tax windfall than the middle class under Mr. Trump.The Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the center-left Urban Institute and Brookings Institution, calculates that Mr. Trump\u2019s policies would on average give the top 1 percent of taxpayers a federal tax cut of $275,000, or 17.5 percent of their after-tax income, while middle-income households would get a $2,700 tax cut, equivalent to 5 percent of their after-tax income.So, I asked Mr. Trump, why not tax the rich at higher rates than they are subject to today?\u201cI really want to keep taxes for everybody as low as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you start making them too high, you are going to lose people from the country, and oftentimes these are the people who create the jobs.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s tax plans could leave him vulnerable on another front. Budget analysts say that slashing taxes by the amounts he envisions would lead to a sharp drop in revenue. The Tax Policy Center estimates a drop in revenue of $9.5 trillion over 10 years. To put that sum in perspective, the federal government took in revenue of $3.2 trillion last year. If spending were not cut in response, and a much faster-growing economy did not provide a lot more revenue, the federal government would have to borrow to cover the shortfall, pushing up the national debt.Mr. Trump, for his part, disputes the notion that steep declines in revenue would result from his tax cuts. \u201cThose numbers are crazy,\u201d he said, noting that the economy grew strongly after the big Reagan tax cuts. (It\u2019s worth noting that the economy also grew strongly after tax increases by Bill Clinton.)And what if Mrs. Clinton says she is the fiscal conservative and he is not? \u201cBut she\u2019s not going to get the economy going,\u201d Mr. Trump said.By focusing her tax increases almost entirely on the wealthy, Mrs. Clinton says she does not have to squeeze more from the middle class. That stance helps her strike a chord with voters who are concerned about income inequality and, if she locks up the nomination, could help her pull in Bernie Sanders supporters in November.Mr. Trump, in addition to cutting income taxes for the rich, intends to get rid of the estate tax altogether.Still, there are elements of his plan that he might highlight if he is accused of favoring the wealthy. Like Mrs. Clinton, he wants to reduce or eliminate deductions for the rich. When I asked Mr. Trump what type of deductions he intended to limit, he said, \u201cWe are preparing a list of the various deductions and we are going to release that next week.\u201dMaybe then the 1 percent will be able to see if there is anything to fear from Mr. Trump.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Growth Rate Weighed Down by Inaction", "Date": "2016-05-17", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneBack when \u201cGunsmoke\u201d was on TV and Lyndon Johnson was president, the United States economy managed to storm ahead by nearly 5 percent a year for nearly a decade. What we would give to recover some of that power!During Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidency two decades later, the rise in the economic cycle, coming out of what was then the worst downturn in the post-World War II era, averaged a bit over 4 percent a year. By the time George W. Bush lived in the White House, the rebound from recession delivered an average growth rate of under 3 percent.You want to know how much bounce it has now? In the seven years since the United States emerged from the Great Recession under President Obama, annual growth has averaged just about 2 percent.The bad news? Unless business and government do something to improve the economy\u2019s underlying capability, the United States will be lucky to achieve even that paltry growth rate over any sustained period of time.\u201cThe growth we have experienced has gained from a massive cyclical tailwind,\u201d Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary who also served as President Obama\u2019s chief economic adviser, told me.But that cyclical tailwind \u2014 bolstered by putting idle resources back to work, which brought the unemployment rate down to 5 percent from 10 percent \u2014 is spent. The jobless rate will not fall from 5 percent \u2014 close to what economists consider full employment without excessive inflation \u2014 to zero.What remains is an economy at the mercy of two powerful dynamics. The first is a gradual shrinking of the work force as a share of the population, as it is squeezed by successive waves of retiring baby boomers and no longer gaining from the one-time surge of women into the paid work force in the 20th century. The second is a persistent decline in productivity growth over the last dozen years.Lakshman Achuthan of the Economic Cycle Research Institute adds it up this way: Over the next five years, labor force growth of half a percentage point plus productivity growth of half a percentage point will push the economy ahead at the anemic pace of just 1 percent a year.The Federal Reserve was able to help engineer a recovery from the recession, but there is little the Fed can do to change the economy\u2019s underlying prospects. \u201cMonetary policy can\u2019t deal with structural problems,\u201d Mr. Achuthan said. \u201cThe litmus test for any policy is, what impact does it have to improve productivity or demographic growth?\u201dAmerica\u2019s stagnant outlook is important: Debt is a bigger burden in slow-growing economies. Paying for a growing number of retirees becomes more onerous. How the pie is divided becomes a tougher political problem in economies that don\u2019t grow.This stagnation, exacerbated by the fact that most of the income gains the economy has managed to achieve have gone to the upper crust, underlies much of the anger coursing through the public this election year.On its own, raw growth isn\u2019t enough. But without decent growth, combined with policies to maintain low unemployment, there is little prospect of improving the fortunes of the less well-off.While Donald J. Trump exploits that anger, his grab bag of proposals \u2014 deporting a large share of the work force; offering multitrillion-dollar tax cuts, mostly for the rich, that would only further widen inequality; blocking trade with much of the world; maybe raising the minimum wage, maybe not \u2014 would do nothing to bolster growth. But don\u2019t worry, it will be great.Voters should not let the candidates avoid the tough questions: What, if anything, can and should be done to enhance the economy\u2019s ability to grow? Should the prospect of long-term stagnation inform policy more directly?At the very least, the dismal forecast calls for the government to prepare for another bout of fiscal stimulus. The recovery by now is already seven years old. With interest rates near rock bottom, the Fed would have little room to prevent another spike in unemployment if the economy were to falter.\u201cStudents learn in Economics 101 that lower taxes and/or higher levels of government spending can mitigate recessions by boosting aggregate demand,\u201d he writes. \u201cThat simple Keynesian idea should be no more controversial today than Darwinian natural selection or global warming.\u201dBut it is. Many Republican politicians reject all three ideas. And as long as the G.O.P. is in control of Congress, that party will have its hand on the nation\u2019s spending levers.The long term is even more challenging.Some experts, like John G. Fernald, a senior researcher at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, share the view of the budget office that productivity will advance by roughly 1.5 percent a year, returning to its average pace since 1970. That would mean little more than 2 percent annual growth.Is that the best the United States can do? Not necessarily.Productivity has slowed to a large extent because hiring is growing faster than capital investment. That means each new worker is most likely not just less skilled but also has less capital to work with, less help from machinery or software to increase output and generate income. One way to increase productivity would be to provide an incentive for capital investment, perhaps with a business tax overhaul that would lead corporations to repatriate the money they are keeping abroad.Relaxing restrictions on educated immigrants would also increase entrepreneurship and investment. Subsidizing child care might encourage more mothers to return to the work force faster. Eliminating onerous regulations \u2014 things like occupational licenses that restrict eligibility for a variety of jobs and overly tight zoning laws that prevent the building of new homes \u2014 would improve economic efficiency and equity.More focused training could substantially enhance the human capital of the work force. Public investment to revamp the nation\u2019s crumbling infrastructure would not only produce jobs for underemployed construction workers, it would also deliver a big productivity boost.How much bang would this deliver for our bucks? Mr. Summers says better policies could add from a half to a full percentage point to growth. And he holds out hope that substantial investments in advanced technologies that have not yet shown large productivity benefits will eventually do so.But even with the best of intentions, cautions Douglas W. Elmendorf, a former Congressional Budget Office chief who is now dean of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, \u201cwe are not going to get back to 3 percent with anything we know how to do now.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China's Middle-Class Anxieties", "Date": "2016-05-10", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 \u201cHow do you get your money out of China?\u201d a wealthy friend asked me recently. I told him that I visit Hong Kong often, and on each trip I take 20,000 yuan, or about $3,100, the legal maximum, which I then exchange for Hong Kong dollars and leave in a local bank account. My friend, who has a much bigger financial portfolio than me, appeared disappointed. At $3,100 a trip, my method isn\u2019t a realistic way for him to get his riches out.In the last year, as the stock markets have tumbled and the renminbi has slowly lost value, many Chinese people like my friend have been seeking ways to move money abroad. The government has responded by adopting new measures to staunch the outflow of money, but people are finding ways around the restrictions. Individuals and companies have moved about $1 trillion out of the country in the last year and a half.The capital flight is a sign of how the Chinese have become more insecure about their future. Economic insecurity adds to the standing list of worries about daily life that includes pollution and tainted food and water. The recent discovery that millions of compromised vaccines were given to children has further incensed the public.Then there are the things the Chinese only whisper about: the stifling of public debate, the undermining of the rule of law, the flouting of due process.Social media has been awash with threads about anxiety with titles like \u201cThe 10 anxieties of the middle class\u201d and \u201cWill the middle class become the new poor?\u201d Young urban professionals have widely shared an article social media app called \u201cGuide on safe passage through the economic crisis.\u201dSome of the concern is to be expected in a slowing economy \u2014 but the worrying goes deeper.Discussions about how to get money out of the country, or converted into a foreign currency, are common. A recent survey by The Financial Times found that 45 percent of Chinese middle-earners wanted to trade at least 10 percent of their savings for foreign currency, while another 29 percent had already done so.And, of course, as the Panama Papers recently showed, even family members of China\u2019s top leaders are squirreling money into off-shore accounts.More people are trying to leave the country. In fiscal 2014, 76,089 Chinese were awarded permanent residency status in the United States, up by 4,291 from the previous year. Of the 10,692 investment visas provided by the United States in the 2014 financial year, 9,128 went to Chinese nationals, up about 30 percent from the previous year. Meanwhile, 88 percent of Australian \u201csignificant investor visas\u201d have been given to Chinese citizens. Investment visas show not only an interest in leaving China but also a desire to move money out of the country.Students, too, are increasingly looking to put down roots abroad. In the 2014-15 academic year, at least 304,040 Chinese students were studying in the United States, up about 110,000 from 2011-12.The authorities are acting in a typically draconian fashion to stem the exodus of capital and people. Changing renminbi for foreign currency has become much more difficult. It\u2019s an even bigger hassle to transfer money overseas. There is a cap of 10,000 renminbi a day and a limit of 100,000 renminbi a year on overseas withdrawals through China\u2019s largest A.T.M. network.In the past year there has been a stream of reports on crackdowns against organizations offering underground money transfer services. At the same time, the government has created even more obstacles to the cross- border purchase of U.S.-dollar-denominated insurance plans.And officials are increasingly requiring people to hand over their passports. In 2003, government employees were restricted from leaving the country for personal reasons. While this restriction was only applied to high-level officials, in the era of Xi Jinping, handing over your travel documents has become normal, even for low-level government employees. In late 2013 in Guangzhou, more than 2,000 village officials were required to surrender their papers. And in Beijing, Sichuan and many other places, even university employees and the lowest level cadres have been obliged to do the same.As for the public\u2019s weakened confidence in the government, the attitude from Beijing seems to be, Who cares? In February, a new lavishly state-funded website, The Paper, posted a glib opinion piece claiming that the anxieties of the middle class can be attributed to their fear of being \u201cbeaten back to their original condition\u201d as peasants and urban poor.This dismissive tone reveals another truth: Middle-class worries may accelerate the outward flow of capital and people, and further isolate the government, but they are unlikely to lead to meaningful change.Ultimately, too many middle-class people benefit from the system. Nearly half of the urban middle class are employed by government organizations or state-owned enterprises. Their misgivings with the government come from something they can\u2019t divest: their identity. This cognitive dissonance is typical of nearly everyone I know. They get that the cause of their various discontents is the one-party system, but they also appreciate that the system underwrites their comfortable lives.I have a friend who is successful by most measures. The city he lives in is big, his job respectable, his income stable, his apartment spacious. He doesn\u2019t like the Communist Party and has many complaints about the political system.But he, like so many others, is in no rush to see political change. \u201cDemocracy is good,\u201d he said to me recently, \u201cbut I don\u2019t hope to live to see it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Eurozone Agrees to Debt Relief and Bailout Aid for Greece", "Date": "2016-05-24", "News": "Supported byEurozone finance ministers also gave a green light for the next round of aid for Greece, money that would allow the country to pay bills in the coming months. Further final approvals for those disbursements will be needed, but ministers allocated 10.3 billion euros, or about $11.5 billion, for Greece, to be distributed in several stages starting with \u20ac7.5 billion as soon as the second half of June.The I.M.F. has painted a dark picture, insisting that Greece cannot meet its budget goals. It has outlined particular demands on the cost and timing of the debt payments. Although the discussion Tuesday night on debt relief looked as if it could be enough to bring the I.M.F. into the bailout, officials signaled that hurdles remain.The European heavyweight in the bailout, Germany, has a more upbeat outlook and remains profoundly skeptical of cutting Athens more slack. Some economists warn that Greek politics are unstable, and that a new government might not be prepared to make alterations later in exchange for debt relief now.\u201cThe fund needs to stick by rules. It can\u2019t fund countries with unmanageable debt loads if it wants to remain part of the world\u2019s most high-profile bailout,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, the Europe director for the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy. \u201cThe Germans need to prove their medicine of austerity and bailouts still works.\u201dThe two sides did find some common ground.The I.M.F. \u201cmade a major concession,\u201d Poul M. Thomsen, the director of the fund\u2019s European department, told a news conference Wednesday morning. \u201cWe had argued that these debt relief measures should be approved upfront, and we have agreed that they will be approved at the end of the program period.\u201dMr. Thomsen said the steps taken by Greece and the debt-relief plans outlined by European lenders should \u201cform the basis for I.M.F. support.\u201d But he also emphasized that the I.M.F. would have to carry out another analysis of the Greek economy before joining the bailout.In recent days, European officials have also been discussing a debt swap that would help Greece. That proposal calls for Europe to buy a portion of the I.M.F.\u2019s loans to Greece and then allow Greece to borrow more money at a lower rate.Asked about those plans, Mr. Thomsen said there was \u201cno concrete proposal\u201d for such a buyout, but he suggested that such a step would be helpful.European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.This type of deal could help appease the I.M.F. because it would effectively cut Greece\u2019s debt costs. It could also mollify Germany, where lawmakers want assurances that the fund will be comfortable participating in the bailout.How much of a dent the plans will put in Greece\u2019s debt after three bailouts in six years was unclear on Wednesday morning. The country has more than \u20ac300 billion in debt, amounting to roughly 180 percent of its gross domestic product.Greece was promised debt relief last summer under the terms of a bailout of \u20ac86 billion. The I.M.F. has said it will not contribute to the rescue effort until Greece\u2019s debt load is addressed.Yet the Germans have largely blocked debt relief. Last month, the German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, insisted at I.M.F. meetings in Washington that it was \u201cnot necessary,\u201d saying it would distract Greece from taking steps to transform its economy.With Germany and the I.M.F. at an impasse, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch politician who leads the Eurogroup, sought to broker a compromise in recent weeks. From his country home in Wageningen, the Netherlands, Mr. Dijsselbloem spent most of the first week of May drafting a three-stage plan, according to two people briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity.In the short term, Athens would get money to reduce its debt, and payment terms would be adjusted at the margins. In the medium term, Greece would get longer grace and payment periods. And in the long term, there could be more far-reaching, though unspecified, measures.But the proposal hit an obstacle when eurozone finance ministers convened in Brussels this month.Mr. Dijsselbloem\u2019s short-term plan, according to the two people briefed on the proposal, called for allowing Greece to tap profits on its bonds that were made by the European Central Bank and eurozone central banks. The bonds, bought at fire-sale prices in the depths of the crisis, have since gone up in value, and the profits would give Greece a bit more leeway in the next couple of years.But Mr. Sch\u00e4uble suggested it would be difficult to get German lawmakers to approve the move, and pushed to make the transfer an option only after 2018, the two people said.The Dutch official redrafted the plan, and the finance ministers reached a consensus that they put to the I.M.F. A few days later, the I.M.F. raised the stakes, recommending that Greece\u2019s interest payments to the eurozone be fixed at 1.5 percent for up to 40 years.With the I.M.F. and Germany sticking firm, the situation set off a flurry of back-room diplomacy ahead of the meeting of the Group of 7 industrial nations in Japan.Over the weekend, Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew of the United States urged Mr. Sch\u00e4uble to put Greece\u2019s debt on a sustainable path through \u201cmeaningful debt relief.\u201d Like the I.M.F., the United States has leaned hard on Germany to give easier terms to Athens to help preserve stability in the Europe.Referring to the short-term aspect of the debt relief plans that emerged Wednesday morning, Mr. Dijsselbloem told the news conference that \u201cit\u2019s difficult now\u201d to say \u201cwhat in economic terms the impact of that will be.\u201d\u201cSome may say \u2014 I have heard it twice now \u2014 that the package is not ambitious,\u201d Mr. Dijsselbloem also told the news conference. But \u201cwhat the Eurogroup has put on the table here\u201d for short-term and medium-term debt relief \u201cis something that a month ago I couldn\u2019t have dreamed of that the ministers would have agreed to,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Would It Take for Donald Trump to Deport 11 Million and Build a Wall?", "Date": "2016-05-19", "News": "Supported byDonald J. Trump\u2019s vow to restore what he says is America\u2019s lost luster, while perhaps not as flowery, comes with campaign promises that are equally grandiose. But Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, has typically provided scant details on how he might make good on his promises \u2014 and ambitious ideas, even the concrete kind, do not always add up.Mr. Trump has suggested he will flesh out his ideas in a forthcoming speech. But experts across many fields who have analyzed his plans so far warn that they would come at astronomical costs \u2014 whoever paid \u2014 and would in many ways defy the logic of science, engineering and law.Mr. Trump has a simple plan to reduce the population of 11 million immigrants living illegally in the United States: Deport them.How? He says he would follow the example of the military-style roundups authorized by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1954. The initiative, known as Operation Wetback, expelled hundreds of thousands of Mexicans.Mr. Trump contends that the start of deportations would show immigrants he meant business and prompt many to leave on their own, and that it would take about two years to finish the job. There, the specifics end.Former senior immigration and border officials are skeptical, to put it mildly. Deportations have peaked recently at about 400,000 a year, so the increase in scale to reach Mr. Trump\u2019s goal would be exponential. And many legal procedures and constitutional constraints on the police did not exist in the Eisenhower era.\u201cI can\u2019t even begin to picture how we would deport 11 million people in a few years where we don\u2019t have a police state, where the police can\u2019t break down your door at will and take you away without a warrant,\u201d said Michael Chertoff, who led a significant increase in immigration enforcement as the secretary of Homeland Security under President George W. Bush.Finding those immigrants would be difficult, experts said. Police officers across the country would need to ask people for proof of residency or citizenship during traffic stops and street encounters. The Border Patrol would need highway checkpoints across the Southwest and near the Canadian border. To avoid racial profiling, any American could expect to be stopped and asked for papers.To achieve millions of deportations, the Obama administration\u2019s focus on deporting serious criminals would have to be scrapped, said Julie Myers Wood, a director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, also known as ICE, under Mr. Bush. \u201cYou would not care if the person had a criminal record,\u201d she said.Large-scale raids, rare under Mr. Obama, would resume at farms, factories, restaurants and construction sites, with agents arresting hundreds of workers and poring over company records. And prosecutors would bring criminal charges against employers hiring unauthorized immigrants.Mr. Trump has said he would triple ICE\u2019s deportation officers, to 15,000 from about 5,000. But even if that could be accomplished quickly \u2014 difficult given the vetting and training required \u2014 it would still be insufficient, experts said. The F.B.I. and other agencies would have to set aside some of their missions to help.John Sandweg, who led ICE for seven months under Mr. Obama, said wholesale deportations could make it easier for immigrant gang members and drug traffickers to escape detection. \u201cIf the agents are looking for volume, they won\u2019t spend the time to do the detective work tracking down the high-value bad guy who has fake documents, the hardened criminals in the shadows,\u201d he said.To prevent flight after arrest, the authorities would have to detain most immigrants awaiting deportation. Existing facilities, with about 34,000 beds, would have to be expanded to hold at least 300,000, Mr. Sandweg estimated, perhaps with tens of thousands of people in detention camps, similar to the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II.Most deportations must be approved by judges. But backlogs in the 57 immigration courts are already severe, with waits as long as two years for a first hearing. The federal government would have to open dozens of emergency courts and hire hundreds of judges, shortcutting the painstaking selection process.There is deep concern among Republicans about political divisions and the future of the party, a new Times/CBS News poll shows. We want to hear from the party\u2019s longtime members or those who have just registered as Republicans.The millions of immigrants from Central American countries, China, the Philippines, India and other noncontiguous nations would have to be flown home at the federal government\u2019s expense. Arranging flights would in itself be a huge and very costly task.At the border, where illegal crossings have fallen to the lowest levels since the 1970s, the Border Patrol would face a rush of newly deported immigrants trying to return, experts said. \u201cMany of these people have been here for decades,\u201d said David V. Aguilar, who was the chief of the Border Patrol and then the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection. \u201cWe should expect an immediate effort to reunify with the family left behind.\u201dMr. Aguilar said a surge of returning deportees could divert the Border Patrol from the fine-tuned hunt for terrorists trying to infiltrate the country, now its top priority.Ms. Wood said mass deportations would add chaos to a dysfunctional immigration system.But the proposals\u2019 main flaw, former officials said, is that they are unrealistic. \u201cUnless you suspend the Constitution and instruct the police to behave as if we live in North Korea,\u201d Mr. Chertoff said, \u201cit ain\u2019t happening.\u201dMr. Trump has promised that the wall will be big, beautiful, tall and strong. Spanning 1,000 miles along the southern border, it will stem the flow of immigrants bringing drugs and crime. And, yes, Mexico will pay for the Great Wall of Trump, as he has called it.But the wall \u2014 symbolic of an iron-fisted immigration policy and providing a rallying cry for his supporters \u2014 has proved to be as divisive in theory as it would be in practice. And experts in domestic security, immigration policy and civil engineering say that building it would be a daunting task and cause more problems than it would solve.Mr. Trump has shared few details. He has said that the wall would be built from precast concrete and steel and that it could be 50 feet tall, if not higher. After calling for it to extend across the entire 2,000-mile southern border, he more recently said half that length could be sufficient because of natural barriers. He has pegged the cost at $4 billion to $12 billion, most recently settling on around $10 billion.Some see that as low. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of logistics involved in this, and I don\u2019t know how thoroughly they\u2019ve thought it out,\u201d said Todd Sternfeld, chief executive of Superior Concrete, a Texas-based builder of walls. \u201cThe resources alone would be astronomical.\u201dMr. Sternfeld, who has led major wall projects across the country and approached the Trump family last summer, suggested that Mr. Trump was overly optimistic about the cost and was underestimating the complexity of the undertaking.Running the numbers, Mr. Sternfeld said a 40-foot-tall concrete wall using a \u201cpost and panel\u201d system that went 10 feet below the ground \u2014 to minimize tunneling \u2014 would cost at least $26 billion. The logistics would be nightmarish, including multiple concrete casting sites and temporary housing for a crew of 1,000 workers if the job were to be completed within Mr. Trump\u2019s first four-year term.Maintenance would be an additional recurring expense, said Walter W. Boles, an engineering professor at Middle Tennessee State University who specializes in concrete construction. Deep trench work would also be necessary for keeping a wall of that height from toppling, he said, and seismic sensors to detect digging would be wise for preserving its integrity from below.\u201cThat\u2019s one heck of a construction project,\u201d said Mr. Boles, who assessed Patrick J. Buchanan\u2019s 1996 proposal for a border barrier. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly a lot more ambitious than I was imagining.\u201dThad Bingel, the chief of staff at Customs and Border Protection during the Bush administration, said the fence offered a cautionary tale. It became mired in lawsuits and environmental controversies that sowed deep anger along the border, and required the extensive use of eminent domain, a practice that Mr. Trump has been criticized for using to seize private properties for his big developments.A wall would be even more complicated, requiring redirection of water so that concrete could be mixed on location, difficult work on rocky terrain and a potential disruption of archaeological sites. Also, Mr. Bingel said, a solid wall could hamper border agents by blocking their view of the wall\u2019s other side.Setting aside the need for congressional approval and a likely fight with Mexico over financing, many who study borders doubt that a mass of concrete would accomplish its purpose. From the ancient Great Wall of China to Israel\u2019s modern security barrier, walls rarely prove totally impervious to people set on traversing them.Walls tend to be crude solutions to complex problems and are evidence of geopolitical failure, said Michael Dear, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who specializes in the border with Mexico.What about the water?Billions of gallons flow between the United States and Mexico, funneling lifeblood to farms and communities on both sides of the border. The Colorado River sends water south; the Rio Grande, a natural boundary for hundreds of miles, delivers precious water from Mexico, through dozens of canals, to much of South Texas.Water experts in the Southwest question how Mr. Trump\u2019s border wall could accommodate those crucial flows and still provide the barrier he wants.Another complication is that a nearly 50-year-old treaty between Mexico and the United States prevents any construction that obstructs or diverts the flow of the waterways. The wall, in other words, could not interfere in any way with the flow of water in either direction.\u201cWe\u2019ve been joking: How big does the hole in the wall have to be to let the water run through it?\u201d said Patricia Mulroy, a Brookings Institution senior fellow and former Nevada water official.One option would be a wire fence, but that would catch all sorts of trash. \u201cThere are going to be consequences for any kind of fence you build,\u201d said Gabriel Eckstein, a water law expert at Texas A&M University.Asked whether the proposed wall might impede water flows, Hope Hicks, a Trump spokeswoman, did not directly respond. \u201cThe proposal speaks for itself,\u201d she said, adding that details could be found on Mr. Trump\u2019s website. But the site does not address water flows.Complicated environmental science and a fraught diplomatic history await anyone seeking to determine how to build a wall that cuts off the flow of people without violating the nation\u2019s water treaty obligations.Experts on those subjects, in interviews, were skeptical that one would ever be built. They speculated that the financial and political challenges were too great, among other reasons.With the will and the financial wherewithal, though, an engineering solution can be found, said Sally Spener, the United States secretary for the International Boundary and Water Commission, which manages the water relationship between Mexico and the United States.But she acknowledged longstanding and delicate water-sharing issues between the United States and Mexico \u2014 a point emphasized by Michael Connor, deputy secretary of the Interior Department, who has worked closely with Mexico on those subjects.A wall could be built that accommodates water flows, Mr. Connor said, but \u201cthe question becomes, when does it become economically significant to address those issues?\u201d(Officials from the Bureau of Reclamation, which reports to Mr. Connor, said they could not quantify the cost given that they had not envisioned or studied such a project.)A bigger concern, he said, was the addition of a potential major wrinkle into the delicate bilateral diplomacy over water sharing. \u201cAny proposal that would threaten that relationship or trust we\u2019ve built would concern me,\u201d Mr. Connor said.Several treaties, particularly one from 1944, outline rules for sharing water from the Colorado River, the Tijuana River and the Rio Grande.It is a complex system that involves water flowing down the Colorado River through Nevada and Arizona into Mexico, and down the Rio Grande from New Mexico into Mexico, where it is replenished by major tributaries before turning to Texas. (On the United States side, the Rio Grande watershed alone includes well over four million people.)Mexico countered that it did not have the water because of drought \u2014 a position that some American environmentalists said was valid.As part of that agreement, Mexico agreed to share some of its water supply from the Colorado River so that the water could be retained in Lake Mead, near the Nevada-Arizona border. That situation worked out well, highlighting friendly but delicate relations.\u201cI was there, and I know the hurdles we had to overcome to assure them we weren\u2019t manipulating the system,\u201d said Ms. Mulroy, from Brookings.\u201cWe are dependent on the Mexicans trusting us,\u201d she said. \u201c It\u2019s an enormous diplomatic issue.\u201dWith a wall, Ms. Mulroy said, \u201cthe chances of another cooperative agreement would be nil.\u201dDonald J. Trump is set to be the Republican standard-bearer, but when it comes to some of his policies, he is out of sync with many Republican leaders in Congress.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What to Make of the Latest Strike in Greece", "Date": "2016-05-06", "News": "Supported byQ & AATHENS \u2014 Greek workers walked off the job on Friday, heeding a call by the country\u2019s labor unions to join a three-day general strike to protest a new round of austerity measures including new pension cuts and tax increases.The walkout, the second general strike this year, halted public transportation services, shut down government offices and closed schools. Here is a look at why Greeks are striking again, and where the country\u2019s tortuous debt negotiations stand:Greece\u2019s two biggest labor unions, which together represent about 2.5 million workers, object to a new round of austerity measures that Greece must adopt to receive fresh bailout funding.The measures include an overhaul of the Greek social security system, involving cuts to the pensions of new retirees and higher social security contributions. They also require increased rates of income tax, a rise in the top level of the country\u2019s sales tax, and higher levies on alcohol and cigarettes.The unions have denounced the measures as a \u201cguillotine\u201d for Greek society, which has suffered six years of austerity measures that have cut household incomes by a third and left a quarter of Greeks unemployed.Social upheaval has been mounting in recent weeks with workers holding sit-ins at city halls and landfills across the country, leaving trash piling up. Greek farmers, who blocked national highways in February to protest pension cuts, are planning to drive their tractors into Athens at the weekend in a symbolic protest.Greece says it has agreed with its creditors on a \u20ac5.4 billion package of austerity measures, and Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for economic and financial affairs, has said the two sides are \u201c99 percent of the way there.\u201dThe legislators are expected to approve the package on Sunday, but the meeting on Monday may be more problematic.Greece\u2019s creditors want the country to legislate an additional \u20ac3.6 billion in contingency measures that would come into effect if Athens misses its 2018 budget targets, but Greece has refused to do so, saying the measures would violate domestic law and go beyond the terms of last summer\u2019s bailout deal.Athens has instead proposed a mechanism to cut spending if it misses budget targets. Its creditors, however, particularly the International Monetary Fund, are skeptical.Mr. Tsipras\u2019s three-seat majority in Parliament is expected to hold for Sunday\u2019s vote, but officials have warned that obliging the authorities to legislate additional contingency measures could prompt a revolt that would shake the fragile government\u2019s stability.New Democracy, the main conservative opposition party, leads Syriza by three percentage points to six percentage points in opinion polls and has been calling for early elections. Ministers have so far ruled out that possibility, but the governing party is rived by dissent, with a radical grouping arguing that the government should \u201cfall heroically\u201d rather than enforce the austerity measures.After six years of crisis management, the eurozone is better prepared to deal with a possible Greek exit from the 19-member currency bloc. Most international banks and foreign investors have sold their bonds and other financial holdings, protecting them from potential upheaval in Greece. Other eurozone countries suffering from debt problems have also largely recovered.But eurozone member states are still heavily invested in Greece, having participated in bailouts worth more than \u20ac300 billion. And they are desperate not to lose their money.Greece does have some leverage, as European officials will be reluctant to face down a new Greek crisis before a June referendum when voters in Britain will decide whether their country should remain a member of the European Union. The bloc is also likely to need Greece\u2019s help in tackling the region\u2019s migration crisis.More than a million migrants entered the European Union via Greece since last year, putting further pressure on the country as it struggles to put its battered economy in order. About 50,000 remain on Greek territory, many of whom are awaiting the outcome of asylum applications. Most are eager to continue their journeys toward more affluent countries such as Germany and Sweden. But those countries have tightened their borders, and more stringent controls may be in place for another six months.The flood of refugees through the Aegean has slowed in recent weeks after a deal between the European Union and Turkey, however. If that trend holds up, Greece\u2019s role in the crisis could lessen.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Verizon Strike to End as Both Sides Claim Victories on Key Points", "Date": "2016-05-30", "News": "Supported byVerizon reached a series of tentative agreements with unions representing nearly 40,000 striking workers over the holiday weekend, retreating on some of the major points of contention, including pension cuts and greater flexibility to outsource work.But after a six-and-a-half week strike, the company also gained some important tools for paring down its work force in the coming years.\u201cThe tentative agreements reached today are good for our employees, good for our customers and will be good for our business,\u201d Marc Reed, Verizon\u2019s chief administrative officer, said in a statement. \u201cThey also include key changes sought by the company to better position our wireline business for success in the digital world.\u201dThe agreements reached on Sunday and Monday between Verizon and two major unions will most likely bring to an end the work stoppage, which began on April 13. The striking members in both unions, the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, must now vote on the agreements. That is likely to happen in the next two or three weeks, and they are widely expected to approve them. They will return to their jobs beginning on Wednesday as part of a short-term \u201cback-to-work agreement.\u201d\u201cThis contract is a victory for working families across the country and an affirmation of the power of working people,\u201d Chris Shelton, president of the Communications Workers of America said in a statement.The four-year contracts would give workers a nearly 11 percent increase in pay over all, up from the 6.5 percent increase that Verizon had proposed before the strike, as well as modest ratification bonuses and profit-sharing.Verizon had long argued that it needed to cut costs and increase its flexibility to manage its work force and preserve the competitiveness of its wireline business, which includes landlines, video and Internet service that run through wires.That business, which employs the overwhelming majority of the striking workers, has declined in profitability in recent years as mobile phone service and hand-held devices have gained popularity. Many of the company\u2019s competitors are not unionized and, therefore, better able to rein in labor costs.They say that Verizon\u2019s fiber-optic Fios network, which provides telephone, video and Internet service, remains lucrative. But they argue that the company\u2019s interest in it has flagged because the labor costs are much higher than for its wireless business, which is overwhelmingly nonunion.Perhaps the most consequential issue at stake in the standoff was Verizon\u2019s ability to outsource work. The previous contracts included a provision requiring that a certain percentage of customer calls originating in a state be answered by workers in that state \u2014 ranging from just over 50 percent for some types of calls in some states to more than 80 percent in others. Verizon sought to significantly lower those numbers.Under the tentative new contracts, a similar percentage of calls must be answered by a unionized worker somewhere in Verizon\u2019s wireline footprint, which runs from Virginia to Massachusetts, rather than the particular state from which the call originates.Both sides claimed victory in the change.\u201cWe only care that our members somewhere in the footprint are doing the work,\u201d said Robert Master, assistant to the District 1 vice president of the Communications Workers of America. \u201cThe push to outsource call center work was rebuffed.\u201dLending partial vindication to this claim was a commitment by the company to create over 1,000 unionized call center jobs over the next four years to accommodate new demand from customers. The company also agreed to reduce the number of call center closings.For its part, Verizon argued that the new call center rule would allow it to wring out inefficiencies. Under the old contracts, a call that originated in New York City would frequently be answered in New York City, then transferred to New Jersey or another state, where a worker with the right expertise could handle it. Now, the representative in New Jersey can answer the call directly more often.\u201cIt\u2019s a big deal; it eliminates an unnecessary step,\u201d said Richard J. Young, a Verizon spokesman. \u201cIt\u2019s all about minutes here and there. Minutes add up to hours; hours add up to jobs.\u201dThe company also won the right to offer buyout incentives to employees once a year without first getting the union\u2019s blessing, making it easier to eliminate jobs that the new rule could eventually render obsolete.Elsewhere, the outcome appeared more one-sided. The unions managed to beat back proposed pension cuts, including a cap on the accrual of pension benefits after 30 years of service.The company also agreed to withdraw a proposal that would have allowed it to relocate workers for up to two months anywhere in its geographic coverage area, although it had already expressed an openness to withdrawing the proposal before the strike.Proposals to change seniority rules and to make the company\u2019s sickness and disability policy more strict were also withdrawn, and the company agreed to change a performance review program in New York City that many workers considered abusive.Significantly, the new contracts also cover some 65 unionized workers at Verizon Wireless stores, signaling the first time that retail wireless workers at the company have been included in a union contract, a potentially important precedent.Some labor experts argued that these victories could reverberate through the broader economy.\u201cWorkers over all have been greatly diminished in their bargaining power, and wages have been stagnant for quite some time,\u201d said Jeffrey H. Keefe, a professor emeritus at the Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations, who has studied the telecom industry for decades. \u201cI want to see the details of this contract, but this may be a real shot in the arm for unions.\u201dVerizon, for its part, also achieved at least one clear victory in the new contracts: hundreds of millions of dollars in health care cost savings.The unions had largely indicated that they would accept these health care measures before the strike.But the tone appeared to shift in mid-May, after Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez and Allison Beck, director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, began to broker the talks.Verizon had initially predicted that the strike would not materially affect its financial position in the second quarter, but its chief financial officer conceded at a recent investor conference that the strike\u2019s effect on installations could hurt the company\u2019s performance.Mr. Keefe said that it was quite rare for a strike in the telecom industry to have a significant economic impact on the target company, as opposed to a public relations impact. But, he said, Verizon may have been vulnerable because so few of its replacement workers, typically managers, had experience with installations.\u201cThere\u2019s more to running a network than hiring a few replacement workers and running them through school,\u201d Mr. Keefe said.Mr. Young, the Verizon spokesman, rejected that argument, saying Verizon\u2019s replacement workers had begun installing Fios for new customers a few weeks earlier than initially planned, and for more customers than expected.The company\u2019s real miscalculation may have been its assessment of the unions\u2019 ability to hold out.\u201cThe total number of installations is off, and it\u2019s not unexpected, considering it was a six-week strike,\u201d Mr. Young said. \u201cYou never know going in. You hope it\u2019s a short duration, but you have to deal with the hand you\u2019re dealt.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "French Unions Clamor for Workers\u2019 Rights, and Relevance", "Date": "2016-05-27", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisNext week, it will be airport staff members, including traffic controllers, forcing some travelers to consider canceling their plans or taking the train. (I\u2019ve reserved a rail ticket to Spain in addition to my airplane ticket because I don\u2019t want to miss a friend\u2019s wedding.)Unions are also calling for unlimited strikes in the train and Paris M\u00e9tro transport sector, and June 14 will be a nationwide day of strikes. One newspaper, Le Parisien, has taken to periodically publishing a roundup listing the next day\u2019s strikes to alert Paris-area readers what to expect and how to alter their routines.It may seem that the French are constantly on strike, or dealing with one. Yet overlooked in all the chanting, banner waving and tire burning is that the strike in France today is often a carefully choreographed dance between labor, government and the public and it is just the latest chapter in a 132-year tradition, dating from the founding of the country\u2019s first trade unions in 1884.Today, the unions can still turn out a mass protest that brings both their members and supporters into the streets, giving a sense of strength. But at least some of it is illusory; rarely do strikes shut down the country entirely \u2014 rather, they inconvenience it.Although unions retain a special significance here, especially to left-leaning political parties, their heyday in France has passed, labor experts say and union leaders, in their more candid moments, concede.Workers nearly everywhere are facing an onslaught of global pressures that seem only to gather with each passing decade. Those in France are no exception. The government\u2019s proposed new labor law \u2014 which is the focus of most of the strikes \u2014 is an attempt to grapple with some of those forces by loosening worker protections in the hopes of spurring hiring and economic growth.It is hardly surprising when right-leaning governments, which generally tend to be antagonistic toward unions, push through legislation that unions oppose, but this is a Socialist government, which the unions supported at the ballot box and expected would protect their interests.The sense of betrayal stings, and that is part of the current round of protests against the government\u2019s new labor law. Opinion surveys show that while the public is not consistently enthusiastic about the strikes, it does not support the government\u2019s backing of the new measure, either.Yet the unions are divided as they fight to retain not only their workers\u2019 benefits, but also the relevance of the unions themselves.The union fighting hardest, the General Confederation of Labor, known as the C.G.T., represents many workers in the transportation and energy fields and still has enough power to make life deeply inconvenient across the country.But whether it could bring the country to a true halt is far less clear.\u201cThe more a union is weak, the more it tends to resort to protesting to be heard,\u201d said Guy Groux, a sociologist specializing in trade unionism at Sciences Po, a political science institute in Paris.After World War II, one in four French workers was a union member, according to the French national statistics bureau. But union membership has slowly dwindled.The decline in France is partly explained by the fact that, unlike other European nations, joining a union in France does not necessarily give a worker more benefits. Rather, the agreements negotiated by a union apply to all employees regardless of union membership.Equally important, however, are the divisions among union members today, with some unions willing to accept the government\u2019s new labor measure and the C.G.T., one of the country\u2019s oldest, standing firm against it and railing against what it sees as a sellout by the government.A former head of the C.G.T., Louis Viannet, denounced the government for perpetrating an \u201caggression that is antisocial, anti-democratic, and I would say also anti-republican,\u201d an insult in France where to be a republican implies a loyalty almost to the concept of France.It is a government that has become a \u201ca spokesman for management,\u201d he said.Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the president, is hardly right leaning, but he has moved his party right in order to fight an economic stagnation that has hardly budged over his last four years in office.He has promised to bring down the unemployment rate, which is over 10 percent. The labor law is his last-gasp attempt to do so before national elections next April. The unemployment rate has decreased slightly over the past two months, which had not happened since 2011, but Mr. Hollande\u2019s assertion that \u201c\u00e7a va mieux\u201d \u2014 \u201cthings are going better\u201d \u2014 has been met with skepticism.Faced with censure from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund for not doing enough to stimulate the French economy, Mr. Hollande has tried to thread the needle between his left-wing supporters and those who are more moderate. He has tried to preserve many worker protections \u2014 France still has among the most generous terms for workers in Europe \u2014 but to modify them enough to entice businesses to create jobs.His problem is that the hard left will brook no modifications in the social contract as it stands.Mr. Groux, the sociologist, noted that it takes many fewer strikers to set fire to tires dragged in front of the entrances of refineries than it would to mount street protests, making the union\u2019s strength look more impressive than it may in fact be.On Friday, there were just 200 union members burning tires and debris blocking an oil depot in Donges, in northwestern France, and the police dispersed them peacefully by midafternoon.At the same time, however, at a Total refinery, workers voted to go on strike until the government withdrew the proposed labor law.The number of strikers blocking roads, however, is small because many within unions are conflicted about whether to strike. The differences among the unions make the strikes less able to fully immobilize the country than simply to inconvenience it.In fact, that is part of what makes strikes in France tolerable, if still a headache. It is rare that everything actually stops.Even union members concede that their greatest hope is not to lose ground \u2014 at least not yet. \u201cFor a while now most of the fights are defensive ones,\u201d said Mr. Viannet, the former head of the C.G.T.\u201cThat\u2019s typically the case with the labor law at the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that we are forced to fight defensively isn\u2019t stimulating for the development of unionism, but we have to do it. The only battles that you are sure to lose are the ones you don\u2019t fight.\u201dAurelien Breeden contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Diabetic Economy", "Date": "2016-05-02", "News": "Supported byLISBON \u2014 Things are terrible here in Portugal, but not quite as terrible as they were a couple of years ago. The same thing can be said about the European economy as a whole. That is, I guess, the good news.The bad news is that eight years after what was supposed to be a temporary financial crisis, economic weakness just goes on and on, with no end in sight. And that\u2019s something that should worry everyone, in Europe and beyond.But it\u2019s telling that this is what passes for good news. We complain, rightly, about the slow pace of U.S. recovery \u2014 but our economy is already 10 percent bigger than it was pre-crisis, while our unemployment rate is back under 5 percent.And there is, as I said, no end in sight to Europe\u2019s chronic underperformance. Look at what financial markets are saying.Such injections aren\u2019t part of a normal lifestyle, and may have bad side effects, but they\u2019re necessary to manage the symptoms of a chronic disease.In the case of Europe, the chronic disease is persistent weakness in spending, which gives the continent\u2019s economy a persistent deflationary bias even when, like now, it\u2019s having a relatively good few months. The insulin of cheap money helps fight that weakness, even if it doesn\u2019t provide a cure.Meanwhile, unemployment in much of Europe, very much including my current location, is still at levels that are inflicting huge human, social and political damage.It\u2019s notable that in Spain, which these days is being touted as a success story, youth unemployment is still an incredible 45 percent.And there\u2019s nothing in reserve to deal with a fresh shock. Suppose that Greece blows up again, or the British public votes to leave the European Union, or China\u2019s economy goes off a cliff, or whatever. What could or would European policy makers do to offset the blow? Nobody seems to have any idea.The thing is, it\u2019s not hard to see what Europe should be doing to help cure its chronic disease. The case for more public spending, especially in Germany \u2014 but also in France, which is in much better fiscal shape than its own leaders seem to realize \u2014 is overwhelming.There are large unmet needs for infrastructure and investors are essentially begging governments to take their money. Did I mention that the real 10-year interest rate, the rate on bonds that are protected from inflation, is minus 0.8 percent?But doing the right thing seems to be politically out of the question. Far from showing any willingness to change course, German politicians are sniping constantly at the central bank, the only major European institution that seems to have a clue about what is going on.Put it this way: Visiting Europe can make an American feel good about his own country.Yes, one of our two major parties is poised to nominate a dangerous blowhard for president \u2014 but it has been obvious for a while that the G.O.P. was in the process of going mad, and the odds are that he won\u2019t actually end up in the White House.Meanwhile, the overall economic and political situation in America gives ample grounds for hope, which is in very short supply over here.I\u2019d love to see Europe emerge from its funk. The world needs more vibrant democracies! But at the moment it\u2019s hard to see any positive signs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Corporate America Chases the Mythical Millennial", "Date": "2016-05-25", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtYet there\u2019s a glaring problem with these and other efforts to go after the younger among us: Millennials aren\u2019t real.Sure, the demographic group exists as an amorphous bloc. But you are as likely to come upon an archetypal millennial as you are to run into Joe Sixpack or be invited to a barbecue at the median American household. It\u2019s hard to believe this even needs to be said, yet here we are: Macroscale demographic trends rarely govern most individuals\u2019 life and work decisions. For most practical purposes \u2014 hiring and managing, selling to, creating products for \u2014 your company may be better off recognizing more discrete and meaningful characteristics in workers and customers than simply the year of their birth.If your management or marketing theories involve collapsing all millennials into a catchall anthropological category \u2014 as if you\u2019re dealing with space aliens or some newly discovered aboriginal tribe that\u2019s suddenly invaded modernity \u2014 you\u2019re doing it wrong. Or, as I believe my millennial friends say, \u201cyass literal epic fail hashtag, bro.\u201dAnother might be to consider that maybe the problem stems from something about your company, your management style or just the worker\u2019s personality, and that it has nothing to do with the fact that the employee was born in 1983 and really enjoyed \u201cAnimaniacs\u201d as a kid.In other words, break out of the stereotype. According to Laszlo Bock, who runs human resources at Google, pigeonholing workers into categories is nothing new, and it\u2019s rarely helpful in running a workplace.\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is that every single generation enters the work force and feels like they\u2019re a unique generation, and the generation that\u2019s one or two ahead of them looks back and says, \u2018Who are these weird, strange kids coming into the work force with their attitudes of entitlement and not wanting to fit in?\u2019\u201d Mr. Bock said. \u201cIt\u2019s a cycle that\u2019s been repeated every 10 to 15 years for the last 50 years.\u201d\u201cWe measure this sort of thing closely, and if you look at what their underlying needs and aspirations are, there\u2019s no difference at all between this new generation of workers and my generation and my father\u2019s generation,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery single human being wants the same thing in the workplace \u2014 we want to be treated with respect, we want to have a sense of meaning and agency and impact, and we want our boss to just leave us alone so we can get our work done.\u201dThis is not to say that today\u2019s young people are identical to old people. Kim Parker, director of social trends research at the Pew Research Center, said demographers have noted large differences in millennials: Compared to older cohorts, they tend to be more socially liberal when it comes to issues like gay marriage and marijuana use, they marry later in life, and they are less enamored of traditional religious and political institutions. Looking at these shifts over time \u201cis a useful construct when you\u2019re trying to analyze a whole population,\u201d Ms. Parker said.But these broad trends leave lots of room for individual differences that matter in the real world, and that are often papered over when we talk about millennials as a monolithic collective.Considering that millennials are the most diverse generation \u2014 spanning many racial, ethnic and income categories \u2014 intragenerational differences are bound to play an important role when you\u2019re talking about individual people. Though both are \u201cmillennials,\u201d a young immigrant working three sharing-economy gigs is likely to look at the world very differently from a trust-fund baby who\u2019s tending his Tumblr in Brooklyn. Yet only one of these stereotypes tends to make it into media accounts of millennials.That doesn\u2019t have to be the case. What\u2019s most bizarre about efforts to describe young people as a broad collective is that technology has rendered such generalizations mostly unnecessary. Thanks to social media, smartphones and reams of searchable data, companies can now track their customers and workers in far more precise ways than simply noting their age cohort. They have your purchase and employment histories, your social media musings, your educational history, your credit report. Companies can break you down analytically, psychographically, financially and in just about every other way short of physically.As my millennial friends say: Ugh.The State of the Art column on Thursday, about the nonhomogeneity of the so-called millennial generation, misspelled the given name of Google\u2019s head of human resources.

{"Headline": "EgyptAir Was Aware of Threats to Security, Including One Scribbled on Plane", "Date": "2016-05-21", "News": "Supported byCAIRO \u2014 In an eerie coincidence, the EgyptAir jetliner that plunged into the Mediterranean on Thursday was once the target of political vandals who wrote in Arabic on its underside, \u201cWe will bring this plane down.\u201dThree EgyptAir security officials said the threatening graffiti, which appeared about two years ago, had been the work of aviation workers at Cairo Airport. Playing on the phonetic similarity between the last two letters in the plane\u2019s registration, SU-GCC, and the surname of Egypt\u2019s president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, some workers also wrote \u201ctraitor\u201d and \u201cmurderer.\u201dThe officials, who were interviewed separately and who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the airline\u2019s security procedures because they were not authorized to speak publicly, said the graffiti had been linked to the domestic Egyptian political situation at the time rather than to a militant threat. Similar graffiti against Mr. Sisi, a former general, was scrawled across Cairo after the military ousted the elected president, Mohamed Morsi, in 2013.Since then, the airline has put into effect a variety of new security measures in response to Egypt\u2019s political turmoil, jihadist violence and other aviation disasters like the crash of a Russian plane that killed 224 people in October. EgyptAir has fired employees for their political leanings, stepped up crew searches and added extra unarmed in-flight security guards. Three such guards died in Thursday\u2019s crash of Flight 804.Whether those moves were sufficient remained an open question on Saturday as experts pored over data emitted by the plane in its final minutes for clues as to what had brought it down. The French air accident investigation authority confirmed that the data showed that several smoke alarms had been activated while the plane plunged toward the sea.But they cautioned that the signals, sent by a monitoring system on board the Airbus A320 jetliner, did not offer enough information to conclude what had caused the crash.\u201cThese are not messages that enable us to interpret anything,\u201d said S\u00e9bastien Barthe, a spokesman for France\u2019s Bureau of Investigations and Analysis. \u201cIf there is smoke, it means that there is potentially a fire somewhere, but it doesn\u2019t tell us where the fire is, and it doesn\u2019t help us establish whether it is something malevolent or something technical.\u201dIn an audio message released Saturday, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, the official spokesman of the Islamic State and the head of a unit dedicated to external attacks, denounced the American-led military campaign against the group but did not mention the EgyptAir crash.EgyptAir\u2019s security procedures last came under scrutiny in March when a passenger on a domestic flight pretended to be wearing an explosive vest and forced the plane to land in Cyprus. The crisis was resolved within hours when the man, later determined to be psychologically troubled, surrendered. The Egyptian authorities were quick to post surveillance videos that they said showed he had been searched before boarding the flight.Among the 66 people on Thursday\u2019s flight from Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris were three EgyptAir in-flight security personnel \u2014 one more than the normal team of two for reasons that were not entirely clear.EgyptAir security guards differ in several respects from the undercover air marshals who travel on American airlines. The Egyptian guards are unarmed and wear an understated uniform consisting of a dark blazer and a white shirt. When called on, they help crew members deal with unruly passengers. They come from a wide variety of backgrounds and earn a moderate wage of about $400 a month.Normally, one security officer sits in the first economy row, behind business class, and the other is at the rear of the aircraft, two members of an EgyptAir crew said. During stopovers at foreign airports, the security officers are usually responsible for searching the workers who clean the plane and checking the credentials of all crew members or employees who board. They do not monitor the baggage handlers who load the plane\u2019s hold.Security officials said those procedures would have applied to the EgyptAir plane during short layovers it made at two African airports \u2014 in Tunis and the Eritrean capital, Asmara \u2014 in the days before the crash. But the procedure is different in Paris because European airports do not permit EgyptAir security officials to search local cleaning workers, a source of disgruntlement among Egyptian officials who feel they are being discriminated against.Colleagues described the security guards who died in Thursday\u2019s crash \u2014 Walid Ouda, Mohammed Farag and Mahmoud el Sayed \u2014 as professionals who had exhibited no signs of unusual behavior. They described Mr. Farag as a lighthearted man who was often teased by friends for not having married, while Mr. Ouda cut a more taciturn figure and was polite to a fault.Friends and relatives also presented a uniformly untroubled picture of the pilot, Capt. Mohamed Shoukair, 36, and his co-pilot, Mohamed Mamdouh Assem, 24. An EgyptAir pilot, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the news media, said he had worked with both and described them as professional aviators who had not exhibited any mental or social problems. At 24 years old, Mr. Assem was the average age of many co-pilots at the airline, he said.EgyptAir crew members have been subjected to much stricter security measures since the crash of the Russian jetliner in October, said the pilot, who described the procedures before that crash as lax. The new procedures include personal searches that have prevented crew members from smuggling cigarettes or currency, he said.The graffiti about Mr. Sisi occurred several times for about two years after Mr. Morsi, of the Muslim Brotherhood, was removed as president in July 2013. At the time, it was taken as a sign of the country\u2019s bitter political divide rather than a directed threat against the plane.Nonetheless, over that period, EgyptAir fired a number of employees, mostly members of the ground staff, who were presumed to be sympathizers of the Muslim Brotherhood, security officials said. Similar purges took place in other companies in Egypt at the time.More recently, fears of terrorism have tightened security at regional airports, including Tunis, where the Airbus A320 had traveled just before its trip to Paris, the pilot said. Foreign flight crews face new restrictions on their movement and are now prevented, for example, from leaving the plane to buy items in the duty-free shop, he said.EgyptAir flights headed to Europe also face added scrutiny under a European Union program known as SAFA, or Safety Assessment of Foreign Aircraft, which allows for spot inspections of airplanes at European airports and penalties for violations.Although Egyptian society has been divided in the turmoil that followed the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak in 2011, there has been a tangible sense of national solidarity since Thursday\u2019s crash. Images of grieving relatives have dominated news coverage. As the official crash investigation starts, many Egyptians have reacted furiously to any suggestion that the airline crew bore any responsibility.Ezzat Shoukair, a cousin of the captain, said he was distressed by some of the coverage.\u201cDon\u2019t listen to the lies people have been saying since the crash,\u201d he said, starting to weep as he spoke. \u201cWe just want to know where his body is. Otherwise, where will those who miss him go when they want to visit him?\u201dAn article on May 22 about EgyptAir\u2019s awareness of security threats to the Airbus A320 jetliner that crashed into the Mediterranean \u2014 including graffiti written in Arabic on the underside of the plane that said, \u201cWe will bring this plane down\u201d \u2014 referred incorrectly in some editions to a cousin of the captain of the fatal flight. The cousin, Ezzat Shoukair, is a man.Aurelien Breeden contributed reporting from Paris, and Merna Thomas from Cairo.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Margot Honecker, East German Hard-Liner and Widow of Ruler, Dies at 89", "Date": "2016-05-06", "News": "Supported byMargot Honecker, the widow of Erich Honecker, the longtime ruler of Communist East Germany, and a powerful hard-liner in her own right as the minister of education for 26 years until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, died on Friday in exile in Chile. She was 89.The daughter of a Communist shoemaker brutalized by the Nazis, raised in a maelstrom of swastikas and the subsequent partition of her homeland by the Allied powers after World War II, Mrs. Honecker was an ardent Stalinist whose hatred of fascism and zeal for Marxism in the postwar German Democratic Republic was said to rival her husband\u2019s.Known as the \u201cpurple witch\u201d for her violet hair dye and her fervor for repressive policies, Mrs. Honecker was 26 and the youngest member of the national legislature in 1953 when Mr. Honecker, 15 years older and a rising star of the East German Communist Party, obtained party permission to divorce his first wife and marry her.With her husband, who succeeded Walter Ulbricht as leader of the G.D.R. in 1971, Mrs. Honecker helped perpetuate one of the most monolithic and authoritarian regimes in Europe\u2019s history, a 40-year dictatorship that, according to Western historians, crushed dissent, spied on a broad spectrum of the population and tried to control its people with heavy-handed propaganda and Orwellian repression.After the collapse of European Communism and Germany\u2019s reunification in 1990, Mr. Honecker was charged with stealing millions from the state, and with manslaughter for his shoot-to-kill orders that cost hundreds of lives as East Germans tried to flee Communist rule. Too ill to finish a trial, he was never convicted.Education Ministry files found in 1991 seemed to confirm allegations, never proven, that Mrs. Honecker had forced people who were considered traitors to surrender their children for adoption. Opponents contended that hundreds of parents had been declared unfit to raise their children after trying to flee to the West or being convicted of espionage. The files cited only a half-dozen cases of children taken for adoption by \u201capproved\u201d Communist families.In one case, the files showed, a couple expelled to the West for political reasons were forced to abandon their three children, who were adopted by a family that refused to allow any contact with the parents.\u201cIt is now clear that the state acted as a kidnapper,\u201d Thomas Kruger, Berlin\u2019s youth minister, said after the files were uncovered.By then, Mrs. Honecker had fled to Moscow. After emigrating to Chile, she remained there in exile for the rest of her life.Mrs. Honecker rarely spoke publicly about East Germany, but when interviewed in 2012 she defended it as a good place to have lived, ascribed its downfall to criminal elements, and briefly addressed the allegation of forced adoptions.\u201cFor me, the G.D.R. was my life \u2014 it\u2019s a tragedy that that country no longer exists,\u201d she told Eric Friedler for a German television documentary, \u201cThe Fall: The End of Honecker.\u201dShe acknowledged that \u201cmistakes were made in history, which one has to regret,\u201d and that \u201cthe G.D.R. also had its foes \u2014 that\u2019s why we had the Stasi,\u201d the country\u2019s secret police agency. But she called the regime\u2019s opponents \u201ccriminals who today make out that they were political victims,\u201d and said that she had never understood why people fled to the West. \u201cThere was no need for them to climb over the wall, to pay for this stupidity with their lives,\u201d she said.Mrs. Honecker dismissed allegations that she had directed a program of forced adoptions. \u201cIt didn\u2019t exist,\u201d she said.She was born Margot Feist on April 17, 1927, in Halle, in what was then the Weimar Republic. After Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, her father was arrested as a Communist and sent to a concentration camp, which he survived.From 1938 to 1945, Mrs. Honecker belonged to the Bund Deutscher M\u00e4del, the girls\u2019 wing of the Hitler Youth, whose membership was obligatory. She joined the Communist Party after the war and rose quickly in its ranks. In 1950 she was elected to the People\u2019s Chamber, the new East German parliament. She met Mr. Honecker at party meetings; gave birth to their daughter, Sonja, in 1952; and was married a year later.She became education minister in 1963 and took on a central role in shaping a Communist society with pedagogy. Russian-language classes were already mandatory, but she helped write laws, adopted in 1965, that integrated education policies into the nation\u2019s employment, military, social and political objectives.Klaus Korn, an author of studies on East German education and development, who was also an aide to Mrs. Honecker, said in an interview that her ideologies were based on \u201cunconditional love for the Soviet Union.\u201d Joseph Stalin had been dead since 1953, but, Mr. Korn said: \u201cShe still saw Stalin as her magnetic pole. For her, his mistakes could hardly have been avoided and were of less significance than his merits.\u201dUnder her direction, indoctrination began in nursery schools with red flags and pictures of her husband. Children were expected to recognize him as a national leader. For older students, the curriculum included literature on socialist life and regular class visits to factories, power stations and collective farms. Military studies, including weapons training, began in junior and senior high schools in the 1970s.The West, especially the United States, was portrayed as decadent and corrupt, while the Soviet Union was hailed as a heroic victor over fascism and a paragon of Communism. Teachers were ordered to report students who deviated from the party line.The propaganda was largely ineffective. An internal Education Ministry poll in 1983 found that 80 percent of students believed that \u201cin school you can\u2019t say what you think.\u201d Indeed, East Germans who tuned in to Western news and entertainment broadcasts were among the most well-informed people in the Communist world, and were well aware of the stark contrasts between their lives and those in the West.For all its economic successes, the Honecker regime took a nose dive in 1989. Rigged elections, limited freedoms and widespread repression by the Stasi led to enormous protests demanding democratic reforms. An exodus to the West threatened the economy and shattered images of a worker\u2019s paradise.Mr. Honecker was ousted on Oct. 18. Mrs. Honecker and others soon followed. Weeks of civil unrest culminated on Nov. 9, when crowds of East Berliners climbed and crossed the Berlin Wall, and guards \u2014 outnumbered and unwilling to shoot \u2014 let them go. On a euphoric night that was televised worldwide, the outpouring was a death knell for the wall and for East Germany.The Honeckers fled to Moscow in 1990 and took refuge in the Chilean Embassy when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. Mrs. Honecker emigrated to Chile while her husband was returned to Berlin to face charges in the deaths of defectors. But a court found him too ill with cancer to finish a trial, and he was allowed to join his wife in Chile in 1993.After his death a year later, Mrs. Honecker, who received from Germany a monthly pension of $1,800, lived quietly in Santiago with her daughter, Sonja, who married a Chilean, Leo Yanez Betancourt, and had a son, Roberto, and daughter, Vivian. There was no immediate confirmation on her survivors.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Sweden, an Experiment Turns Shorter Workdays Into Bigger Gains", "Date": "2016-05-20", "News": "Supported byGOTHENBURG, Sweden \u2014 Arturo Perez used to come home frazzled from his job as a caregiver at the Svartedalens nursing home. Eight-hour stretches of tending to residents with senility or Alzheimer\u2019s would leave him sapped with little time to spend with his three children.But life changed when Svartedalens was selected for a Swedish experiment about the future of work. In a bid to improve well-being, employees were switched to a six-hour workday last year with no pay cut. Within a week, Mr. Perez was brimming with energy, and residents said the standard of care was higher.\u201cWhat\u2019s good is that we\u2019re happy,\u201d said Mr. Perez, a single father. \u201cAnd a happy worker is a better worker.\u201dThe experiment at Svartedalens goes further by mandating a 30-hour week. An audit published in mid-April concluded that the program in its first year had sharply reduced absenteeism, and improved productivity and worker health.\u201cWe\u2019ve had 40 years of a 40-hour workweek, and now we\u2019re looking at a society with higher sick leaves and early retirement,\u201d said Daniel Bernmar, leader of the Left party on Gothenburg\u2019s City Council, which is running the trial and hopes to make it the standard. \u201cWe want a new discussion in Sweden about how work life should be to maintain a good welfare state for the next 40 years.\u201dBut resistance has formed in some corners of this bustling city, and opponents warn that the idea is a utopian folly. If all of Gothenburg, let alone Sweden, were to adopt a six-hour workday, they say, the economy would suffer from reduced competitiveness and strained finances.\u201cIt\u2019s the type of economic thinking that has gotten other countries in Europe into trouble,\u201d said Maria Ryd\u00e9n, Gothenburg\u2019s deputy mayor and a member of the opposition Moderates party. She is leading a campaign to kill the trial, citing high taxpayer costs and arguments that the government should not intrude in the workplace.\u201cWe can\u2019t pay people to not work,\u201d she added.A similar model has long ignited controversy in France, ever since a Socialist government made a 35-hour workweek mandatory in 2000. Companies complain it has reduced competitiveness and created billions in additional costs for hiring and social charges. Unions defend the law as shielding workers from employers who might otherwise return to excessively long work hours.Such concerns have not deterred a growing number of small businesses in Sweden from testing the concept. Many found that a shorter workday can reduce turnover, enhance employee creativity and lift productivity enough to offset the cost of hiring additional staff.\u201cSince we work fewer hours, we are constantly figuring out ways to do more with our time,\u201d Ms. Brath said.Sitting inside their airy office, Brath\u2019s employees checked off the ways. \u201cWe don\u2019t send unnecessary emails or tie ourselves up in meetings,\u201d said Thommy Ottinger, a pay-per-click specialist. \u201cIf you have only six hours to work, you don\u2019t waste your time or other people\u2019s time.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a life changer,\u201d he said, adding that the environment inspired fierce staff loyalty.Last year, the orthopedics unit switched 89 nurses and doctors to a six-hour day. It hired 15 new staff members to make up for the lost time and extend operating room hours. At 1 million kroner (about $123,000) a month, the experiment was expensive, said Anders Hyltander, the executive director. But since then, almost no one calls in sick, and nurses and doctors have been more efficient.\u201cI had reached a point where I could only work at 80 percent capacity,\u201d said Gabrielle Tikman, a surgical nurse. \u201cNow it\u2019s easier to rest and I have time at home to sit and really talk with my children. I\u2019ve got my power back.\u201dThe unit is performing 20 percent more operations, generating additional business from treatments like hip replacements that would have gone to other hospitals. Surgery waiting times were cut to weeks from months, allowing patients to return to work faster and reducing sick leave elsewhere in the economy, Mr. Hyltander said.\u201cFor years, we\u2019ve been told that an eight-hour workday is optimal,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think we should let ourselves challenge that view and say, \u2018Yes that\u2019s the way it is now, but if you want to increase productivity, be open to new ideas.\u2019\u201dThe hospital was inspired by a nearby Toyota vehicle service center, which moved to a six-hour day 13 years ago to address employee stress and customer complaints about long waiting times. The new system keeps the garages open longer and reels in new business.\u201cWhat we can see today is that employees are at the very least doing the same amount in the six-hour workday, often more than they did in the eight-hour day,\u201d said Martin Banck, the service center\u2019s director. \u201cIt\u2019s heavy work \u2014 drilling, building engine blocks \u2014 but they have stamina, and we have more profit and customers because cars get fixed faster.\u201dAnd employees say that more downtime makes them happier on the job. \u201cSimply put, we work more efficiently,\u201d said Matthias Larsson, 33. Thanks to his shorter hours, Mr. Larsson can care for his three children, cook, clean and shop while his wife is at work.Back at Svartedalens, Mr. Perez hopes the same fate will not befall him. \u201cWe never dreamed that there\u2019d be a six-hour day,\u201d he said. \u201cYou feel joy coming to work here.\u201dIngrid Karlson, a 90-year-old tenant, nodded from her wheelchair. \u201cThe personnel are completely different,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re happier and we\u2019re happier.\u201dAn earlier version of a photo caption with this article misspelled the surname of an employee of a Toyota service center. He is Matthias Larsson, not Larrsson.Christina Anderson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How I Learned to Love Snapchat", "Date": "2016-05-18", "News": "Supported byOn TechnologyIn the mid-\u201980s, a German engineer named Friedhelm Hillebrand helped devise a way for cellphones to send and receive text messages. Back then, mobile bandwidth was extremely limited, which meant that the messages needed to be as lightweight as possible. The story goes that Hillebrand experimented with a variety of greetings and phrases and concluded, in very German fashion, that most things that needed saying could be done so in an economical 160 characters or fewer. \u201cThis is perfectly sufficient,\u201d he said of his findings. Eventually the infrastructure improved so that there were no limits to how much text we could transmit at once. And by 2007, texting had surpassed voice calls as the preferred, if not default, mode of communication.As most rapid advances in technol\u00adogy tend to do, this transition inspired a low-grade, intergenerational moral panic. Many feared that we would become asocial creatures, misanthropes who would rather hide behind the safety of a screen than face the intimacy of a spoken conversation. And maybe there\u2019s some truth in that, but there\u2019s another way of looking at it. Maybe we didn\u2019t hate talking \u2014 just the way older phone technologies forced us to talk. Texting freed a generation from the strictures and inconvenience (and awkwardness) of phone calls, while allowing people to be more loosely and constantly connected.I thought about this shift recently when trying to make sense of the rise of Snapchat, the latest wellspring of techno\u00adsocial hand-wringing. Like texting, Snapchat flourished amid scarcity, though of an entirely different kind. We no longer live in Hillebrand\u2019s era, when there were hard limits on how much we could say over text; but words alone can be an imperfect technology. So much of what we mean lies not just in what we say, or in the exact words we choose, but also in the light that animates our eyes (or doesn\u2019t) when we de\u00ad\u00adliver them and the sharpness (or softness) of the tone we use. Text barely captures even a fraction of that emotional depth and texture, even when we can type as much as we want. Snapchat is just the latest and most well realized example of the various ways we are regaining the layers of meaning we lost when we began digitizing so many important interactions.Most efforts to approximate normal human behavior in software tend to be creepy or annoying. The oblong gray bubble that pops up when your conversation partner is typing (officially called the \u201ctyping awareness indicator\u201d) is no doubt intended to be helpful, the virtual version of watching someone inhale and then part their lips to speak. But it becomes panic-inducing if it appears and then disappears \u2014 an indication that someone wrote something, then, for any number of reasons, deleted it. Similarly, \u201cread\u201d receipts, designed to let you know that someone opened and read your message, are perhaps best at letting you know when you\u2019re being ignored. In a strange turn of events, texting has evolved to become almost as awkward as the phone calls it made obsolete.This is not to say that text is irredeemable. A significant humanization of our text interactions happened quietly in 2011, when emoji were introduced as part of an Apple iOS software update. They offered a palette of punctuation that clari\u00adfied intent. Tacking on emoji like hearts, skulls, grins and bugged-out eyes to a short message made it infinitely easier to confidently project sarcasm, humor, grief and love across a medium that had been, until then, emotionally arid. If you want proof that we see ourselves in the emoji we use, consider the ever-present disputes over emoji inclusivity: Initially, the characters all had the same skin tone, and even now, the only \u201cprofessional\u201d emoji are male. And though the catalog of emoji has expanded in response to user demand, it still struggles to keep up with the multiplicity of human experiences. As a result, a new bespoke-emoji economy has begun to emerge, in apps like Bitmoji, which let people create personalized avatars to adorn their text messages. If our emoji couldn\u2019t become us, we would become our emoji.But messages that include little actual messaging seem to be the wave of the future, and Snapchat is leading the way. The app, which allows users to send short videos and images that disappear after a short period of time, is intimate by design, something that sets it apart from its social-media peers. Most of the \u201csnaps\u201d I send and receive are tightly framed, with angles that could be considered unflattering. They\u2019re low resolution too, the images speckled with grain. Snapchat does have filters, but the dumb ones are the most fun, especially the ones that add a comically hideous effect \u2014 bloating your face into a red tomato, or distorting it into an animal mask.If we are to believe the theories about how people want to communicate nowadays \u2014 largely through anesthetized, hypermediated and impersonal ex\u00ad\u00adchanges \u2014 Snapchat\u2019s recent surge in popularity makes little sense. During the first few years of Snapchat\u2019s existence, the only people I knew using the service (beyond journalists like me who were trying to understand it) were my youngest relatives, still in high school and college. And of course there was the attendant moral panic: When it first blew up around 2012, the press seemed to assume it would primarily be used by horny teenagers swapping nudes.If that was ever the case, it has since expanded. Each time I check the app, I\u2019m surprised to see who else in my network has started using the service. My circle includes every demographic, age and locale: co-workers who send snaps of their dogs, friends on strange adventures in the desert, people I talk to mostly online sending videos from their travels. The videos are rarely elaborate: just a few seconds of my favorite people\u2019s faces on a large screen, smiling, or singing, or showing off their view, before they fade and disappear.Its entire aesthetic flies in the face of how most people behave on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter \u2014 as if we\u2019re waiting to be plucked from obscurity by a talent agent or model scout. But Snapchat isn\u2019t the place where you go to be pretty. It\u2019s the place where you go to be yourself, and that is made easy thanks to the app\u2019s inbuilt ephemerality. Away from the fave-based economies of mainstream social media, there\u2019s less pressure to be dolled up, or funny. For all the advances in tech that let us try on various guises to play around with who we are, it seems that we just want new ways to be ourselves. As it turns out, the mundanity of our regular lives is the most captivating thing we could share with one another.Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brazil\u2019s Senate Votes to Begin Impeachment Trial of Dilma Rousseff", "Date": "2016-05-12", "News": "Supported by\u201cWe could no longer ignore these crimes and thus voted for impeachment,\u201d \u00c1lvaro Dias, a senator from the Green Party, said shortly before casting his vote. \u201cHaving been assaulted by incompetence and wrongdoing, Brazilians expect punishment.\u201d\u201cThe struggle for democracy doesn\u2019t have an end date,\u201d she said in a speech Thursday, shortly before vacating the presidential office. \u201cIt\u2019s a permanent fight that requires our constant dedication. It\u2019s a fight that can be won, and it is one we will win.\u201dBut given the margin of opposition against her on Thursday, political analysts said she stood little chance of winning the trial and finishing the remaining two and a half years of her final term in office.\u201cGiven the polarization in Brazil, if she sticks to her guns and fights this all the way to the end, it\u2019s going to prolong the agony for the country,\u201d said Mauro F. Guill\u00e9n, a professor of international management at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cThe best thing she could do for her country is to bite the bullet and step aside.\u201dThough widely expected, the spectacle of Ms. Rousseff\u2019s being put on trial is a watershed in the power struggle consuming Brazil, which experienced a rare stretch of stability over the last two decades as it strengthened its economy and achieved greater prominence on the world stage.The nation\u2019s economic woes are not simply a result of falling global prices for Brazilian commodities like oil and soybeans. They are also self-inflicted, economists say, a consequence of flawed policies and enormous graft scandals. Many voters blame Ms. Rousseff and her leftist Workers\u2019 Party.\u201cEverything is so expensive now, we can barely afford to eat,\u201d said Juliana Santos, 29, a ticket-taker who works for a public bus company in Bras\u00edlia, the capital. \u201cThe Workers\u2019 Party promised they would change things, but they changed things for the worse.\u201d\u201cPlainly said, this is the worst crisis in our history, with its combination of economic calamity, discredited politics and the violation of the lowest ethical standards,\u201d Boris Fausto, a Brazilian historian, told reporters this month while summing up the country\u2019s grim mood.Ms. Rousseff, 68, is the second Brazilian president to face impeachment since democracy was re-established in the mid-1980s after a long dictatorship.Dilma Rousseff, Brazil\u2019s president, is facing removal from office. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the proceedings.After 20 hours of often-somnolent speechmaking, the Brazilian solicitor general, Jos\u00e9 Eduardo Cardozo, took to the dais just after dawn on Thursday and told lawmakers that history would judge them harshly if they voted to try Ms. Rousseff for a crime he said she had not committed. \u201cIf this impeachment goes forward, Brazil will become the world\u2019s largest banana republic,\u201d he said, emotion filling his voice.Throughout the day, the corrugated-metal enclosures that had been erected outside Congress to contain protesters remained mostly empty, a marked contrast to the thousands of people who flocked to the capital last month to express their support or opposition during the impeachment vote in the lower house.By evening on Wednesday, several hundred people had gathered in the pens, and at one point, police officers fired tear gas into a crowd of anti-impeachment protesters after firecrackers were lobbed in the officers\u2019 direction.Ms. Rousseff is a former Marxist guerrilla and a trained economist who spent years working in the nation\u2019s energy bureaucracies. She had not held elected office until former President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who was constitutionally barred from running for a third consecutive term, picked her to be his successor.In 2010, she won handily, and during her time in office, she largely continued the generous social welfare programs that had earned Mr. da Silva unswerving loyalty from the country\u2019s poorest citizens.\u201cOur greatest achievements were to raise 36 million people out of poverty and elevate 40 million others into the middle class,\u201d Mr. da Silva said in an email on Wednesday. \u201cWe remain a party that cares about the poor and about social justice.\u201dBut as the economy soured and scandal rocked the political establishment, Ms. Rousseff\u2019s popularity sank into the single digits, giving her adversaries in Congress an opening to seek her removal.It was the recent defection of Mr. Temer that helped seal her fate, providing opponents in the lower house the crucial bloc of votes they needed to push forward with impeachment.But Mr. Temer may be even less popular than Ms. Rousseff, with one recent poll finding that only 2 percent of Brazilians would vote for him. He also faces his own legal problems. An electoral court ordered him this month to pay a fine for violating campaign finance limits. The ruling could make him ineligible to run for elected office for eight years, creating an unusual situation in which a politician barred from campaigning ends up running the country.Fixing the economy, which may require adopting unpopular austerity measures, is just one of the challenges facing Mr. Temer, 75. Critics have expressed concern over some of his top advisers, several of whom are under investigation, including Romero Juc\u00e1, a senator from Roraima State in the Amazon, and Geddel Vieira Lima, a former executive at one of Brazil\u2019s largest public banks.

{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Idea to Cut National Debt: Get Creditors to Accept Less", "Date": "2016-05-06", "News": "Supported byAsked on Thursday whether the United States needed to pay its debts in full, or whether he could negotiate a partial repayment, Mr. Trump told the cable network CNBC, \u201cI would borrow, knowing that if the economy crashed, you could make a deal.\u201dHe added, \u201cAnd if the economy was good, it was good. So, therefore, you can\u2019t lose.\u201dSuch remarks by a major presidential candidate have no modern precedent. The United States government is able to borrow money at very low interest rates because Treasury securities are regarded as a safe investment, and any cracks in investor confidence have a long history of costing American taxpayers a lot of money.Experts also described Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal as fanciful, saying there was no reason to think America\u2019s creditors would accept anything less than 100 cents on the dollar, regardless of Mr. Trump\u2019s deal-making prowess.\u201cNo one on the other side would pick up the phone if the secretary of the U.S. Treasury tried to make that call,\u201d said Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP. \u201cWhy should they? They have a contract\u201d requiring payment in full.Mr. Trump told CNBC that he was concerned about the impact of higher interest rates on the cost of servicing the federal debt. \u201cWe\u2019re paying a very low interest rate,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat happens if that interest rate goes two, three, four points up? We don\u2019t have a country. I mean, if you look at the numbers, they\u2019re staggering.\u201dCurrent polls show an uphill battle for Donald Trump should he and Hillary Clinton face off in the general election.Pressed to elaborate on his remarks, Mr. Trump did appear to step back. He said that he was not suggesting a default, but instead that the government could seek to repurchase debt for less than the face value of the securities. The government, in other words, would seek to repay less money than it borrowed.Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said that she shared Mr. Trump\u2019s concern about the size of the federal debt, but that the issue needed to be addressed through changes in fiscal policy \u2014 some combination of less spending and more revenue.\u201cIt\u2019s a policy problem, not a debt-management problem,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen it comes to fiscal responsibility, people are always looking for the easiest of answers. If there were low-hanging fruit here, the Treasury Department would already be on it.\u201dRepurchasing debt is a fairly common tactic in the corporate world, but it only works if the debt is trading at a discount. If creditors think they are going to get 80 cents for every dollar they are owed, they may be overjoyed to get 90 cents. Mr. Trump\u2019s companies had sometimes been able to retire debt at a discount because creditors feared they might default.But Mr. Trump\u2019s statement might show the limits of translating his business acumen into the world of government finance. The United States simply cannot pursue a similar strategy. The government runs an annual deficit, so it must borrow to retire existing debt. Any measures that would reduce the value of the existing debt, making it cheaper to repurchase, would increase the cost of issuing new debt. Such a threat also could undermine the stability of global financial markets.In 1979, for example, what the government described as \u201cbookkeeping problems\u201d temporarily delayed $120 million in interest payments. In the aftermath of the delay, investors pushed up interest rates on Treasuries by about 0.6 percentage point, according to a 1989 study by Terry L. Zivney of the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, and Richard D. Marcus of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. That cost taxpayers roughly $12 billion.In 2011, federal borrowing costs climbed as congressional Republicans refused for a time to increase the federal government\u2019s statutory borrowing limit, raising doubts about the government\u2019s ability to repay its debts. The Bipartisan Policy Center calculated that the higher rates will cost taxpayers about $19 billion.There is a limited opportunity for Mr. Trump to pursue bond buybacks without disrupting markets. He could seek to take advantage of the market\u2019s preference for brand-new Treasuries. In a longstanding quirk, older vintages of Treasuries trade at slightly lower prices than the latest issuance. Treasury officials have discussed issuing new debt to fund purchases of older debt, but they would do so because newer securities are easier for investors to buy and sell. That might improve the workings of financial markets. Any savings, however, would be small change.\u201cIt would not move the needle at all on the overall debt,\u201d Mr. Crandall, the economist, said.Advertisement"}

Maybe, an Italian Court Says", "Date": "2016-05-03", "News": "Supported byROME \u2014 Stealing food from a supermarket may not be a crime in Italy if you are homeless and hungry, the nation\u2019s highest appeals court has ruled.In a case that has drawn comparisons to \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables,\u201d the Supreme Court of Cassation threw out the conviction of a homeless man from Ukraine, Roman Ostriakov, who was caught trying to take 4.07 euros \u2014 about $4.70 \u2014 worth of cheese and sausage from a store in Genoa without paying for it. A trial court sentenced him in February 2015 to six months in jail and a fine of \u20ac100.The court\u2019s decision went far beyond what the appeal in the case had sought. Valeria Fazio, the prosecutor at the Genoa court where the trial was held, said in a telephone interview that her office understood that Mr. Ostriakov had stolen only out of need, and had appealed in hopes that the court might set a more lenient sentence.But the court decided that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t have to be punished at all,\u201d Ms. Fazio said.The court has yet to release its full reasoning in the case, but Gherardo Colombo, a former member of the Supreme Court of Cassation, said it seemed to rely on an Italian legal doctrine: \u201cAd impossibilia nemo tenetur.\u201dThe term is Latin for \u201cNo one is expected to do the impossible.\u201dMaurizio Bellacosa, a professor of criminal law at Luiss University in Italy who has often argued cases before the Court of Cassation, said that the application of that doctrine in a shoplifting case \u201chas a certain novelty.\u201d\u201cThey rarely apply the \u2018state of necessity,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Bellacosa said, and when they do, it is generally in cases \u201clike a castaway who fights with another shipwreck victim for the last raft he has to save his life.\u201dWhen examining thefts by poor people, he said, \u201cusually the court classifies these cases as smaller crimes, but crimes, as poverty is considered avoidable through the social support system.\u201dIn contrast with the American legal system, the decisions of the Court of Cassation do not necessarily create binding precedents for lower courts to follow. But Mr. Bellacosa said the decision in the Ostriakov case \u201cis a new principle, and it might lead to a more frequent application of the state of necessity linked to poverty situations.\u201dThe ruling quickly generated a heated response in Italy.In the 1970s, when Italy was rocked by violent leftist groups like the Red Brigades, radicalized youths \u201cplundered supermarkets with impunity in the name of the working class,\u201d but they stole \u201ccaviar and Champagne,\u201d Mr. Gramellini added. \u201cNow, people don\u2019t steal to pursue an ideal, but to fill up their stomach.\u201dMr. Colombo, the former member of the Supreme Court of Cassation, said he believed that the decision in the Ostriakov case was correct.Mr. Ostriakov, 30, was spotted by another customer when he tried to leave the supermarket with cheese and sausage in his pocket after having only paid for some breadsticks. Mr. Colombo said it was important legally that the theft was nonviolent.\u201cIt would have been different if he had committed a robbery,\u201d he said. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have acquitted him.\u201dGaia Pianigiani reported from Rome, and Sewell Chan from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thomas Perez, a Labor Watchdog Who\u2019s Not All Bite", "Date": "2016-05-14", "News": "Supported byRevaluedOn a recent Wednesday at lunchtime, Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez strolled through the clattering kitchen of the Modern, the haute eatery at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.As sous-chefs finished plates of poached salmon and foie gras for the dining room, Mr. Perez quizzed employees on their working conditions and benefits. Were they adequately compensated? Did they make enough to save for retirement? Were they proud to work there?Mr. Perez nodded appreciatively, but he wasn\u2019t necessarily surprised. The visit was part of an unusual effort by the labor secretary to find common ground between his office and the business community.It\u2019s not an obvious pairing. The Labor Department is charged with improving working conditions and benefits for employees, job seekers and retirees. That means pressuring companies to raise wages and spend more on perks, efforts that can drag on profits. When it does single out companies, it is usually in the form of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration bringing an enforcement action against what it deems an irresponsible employer.But in the waning days of the Obama administration, Mr. Perez is turning the spotlight on companies he believes exemplify social and environmental responsibility.\u201cThe employers who do best are employers who reject these false choices,\u201d Mr. Perez said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a zero-sum world where you either take care of your workers or you take care of your shareholders. You can do good and do well, too.\u201dDarrell M. West, vice president for governance studies at the Brookings Institution, said Mr. Perez was breaking the mold of the office. \u201cIt is unusual for a labor secretary to be building bridges with the business community,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is an atypical era.\u201dMr. Perez is also an atypical cabinet secretary. The son of first-generation immigrants from the Dominican Republic, he paid his way through Brown University by collecting trash and working in the cafeteria. He went on to study at Harvard Law School, then worked as a federal prosecutor in the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division. While there, he led an interagency task force designed to improve conditions for low-wage workers.Mr. Perez has won elected office only once \u2014 in 2002, when he took a seat on the Montgomery County Council in Maryland. In that role, he continued to campaign for vulnerable employees, opposing mergers likely to result in job cuts and fighting for better benefits for county workers.In 2007, he was appointed to run the Maryland Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, where his efforts to help workers continued. And in 2009, President Obama appointed Mr. Perez assistant attorney general for civil rights, where he took on discrimination by police, discrimination in schools and onerous voter ID laws.\u201cHe\u2019s the first labor secretary I\u2019m aware of that has gone beyond this \u2018us versus them\u2019 mentality,\u201d Mr. Meyer, of Union Square Hospitality, said. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to set an example, and he\u2019s looking for businesses that are already embracing the very policies he wants to see others embrace.\u201dMr. Perez\u2019s courting of chief executives also stems from a recognition that his department alone can\u2019t fix the problems bedeviling American workers. Thorny issues like wage stagnation, stingy vacation time, shoddy manufacturing and environmental degradation are so complex, so entrenched, that no one government agency can tackle them (not to mention the diminished influence of organized labor).\u201cSecretary Perez recognizes that to address these issues, he can\u2019t do it with the Labor Department alone,\u201d Mr. West, of Brookings, said. \u201cHe has to encourage business people to step up to the plate.\u201dIndeed, the scope of what Mr. Perez is advocating goes well beyond the limited purview of the Labor Department, and will take much longer than the 250 or so days he has left in office. Understanding as much, Mr. Perez is trying to convince businesses that it is in their self-interest to increase wages, offer better health care and take better care of the environment.\u201cGovernment alone can\u2019t fix this,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is about a generational shift, and it is not going to happen in six months.\u201dMr. Perez offers few specifics when describing his vision of an economy that works for all. Beyond calling for a higher minimum wage, he has not identified specific benchmarks companies should meet in order to win his approval. Instead, he speaks generally of reforming corporate culture, and allowing managers the freedom to put workers first.\u201cThere\u2019s a myth out there that you have to genuflect at the altar of quarterly earnings,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a false choice that you can either be a good fiduciary or promote values such as environmental sustainability.\u201dIt all sounds good, but in truth, there\u2019s only so much Mr. Perez can do as labor secretary. And while he has showered praise on the Modern, and on start-ups like Managed by Q, a cleaning company, and UncommonGoods, which makes jewelry and other items, only a few big companies \u2014 Costco, Nestl\u00e9 and Whole Foods Market among them \u2014 have won his limited endorsement.He demurred when asked about joining the ticket. \u201cI haven\u2019t had any conversations about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just doing my day job.\u201dIt\u2019s a day job intended to help other people with day jobs. He wants companies to take better care of their employees, even if it costs them in the short term. It\u2019s not a message many C.E.O.s want to hear, but Mr. Perez believes it is his duty to spread the word.\u201cWe\u2019re building a movement,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s undeniably a work in progress, but there\u2019s a fundamental desire to see capitalism to do something different.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "No Doubt Now: Donald Trump Is Here to Stay", "Date": "2016-05-04", "News": "Supported byLettersTo the Editor:To bemoan the ascendancy of Donald Trump as the presumptive Republican nominee is pointless and a waste of time. He is here to stay, and he should not be underestimated in the presidential election in November. He is neither a true Republican nor, obviously, a true Democrat. He is a wild card who promises, without the slightest effort to tell us how, to end the paralysis of American politics, and reassert American power around the world.Sounds great, and there is a huge electorate out there that does not care whether Mr. Trump has any idea about how to accomplish these lofty goals. This is not a movement akin to the Bernie Sanders phenomenon. This is pure, empty machismo and bombast, the likes of which we have not seen in American politics in my lifetime.The truth remains that there is an inescapable and palpable feeling around the country that the \u201cidea\u201d people in Washington have failed miserably because their party allegiances prevented them from compromising on anything. Mr. Trump represents a potential breakthrough in that political stalemate. If the Democrats are dismissive about the level of discontent that Mr. Trump has effectively tapped into, the November election is going to be nail-biter.PETER C. ALKALAYScarsdale, N.Y.To the Editor:In the probable presidential contest between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton there is one factor that will, in my view, likely result in a Democratic landslide.The Republican establishment is fearful that a Trump presidency would not only be an unmitigated disaster but also could destroy the party. The thought of an apparent buffoon with nowhere near the necessary knowledge base, appropriate experience or proper temperament becoming a Republican president of the United States is so utterly repulsive and scary that many of them will just sit out the election.These people would rather lose a presidential election, and possibly the Senate and the House as well, than risk an utterly inept performance on both the domestic and international fronts that would at best make their party a laughingstock and at worst cause its demise.JERRY RAPPNew YorkTo the Editor:I was disappointed that Nate Cohn, in analyzing Donald Trump\u2019s chances of winning the presidency, states, \u201cThere isn\u2019t much evidence that Americans are particularly dissatisfied with the state of the economy,\u201d citing the unemployment rate and other data.This is the mistake that, alas, has given us Mr. Trump as the candidate of a major party. Elections are decided not on employment statistics but rather on how voters regard their own places and possibilities in the economy.Unemployment is indeed relatively low, but the feeling of being left behind is obviously widely shared; it contributed greatly to the vote totals for both Mr. Trump and Bernie Sanders. If people feel that they are underpaid, or underused, or stuck or sliding backward, then the actual employment rate is much less significant in predicting how people will vote.The belief that opportunity now exists only for a highly educated and networked elite is distorting our politics and, unless faced and addressed, will affect in dangerous ways the outcome of the November election.DAVID LEBEDOFFMinneapolisThe writer is the author of \u201cThe Uncivil War: How a New Elite Is Destroying Our Democracy.\u201dTo the Editor:Imagine a cadre of dedicated, informed and, yes, idealistic young people voting this year and in years to come for dedicated, informed and, yes, idealistic politicians.VIRGINIA G.

{"Headline": "Cuomo Loyalist With Troubled Finances Is at Center of U.S. Inquiry", "Date": "2016-05-06", "News": "Supported byALBANY \u2014 As a former aide to both Andrew M. Cuomo and his father, Todd R. Howe built a reputation as a prominent lobbyist in Albany and Washington, with top clients like the Metropolitan Museum of Art and major developers in upstate New York.The allegations against Mr. Howe, who has not been charged with a crime, are not clear. But a review of court documents and public records found that his professional persona masked a history of chaotic and slipshod financial dealings, including a 2003 bankruptcy and nearly $400,000 in federal tax liens and other judgments against him.Though he looked every bit the prosperous Beltway insider, with large homes in the Maryland suburbs and children in elite New England boarding schools, he appeared to be often short of money, dodging tens of thousands of dollars in bills from a long lineup of local car dealerships and home-improvement businesses.At one point, in 2009, he was apparently so pressed for money that he made a false bank deposit for $45,000 \u2014 a felony theft charge, to which he pleaded guilty and received a one-year probation sentence.Governor Cuomo has taken pains to distance himself from Mr. Howe since news of the investigation broke. On Monday, the governor\u2019s counsel, Alphonso David, wrote a letter addressed to all executive branch agencies warning against any \u201clobbying communications,\u201d including phone calls, emails or meetings, with Mr. Howe or anyone connected with his business.\u201cWhy does that not surprise me?\u201d Steve Klitsch, a contractor who sued Mr. Howe over an unpaid kitchen renovation bill for his $2.1 million Potomac home, said upon learning that Mr. Howe was involved in a federal inquiry. \u201cI guess he\u2019s now really gone big time.\u201dMr. Howe did not return messages seeking comment. A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, declined to comment on the governor\u2019s relationship with Mr. Howe.His is a past littered with erratic behavior and litigation. In 2002, a bank sued Mr. Howe and his wife for failing to pay back a $90,000 home equity loan. In 2010, he was prosecuted for failing to return a rental car, a felony. He has had his wages garnished to pay off judgments in at least four cases. Over the past 11 years, he was ordered to pay nearly $15,000 to two tree landscaping companies alone.All the while, his route through Albany and Washington kept intersecting with that of Mr. Cuomo and his inner circle.His ties to the Cuomo family date to 1984, when he joined Gov. Mario M. Cuomo\u2019s administration as a traveling aide. In November 1988, Mr. Howe was aboard a state-owned airplane with the governor when smoke began filling the cabin, forcing an emergency landing in the middle of the night.The two men remained close.\u201cWe brought him down, sat him down and basically said, \u2018Hey Joe, here\u2019s what we need done,\u2019\u201d Mr. Howe recalled to The Observer, of their move to Washington. \u201cAnd Joe again stepped into the fray.\u201dHis financial troubles were already mounting. He faced a foreclosure case in Maryland in 1999, another the next year and a third in 2006. Around the time he joined WOH, he and his wife found themselves in court, being sued by a contractor, Fernando Alban, over an unpaid bill for a kitchen renovation.\u201cHe always seemed to be a wheeler-dealer,\u201d said Donald B. Weisfeld, who was Mr. Alban\u2019s lawyer in the case. \u201cMoney was constantly coming in and out, but neither one of us really knew what he did.\u201dHe would not answer phone calls. Several of his checks bounced. Yet he \u201cdressed well\u201d and \u201clooked like he had money,\u201d Mr. Alban said.Mr. Alban won a judgment against the Howes. The sum was not princely \u2014 a little less than $8,000 \u2014 but larger cases would follow.In the bank-theft case, Mr. Howe confessed to filling out a $45,000 deposit slip without including a check, making it appear as though he had $45,000 in his TD Bank account, according to court records. He had already drawn a check for that amount to be paid to Union College, a private liberal-arts school in Schenectady, N.Y., which had been unsuccessfully trying to collect more than $35,000 from him.When TD Bank discovered the discrepancy, Mr. Howe said he must have dropped the check he meant to deposit. He promised to get a replacement check from Fidelity Investments, where, investigators later determined, he had never had an account.Mr. Howe pleaded guilty in April 2010 and was sentenced to one year of probation.It was unclear what the Union College bill was for. Mr. Howe sent his children to expensive private schools, but not, apparently, to Union, according to online profiles of his children.Having to pay tuition was one of several excuses he gave Mr. Klitsch, the Maryland contractor who won a judgment for more than $4,000 against Mr. Howe in 2009 after Mr. Howe stopped making payments on his kitchen renovation bill, Mr. Klitsch said.Mr. Klitsch said he found that his was only the latest local business to sue the lobbyist. The list read like the Maryland yellow pages: a swimming pool technician, a lumberyard, a heating technician and so on.\u201cThey said: \u2018Steve, good luck, man. I tried suing him, and it didn\u2019t work. Good luck!\u2019\u201d Mr. Klitsch recalled. \u201cI was joking with them, \u2018Why don\u2019t we go down there, put a big sign in the yard: Todd Howe Doesn\u2019t Pay.\u2019 He\u2019s a professional rip-off guy.\u201dDespite his jumbled finances, Mr. Howe and his wife, Sarah, a public-relations consultant, bought a $1.8 million home in Washington in June 2015.Emmarie Huetteman contributed reporting from Washington, and Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}

It was part of a broad $500 million investment plan to make the steel mill competitive and profitable.But China has stymied the strategy.The steel mill, owned by the privately held Celsa Group of Spain, just cannot compete with Chinese rivals, which offered products at 20 percent below prevailing rates in Britain. Celsa estimates that Chinese companies at one point accounted for about half of the region\u2019s sales in a certain type of reinforcing bar, up from essentially nothing just four years ago.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to have free trade, but it has to be fair,\u201d said Luis Sanz, the managing director for British operations at Celsa.The steel industry sits at the crux of a major debate playing out across the world economy, one that could soon be intensified by a looming change in the global trade rules.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.As China\u2019s economy has slowed, the country\u2019s manufacturers, in varied areas like solar panels, tires, aluminum and shoes, have been in a desperate hunt to maintain sales and avoid layoffs. Looking beyond their borders, many are offering rock-bottom prices to win orders.The heavy discounting has fed a backlash. Politicians like the American presidential candidates Donald J. Trump and Bernie Sanders are railing against free trade, saying the rules hurt domestic workers. Countries are crying foul, claiming that Chinese exporters are dumping goods.And the dynamics are getting more complicated, as a crucial provision of global trade rules expires in December.When China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, the country was labeled a nonmarket economy, at the insistence of the United States and Europe. The technical designation makes it easier to prove that China is dumping goods in foreign markets, allowing countries to slap tariffs on those products. In March, the United States imposed a prohibitive 266 percent tariff on certain Chinese steel makers for selling below cost.Calculating production costs in China is tricky. The true costs are often obscured by politically guided policies that benefit companies, including state-backed loans at below-market interest rates and free land for job-creating factories.Given China\u2019s designation in the W.T.O., the United States, Europe and others can use a proxy country, a locale with a similar level of income and better data like Poland, Thailand or South Africa, to help determine production costs. The proxy countries often have higher costs than China, which has greater economies of scale.China is beginning a global lobbying push to bar the use of proxy countries. Chinese ministers have been meeting with overseas leaders and with executives of businesses that sell to China. The country is calling for W.T.O. members to \u201cacknowledge China\u2019s market economy status\u201d and \u201cto adopt the necessary measures as soon as possible,\u201d the commerce ministry said in a faxed response to questions.But the rules are somewhat ambiguous, complicating China\u2019s efforts. The 2001 W.T.O. agreement explicitly authorizes the use of proxy countries through December in cases against China, but it is silent about what happens after that.The Europeans and Americans are skeptical about whether China actually qualifies as a so-called market economy. In a market economy, supply and demand are the guiding forces. In China, the government also plays a major role, dictating investments, strategy, even when a plant can close.China\u2019s policies have helped create extensive overcapacity. China makes 50 percent of the world\u2019s steel, 55 percent of its aluminum and 60 percent of its cement, even as its domestic demand has weakened.\u201cThey\u2019re nowhere near a market economy, and it\u2019s delusional to think that they are,\u201d said Leo W. Gerard, the president of the United Steelworkers Union.The tensions have been palpable in steel.Celsa and other Western steel manufacturers got clobbered by the global financial crisis that started in 2008, as demand sank and prices dropped. When the industry started to recover, they faced a growing competitive threat from China.In the last three years, Chinese steel exports more than doubled to 107 million metric tons, higher than the annual raw steel production of the United States. Prices fell steeply, although they have perked up lately on speculation of renewed demand in China.The result has been a shakeout in steel.Celsa has not turned a profit in seven years. ArcelorMittal, the world\u2019s largest steel maker, announced an annual loss of nearly $8 billion in February, blaming Chinese competition. Since the beginning of last year, United States Steel has cut 5,000 jobs and warned that thousands of others are at risk.\u201cUnfairly traded steel imports have reached historic levels in 2015 and 2016, taking almost 30 percent share of the domestic steel market,\u201d Doug Matthews, a U.S. Steel executive, testified in a government hearing last month.China faces its own share of pain.Hundreds of steel makers are limping along, overloaded with debt and battered by weak prices. The chairman of Dongbei Special Steel, a large Chinese company, hanged himself in March, days before the company began defaulting on loans.The global downturn has created a political firestorm. In February, thousands of steelworkers marched in Brussels, the headquarters of the European Union, demanding protection from Chinese products.The issue flared up again when Tata Steel announced plans to sell or close its money-losing business in Britain, prompting calls for an emergency session of Parliament. Tata has managed to find takers for some of its plants, but about 11,000 jobs in Britain remain at risk.\u201cEffective antidumping measures have to be implemented as quickly as possible,\u201d said Wolfgang Eder, chief executive of Voestalpine, one of Europe\u2019s largest steel makers, warning that \u201cmany thousands more E.U. jobs are under severe threat.\u201dThe political mess could set up a standoff over the W.T.O. rules, since they are one of the industry\u2019s main defense mechanisms.The Obama administration has pressed China to follow through on promises of market-oriented reforms, to help level the playing field. The administration has not taken a public position on whether to repeal proxy country procedures for China, which would require legislation.Getting legislation through Congress is even more difficult than usual this year. Trade is a touchy subject in the presidential election. And the administration\u2019s trade priority is to win congressional approval of the Trans-Pacific Partnership with China\u2019s economic rivals in the region, including Japan and Vietnam.Europe, which is just starting to consider the issue, is looking at a compromise, by toughening penalties against China while still conferring market status on the country. Doing nothing \u201cmay well create new and serious frictions in our bilateral relationship with China,\u201d Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, the European trade commissioner, said in a speech in March, adding that three million jobs in Europe depend on sales to China.The two-way relationship is what makes the trade rules so complex.If China does not prevail, some players worry about getting stuck with insufficient and high-cost goods from local factories. \u201cWe don\u2019t want locals to go out of business, but we want it to be free and fair,\u201d said Jeffrey Kabel, the chairman of the International Steel Trade Association, a group in London that represents the entire steel food chain, including traders, producers and users. A big worry among customers, he said, is that they \u201cwon\u2019t have a choice for buying.\u201dOn the flip side, the Celsa production line, with its glowing metal rods, employs about 750 people. Mr. Sanz said the plant was not yet ready to start layoffs, although the jobs could also not be guaranteed.\u201cWe want fair competition to see who survives,\u201d he said.Stanley Reed reported from Cardiff, Wales, and Keith Bradsher from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}

Trump and Hillary Clinton are locked in tight races in three crucial states in November\u2019s general election, according to new polls that show men and women sharply divided on the presidential candidates and the likelihood of a close overall contest.\u201cAt this juncture, Trump is doing better in Pennsylvania than the G.O.P. nominees in 2008 and 2012,\u201d said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac Poll. \u201cAnd the two candidates are about where their party predecessors were at this point in Ohio and Florida.\u201dMr. Trump became the Republican Party\u2019s presumptive nominee last week after Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio dropped out of the race. Mrs. Clinton holds a substantial delegate lead over Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in the Democratic contest, but he is continuing to compete in coming primaries, including Tuesday\u2019s Democratic voting contest in West Virginia.The polls do offer some support for Mr. Sanders\u2019s argument to stay in the race, as he outperforms Mrs. Clinton in head-to-head matchups against Mr. Trump in the three states. The senator from Vermont tops Mr. Trump by two points in Florida and Ohio and by six points in Pennsylvania.In the expected general election contest between Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton, the divide between men and women is stark. She holds wide leads with women in Pennsylvania and Florida and a smaller one in Ohio, while Mr. Trump holds big leads with male voters in all three states.Voters generally think that Mr. Trump is better equipped to manage the economy and handle terrorism, but they view Mrs. Clinton as more intelligent and having \u201chigher moral standards.\u201d In all three states, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump receive low marks from prospective voters when it comes to their honesty and trustworthiness.Although Mr. Trump holds a wide lead among white men, some of his central proposals \u00e2\u0080\u0094 such as deporting all undocumented immigrants and building a wall along the Mexican border \u00e2\u0080\u0094 remain divisive. In Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania, most voters think that undocumented immigrants should be able to stay in the United States while applying for citizenship. Floridians are split on the merits of a wall, while most Ohio and Pennsylvania voters are against it.Mr. Brown noted that nonwhite voters in Florida are overwhelmingly against Mr. Trump\u2019s wall, but that his support among white men is keeping him competitive\u00c2\u00a0in the state.\u201cRepublicans\u2019 weakness among minority voters is well-known,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cBut the reason this race is so close over all is Clinton\u2019s historic weakness among white men.\u201d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "New Aircraft Give Market Some Lift", "Date": "2016-05-23", "News": "Supported bySpecial Report: Business AviationThe market for large business jets has fared remarkably well in recent years, despite the global recession, as a new generation of buyers in Russia, China or Brazil has been won over by the sleek appeal of speedy and luxurious planes that can connect most points in the world without stopping for fuel.But there are now signs of a slowdown in the private jet market. The oil and commodities collapse and the slowdown in emerging markets over the past two years has put a dent in demand, particularly from emerging countries. \u201cClearly, as the global economy continues to soften, the business aviation industry has felt that impact,\u201d said Brian Sill, the president of commercial aviation for Honeywell Aerospace, a major provider of avionics, engines and other components. \u201cThere are some headwinds in the world right now, in places like China, and in Russia, and those are being felt in the industry.\u201d Last year, new plane sales reached about $22 billion, with 712 new jets delivered, according to Rolland Vincent, an aviation consultant and market researcher. The market this year should soften, with projected sales of 680 jets. Large planes account for over half of all business jet purchases each year, and for 80 percent of the industry\u2019s sales value, given the much higher prices they can command. \u201cIt\u2019s always been a cyclical business and people tend to forget this in the good times,\u201d Mr. Vincent said. Still, the appeal of private jets remains strong, particularly in the category of bigger jets with larger cabins that can fly farther than ever without stopping for fuel. These jets remain a staple of corporate fleets in the United States and are prized by hedge fund managers and venture capitalists looking for bragging rights. As demand slows down in Asia and the Middle East, it is picking up in North America, where buyers are looking for deals in the previously owned market. The appetite for size and speed is behind the global success of the Gulfstream G650, a $65-million twin-engine jet with a top speed of 610 miles per hour (982 kilometers per hour) and range of 7,000 nautical miles (13,000 kilometers), along with rivals like the Bombardier\u2019s Global 5000 and the Dassault Falcon 7X.These planes can effortlessly link New York to Beijing or London to Los Angeles in a dozen or so hours while offering great comfort and luxurious amenities \u2014 like leather chairs, oversized windows, and wood paneling. They offer the \u201cbillionaire class\u201d and top corporate leaders a shortcut from commercial flying with none of the hassles of regular air travel. Cabins are pressurized at half the levels of commercial airplanes, which means less dryness and fatigue and more comfortable trips. High-speed Internet is readily available for streaming movies or conducting video conferences. Pilots have heads-up displays that allow them to see obstacles even when visibility is low. \u201cThe great beauty is that people can really get somewhere nonstop they couldn\u2019t get to before,\u201d said Mr. Vincent. \u201cThese people want to be very discreet, and going direct nonstop is a big deal for them. They save time and save the hardships of being observed. It\u2019s a privacy and security issue for them.\u201d Chad Anderson, the president of Jetcraft, a trader, investor and brokerage company, summed up the appeal of business jets as \u201crange, comfort, and a general sensibility to operating economics.\u201d\u201cThe globalization of the world isn\u2019t getting any less global,\u201d said Mr. Anderson. \u201cIt\u2019s getting more global. There is more demand to go international. There are also more and more sensitivities to security and safety.\u201d Honeywell, which has conducted market surveys for more than three decade, forecast about 9,200 deliveries of new jets through 2025, worth a total $270 billion. The company also expects that deliveries in 2016 will be slightly lower this year than last year, but it sees a sharp rebound after 2017 as new jets come on the market.Analysts pointed out that, while demand was slowing in Asia and elsewhere, the market for jets in the United States and North America generally \u2014 which accounts for more than half global sales \u2014 had picked up.Planes that were sold to Chinese buyers five or six years ago are returning on the second-hand market in the United States. \u201cWe have what used to be an eastward-heading market heading west again,\u201d said Mr. Anderson. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more corporate buyers here in the U.S. right now, primarily in the replacement market.\u201d Many corporate fleets had put their replacement plans on hold in recent years and now find the need to renew their planes. \u201cAircraft values are still pretty depressed in historical terms, but in the eyes of astute buyers that\u2019s an opportunity,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. Estimates about the future vary. Mr. Vincent expects to see 7,900 jets delivered in the next 10 years. He recently reduced his forecast by six to seven percent because of current market dynamics. In addition, analysts point out that there\u2019s a long list of new planes to pick from for buyers seeking their first plane or looking for a replacement option. \u201cThe polish has come off some of the legacy models that have been in the market for a while, and customers are migrating to the new models,\u201d said Mr. Vincent. The top three major manufacturers all have a new plane at various stage of development and certification.Dassault\u2019s new tri-engine Falcon 8X, which is close to certification, recently completed a round-the-world demonstration tour covering 55,000 nautical miles and over 60 flights, ahead of its anticipated entry into service in the second half of this year. The airplane, estimated to cost about $58 million, made its debut at the 2015 Paris Air Show, and provides more range that its predecessor, the 7X. It would be able to reach Beijing from Los Angeles.That model will be followed by the Falcon 5X, a twin-engine plane. That aircraft, expected to be delivered in 2020, will have less range than the other variants but comes with a more spacious cabin because of its larger fuselage volume. The plane will also have what is widely believed to be the first-ever skylight in an aircraft.At Gulfstream, the new G500 and G600 are currently in early production and testing stages, and should come out of the production lines in 2018. Chasing them both in terms of delivery time is Canada\u2019s Bombardier, whose production of the new Global 7000 and Global 8000 have been delayed at least two years and should come into service, respectively, in 2018 and 2019. In addition, there\u2019s a crop of new planes coming on the market, starting with the newest addition to the list of business jet manufactures, Honda Aircraft, which recently delivered the first HondaJet in Europe after receiving its flight certification last year.Others include the Pilatus PC-24, a six-passenger midrange jet that is being developed by Pilatus Aircraft in Switzerland and had its first flight last year, with deliveries expected in 2017. The second half of next year should also see the certification and first delivery of the Cessna Citation Latitude, from Textron Aviation.\u201cThere are several major new platforms in development, and we are very excited about that, because it always creates a lift for the industry,\u201d said Mr. Sill of Honeywell.

Sadly, it has not.In comparative terms, by the proportion of national income diverted to reducing budget deficits, Greece had absorbed austerity measures almost nine times the magnitude of those imposed in Italy and about three times Portugal\u2019s. The result? Between 2009 and 2014, Italy\u2019s economy grew by a paltry 2 percent and Portugal\u2019s contracted by 1 percent; in the same period, Greece\u2019s national income dwindled by a catastrophic 26.6 percent \u2014 about the same as for America in the depths of the Great Depression. The result was a humanitarian disaster only a 21st-century John Steinbeck could adequately describe.Against this background, Greek voters elected my then party, Syriza, in January 2015 to negotiate an end to self-defeating austerity in exchange for serious reforms. With the state now living within its means, I strove, as the country\u2019s new finance minister, to convince our European and institutional lenders that their interest and ours would best be served by reducing tax rates and avoiding further cuts to already much reduced pensions. As a compromise, I even promised a \u201cdeficit brake\u201d \u2014 automatic tax hikes that would kick in if government revenues did not pick up within an agreed period.Amid this endless suffering, have any lessons been learned?

{"Headline": "Fleeing Fire in Canada\u2019s Oil Country", "Date": "2016-05-06", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorDevon, Alberta \u2014 I DON\u2019T know if my house still exists. I believe it does, for now. The latest reports show 12 homes destroyed in our neighborhood in Fort McMurray, Alberta. They\u2019re trailer homes, on the other side of the main road from us, edging up against the forest. This is oil sands country, and although this is a depressed economy, the trailer homes are worth about $500,000 each. Even in Canadian currency that\u2019s a lot.The Fort McMurray community of nearly 80,000 is in the heart of the Athabasca oil sands region. Unlike drilling, extracting oil from sand is costly, and works best when the price of oil is high. The last decade saw a boom of near-Klondike proportions. People from all over the country moved here, and a lot of them maxed out their lives \u2014 adding A.T.V.s and dirt bikes to their driveways, and working too many shifts to ever drive them. Then, around 2014, the overtime dried up, though people were still trying to live a time-and-a-half life. During the boom, people planned new facilities and infrastructure upgrades dependent on a future blessed with oil at $100 a barrel. Now empty lots lie undeveloped, waiting for the next upturn. If it comes.We\u2019ve had perfect conditions for a fire: A mild winter and a drier than usual spring caused lower moisture levels. One spark can grow quickly here, in boreal Canada, where forests surround the town. Unseasonal swirling winds took it from brush fire to disaster.When we left our home to drive north to a safe place to take shelter on Tuesday, the roads were clogged, with traffic almost at a standstill. The trip we set out on normally takes 45 minutes; this time it took six times as long. For people who left after we did, it took twice as much again. I tried to imagine what that would have been like: nine hours, crawling along with an anxious beagle and a fractious 7-year-old on board. No thanks.As we drove, we could see the fire in the distance, threatening the town. Radio reports confirmed what we finally realized. This was no overnight inconvenience. The evacuation was Alberta\u2019s biggest, a whole town emptied in a polite and orderly fashion, according to the Canadian stereotype.My wife was out \u201cat site,\u201d the local name for the oil sands businesses. Her company, Syncrude, reopened lodgings set to be demolished, and by my reckoning were able to accommodate close to 3,000 employees and their families, for which we were all thankful. The mattresses had dubious stains and no bedding, but they were safe from the fire.We left at just after 5 the next morning, heading back south to somewhere we could stay longer. Everybody who left town and drove north, between 10,000 and 20,000 of us, knew that at some point we had to return. Past our burning homes and our deserted city.As we came back toward town, the smoke was wall-like, reducing visibility to a few yards ahead of our lights. The flames had crossed the highway already, and we had been told they had also jumped the Athabasca River, about the length of a football field. It was scarcely believable until we saw the burned grass on both banks.Our home was surrounded by houses that are burning. Later we heard the firefighters had been pulled out of our suburb. Either they\u2019ve won, or lost. We fear the latter.The day we left, some of our friends were dousing their cedar-shingled roofs with their garden hoses. It was futile, and they knew it, but the brain seizes under pressure. One neighbor packed his lawn mower, surely not an essential wherever he was heading. Later, on the way north, I fretted about the bananas I had left on the counter, wondering if they would ooze all over the place as they rotted.The smoke billowed and hovered, rank and nasty. It felt like a film set. Tom Cruise would come around the corner and be told off by Emily Blunt. They\u2019d laugh, hear \u201cCut,\u201d and call for a do-over. But there are no second chances in Fort McMurray, not at the moment. My family and I made it out of town on Wednesday 30 minutes before they closed the road south. We don\u2019t know when we will be allowed back. Home is an R.V. parked at my brother-in-law\u2019s house. We\u2019re lucky.I sought counsel from people who had made it through a 2011 fire. Keep your receipts, and when you get home don\u2019t try to clean a fridge with two weeks\u2019 worth of rotten food. \u201cGet rid of it,\u201d advised a survivor of both infernos.I think I can stop worrying about my bananas.Kevin Thornton lives in Fort McMurray, Alberta.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Miami Emerges From Gloom Into Residential and Commercial Sunlight", "Date": "2016-05-10", "News": "Supported bySquare FeetMIAMI \u2014 It was always Miami Beach, a barrier island on the sun-dappled Atlantic, that attracted the attention, the glamorous notices, the billions of dollars in real estate speculation.Just four miles away on the mainland, the sprawling metropolis of Miami suffered for years in the comparison, its scruffy downtown largely devoid of life after offices closed for the day and commuters fled to the suburbs. Inner-city neighborhoods, mired in poverty, were far from investors\u2019 radars.\u201cIt was a ghost town, with vacant parcels, no residential areas, no museums,\u201d said Alan R. Kleber, managing director of the local office of JLL, an investment management company that specializes in commercial real estate. \u201cIt was a wasteland with an amazing view.\u201dMiami long struggled to achieve the patina of prosperity, even though glimmers appeared in the Brickell neighborhood, where condominium towers and office buildings proliferated, and more recently in the Design District, with its elegant boutiques.Now, a wave of commercial and residential development in downtown Miami and its periphery is altering the city\u2019s skyline. And in providing options for those less affluent than the condo dwellers by the water, it is challenging the long-held perception that Miami is not a place where a middle-class person can live well and raise a family.\u201cIt\u2019s become dynamic and vibrant, even for the naysayers,\u201d Mr. Kleber said of the last few years. \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is the densification of a city, right before your eyes. We\u2019re watching another Manhattan being built.\u201dWhile such comparisons may be hyperbolic, data show a significant increase in downtown residential properties \u2014 many of them rental apartments \u2014 in tandem with construction of multipurpose developments, retail stores, restaurants, supermarkets, a mass transit hub and cultural institutions.The building rush seeks to capitalize on a growing number of jobs in the city\u2019s business and financial sector, which serves hundreds of banks, private equity firms and hedge funds. With its economy now on decidedly firm footing, the Miami area \u2014 with a balmy climate, exotic surroundings and international flair \u2014 is an appealing place for companies from elsewhere, especially Latin America.Over the next five years, businesses in the city are expected to add almost 20,000 office jobs, the agency said, estimating that some 385,000 square feet of new office space are under development.Much of that work force will shun living outside Miami, in large part because of the horrendous rush-hour traffic. The decidedly untrendy suburbs are often not even considered by new arrivals, who want to be close to the barrier island\u2019s South Beach neighborhood, even if they cannot afford to live there.\u201cPeople want to be able to walk to work, to restaurants or to the park,\u201d said Nitin Motwani, a developer of Miami Worldcenter, a $2 billion, 27-acre development that broke ground in March.The project, being built on land assembled from some 50 parcels that Mr. Motwani and his associates began buying at auction 12 years ago, will include pedestrian-only streets with stores and restaurants, a hotel, a 500-unit condominium tower and, in other structures, more than 1,200 rental apartments aimed at moderate-income professionals and families.The resident population of downtown has doubled since 2000, according to census figures compiled in 2010 and assessments since then by the development authority, and an additional 40 percent or so of growth is predicted through 2019. The changes make Miami fertile ground for the retail and services market. The city\u2019s retail sector, which generated almost $4.5 billion in revenue in 2014, \u201cwill usher in 1.4 million square feet of new leasable space over the next three years,\u201d the development agency said.That increase in downtown retail space will largely be driven by several mixed-use projects under construction, the report said. Besides Worldcenter, there is Brickell City Centre, which will contain a half-million-square-foot shopping mall, condominium towers, hotel rooms and office space; and Miami Central Station, a train, light-rail and bus hub with stores and apartments.\u201cA big portion of the population wasn\u2019t being served,\u201d said Brian Pearl, a founder of Global City Development, referring to everyday workers for whom low housing costs are a crucial consideration. This summer, Mr. Pearl\u2019s company plans to begin construction on a five-story building with more than 200 apartments, from studios to two-bedroom apartments. Rents will be in the range of $1,000 to $2,000 a month.\u201cIf you earn $60,000, $70,000 a year, you can afford to live there,\u201d Mr. Pearl said in an interview.Mr. Pearl\u2019s firm plans to close next month on another property, where it expects to build about 260 rental apartments and 20,000 square feet of retail space. Both sites are near parks.\u201cWe want to create areas where people can have a community experience,\u201d Mr. Pearl said. \u201cThey can use the park, the local retailers, walk their dog.\u201dJames W. Shindell, who heads the real estate group at the law firm Bilzin Sumberg, said that Miami was becoming \u201cone of those gateway cities, like San Francisco, New York or Washington, that attract human capital.\u201d And while rents have been going up, many professionals prefer to rent to stay flexible for their careers and enjoy features at new developments.While there is evidence of saturation in the market for high-end condominiums, developers see profit in redirecting their sights toward buyers in lower income brackets. Nir Shoshani hopes to attract professionals aged 30 to 45 to a 500-unit condominium tower called Canvas, for which he broke ground in February. The average unit will cost about $400,000, he said, and be just 860 square feet.For years, there was little to attract outsiders to downtown except the American Airlines Arena, the Miami Heat\u2019s home court, which opened in 1999, and the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts, now a decade old. In the last few years, the P\u00e9rez Art Museum Miami arrived, and the Patricia & Philip Frost Museum of Science is under construction. And the Wynwood arts district is now commanding such high prices that some artists and gallery owners are looking further afield to set up shop.Adding to the renewal of downtown is a $13 million project to restore a half-mile section of Flagler Street, which long ago was the city\u2019s pre-eminent urban thoroughfare but fell into decay in recent decades. The plan, inspired by the pedestrian-only Ramblas in Barcelona, Spain, is to transform the street with outdoor cafes, wider sidewalks and valet parking. The developer Moishe Mana has already invested more than $200 million in properties on and near Flagler Street.\u201cEvery year it\u2019s becoming more like a city,\u201d said Michael A. Comras, a developer whose optimism about Miami\u2019s financial health led him last year to form a partnership that bought the CocoWalk shopping complex in Coconut Grove for $87.5 million and the Shops at Sunset Place, a mall in South Miami, for $110 million, both of which he plans to renovate.\u201cToday the pie is getting bigger, so when one area gets hot it doesn\u2019t suck the life out of the other ones,\u201d Mr. Comras said. \u201cThere\u2019s enough for everyone.\u201dNot everyone here is as optimistic. Ezra Katz, the chief executive of Aztec Group, a real estate investment banking firm, said it would take several years to absorb the apartments and condominiums that have already been built or are in the pipeline. He was concerned also that infrastructure improvements have not kept pace with development in the city\u2019s core.\u201cWe have doubled the number of people living in the urban area, but new roads, transportation, parking, sidewalks and bridges haven\u2019t appeared,\u201d Mr. Katz said. \u201cWe have set ourselves up for several years of congestion and traffic nightmares in and around downtown. Developers and government agencies saw the writing on the wall years ago and had the wherewithal to act, but didn\u2019t. Now it\u2019s too late.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But Hiroshima \u2014 obliterated by an American atomic bomb 71 years ago, then rebuilt with a newly peaceful and prosperous country \u2014 is in many ways the heart of Japan\u2019s modern national identity.From a militarist empire whose armies tore across Asia in the first half of the 20th century, Japan, seared by the most horrific consequence of war, embraced democracy and nonbelligerence seemingly overnight. It has not sent a soldier into combat since 1945, a record of pacifism that exceeds even that of its onetime ally Germany.Mr. Oe added, \u201cThe Japanese Constitution is a Hiroshima Constitution, more than a Tokyo Constitution,\u201d referring to the transformative basic law handed down by the United States after Japan\u2019s defeat. The charter renounces war, declares that \u201cland, sea and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained,\u201d and rejects \u201cthe right of belligerency of the state.\u201dBut the Constitution, and the array of pacifist-tinged laws and policies that flow from it, has come under attack as external dangers loom. The pacifist movement that has long been centered in Hiroshima is struggling to remain relevant to younger people, many born several generations after the war\u2019s end.\u201cObama is visiting Hiroshima at a time when the contrast between the city and what\u2019s happening at the national level is getting stronger,\u201d said Tadatoshi Akiba, a former mayor of the city.Seven decades after World War II, Mr. Abe\u2019s governing Liberal Democratic Party says the constraints placed on Japan in the conflict\u2019s aftermath are outdated and enfeebling, and it has proposed an array of constitutional amendments, including a rollback of the charter\u2019s pacifist clauses.Mr. Abe argues that change is vital because a more potent and assertive China and a nuclear-armed North Korea have emerged on Japan\u2019s doorstep. And he has offered a brasher alternative to the inward-looking exceptionalism that grew out of Hiroshima, campaigning to transform Japan into a \u201cnormal\u201d country, with a freer military and a bigger role in global affairs.For some, that vision runs counter to the \u201cnever again\u201d message inscribed on Hiroshima\u2019s war memorial, and symbolized by the skeletal atomic bomb dome preserved at ground zero nearby.\u201cAbe\u2019s approach is a kind of \u2018military pacifism\u2019 that takes war as a given,\u201d said Motofumi Asai, a former Foreign Ministry official who directed the Hiroshima Peace Institute from 2005 to 2011 and is now a professor at Osaka University of Economics and Law. \u201cIf Japanese people embrace this, they are denying their postwar constitutional pacifism.\u201dJapanese pacifism has always been strewn with contradictions. The \u201cpeace Constitution\u201d has not stopped the country from rebuilding its military, though its postwar version, the Self-Defense Forces, has never fought abroad. Japan\u2019s leaders have declined to develop nuclear weapons, but they welcome the nuclear umbrella provided by the United States. And they have endorsed American military interventions around the world, while keeping Japan out of combat.\u201cJapanese pacifism has been made possible by the fact that Japan is protected by the United States,\u201d said Makoto Iokibe, a professor at Kobe University and former president of the National Defense Academy of Japan. Now, the changes sought by Mr. Abe are forcing Japan to face that paradox, in ways that make many uncomfortable.\u201cJapan is being asked to play a new role,\u201d Professor Iokibe said, \u201cand that has created a sense of crisis among traditional postwar pacifists.\u201dMr. Abe has not mustered the political support needed to amend the Constitution, and many specialists say they think he never will. The bar is high: Any changes require the approval of two-thirds of both houses of Parliament and a majority of voters in a national referendum. The document has not been altered since it came into force in 1947.In August, on the 70th anniversary of the bombing, leaders of seven groups representing bomb survivors delivered a letter to Mr. Abe demanding that he withdraw the legislation. He declined, and Parliament approved the laws the next month.Here is a look at major statements on Japan\u2019s war legacy by monarchs and senior officials since its defeat in 1945.Peace groups are preparing to challenge the laws in the judiciary, but the Supreme Court of Japan has generally declined to second guess the government on national security issues.In opinion surveys, a majority of Japanese say they disagree with Mr. Abe\u2019s military policies. But the issue does not appear to be a priority for many. More tangible issues, like Japan\u2019s long-sputtering economy, rank higher. The Liberal Democrats are well ahead in the polls, while opposition parties that have rallied around reversing the security laws languish in the single digits.Mr. Abe\u2019s agenda has encountered some public resistance, including modest protests against the security bills last year, but the opposition, hobbled by infighting and weak leaders, has failed to capitalize on such sentiment.\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t like what Abe is doing,\u201d said Professor Asai, of Osaka University of Economics and Law, \u201cbut when they hear him and his supporters say \u2018China, North Korea,\u2019 they think it can\u2019t be helped.\u201d\u201cIf Obama goes to Hiroshima, and Abe ends up looking good because of it, and that dooms Article 9, what a horrible result that would be,\u201d said Tatsuya Yoshioka, director of Peace Boat, a group that has brought atomic bomb survivors to the United States and elsewhere to speak about their experiences.Mr. Abe must call an election this summer for the upper house of Parliament, the House of Councillors. Aides say he is also considering dissolving the more powerful House of Representatives, turning the contest into a general election that, if his Liberal Democrats win, could keep his government in power for four more years and put supporters of constitutional change closer to their goal.Haruko Moritaki, a veteran peace activist in Hiroshima, said she was glad Mr. Obama was coming, though she said she would like him to say that dropping the bomb was a mistake. Her father was partly blinded by the blast, and he was later one of the founders of an antinuclear campaign group, the Japan Congress Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs.She said her biggest regret was that Mr. Obama had to share the spotlight with Mr. Abe, whose agenda she said was eroding the historical lessons embodied by the city.\u201cI want to see Obama at the memorial, but I don\u2019t want to see Abe by his side,\u201d Ms. Moritaki said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see the Hiroshima memorial used.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bubble Indemnity", "Date": "2016-05-10", "News": "Supported byOn MoneyIt was a striking admission. This \u201clargely worthless\u201d start-up scene, according to the research firm CB Insights, has raised an estimated $238 billion over the last five years \u2014 a remarkable bull run in private technology stocks. Forbes reports that there are now close to 200 \u201cunicorns,\u201d to use the Valley term of art for private companies worth more than a billion dollars on paper. Since the financial crisis, these companies, along with their more established public predecessors, have been seen by many Americans as the last redoubt of confidence and productivity in an otherwise uneven recovery. V.C.s have spent years dismissing speculation about a private-equity bubble as merely an expression, by know-nothing spectators, of resentment and alarmism; media onlookers, they argue, should talk instead about the triumphal progress of the genuinely great start-ups as they try to solve our most difficult problems. Over the past year, however, as allegations of mismanagement and unsustainability have grown \u2014 Square went public for approximately half its last private valuation; Fidelity and other large mutual funds wrote down their positions in Dropbox, MongoDB, and Snapchat; and both Zenefits and Theranos were accused of deceptive practices \u2014 that confidence has come to look more like hubris.This past January, after a long autumn of minor misfortune left the market in a stall, I spent a week loitering in the command concourse of American V.C., Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, Calif., where the soft, spruce-filtered sunlight falls through plate glass into quiet offices of beige on beige. There was some selection bias at work, as all my introductions were brokered by a smart and thoughtful friend, but not a single investor I talked to fit the description of the supercilious techno-optimist \u2014 and most, in private, didn\u2019t hesitate to concede Palihapitiya\u2019s point. Of course they believed private valuations had become preposterous; of course the run in private tech stocks couldn\u2019t possibly last; and of course, many start-ups, especially those of the \u201cUber for garden-gnome rearrangement\u201d variety, are in fact largely worthless.Where they differed from the naysayers, however, was in their rating of the \u00adcauses\u00ad and consequences; the fault, they said, didn\u2019t belong to the technological elite but to everybody else: What has driven inflated valuations, in a time of extremely low interest rates and meager returns elsewhere, is \u201cdumb money,\u201d all the alien capital that has flowed into the Valley in recent years. Dumb money is a hedge-funder who\u2019s jealous of a V.C. Dumb money is sovereign wealth. Dumb money is an Emirati home office. Dumb money is a Facebook millionaire in a Maserati who wants to look like a player. Dumb money wants to get in on tech because it\u2019s a box to check off. Dumb money isn\u2019t in it for the long run. Dumb money doesn\u2019t actually care about the technology. Dumb money doesn\u2019t create value. Dumb money thinks what you lose on the margin you\u2019ll make up for in volume. Dumb money wants to get in on Uber at any price, and will accept a \u201climited-edition private offer\u201d to join the scarce ranks in a \u201cspecial purpose vehicle\u201d that bears all the risks of one company with none of the hedging benefits of a portfolio. Dumb money is those pinkish guys with bull necks in Zegna suits. The weird thing about dumb money, unfortunately, is that it can act with fiendish intelligence, insisting on stipulations that guarantee returns at the expense of founders, employees and other investors.Luckily for the American economy, the dumb money this time around is no longer a mob of deluded pensioners waist-deep in Webvan. (It\u2019s also, the V.C.s noted, a lot less money in total, and at least in theory it\u2019s coming from people who can afford the losses; the last dot-com crash erased an estimated $6.2 trillion in household wealth.) So the coming correction will allow the smart money to roll up its brushed-microfiber sleeves and get back to basics. A lot of $10 billion companies will become $1 billion companies, and $1 billion companies will be acquired for $100 million, and the dumb money will slink away. Operating expenses and burn rates will come way down, and companies that didn\u2019t worry about profitability or unit economics will. There will be layoffs, sure, but the only serious effects will be that the traffic on I-280 will no longer back up three exits, it\u2019ll be easier to get a table at the Village Pub and engineers three minutes out of Stanford will no longer expect $150,000 a year and backlit fountains of complimentary fruit water.Defenders of that system argue that all they really need are the expected half-dozen mega-I.P.O.s (Slack, Palantir, Snapchat, Uber, Airbnb) to make enough cash returns to offset the losses. But that fantasy math holds for only a tiny cohort of V.C. firms. It also overlooks the well-being of tens of thousands of employees, especially support staff, who have worked for years for a share in the wealth they\u2019ve created. Perhaps worst of all, it betrays a callow belief that the genuinely transformative long-term endeavors that V.C.s have come to support \u2014 erstwhile academic research into artificial intelligence, bioengineering and sustainable energy \u2014 will be somehow insulated from an industry downturn. An exploded bubble could very well mean that those \u201ctotally audacious\u201d bets will go unfunded entirely. That might seem like a satisfying comeuppance for the imperious Valley, but it\u2019s not something to be smug about. Smart money convinces itself of its highly differentiated intelligence at what might prove to be all of our expense.Gideon Lewis-Kraus is a contributing writer for the magazine.

It goes without staying that the Obama administration has absolutely no interest in going to war with Venezuela. Rather, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a diversion tactic intended to deflate the effort to oust Mr. Maduro from office this year through a popular referendum.The military could play a key role if the standoff between Mr. Maduro and the opposition intensifies.

{"Headline": "Vladimir Putin\u2019s Dangerous Obsession", "Date": "2016-05-19", "News": "Supported byEditorialOn the surface the move seems a humanitarian gesture from two nations that are supposedly partners in ending Syria\u2019s bloody civil war. What it really does is highlight, once again, the duplicity of President Vladimir Putin of Russia, in Syria and elsewhere. Mr. Assad remains in power largely because of Russian military assistance. It is hard to believe that Mr. Putin, who fancies himself a man who can get what he wants, could not persuade Mr. Assad to let aid get through to the cities if he chose to try.While promising Secretary of State John Kerry that he would work with America to end the war that has reportedly killed up to 470,000 people, Mr. Putin has been unable or unwilling to stop Mr. Assad from shelling civilians and, according to reports, is continuing Russian airstrikes as well. A temporary cease-fire that raised hopes for a more durable peace has now largely collapsed, talks between the Assad government and opposition forces have broken down and plans to begin a negotiated political transition to a more inclusive government by Aug. 1 seem ever more remote.Syria is just one arena where Mr. Putin\u2019s obsessive quest to make Russia great again has fueled instability and reawakened political suspicions and animosities that faded after the fall of the Soviet Union.All this risks direct confrontation with the United States. American military forces have gone out of their way to exercise restraint, but decisions on whether oncoming planes are a threat are made in an instant, and restraint cannot be assumed.Mr. Putin has long misread NATO, which was significantly demilitarized after the Cold War, as a threat. His more assertive behavior may produce exactly the reinvigorated alliance he feared, one that is much more serious about military spending despite problems with economic growth, Syrian refugees and political dysfunction.NATO\u2019s 28 members will meet in Warsaw in July, a good time to reassert resolve. In June, sanctions imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine will expire, and will need to be renewed, though NATO members would be wise to keep channels for dialogue with Russia open as well. Mr. Putin would have greatly improved his chances of regaining the international standing he craves had he diversified his country\u2019s economy and worked constructively with the West.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Finds Its Global Ambitions Humbled in Its Own Backyard", "Date": "2016-05-18", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 The heart of this global financial hub resembled an armed camp on Wednesday as thousands of police officers deployed around a hotel and convention center where a senior Chinese official was visiting.For many in Hong Kong, the show of force only increased their fears that the city\u2019s civil liberties and autonomy are under assault by the government in Beijing.Across the Taiwan Strait, final preparations were underway for the inauguration on Friday of Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan\u2019s first female president. She was swept into power in part by young voters anxious about what they see as Beijing\u2019s rising influence over the island. Ms. Tsai is expected to have a far more cautious attitude toward promoting Chinese trade and investment than her predecessor.It is a humbling week for China. The world\u2019s second-biggest economy after the United States, it is richer and stronger than ever, and its financial clout is being felt the world over. But Beijing is finding it exceedingly difficult to win hearts and minds in its own backyard, among the more than 30 million Chinese-speaking people of Taiwan and Hong Kong.China is searching for a new approach toward both Hong Kong and Taiwan, but it has yet to find one that is different from the policies it has used before \u2014 hard-line political tactics that provoke resentment, and pragmatic appeals to economic interests that fall short in societies where the benefits of trade with the mainland are unevenly distributed.\u201cThere are more centrifugal forces, and it\u2019s hard for Beijing to deal with these forces,\u201d said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor of government and international studies at Hong Kong Baptist University. \u201cI think it is a clash between two political cultures: authoritarian in China and liberal in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Hong Kong is very much on the bridge, resisting the authoritarian political culture in China.\u201dSuch attitudes \u2014 a fear of democracy and heavy-handed control of the news media \u2014 are at odds with the increasingly well-educated populations in Hong Kong, a former British colony where civil liberties like freedom of speech and freedom of assembly are guaranteed, and Taiwan, a democracy for the past two decades.Those concerns erupted late last year, when five Hong Kong booksellers disappeared, showing up later in Chinese custody in Guangdong. One publisher, Lee Bo, was plucked from the streets of Hong Kong, a violation of the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d principle that safeguards the city\u2019s autonomy until 2047, the 50th anniversary of its return to Chinese sovereignty.\u201cThat act is like driving a truck through \u2018one country, two systems,\u2019 \u201d Emily Lau, head of the Democratic Party in Hong Kong\u2019s legislature, said in a telephone interview. \u201cHong Kong is going through very dark times.\u201dMs. Lau and several other pro-democracy lawmakers met with Mr. Zhang at a reception on Wednesday evening, telling him that the city\u2019s chief executive, Leung Chun-ying, should be dismissed. Mr. Leung was standing next to Mr. Zhang at the time, Ms. Lau said.Ms. Lau and her colleagues also urged Mr. Zhang to revisit the issue of democratic elections for the chief executive post. They argued that opening up the position to a genuine contest, rather than allowing only a narrow slate of Beijing-approved candidates, would help to damp growing enthusiasm in Hong Kong for self-determination, and even independence, she said by telephone.\u201cPeople are very, very frustrated, and that\u2019s why some, including young people, are looking for a way out, including independence,\u201d Ms. Lau told Mr. Zhang. She said he responded that Beijing was satisfied with the performance of the Hong Kong government and that people had differing points of view.\u201cI think he got the message loud and clear,\u201d she said.Concern that some of the newly radicalized groups in Hong Kong might try to disrupt Mr. Zhang\u2019s visit \u2014 the first by a member of the elite Politburo Standing Committee since 2012 \u2014 led to extraordinary security measures.\u201cHe must feel fearful and guilty, so he needs such high security and fears any contact with the people,\u201d said Raphael Wong, vice chairman of the pro-democracy League of Social Democrats, whose members had assembled in one of the designated protest zones blocks away from where Mr. Zhang was staying. \u201cHe simply couldn\u2019t tolerate any dissent against the Communist Party.\u201dBeijing also appears to be stepping up pressure on international organizations not to accept Taiwan as a separate member.Although Ms. Tsai has promised to maintain the status quo with China, many in her Democratic Progressive Party, which captured the presidency in January elections and, for the first time, control of the legislature, support independence.Under the current president, Ma Ying-jeou of the Kuomintang, or Nationalist Party, cross-strait economic ties have flourished. But China\u2019s intentions worried many in Taiwan, who saw the closer relations as tools to advance Beijing\u2019s goal of political control.Ultimately, in both Hong Kong and Taiwan, the generations now moving into positions of responsibility increasingly view themselves as separate from China, and that rise of identity politics \u201ccould pose grave political challenges to Beijing,\u201d said Zhang Baohui, a professor of political science at Lingnan University in Hong Kong.\u201cI feel like Hong Kong is like Taiwan more than 20 years ago, before we had free elections,\u201d said Sung Chung-hsing, 43, a lawyer in the island\u2019s capital, Taipei. \u201cThe young people in Hong Kong have realized the importance of freedom and elections. I hope they can raise their voices and let the mainland government know their feelings.\u201dMichael Forsythe reported from Hong Kong, and Austin Ramzy from Taipei, Taiwan.

{"Headline": "Sexual Freelancing in the Gig Economy", "Date": "2016-05-14", "News": "Supported byOpinionA FRIEND of mine complains about how many of the men she meets on Tinder use corporate language to chat her up. First, they \u201creach out.\u201d Then, after spending the night together, they \u201cfollow up.\u201dThis kind of flirting is banal, but it makes sense. We constantly use economic metaphors to describe romantic and sexual relations. Few people today refer to women as \u201cdamaged goods\u201d or wonder why a man would \u201cbuy the cow when he can get the milk for free,\u201d but we have \u201cfriends with benefits\u201d and \u201cinvest in relationships.\u201d An ex may be \u201con\u201d or \u201coff the market.\u201d Online dating makes \u201cshopping around\u201d explicit. Blog after blog strategizes about how to maximize your \u201creturn on investment\u201d on OkCupid.We use this kind of language because the ways that people date \u2014 who contacts whom, where they meet and what happens next \u2014 have always been tied to the economy. Dating applies the logic of capitalism to courtship. On the dating market, everyone competes for him or herself.When parents worry about how their 20-something kids are (or aren\u2019t) pairing off, or the authors of trend pieces lament \u201cthe death of courtship,\u201d they seem to forget that the pursuit of sex and romance didn\u2019t remain unchanged from the moment when the first Homo sapiens sidled across the savanna toward his soul mate until Steve Jobs rolled out the iPhone.If you want to understand why \u201cNetflix and chill\u201d has replaced dinner and a movie, you need to look at how people work. Today, people are constantly told that we must be flexible and adaptable in order to succeed. Is it surprising that these values are reshaping how many of us approach sex and love?And those are just the hours on the clock. They don\u2019t include time spent outside normal hours answering emails or maintaining a social media presence \u2014 activities that many jobs require. In other words, single people today tend to work longer hours than they would have in the Norman Rockwell, soda-fountain era that many people seem to have in mind when they get misty-eyed about \u201ctraditional\u201d dating. No surprise they have less time and energy left over to go out.Sometimes social class can make a difference. Growing numbers of working-class Americans are eschewing marriage and having children outside of marriage. In a 2013 study conducted by researchers at Harvard and the University of Virginia, working-class respondents cited low wages and a lack of job security as the primary reasons for these changes.Still, for all of the challenges, it\u2019s worth noting that the gig economy has also brought some much-needed flexibility to dating and relationships. Young women today face less pressure to build their lives around marriage and childbearing than their mothers or grandmothers did. If you are gay or lesbian or if you want a relationship that is not monogamous you are likely to meet less resistance than you might have in the past. Still, as the work of dating has become increasingly flexible, it has also become increasingly precarious.DATING itself is a recent invention. It developed when young people began moving to cities and women began working outside private homes. By 1900, 44 percent of single American women worked. Previously, courtship had taken place under adult supervision, in private places: a parlor, a factory dance or church social. But once women started going out and earning wages, they had more freedom over where and how they met prospective mates. Because men vastly out-earned women, they typically paid for entertainment.Today, we refer to a man inviting a woman to dinner as \u201ctraditional.\u201d At first it was scandalous: A woman who arranged to meet a man at a bar or restaurant could find herself interrogated by a vice commission. In the 1920s and \u201830s, as more and more middle-class women started going to college, parents and faculty panicked over the \u201crating and dating\u201d culture, which led kids to participate in \u201cpetting parties\u201d and take \u201cjoy rides\u201d with members of the opposite sex.By the 1950s, a new kind of dating took over: \u201cgoing steady.\u201d Popular advice columnist Dorothy Dix warned in 1939 that going steady was an \u201cinsane folly.\u201d But by the post-war era of full employment, this form of courtship made perfect sense. The booming economy, which was targeting the newly flush \u201cteen\u201d demographic, dictated that in order for everyone to partake in new consumer pleasures \u2014 for everyone to go out for a burger and root beer float on the weekends \u2014 young people had to pair off. Today, the economy is transforming courtship yet again. But the changes aren\u2019t only practical. The economy shapes our feelings and values as well as our behaviors.The generation of Americans that came of age around the time of the 2008 financial crisis has been told constantly that we must be \u201cflexible\u201d and \u201cadaptable.\u201d Is it so surprising that we have turned into sexual freelancers? Many of us treat relationships like unpaid internships: We cannot expect them to lead to anything long-term, so we use them to get experience. If we look sharp, we might get a free lunch.But for all the hand-wringing, this kind of dating isn\u2019t any more transactional than it was back when suitors paid women family-supervised visits or parents sought out a yenta to introduce their children at a synagogue mixer. Courtship has always been dictated by changes in the market. The good news is that dating is not the same thing as love. And as anyone who has ever been in love can attest, the laws of supply and demand do not control our feelings.Advertisement"}

Forging the 130-ton snake alone involved five specialized metal foundries, one of them in China, Mr. Mennour said, and\u00c2\u00a0installing the artwork required a team of hundreds, working in shifts for more than 20 hours a day for 12 days. \u201cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the biggest thing I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever done,\u201d he said.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen you are inside the Grand Palais, you will not have a global view of the installation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Axelle Blanc, the Monumenta project coordinator, said in a joint interview with Mr. Huang, Mr. Mennour and Jean de Loisy, the curator of \u201cEmpire\u201d\u00c2\u00a0and president of the Palais de Tokyo contemporary art museum, before the opening. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will just see parts of it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is an artwork that initially resists global comprehension.\u00e2\u0080\u009dNapoleon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hat is a blown-up version of one he wore at the Battle of Eylau in East Prussia. The containers, bearing the logos of international shipping companies, are avatars of the boxes that transport 90 percent of world trade. The snake, a recurrent element in Mr. Huang\u00e2\u0080\u0099s art, is an enigmatic symbol in both Chinese and Western mythology, endowed with multiple, contradictory qualities. Visually, the vertebrae of the snake mirror the delicate Art Nouveau iron ribs of the domed roof of the Grand Palais; and the rectangular arch of the gantry crane riffs on the series of arches in\u00c2\u00a0and near Paris, including the Grande Arche de la D\u00c3\u00a9fense, which was built in 1989 for the bicentennial of the French Revolution.That was the year Mr. Huang, invited to participate in\u00c2\u00a0a group show at the Pompidou Center, left China for France. Finding himself abroad during the protests in and around Tiananmen Square in Beijing, he chose to stay in the West, in exile.Mr. Huang, who was born in 1954 in Xiamen, had built a reputation in China as an avant-garde provocateur. In 1986, he founded Xiamen Dada, a postmodern group mixing Zen Buddhism with Dadaist surrealism, influenced by artists including Joseph Beuys, John Cage and Marcel Duchamp.Mr. Huang described his\u00c2\u00a0artistic practice\u00c2\u00a0in that period\u00c2\u00a0as anti-art, anti-history and anti-self-expression, a time when he created works formulated by the spin of a roulette wheel or the throw of divining sticks.

{"Headline": "How to Save Clintonism", "Date": "2016-05-21", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisPittsburgh \u2014 SINCE their premiere on the national stage a quarter-century ago, Hillary and Bill Clinton have been the closest of partners in politics. Through some rocky times they have turned to each other on vital projects, as in 1993, when Mr. Clinton asked his wife to lead an ultimately failed effort to establish universal health care. And then last week, Mrs. Clinton, her campaign straining to build momentum, said that her husband would be \u201cin charge of revitalizing the economy\u201d in a second Clinton White House.With that announcement, Mrs. Clinton underscored that the couple had partnered in another joint venture: trying to refurbish Clintonism, the political creed that defined his two terms as president.Celebrated by its supporters as a synonym for peace, prosperity and a common-sense centrism, Clintonism was \u2014 and is still \u2014 derided by its detractors on the left as corporatism and on the right as a shorthand for scandal and impeachable offenses. As Mrs. Clinton tries to unite her fractious party and turn her focus to Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, she is also looking to what can be salvaged and what must be discarded from her husband\u2019s legacy.What, then, might Clintonism 2.0 look like?In its original form, Clintonism was an effort to pull the Democratic Party \u2014 which had lost five of the six presidential elections between 1968 and 1988 \u2014 back into political relevance. Forged out of Mr. Clinton\u2019s years as governor of Arkansas, it involved more than just tweaking Democratic orthodoxy. Mr. Clinton wanted to help big corporations thrive, favored trade policies that unions loathed and spoke of reining in welfare and fighting crime.The approach brought him victory over President George H.W. Bush in 1992, and then helped him navigate a hostile, Republican-controlled Congress after 1994. His health care agenda was blocked, but he managed to \u201ctriangulate\u201d between Republicans and Democrats well enough to enact other major parts of his agenda, from a trade deal with Mexico and Canada to welfare reform to a crime bill.Even Republicans, who pilloried and then impeached the president for his sexual escapades, admired Clintonism for its political suppleness. The 42nd president left the White House with high approval ratings after serving during years of economic growth. Many liberals felt bruised, even betrayed \u2014 there were some high-profile repudiations of the president, especially when he signed a welfare overhaul in 1996 that set time limits on benefits. But no one doubted that he had given new life to the party when he left office in 2001.But Clintonism 1.0, designed to carve out a middle ground, may prove obsolete in 2016, when the center might not hold. Senator Bernie Sanders is trying to push Mrs. Clinton left on the issues of income disparity, student loan debt and health care costs. And even as Mr. Trump assails the liberal goal of immigration reform, he has also voiced the frustration of white working-class voters who, like liberal Sanders partisans, are angry about stagnating wages and trade.So even as Mrs. Clinton anoints the former president as her partner on economic issues, she is moving unmistakably away from some of his major policies.Mr. Clinton was an ardent supporter of international trade agreements and regarded the North American Free Trade Agreement, known as Nafta, as one of the signature achievements of his two terms. In signing the pact at a 1993 ceremony he called it \u201ca force for social progress as well as economic growth.\u201dBut both Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump assert that free trade has destroyed American jobs. As a result of their criticism, Mrs. Clinton, who once described the Trans-Pacific Partisanship negotiated by Mr. Obama as the \u201cgold standard\u201d of international trade pacts, has withdrawn her support for it.Mrs. Clinton is also on the defensive about her ties to Wall Street and about the high-paid speeches she delivered to Goldman Sachs. Two decades ago, those ties were symbols of the party\u2019s openness to business interests. But now Mr. Sanders is attacking them as tarnished emblems of the party\u2019s drift from its New Deal heritage and its roots in the working and middle classes of American life. And Mr. Trump has jumped on her Goldman speeches as evidence of hypocrisy and secretiveness.Clintonism 1.0 also has created concerns about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s ability to energize core Democratic voters. Faced with criticism from the Black Lives Matter movement, she has called for ending \u201cthe era of mass incarceration\u201d of black and Latino youths that was created in part by the 1994 crime bill that her husband signed and that she supported as first lady. Even so, Mrs. Clinton seems to have won the black vote handily throughout the primaries, according to exit poll data.Young voters in particular seem unmoved by the moderate promise of Clintonism \u2014 Mrs. Clinton won only 17 percent of voters 18 to 29 in last month\u2019s primary in the swing state of Pennsylvania. And while she was in the vanguard of the last phase of feminism, she seems less relevant to the new generation of young women who are critical to a new Clinton electoral coalition.The results of the Kentucky primary last week \u2014 where Mrs. Clinton barely squeaked out a victory over Mr. Sanders after having prevailed there by 35 percentage points over Barack Obama in 2008 \u2014 underscore just how much she is struggling to consolidate the party\u2019s base. The persistent disenchantment with her campaign among Sanders voters raises questions about whether Mrs. Clinton might look to expand her vote by reaching out to moderate Republicans and independents who are uncomfortable with Mr. Trump.It does not help that Mrs. Clinton lacks her husband\u2019s panache, one of their many stylistic differences.\u201cHe relishes campaigning, and she does it because she has to,\u201d said Edward G. Rendell, the former governor of Pennsylvania and a longtime ally. But he insists that the two have the same outlook and ideology. \u201cThey are similar in their values,\u201d Mr. Rendell said in a recent interview, \u201cand they are similar in what they care about.\u201dThose shared values are in many ways at the core of Clintonism 1.0 and 2.0. Both Clintons are animated not just by a center-left approach to campaigning and governing, but also a devout faith in expertise, particularly of the academic sort, and in the power of policy. And both are dedicated globalists: As secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton holds the record for number of countries visited in office, 112, while her husband made twice as many international trips as Ronald Reagan and three times as many as Richard Nixon.It is in that global outlook that Clintonism might benefit Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign. At a time when Mr. Trump is vowing to restrict immigration and trade, and also reduce support for NATO and other international organizations that have been bulwarks of American foreign policy, Mrs. Clinton may find support among moderate Republicans and business interests for her vision of a more open, internationalist America.Will that be enough to overcome weariness with the very idea of another Clinton White House?If there was \u201cAdams fatigue\u201d for John Quincy Adams in 1824 because his father had been president, it didn\u2019t prevent his election. Neither did \u201cBush fatigue\u201d stop George W. Bush from winning a hair-thin victory in 2000 \u2014 though it might have helped vanquish his brother Jeb in the primaries this year.But for Mrs. Clinton the challenge is probably greater because, unlike the children of presidents, she was there by her husband\u2019s side, his partner, during two turbulent terms. So while she can share in much of the credit for the achievements of Clintonism, she must also bear the weight of its mistakes.\u201cThe brand has been badgered,\u201d said L. Sandy Maisel, a Colby College political scientist. \u201cThe people who have been saying terrible things about the Clintons have been saying them for 24 years now.\u201dDavid M. Shribman, a former New York Times political writer, is executive editor of The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hamas Calls for Resumption of Death Penalty in Gaza", "Date": "2016-05-25", "News": "Supported byGAZA CITY \u2014 Hamas, the militant Islamist group that rules Gaza, called on Wednesday for the resumption of the death penalty for certain crimes. Several Palestinians convicted of collaborating with Israel or of murder are now facing execution.In a terse statement, Hamas called on \u201cthe competent judicial authorities to undertake their duties.\u201d The statement was widely seen as a green light to begin executions, because Hamas officials had been arguing for days about reinstating the death penalty.\u201cWe found it was important to implement the death penalty rule to maintain civil peace in society and to prevent cases of murder,\u201d said Yehia Mousa, a Hamas legislator in Gaza.\u201cThe death penalty exists in America,\u201d he said. \u201cKillings warrant the death penalty.\u201d\u201cWe have three or four cases that are ready for the death penalty,\u201d Mr. Mousa said, adding that the executions would be carried out in police stations.Hamas officials began imposing the death penalty after they took control of Gaza in 2007. Since then, the Palestinian Center for Human Rights has documented 67 executions. That figure does not include Hamas gunmen\u2019s killings of people accused of being collaborators during wartime.Hamas mostly stopped the executions after June 2014 because a national unity government led by President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority was officially placed in charge of Gaza.As president, Mr. Abbas is required to ratify each death sentence before it is carried out. But he opposes the death penalty and has not ratified a sentence since he came to power in 2005.Hamdi Shakour, the deputy director of programs at the Palestinian Center for Human Rights, said Hamas appeared to have revived the death penalty in response to the popular sentiment that crime is increasing in Gaza, a product of years of unemployment and poverty, tight restrictions on travel and three wars in the territory.\u201cInstead of talking about the collapse of the economy, the social fabric and people\u2019s living standards, they are arguing that there is no preventative punishment,\u201d Mr. Shakour said.Sari Bashi, a spokeswoman for Human Rights Watch, said: \u201cIt\u2019s terrible. The court system in Gaza is rife with coercion, torture and compromised procedures, and so to execute people in Gaza is particularly egregious.\u201dMajd Al Waheidi reported from Gaza City, and Diaa Hadid from Beit Sahour, West Bank.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senate Passes Bill Exposing Saudi Arabia to 9/11 Legal Claims", "Date": "2016-05-17", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A bill that would let the families of those killed in the Sept. 11 attacks sue Saudi Arabia for any role in the terrorist plot passed the Senate unanimously on Tuesday, bringing Congress closer to a showdown with the White House, which has threatened to veto the legislation.The Senate\u2019s passage of the bill, which will now be taken up in the House, is another sign of escalating tensions in a relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia that once received little scrutiny from lawmakers.Many economists are skeptical that the Saudis would deliver on such a warning, saying that a sell-off would be hard to execute and would do more harm to the kingdom\u2019s economy than to America\u2019s.Questions about the role Saudi officials might have played in the Sept. 11 plot have lingered for more than a decade, and families of the victims have used various lawsuits to try to hold members of the Saudi royal family and charities liable for what they allege is financial support of terrorism.But these moves have been mostly blocked, in part because of a 1976 law that gives foreign nations some immunity from lawsuits in American courts.The Senate bill carves out an exception to the law if foreign countries are found culpable for terrorist attacks that kill American citizens within the United States. If the bill were to pass both houses and be signed by the president, it could clear a path for the role of the Saudi government to be examined in the Sept. 11 suits.Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, a Democrat and a sponsor of the bill, said the legislation would help the families of the victims seek justice. \u201cFor the sake of the families, I want to make clear beyond the shadow of a doubt that every entity, including foreign states, will be held accountable if they are found to be sponsors of the heinous act of 9/11,\u201d he said shortly before the bill\u2019s passage.\u201cIf the Saudis did not participate in this terrorism, they have nothing to fear about going to court,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they did, they should be held accountable.\u201dMr. Schumer said he believed that Democrats would override a veto from Mr. Obama. He also said he believed that Saudi Arabia\u2019s threat to pull its assets, a concern of the administration, was \u201chollow,\u201d adding, \u201cIt will hurt them a lot more than it hurts us.\u201dThe National Archives released a series of memos written by Sept. 11 Commission staff members, a compilation of numerous possible connections between the hijackers and Saudis inside the United States. The document appears to be a glimpse into what is still inside the classified 28 pages of the congressional inquiry into the 2001 attacks.Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, said the legislation was written in such a way that Americans would not be subject to legal action taken by other nations. \u201cI do believe that there\u2019s going to be some saber rattling, some threats, but I think that they are hollow,\u201d Mr. Cornyn said.In a move intended to address some White House concerns, the bill\u2019s sponsors included a new provision that would allow the attorney general to put a hold on individual court cases if the administration can show that it is negotiating with the defendant government to resolve the claims.But a release on Tuesday from Mr. Schumer\u2019s office said the administration would need to provide details about the talks and a timetable for their resolution.Mr. Earnest said on Tuesday that White House officials would seek to negotiate with Republicans and Democrats on alternatives to the legislation that might be acceptable to the president, but he added, \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s possible at this point.\u201dEarlier this month, Mr. Jubeir said during a news conference that the proposed legislation was \u201cstripping the principle of sovereign immunities\u201d and turning international law \u201cinto the law of the jungle.\u201dThe legislation is moving through Congress as the Obama administration considers whether to declassify a portion of a 2002 congressional investigation of the Sept. 11 attacks that cited some evidence that Saudi government officials and other Saudi citizens living in the United States had a hand in the terrorist plot.Those conclusions have yet to be released publicly, but recently the National Archives posted a separate document on its website that appears to offer a glimpse at what the still-classified 28 pages contain.The document, dated June 6, 2003, is a series of memos written by Sept. 11 commission staff members compiling numerous possible connections between the hijackers and Saudis in the United States.The Sept. 11 commission, which began its work after the congressional inquiry, found \u201cno evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually funded\u201d Al Qaeda or the 9/11 plotters.Last month, the commission\u2019s co-chairmen, Thomas Kean and Lee Hamilton, issued a statement saying that the 28 pages \u201cwere based almost entirely on raw, unvetted material that came to the F.B.I.\u201d \u2014 much of it ultimately deemed inconclusive by the Sept. 11 panel.\u201cAccusations of complicity in that mass murder from responsible authorities are a grave matter,\u201d they wrote. \u201cSuch charges should be levied with care.\u201dEmmarie Huetteman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Mystery of Spain\u2019s Perpetual Jobs Problem", "Date": "2016-05-02", "News": "Supported byEuro EconomicsYou\u2019d be forgiven for thinking that such a high level of joblessness, weighing on families for so long, would have caused the country to crack by now. The jobless number is so much higher than the rate for other economic laggards like Italy (11 percent) and Portugal (12 percent).Certainly, some of Spain\u2019s unemployment is overstated because some workers have off-the-books jobs. And people may feel optimistic because unemployment has fallen in recent quarters, from 25 percent two years ago.But the chances of that look slim.One cause of the high rate became embedded in Spain\u2019s labor market over the last 40 years. A significant proportion of Spain\u2019s workers emerged from the dictatorship years with ironclad job security. Many of those protections remained, Mr. Jansen said, but much of the new hiring in the democratic era took place through temporary employment contracts. Just before the 2008 financial crisis, around a third of Spain\u2019s workers were on temporary contracts, far higher than the European average.When the crisis hit, it was very easy to lay off the temporary workers. True, during the recent recovery, the high use of temporary contracts has most likely spurred Spanish firms to bolster their hiring. But the persistence of overly protective labor contracts alongside temporary ones with too few protections has probably also created inefficiencies within Spanish companies that have dampened economic growth.Unlike the United States, which surpassed its pre-bubble peak in 2011, the eurozone as a whole has stumbled along. Here are some of the bloc\u2019s notable leaders and laggards.Mr. Jansen\u2019s preferred solution is to introduce a new contract that could increase protections for temporary workers and loosen them for many permanent workers. But he said Spain\u2019s politicians had shown little support for this idea.Something else is making matters worse right now. Much of Spain\u2019s working-age population does not have an education beyond high school. And many of those people have remained unemployed for multiple years after the financial crisis of 2008. (Nearly a fourth of the unemployed have been without work for four years or more.)Such workers are increasingly losing contact with the industries they worked in, and that will make it even harder for them to find jobs. And hiring in Spain\u2019s construction industry, a big employer before the crisis, is not likely to return to precrisis levels anytime soon. Mr. Jansen says helping the long-term unemployed requires a substantial overhaul of Spain\u2019s retraining programs. But this costs money, and Spain has one of the largest budget deficits in Europe.This is where we bump into the big economic debate that looms over the Continent. On one side are those who insist that struggling countries must pursue policies that cut government spending and free up markets, to spur strong and sustainable growth. As we have learned, Spain\u2019s labor market could certainly do with some big changes. But as we have also seen, these changes are far from imminent. They are expensive. They threaten entrenched interests. Spain\u2019s leaders are so divided that they can\u2019t form an administration that could attempt bold moves.Economists on the other side of the debate emphasize the need for the European Union as a whole to come together to introduce big top-down actions. Such policies include debt forgiveness and far greater fiscal stimulus. Spain\u2019s sky-high unemployment has not moved Europe\u2019s leaders to take such steps by now. Then again, Europe can\u2019t count on Spain \u2014 or any country \u2014 to tolerate this high level of joblessness forever.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Feeling Let Down and Left Behind, With Little Hope for Better", "Date": "2016-05-25", "News": "In a moment riddled with economic and social worries, an e-cigarette shop in Wilkes County, N.C., is an oasis for some young Appalachians.Supported byNORTH WILKESBORO, N.C. \u2014 Kody Foster had finished his Wednesday afternoon shift at the warehouse where he earns $12.50 per hour. Normally, he would be packing himself into his Ford Focus, with its Bernie Sanders sticker and plaque with the number 48, in honor of the stock-car racer Jimmie Johnson.But this week, Mr. Foster, 26, couldn\u2019t get the Ford\u2019s check engine light to turn off, and the dealership told him that fixing it would cost $1,000, which he didn\u2019t have. So instead, he borrowed his sister\u2019s ancient red minivan, with its sliding door that doesn\u2019t shut right.Mr. Foster\u2019s destination, wedged between a pizza parlor and the opioid addiction clinic, was the Tapering Vapor, a bare-bones e-cigarette shop and makeshift lounge that serves as his modest oasis, a place to catch a mild nicotine buzz and let a world of worry float away on banks of big, cloying, candy-flavored clouds.In an America riddled with anxieties, the worries that Mr. Foster and his neighbors bring through the doors of the Tapering Vapor are common and potent: Fear that an honest, 40-hour working-class job can no longer pay the bills. Fear of a fraying social fabric. Fear that the country\u2019s future might pale in comparison with its past.Still, the regulars at the Tapering Vapor \u2014 overwhelmingly white, mostly working class and ranging from their 20s to middle age \u2014 provide a haze-shrouded snapshot of an anxious nation navigating an election year fueled by disquiet and malaise.Mr. Foster drove past the old Key City furniture plant; the original business was killed off by cheap imports and the Great Recession. The new tenant, a legal moonshine maker called the Copper Barrel Distillery, was proudly hawking bottles of the product that had once been the not-so-secret shame of this place \u2014 as well as $19.99 ball caps, made in Bangladesh, emblazoned with the distillery\u2019s logo.He parked next to the addiction clinic, with a discreet sign that read, \u201cMountain Health Solutions.\u201d Just a few hours earlier, it had been the busiest business on the block.The Tapering Vapor was almost empty save for Andrew Taylor, the manager. He stood behind the counter under a Guy Fawkes mask, the universal symbol of protest and disaffection, and near the dry-erase board listing dozens of flavors for sale. The names suggested fantasia and abundance: Summer Melon, Broken Neon, Caramel Latte, Unlimited Power.The two friends greeted each other with a joke borrowed from a popular Vine video. Mr. Taylor, 22, blew out a cloud that smelled like orange cheesecake.Moments later, another customer, Karen Chapman, came in carrying an oversize handbag. She ordered a bottle of nicotine-laced liquid flavored like dark chocolate and tobacco.She said she had quit smoking cigarettes in March, soon after her favorite character on the reality television show \u201cMob Wives,\u201d Angela Raiola, died of cancer. Ms. Chapman, 47, said she had two master\u2019s degrees and was currently holding six part-time jobs \u2014 a mix of clerical, academic and online work, none of which provided health insurance.\u201cThis is not the life I saw for myself,\u2019\u2019 she said.Now Mr. Foster was at work at the counter, his eyes locked in concentration under his ball cap. He was building a custom heating coil for the kind of powerful vapor-delivery device he and his friends prefer: a walkie-talkie-size gadget called a vaporizer, or a mod. It was a complicated procedure, involving an electric drill and a spool of 36-gauge alloy wire.Mr. Foster has always had a knack for building. Before the recession, his father built fancy mountain retirement homes here. Now retirees were nosing around the North Carolina mountains again, and his father was building again. Sometimes Mr. Foster pitches in.But this afternoon, as he sucked on a mod loaded with a banana-strawberry concoction, he was trying not to think about the trouble he was in. About how he messed up by buying the little white Ford off the showroom floor in 2012; the $265 monthly payments were killing him.How his Verizon bill inched close to $300 the month before because he lost track of how much video he had streamed.How he, his wife and their 4-year-old son were living at his mother-in-law\u2019s place after the landlord sold the house they had been renting for $400 per month. How even a two-bedroom trailer in a crummy neighborhood around here was going for $600 per month. \u201cMore than I can handle,\u201d he said.And how his second child was due in July.\u201cIt\u2019s not just me. There are other people in similar boats,\u201d Mr. Foster said. He acknowledged that maybe he was to blame for some if it. Maybe he should have stayed in college. Maybe he should have kept better track of his cellphone\u2019s data plan.But in his America, he said, it seemed that just a few bad choices could doom anybody who wasn\u2019t born with Donald Trump money. \u201cIf you make just one poor decision,\u201d he said, \u201cthen you\u2019re screwed.\u201dMr. Foster likes Mr. Sanders\u2019s promise of universal health care, and his pledge to make tuition free at public colleges and universities. His dream, which seems distant now, is to one day return to school and study marine biology.Among those who chose Mr. Trump was Mr. Taylor, a native of western North Carolina who never knew the world before the North American Free Trade Agreement or the Internet. He is a gamer and amateur musician. He attends Baptist Bible study and owns a throwback \u201cLegend of Zelda\u201d T-shirt. He plays bluegrass and the White Stripes.And though globalization provides him with his preferred instruments of leisure \u2014 a foreign-made Xbox and a cheap, sturdy Japanese acoustic guitar \u2014 he is also one of globalization\u2019s discontents.On the whole, Mr. Taylor agrees with Mr. Trump that the United States, particularly places like Wilkes County, received raw deals from the trade pacts that began with the passage of Nafta. Some of the textile and furniture industry remains here. But it is not like it was. Or at least the way people tell him it was.\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to be worse than anybody else up there,\u201d Mr. Taylor said of Mr. Trump. If nothing else, he said, \u201cHe\u2019d be somewhat more interesting to watch things unfold under.\u201dLike many others here, both successful and not, Mr. Taylor and Mr. Foster are united in their belief that they are living among the ruins of a lapsed golden age.\u201cEvery day is Saturday in these thriving mountain towns,\u201d a narrator says.Mr. Cooper is a rare young white-collar professional who stayed in town. Many of his clients are people he went to high school with and are now in trouble over drugs or caught in the tangle of family court and dead-end jobs. It doesn\u2019t surprise him that Mr. Trump\u2019s message resonates.\u201cIf there were winners or losers in America in this century, they were the losers,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re talking to people who haven\u2019t won in 30 years, and now somebody is telling them they\u2019re going to win again.\u201dMr. Trump is popular here for a number of reasons. The county is 93 percent white, but from 1990 to 2014, the Hispanic population there grew from 360 people to 4,154, according to census figures. On a Wednesday in March, Brona Wood, 58, a maintenance worker at the county courthouse, came in to the Tapering Vapor for a bottle of liquid called Fruity Juice. If Mr. Trump is elected, she said, \u201cThe Mexicans is going to stop coming in here and taking everybody\u2019s jobs.\u201dEddie Settle, the chairman of the County Commission, was giving a driving tour of the county a few days before the March primaries when a pickup truck adorned with a Confederate flag passed by. It is a common sight here, Mr. Settle said, though he argued that the Confederate symbol has less to do with racism than an ingrained suspicion of those in power. He said the same dynamic explained Mr. Trump\u2019s appeal: \u201cIt\u2019s not because he\u2019s Donald Trump. It\u2019s because he\u2019s anti-establishment.\u201dAs part of his tour, Mr. Settle drove by the large chicken processing plant in Wilkesboro, operated by Tyson Foods. Pay on the production line ranges from $10 to just under $14 per hour. It employs about 2,800 people.Out on Route 421, near the bustling Wilkesboro Walmart, the highway is lined with common American chains \u2014 Sonic, Chik-fil-A, Dollar Tree, Hardee\u2019s, Taco Bell, Sally Beauty Supply \u2014 a sign of the area\u2019s low-wage jobs. The county\u2019s unemployment rate was almost 15 percent in February 2010. In April, it was 5.4 percent, about the same as the national rate.\u201cWe don\u2019t have an unemployment problem here,\u201d said Jim Smoak, the chairman of the Wilkes Economic Development Corporation. \u201cWe have a wage problem.\u201dEven before Mr. Trump\u2019s rise, government and business leaders here had concocted a plan for making Wilkes County great again. They introduced advanced engineering and computer training in high schools, and at the community college, they added computer controlled lathes and mills and a programmable practice production line \u2014 all to train future workers for the Kia or Hyundai plant or other big manufacturing facility the county hopes to lure. So far, no luck.Some of the clientele at the Tapering Vapor have made their own luck, working hard and earning a measure of economic security. Others are just getting by.Billy Williams, 30, walked in wearing an oversize football jersey, with a front tooth conspicuously missing, and asked for a strawberry-raspberry liquid called Beetlejuice. He said he had been working a few hours a week at a restaurant across the river. It was not as many hours as he\u2019d like, but he said it was the best work he could find, given his felony cocaine conviction from many years ago.Kim Shumate, 58, walked in, looking for a replacement part for her mod. She quit smoking cigarettes after her house went into foreclosure in 2012. That was after Lowe\u2019s, at the height of the recession, stopped contracting with her husband\u2019s company, which had built the interiors of new stores.Ms. Shumate cries when she thinks about her old house, with its big porch and its trails through the woods. So she tries not to think about it at all.Lonnie Ramsay, 45, walked in looking for help. He described a nasty falling-out with his girlfriend and said he just wanted to get home to a nearby city. But he only had $25 to his name. He said he had been making $10 an hour at a factory.One Friday afternoon someone brought a pair of virtual reality goggles hooked up to a laptop to the shop. Mr. Foster exhaled a cloud that smelled like a Popsicle. He said he had been reading up on the idea, explored in the \u201cZeitgeist\u201d movie, of a \u201cresource-based economy\u201d \u2014 a system in which, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s no money and everything is controlled by computers and resources are equally distributed and there\u2019s no ownership or anything like that.\u201d\u201cThe system we have now is going to collapse,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd technology, the automation process, is going to keep taking over and over.\u201dThat, he said, would free up people to do what they wanted.Chris Lentz, 36, a worker for a utility company in a pair of mud-caked boots, frowned and asked, \u201cIf people were just given everything they ever needed, then what\u2019s the point of going to work?\u201dAnd so it went: the thick, sweet haze; the frustrations, diversions and digital toys; and the sense, in this jagged, hyperconnected moment, that everything is possible, or nothing is.Mr. Foster took a turn with the virtual reality goggles, and put himself on a roller coaster. His body squirmed and bounced on the sofa as he rounded and flew down the virtual tracks until he became queasy, and said he\u2019d had enough.Advertisement"}

Graduated from Penn StateSince I\u2019m taking a more untraditional route for a psychology degree and going into business rather than on to graduate school, I\u2019ve been in the process of searching for a job using online job boards and recruiting firms since last December. It\u2019s been quite a long journey. I\u2019ve had at least 40 interviews of varying types (from phone to Skype to in person), but hopefully all my hard work will pay off soon! I\u2019m looking to start a job within human resources in the next few months, preferably in New York City.CAMMI CLEMENT, 18, Piqua, Ohio.Graduating from Upper Valley Career Center\u2019s HVAC/R program My job search was a bit different than a lot of other high school students\u2019. I didn\u2019t have to do a lot of searching. In fact, the employers came to me. I was offered a job shadow for Emerson Climate Technologies based in Sidney, Ohio. After touring the facility for the day, I was given the opportunity to be an apprentice. I jumped on that offer as quick as I could. My first day was June 1, 2015. I mostly worked with the older employees so that I could get a feel of how the equipment ran and operated. Not too long after that, I was able to maintain, modify and tear down compressors all on my own.After almost a year of working at Emerson, I was offered a full-time position as a buildup technician after high school. Not only was I offered a full-time position, but they also offered to reimburse me for my college tuition. I can\u2019t even begin to explain the amount of weight that\u2019s been lifted off my shoulders. I\u2019ve always wondered how I was going to be able to pay for my college years, not to mention the amount of debt that would be staring me on the face. It is such a relief that I won\u2019t have to worry about what most 18-year-olds coming out of high school do, and for that I am grateful. Now I will be able to work full time while I attend school during the evening.JULIAN GILYARD, 22, New York.One of the truest statements is that there is no template to get a job out of college. At the beginning of junior year, I began to have an interest in finance. At my school, the business school, which I am not a part of, is separate from the school of arts and sciences. Through the grapevine, I heard that U.N.C. was holding a breakfast with UBS in Chapel Hill to meet with students, so I woke up at 4 a.m. and drove to Chapel Hill to meet with members of UBS. There I incidentally met UBS strategist Dylan Stamer. At the time, he basically taught me everything I knew about finance in 45 minutes. Following our encounter, he told me if I was ever in N.Y.C. to stop by the office.Like an eager student, three weeks later, I tagged along with the finance club to their \u201cWake on Wall Street\u201d trip and flew up to N.Y.C. When we stopped by UBS, Dylan greeted me and took me to the trading floor. From there, he asked me to step into a room and told me that people were going to meet me. For the next five hours, I sat down working on puzzlers, finance topics and math problems. My perception was that I was just meeting people; I didn\u2019t know I was being interviewed. By the end of the last conversation, I was offered an internship position for my junior year summer. After interning for UBS in the summer of my junior year, I was offered a full-time position in N.Y.C. to start upon graduation.JUNAID ABDUL KADER, 23, Staten Island, N.Y. Graduated with G.E.D.I started looking for my first job when I was 18 years old. I had trouble finding a job since I had no work experience, didn\u2019t have my high school diploma, and I was extremely shy and lacked self-esteem. When looking for a G.E.D. program online, I found Opportunities for a Better Tomorrow. I joined the program and it helped me prepare for the G.E.D. test, develop customer service and public speaking skills, and build my self-confidence. Through the program I got my G.E.D. and an internship at Burberry, and they ended up hiring me full time, which is how I got my first job. From that job, I ended up doing customer service for airlines at J.F.K. I currently work for Aircraft Service International Group and am stationed at Etihad Airways, where I greet and check in passengers and help passengers board their flights at the gate.MUQADDAS IBRAHIM, 22, Portland, Ore. Graduating from Wake Forest UniversityMy family immigrated from Afghanistan in 2002. For me the job process was much smoother than I expected. I attended the annual career fair at Wake Forest and had the opportunity to speak to companies I was interested in. Later that day, I was contacted by Dish Network and Abercrombie & Fitch recruiters. By mid-October, I had completed multiple in-person, phone and Skype interviews. I was flown to both headquarters for final in-person interviews with upper management. In November, I was given offers from both companies, but I chose to take the business analyst position with Abercrombie because of its reputable training program and it aligned with my career goals and interests. I\u2019ll be starting on June 27 in Columbus, Ohio.EDUARDO EVANGELISTA, 24, Brooklyn, N.Y. Graduated with G.E.D.\u201cI didn\u2019t finish high school and started looking for a job when I was 19 years old. I asked at all the businesses in my neighborhood if they were hiring, but nobody would give me a job. A friend told me that if I had trouble finding a job I should go to Opportunities for a Better Tomorrow, and they would help me find a job and get my G.E.D. Through the program I got my G.E.D., and they also taught me how to prepare for an interview, dress well and be on time for work. Having a G.E.D. definitely made the job search easier since nobody would ever consider hiring me before I got that. After I got my G.E.D., Opportunities for a Better Tomorrow helped me get my first job at Citarella supermarket and then helped me find my current job at Sims Municipal Recycling, where I work as a quality control specialist.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vague Promises of Debt Relief for Greece", "Date": "2016-05-30", "News": "Supported byEditorialGreece is bankrupt in all but name. The country has a debt of more than 300 billion euros ($333 billion), or about 180 percent of its gross domestic product, a sum it cannot hope to repay in full.The reality is that Greece can\u2019t be squeezed any harder. But the finance ministers are seeking still more spending cuts and increased taxes. They want to see a budget surplus of 3.5 percent of G.D.P. before interest payments by 2018. A stable and fast-growing country might be able to hit that target, but it is preposterous to expect that from Greece. The International Monetary Fund wants to see a more realistic surplus of 1.5 percent.Germany, which has lent more money to Greece than any other country, and other European nations simply do not have any ideas, besides imposing ever more austerity, for resolving the crisis in Greece. The government of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, for one, does not want to commit to debt restructuring before elections in 2017, since many Germans are opposed to any policy that bails out the Greek government. While it\u2019s understandable that German lawmakers are reluctant to admit that the debt won\u2019t be paid in full, delaying the discussion about debt relief will not make this problem go away.This crisis will never end if European leaders keep pushing policies that have repeatedly failed.Advertisement"}

It said it did not plan to restate any published ratings.Still, the disclosure is likely to add to industrywide doubts over carmakers and the fuel-test results they report to governments around the world.Suzuki shares fell more than 9 percent in Tokyo on Wednesday after news reports that it would report fuel-test discrepancies and become the latest Japanese automaker to come under scrutiny.Osamu Suzuki, Suzuki\u2019s chairman and chief executive, apologized to customers but said the company had retested its vehicles and found no significant differences between the results and their already-published ratings.\u201cIn effect, we were using a way of measuring that was not approved, and for that I apologize deeply,\u201d Mr. Suzuki said.The problem came to light after Japanese regulators ordered all carmakers to re-examine their testing methods after the revelations at Mitsubishi last month.

{"Headline": "What Was the Greatest Era for Innovation? A Brief Guided Tour", "Date": "2016-05-13", "News": "Economic ViewWhich was a more important innovation: indoor plumbing, jet air travel or mobile phones?Supported byWe\u2019re in the golden age of innovation, an era in which digital technology is transforming the underpinnings of human existence. Or so a techno-optimist might argue.We\u2019re in a depressing era in which innovation has slowed and living standards are barely rising. That\u2019s what some skeptical economists believe.The truth is, this isn\u2019t a debate that can be settled objectively. Which was a more important innovation: indoor plumbing, jet air travel or mobile phones? You could argue for any of them, and data can tell plenty of different stories depending on how you look at it. Productivity statistics or information on inflation-adjusted incomes is helpful, but can\u2019t really tell you whether the advent of air-conditioning or the Internet did more to improve humanity\u2019s quality of life.But even as the glimmers of the technological future were emerging, much would seem primitive today. People lit their houses with candles and whale oil, and heated them with wood or coal-burning stoves that kept homes unevenly heated and smelling of smoke.Only a quarter of the population lived in cities, most of them in the Northeast. Families were large, and the population skewed young; there were 5.3 people per household, twice as many as in 2010, and 59 percent of the population was under age 25, while today it is more like 34 percent. By modern standards, the population was extremely poor, with the average citizen spending $2,808 a year in 2010 prices \u2014 less than the equivalent of the modern-day per-capita economic output of the Republic of Congo.They ate pork. Lots and lots of pork \u2014 131 pounds of it per person per year in 1870 (that number was half as much by 1929 and is around 55 pounds today). Unlike other meat-producing animals, pigs could live almost anywhere and could survive largely on food scraps. Their meat, easily salted or smoked, could be preserved in an era without refrigeration.Fresh vegetables were scarce; farmers emphasized crops that could be stored or preserved, like turnips, pumpkins, beans and potatoes, instead of leafy greens that would deteriorate quickly. Apples were the only fruit widely consumed, and much of the apple crop was turned into cider or brandy for preservation.Most rural adults had two sets of work clothes, both made at home, and better-off families had a nicer set of clothing for church or social outings. There was not much in the way of consumer goods, and department stores were in their infancy, just starting to appear in large cities.Instead of a toilet, you used a chamber pot or an open window in the city, an outhouse with an open pit underneath in the country. Modern toilets were an invention that was in its earliest phases during the decade of the 1870s. Big cities had sewers for both rainwater and human waste, but they flowed into rivers unfiltered.The New York City subway wouldn\u2019t open for another 34 years. Boston had 700 horses per square mile. The average horse produced 40 to 50 pounds of manure and a gallon of urine daily, which made the streets of major cities no pleasant place to be.By today\u2019s standards, entertainment options were limited. Total circulation of newspapers was 2.6 million in a country of 40 million people. There was no telephone, record player, movie or radio. Men could go to the local saloon to drink; women generally couldn\u2019t. Vacations and weekends were not really a thing.Childbirth usually took place at home, and deaths were common both at birth and during early years from diseases like yellow fever, cholera and many others. There was no licensing of doctors, so quacks were common.The most fundamental shift over those decades was that the American home became, in Mr. Gordon\u2019s word, \u201cnetworked.\u201d Houses that were once dark and isolated were becoming intertwined. They were starting to be connected to electric grids, providing clean, bright light without emitting smoke. Urban water networks supplied clean water, and sewer systems removed waste without the pungent odors of chamber pots and outhouses. Telephones allowed people to converse with distant friends.These advances were enabled not just by technological innovation in plumbing and electricity, but also by urbanization. In 1870, 23 percent of the United States population lived in cities, which rose to 51 percent by 1920. Large, ornate Victorian mansions were giving way to small bungalows affordable to the working class, which took off in Chicago starting in 1905. Sears offered prefabricated materials for a bungalow that it boasted could be built with 352 hours of carpenter labor. A less obvious factor in making mass housing available: The inflation-adjusted price of nails dropped by a factor of 10 from 1830 to 1930 with the advent of factory production.It\u2019s hard to overstate how revolutionary the advent of electric light was. In the 1870s, a kerosene lamp could produce 5,050 candle hours worth of light a year at a cost of $20. That same $20 in 1920 bought 4.4 million candle hours a year from bulbs.In Muncie, Ind., in 1890, there were not more than a dozen bathrooms with running water and sewers across town. By 1925, 75 percent of Muncie\u2019s homes had running water and two-thirds had sewer connections, including almost all newly constructed houses.This is thought to be a major reason public health and life expectancy improved in the years leading to 1920. Many of the major advances in medical treatment, like antibiotics, were yet to arrive, but clean water and waste removal \u2014 chlorination and filtration were introduced \u2014 cut back the death rate from typhoid fever by a factor of five from 1900 to 1920. The number of modern hospitals grew to 6,000 in 1920 from 120 in 1870, and medicine became more of a science, with doctors getting away from selling dubious cure-alls.Transportation was undergoing its own transformation, and people were becoming far more connected to one another physically. In 1900, just 8,000 motorcars were registered in the United States, but there were 9 million in 1920 and 23 million in 1929. Streetcars and subways, unheard-of in 1870, were in all the major cities by 1920. Intercity trains were becoming steadily faster and more reliable \u2014 a train trip from New York to Chicago that took 38 hours in 1870 was 24 hours in 1900 and 16 hours in 1940.Add it all up, and Americans who in 1870 would rarely travel farther than they could go on foot or horseback could suddenly range much more widely.The social effect was particularly great in rural areas. Between 1900 and 1910, one local paper in Illinois reported on the arrival of each new automobile in its town. The automobile \u201cseemed designed to loosen ties and dangle the horizon before the unsettled,\u201d wrote the geographer John A. Jakle. Suddenly a farmer had options beyond the general store and the local bank.The age of processed food had begun. National food brands including Heinz sauces, Campbell\u2019s soup, Quaker oats, Jell-O and Coca-Cola had been invented and began to fill cupboards. Instead of a 1870s breakfast of pork and grain mush, a 1920s American ate Kellogg\u2019s cornflakes, invented in 1894, and orange juice.Refrigerated railroad cars and in-home iceboxes meant that vegetables were now available in winter, and not just turnips. Growers in California developed \u201ciceberg\u201d lettuce in 1903, advertising that it could stay fresh as it crossed the country by rail.Still, much about a 1920 household would still seem foreign to a modern visitor. There were no standardized electrical plugs, so even households with electricity didn\u2019t have appliances we would recognize today. Electric refrigerators and washing machines were virtually unknown.Restaurants were starting to arise, with fancy hotels in the biggest cities employing French chefs, and less expensive restaurants owned by Chinese, German and Italian immigrants starting to appear. While traveling by car, options were few, but the White Castle hamburger stand would open in 1921 and Howard Johnson\u2019s restaurant in 1925. A wave of German immigration meant sausages and sauerkraut were becoming widespread. The hot dog on a bun had made its first appearance at Coney Island in 1900, and was becoming ever more popular.Consumers were starting to have more options, as chain stores arose to offer more variety and lower prices than the small-town general store, which in many places had a monopoly on all manner of goods. The grocery chain A.&P. had 67 stores in 1876 and 15,000 by 1930. Local merchants fought the rise of the chains much as they have fought the rise of Walmart more recently.And increasingly, anything not available in a local store could be obtained by a mail-order catalog \u2014 the Montgomery Ward catalog was first issued in 1872, the Sears catalog in 1894. By 1900, Sears was fulfilling 100,000 orders a day, and its catalog featured fur coats, furnaces, furniture and much more. The catalog business was helped along by a technological innovation \u2014 parcel post, which arrived in 1913. By contrast, in 1890, only about a quarter of American households received mail at their door.It wasn\u2019t just consumer goods arriving at Americans\u2019 doors. Better printing presses and transportation made publishing newspapers more economical, and the average American household read more than three newspapers in the time frame from 1910 to 1930, up from 0.9 in the 1870s.Telephones were not yet ubiquitous but were spreading quickly. In 1880, the telephone was used for 10 conversations per household per year, a number that reached 800 by 1929; a popular form of entertainment in rural areas became using a \u201cparty line\u201d to talk with far-flung neighbors.The phonograph, invented in 1877 and in wide use by the 1920s, opened up another entertainment option: listening to professional-quality music at home, unheard-of in earlier generations. Outside the home, motion pictures \u2014 still silent, until 1927 \u2014 were the latest thing, offering an affordable way to consume a new form of entertainment. They were wildly popular by modern standards; a 1919 study in Toledo, Ohio, found 316,000 movie visits in a week \u2014 in a city with a population of only 243,000!The age of electronic information had not yet begun as of 1920, however: The first commercial radio station opened that year (and by 1923, there were 556 of them).The changes in transportation and communication starting to be seen in 1920 had become fundamental parts of daily life half a century later.Air travel was a perilous, uncomfortable endeavor in 1920 (Charles Lindbergh did not cross the Atlantic until 1927, and many died trying that and similar feats); by 1970 jumbo jets connected major cities around the world and were quite safe. Indeed, in many ways flight in 1970 was more pleasant than today, with no security lines and larger, more comfortable seats in coach class \u2014 albeit at a much higher price than today.Traveling from the West Coast to the East Coast went from being a multiday affair by train to a trip made in less than a single day, at least for those who could afford it.Cars in 1920 were uncomfortable and prone to breakdowns, and were driven on dirt or irregularly paved roads. A 1920 Ford Model T had to be hand-cranked to start. By 1970, cars were comfortable, with options like radios and air-conditioning. They were driven on comparatively smooth, safe surfaces on the Interstate highway system, most of which had been built by 1972.Homes were changing, as the innovations that were being increasingly adopted in 1920 became truly universal. Electric light was in 79 percent of households in 1940 and 100 percent in 1970; running water was in 98 percent of homes, up from 74 percent.Refrigerators rose to 100 percent adoption in 1970 from 44 percent in 1940, and their quality improved a great deal as well; Consumer Reports described constant repair needs in 1949 that had been mostly solved by 1971. The same was true of almost all household appliances.Air-conditioning, first introduced in the United States in 1923, transformed cities with hot weather, propelling the population growth of places like Las Vegas, Miami and Houston. There were 48,000 room air-conditioning units sold in 1946, which rose to two million by 1957. Still, by 1970 only a minority of households had air-conditioning \u2014 11 percent with central air, and 26 percent with room units.Americans started eating a lot less pork and a lot more chicken and turkey; consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables fell as the proportion of people living on or near farms fell, while diets shifted toward much more canned fruits and vegetables (canned vegetable consumption rose from 34 pounds per person per year in 1940 to 93 pounds in 1970). Margarine replaced lard and butter as the cooking fat of choice.The size of grocery stores exploded, with a wide variety of processed foods; a small chain store in the 1920s offered 300 to 600 items, while a 1950 supermarket stocked 2,200, and its 1985 equivalent 17,500.A person had fewer TV channels and fewer movies to choose from than today; the videocassette recorder was years away, so you were captive to what broadcast networks happened to be showing. This resulted in huge audiences; in 1953, 69 percent of televisions were tuned in to the broadcast of the episode of \u201cI Love Lucy\u201d in which Lucy has a baby.In 1970, anyone who needed to reheat leftovers faced a messy, time-consuming task at the stove \u2014 not the quick minute in a microwave of today. The microwave was introduced in 1965 and was not widely purchased until the 1980s, partly owing to falling price. It cost $495 in 1968, and a compact model with more bells and whistles fell to $191 by 1986.But the microwave is the exception. Most of the advances in home appliances since 1970 have been trivial in the scheme of things: a little more energy efficiency here, a more ergonomic handle there, greater reliability, meaning fewer repair calls. Indeed, while fashions have changed in homes since then, in terms of d\u00e9cor and layout, the American household works largely as it did then.Airplanes continued getting safer, with the number of deaths per 100 billion miles traveled falling to less than 1 from more than 100 in 1970. Travel became considerably less expensive \u2014 though the rate of price decrease for air travel was slower from 1960 to 1980 than it had been from 1940 to 1960. Still, air travel had been an upper-middle-class activity in 1970, and now is affordable to the masses.By some measures, air travel has become more onerous since 1970. There were no security screening lines (those were introduced after a series of hijackings in the late 1960s and early \u201970s). Seats were larger and came with free meals and drinks. Arguably, though, the bundle offered by circa-1970 airlines for coach class seats is still available: You can still get a bigger seat and free drinks at a higher price, but now it\u2019s called first class.Once you factor in the time it takes to arrive early and get through security, flying from New York to Chicago takes about the same time, and costs about the same in inflation-adjusted dollars, as it did in 1936; modern planes are faster, but then one could show up at the airport 10 minutes before the scheduled flight time and hop on the plane.Automobiles became more reliable, and car travel far safer, with widespread use of seatbelts, adoption of airbags and anti-lock brakes, better technology to understand how to build a car so that it protects occupants in a crash, and legal and public-awareness efforts against drunken driving. Deaths per 100 million miles driven have fallen from about 11 in 1940 to about five in 1970 to around one today.Compared with 1970, Americans today eat a good bit less beef, pork and eggs, and about twice as much chicken. They eat more fruits and vegetables. But that\u2019s only part of the story. Americans are eating more of their meals away from home, and in restaurants more varied than people in 1970 could have imagined. Thai, Japanese, Middle Eastern and Indian food is now for sale even in small cities.Some of the biggest changes to everyday life since 1970 have been around information and entertainment. The clich\u00e9 about TV going from three channels a generation ago to hundreds actually understates it. The television itself has gone from a 19-inch screen to 50 or more inches, with much more vivid color and definition. Besides many more channels, thousands of movies and television shows are available at any moment of the day or night through on-demand streaming services.And that doesn\u2019t even account for the Internet more broadly. In effect, a person can get access to nearly any notable work mankind has ever produced \u2014 novels, movies, visual art \u2014 instantly and at home. Or thanks to Internet-enabled mobile devices that have become widespread in the last decade, nearly anywhere the person is.Keeping up with distant friends and relatives once required expensive calls on land-based phone lines; now there are free or nearly free conversations through text messages, mobile phone calls or video communication services like FaceTime and Skype. Sending a more detailed message once meant writing it by hand or on a typewriter, putting it in an envelope, driving it to the post office, and waiting a few days for the recipient to get it; now it is an instant, free email.In short, the sheer number of ways a person can be in touch with others, and consume information or entertainment, has exploded, and the price has collapsed.This is the area in which human life has changed the most in the last 46 years. We live and travel much as we did in 1970. We eat more variety of foods. Products of all types keep getting a little safer, a little more efficient, a little better designed.But the real revolution of recent decades is in the supercomputer most people keep in their pocket. And how that stacks up against the advances of yesteryear is the great question of whether an era of innovation remains underway, or has slowed way down.A picture caption with an article on May 15 about the greatest innovations of the current era erroneously attributed a distinction to the flight shown, the landing of a Concorde supersonic jet in New York in 1977. While that landing was the first by the Concorde in New York, which had previously prohibited the jet from landing, it was not the first trans-Atlantic flight by the Concorde, which took place in 1973.Photographs curated by Darcy Eveleigh; art direction by Antonio de Luca.Advertisement"}

Owning shares in the company provides a tremendous opportunity for the workers at his plant in New Berlin, N.Y., an area where working at a state prison or owning a small dairy farming business are two of the limited options.Mr. Ulukaya\u2019s profits are a result of paying dairy farmers the convoluted federal minimum price for milk, and the Greek yogurt boom is driving the price down. That price is so low that it is pushing many of New York\u2019s small family farms out of business.I urge Mr. Ulukaya to extend profit shares to the dairy farmers and farm workers who toil each day to supply Chobani with fresh, high-quality milk. This would set a strong example of how we can revitalize rural America.

{"Headline": "Open Spaces Bring Light to Downtown Columbus", "Date": "2016-05-31", "News": "Supported bySquare FeetCOLUMBUS, Ohio \u2014 The capital city of Ohio adopted a reconstruction plan for encouraging development 14 years ago that emphasized three unexpected ingredients: more grass, less water and targeted taxpayer spending.This year, those words on paper are fully coming to life in the southern blocks of the downtown area of Columbus, which is beckoning developers after decades of disinvestment.\u201cWhat happened here is that people chose the future,\u201d Mayor Andrew J. Ginther said. \u201cOur business leaders work closely with the public sector. We\u2019ve taken some big steps that worked.\u201dIn May, the Arshot Investment Corporation became the latest developer to embrace the formula. The company announced its plan for Millennial Tower, a 25-story, $90 million, 400,000-square foot mixed-use development that includes 180,000 square feet of office space, 40,000 square feet of retail space and 100 apartments.Construction of the tower is scheduled to start early next year on the corner of Rich and Front Streets, a short walk from the nine-acre Columbus Commons, which was completed in 2011. The tower will also be one block from the city\u2019s Scioto River shoreline promenade and park, which was completed last year.Within a few blocks of the coming tower are five other buildings that are under construction or just opened, totaling $241 million in private investment to construct 275,000 square feet of office space, about 800 residential units and 80,000 square feet of retail space.Preceding these changes was a challenging campaign for local lawmakers, who persuaded Columbus residents during the recession in 2009 to approve a city income tax increase to 2.5 percent, from 2 percent.The vote was close, but the measure passed. The added revenue helped prevent layoffs of city employees and enabled Columbus to begin investing in its reconstruction plan. The city spent $63 million from 2011 to 2015 to build three new parks. The total cost was $105 million, and the balance was raised from city businesses, most of them affiliated with the Columbus Downtown Development Corporation, a nonprofit organization founded in 2002 and directed by business and civic leaders.In 2011, the development group scraped away the last vestiges of the 1.2-million-square-foot City Center. The nearly empty shopping mall, which opened in 1989 but struggled as interest in downtown shopping declined, was replaced by Columbus Commons, a $25 million expanse of grass, gardens and a shaded food court inspired by Bryant Park in Midtown Manhattan.The same year, the city rebuilt its eastern Scioto River shoreline, shrinking a five-lane riverfront boulevard to three lanes, and adding a promenade and restaurants. The renamed Scioto Mile cost $44 million.Columbus then looked at the river itself, listless and muddy. In 2013, the city removed the Main Street Dam, which was completed in 1918 to control flooding but also doubled to 600 feet the distance between the river\u2019s banks. With the dam out of the way, and with the help of dredges to remove sediments, the river narrowed to 300 feet, and the city gained 33 acres of once-submerged shoreline that opened as the $36 million Scioto Greenways park last year. The projects were principally financed by public funds.Columbus\u2019s strategy of seeding anticipated private real estate investment with taxpayer money defied the tactics of low taxes and public spending austerity that gripped Ohio\u2019s state lawmakers through and since the recession. But city officials say their decisions have paid off, attracting developers into privately financing the replacement of cracked asphalt of parking lots with nearly $350 million in new and renovated market-rate buildings that house thousands of downtown residents, and helped generate 1,000 jobs.The newest completed project in the southern part of downtown is 250 High Street, a $55 million, 12-story building on the southwest corner of Columbus Commons. It is 320,000 square feet, and has about 120 rental units and retail and office space. Opened in November, it has 140,000 square feet of office space and 10,000 square feet of ground-floor retail space. Over all, it is 99 percent leased.The market response has been so strong that the builders \u2014 Robert White Jr., the president of the developer the Daimler Group, and Brett Kaufman, the chief executive of Kaufman Development \u2014 are preparing to construct a $60 million, mixed-use building of similar size on an empty parcel a block away.\u201cOur thought was that green space would change how people viewed this part of the city,\u201d Mr. White said. \u201cIt did just that.\u201dThe new project from Mr. White and Mr. Kaufman on Rich Street, called Two25 Commons, will be the final piece in a three-sided enclosure of buildings that surround the park. Other new structures are the Julian, a $21 million, seven-story apartment building with about 90 residential units, which opened last year; and Highpoint at Columbus Commons, a $51 million, 300-unit rental apartment project with ground-floor retail, which opened in 2013. Across High Street, a $30 million apartment project with about 250 units and 22,000 square feet of retail space is under construction.\u201cWe knew we needed to build the amenities to attract privately financed development,\u201d said Guy V. Worley, chief executive of the Columbus Downtown Development Corporation. \u201cWe had a lot of help from our major businesses here, which wrote seven- and eight-figure checks. At the same time, the public investment has been substantial.\u201dWith 836,000 residents, Columbus is the largest city in Ohio and one of the largest in the Midwest by population. Unlike its two big sister cities, Cincinnati and Cleveland, which have lost residents, Columbus has grown over the last few decades.Business executives and government leaders cite Columbus\u2019s long history as the state capital, its central location and huge pool of graduating students from Ohio State University and other colleges as competitive advantages in sustaining the city\u2019s economy.Similarly, in the late 1990s, Columbus recognized that a 75-acre industrial area and abandoned rail yard along the Scioto River, about a mile north of Columbus Commons, was a prime site for a new multiuse district. The city collaborated with Nationwide Realty Investors, an affiliate of Nationwide Mutual Insurance, which is based in the city. Together, at a cost of $750 million, they turned the area into the Arena District, now one of the city\u2019s most active areas for work and residences. The Blue Jackets, the National Hockey League team, play there, as do the Clippers, an affiliate of the Cleveland Indians baseball team.Since 2000, the number of people living in the city\u2019s center has doubled, to 7,500, according to the mayor\u2019s office. The $388 million in public infrastructure investment since 2011 in the Columbus Commons area and several more downtown projects has generated close to $2 billion in private investment in Columbus\u2019s downtown, the office said, and brought 1,600 new jobs into 2.5 million square feet of fresh office space.The next area for development, Mr. Ginther said, is Franklinton, one of the city\u2019s oldest neighborhoods and across the river from downtown in the 200-acre floodplain along the Scioto\u2019s western bank. Ignored for decades, Franklinton\u2019s turn-of-the-20th-century homes and mid-20th century light-industrial buildings are separated by many empty parcels. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the public investments in place to make that neighborhood really work,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

A lot of these men are too old to train for another job.\u201dPresidential primaries tend to bring attention to local issues as candidates move from state to state, and as the candidates have come to West Virginia to campaign, coal has been no exception.\u201cThese communities need help,\u201d Mr. Sanders said last week at a food bank in McDowell County. \u201cIt is not the coal miners\u2019 fault in terms of what\u2019s happening in this world.\u201dIn some ways, Mr. Sanders is not a natural candidate to be courting the votes of coal miners: He is outspoken on climate change and advocates moving away from fossil fuels. But his message of economic fairness has been embraced by white, working-class voters.But what people here bring up is a comment she made about coal workers in March, when she said during a televised forum, \u201cWe\u2019re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.\u201d She was talking about providing opportunity through clean energy, and she emphasized that coal miners must not be left behind, but the sound bite was a damning one.\u201cA lot of people that I know are laid off, and you know that had to hurt the people,\u201d said Janet White, 80, a librarian whose husband was a coal miner.At a rally in Charleston last week, he donned a hard hat given to him by an industry group that had endorsed him, the West Virginia Coal Association, and mimicked shoveling coal. \u201cMy hair look O.K.?\u201d he asked after taking the hat off.Mr. Trump gushed about mining, telling the crowd that he was fascinated by it and promising to revive the industry. \u201cYou watch what happens: If I win, we\u2019re going to bring those miners back,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be so proud of your president.\u201d He did not explain how he would go about doing that.The signs of the state\u2019s economic distress are all over, particularly in areas known for coal production, like Boone County, south of Charleston. In the window of a barbershop and beauty salon in Madison is a yellow sign: \u201cWe support coal and those who mine it!\u201dBut inside, Barbara Bias had no customers. The wives of coal miners used to come in with money to spend, she said. Not anymore.\u201cBoone County used to be booming, and now there\u2019s nothing,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a ghost town, because when the coal goes out, it hurts all of us.\u201dAn interactive delegate calculator that lets you simulate how the 2016 Democratic nomination process could unfold.In the last quarter of 2011, West Virginia had about 24,700 coal mining jobs; by the last quarter of 2015, that number had fallen to about 14,500, a decline of more than 40 percent, according to an analysis by S&P Global Market Intelligence.The industry has suffered because of a combination of factors, and a slew of coal companies have filed for bankruptcy protection.\u201cIt\u2019s a perfect storm of those three factors coming together at about the same time,\u201d said John Deskins, the director of the Bureau of Business and Economic Research at West Virginia University. So far in 2016, coal production in West Virginia is down by more than a third compared with 2015, according to federal data.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: A Minimalist Version of \u2018Peer Gynt\u2019 Still Provokes", "Date": "2016-06-19", "News": "Supported byToward the end of Ibsen\u2019s \u201cPeer Gynt,\u201d a saga of self under siege, the title character is discovered peeling an onion, finding in the layers of that humble vegetable a symbol for the chapters of an eventful life. In most productions of this bulky fantasia, the moment is a long time coming \u2014 as much as five or six hours \u2014 and audiences are likely to feel as depleted as the now aged Peer.As for the man, though he\u2019s embodied in the sullied flesh by the talented Gabriel Ebert, his identity is, as always, open to debate. So, come to think of it, is that of the strange and swirling play in which he appears, though in this telling \u201cPeer Gynt\u201d is both more digestible and less flavorful than usual.Originally composed in five acts of verse that travel the globe amid various real and surreal estate, this early work by Ibsen would seem to have little in common with his later, better-known dramas of scalding social realism, \u201cGhosts\u201d and \u201cA Doll\u2019s House.\u201d Yet in some ways, \u201cPeer Gynt,\u201d inspired by Norwegian folk tales, is the most prophetically modern of all his plays, anticipating writers of the page (Joyce, Kafka) and stage (Ionesco, Pirandello) who would question the very nature of reality and identity.Of course in Peer\u2019s case what is finally found is plenty of nothing, an apt conclusion for a man for whom a solid self remains elusive. Mr. Doyle\u2019s six-performer, single-set, intermission-free condensation delivers somewhat more fruitful results.If this production lacks the teeming, motley exuberance that pulses in Ibsen\u2019s text, it definitely distills the intriguing philosophical essence of a play that still seems unsettlingly relevant. And you may wind up filling in the blanks left by Mr. Doyle\u2019s stark staging with contemporary scenes from, among other sources, the current presidential race.Like your typical American politician, our Peer, played with radiant petulance and inexhaustible athleticism by Mr. Ebert, is a figure of great bluster, ambition and duplicity. We first meet him as a boy telling his impoverished, understandably distrustful Mother (Becky Ann Baker) extravagantly tall tales of riding an enchanted stag through the mountain.Someday, he says, he\u2019s going to be emperor. And in the scenes that follow, he makes good on the boast, as he roams from the mazelike, snowy forests of Norway to the boundless sea, with stops in the New World and the North African desert. He becomes, among other things, a prince in the realm of the trolls; a millionaire slave trader (\u201cI wanted to stimulate the economy,\u201d he explains); and a seducer and abandoner of assorted women.At the same time, he never stops wondering what personality has been shaped by this nomadic life. \u201cMan, be thyself,\u201d goes an injunction oft-repeated in the play. But who is that? As he contemplates his imminent death, Peer broods, \u201cThen let the snow fall over me and on my resting place may they write \u2014 \u2018Here Lies No One.\u2019\u201dI\u2019m making \u201cPeer Gynt,\u201d a work of endless contradictions, sound simpler than it is. Every assertion is followed by its opposite. And the figures who bedevil Peer include, in addition to the trolls he takes up with (embodied by Dylan Baker and Jane Pfitsch), a mysterious stranger on a doomed ship (George Abud); a cosmic button molder (Adam Heller); and Solveig (a touching Quincy Tyler Bernstine), Peer\u2019s pure-hearted, ever-waiting sweetheart.Their diverse interactions \u2014 hauntingly underscored by Dan Moses Schreier\u2019s music and sound design \u2014 occur on and around a ragged raised platform of a stage (David L. Arsenault did the set). But it\u2019s a small space, basically built for one, and it seems safe to say Peer has seldom seemed as solitary a soul as he does here.By the time he comes to his t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with the onion, we may not feel like weeping, as Peer does (it\u2019s an onion, remember). But in this production, we can definitely understand why and how he\u2019s reached this pathetic moment of communion.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Policy Puts Iran Deal at Risk", "Date": "2016-05-06", "News": "Supported byPerhaps nothing is more important to President Obama\u2019s foreign policy legacy than the success of the Iran nuclear deal. It bears his personal imprimatur and will stand or fall on whether it prevents Iran from producing a bomb over the 15-year term of the agreement and beyond.If an Iranian hard-liner returns to power in the presidential election next year, replacing President Hassan Rouhani, the likelihood of the deal unraveling will increase. The balance between the reformist Rouhani and the hawkish Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei produced the political conditions in which the accord became possible.But today America is undermining that balance, reinforcing Iranian hawks and putting the hard-won deal that reversed Iran\u2019s steady advance to the nuclear threshold at risk. It\u2019s a shoot-yourself-in-the-foot policy after a major diplomatic achievement.The growing cry in Tehran is that Rouhani and his foreign minister Javad Zarif were had by Washington because Iranian concessions \u2014 the slashing of the number of centrifuges and its uranium stockpile \u2014 have not produced promised economic benefits. Hard-liners are baying: \u201cWhere\u2019s the beef?\u201dThe chief problem is that European banks are terrified that if they provide financing to Iran they will fall foul of United States sanctions that are still in place. Many of these banks \u2014 including BNP Paribas, Commerzbank and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u2013 have paid hefty fines in recent years. In all, European banks have handed over more than $15 billion since 2012 for infringement of U.S. financial sanctions on Iran. From a risk-reward standpoint no European bank can make enough revenue in Iran to offset the possibility of being slapped with a big fine.Secretary of State John Kerry attempted to break the logjam last month by saying that, \u201cWe have no objection and we do not stand in the way of foreign banks engaging with Iranian banks and companies, obviously as long as those banks and companies are not on our sanctions list for non-nuclear reasons.\u201dBut the ownership structure of Iranian corporations is often opaque, making it difficult for European companies to be sure there is not, for example, a Revolutionary Guard Corps interest. Knowing exactly who the customer is may be arduous.One international businessman based in Tehran told me he\u2019d received a letter from United Against Nuclear Iran, an American advocacy organization, warning him that he might be working with the Revolutionary Guards and could get into trouble. \u201cYou can be sure that letter is going to all the European banks,\u201d he said.Most international transactions are dollar-denominated, so they have to transit the U.S. banking system before being settled. Because the U.S. trade embargo on Iran remains in place, making it illegal, with limited exceptions, for Americans or American companies to deal with Iran or its government, this is very problematic. A bank may be located in Europe but unable to demonstrate that a proposed Iran contract does not involve its United States subsidiary at some level.In an e-mail, Hamid Biglari, an international financier and a former vice-chairman at Citigroup, wrote: \u201cWe\u2019ve turned what should have been a win-win opportunity for greater engagement into a lose-lose outcome where neither Iran can truly benefit nor American firms can compete on a level international playing field.\u201dIn an earlier conversation, Biglari told me, \u201cThe irony of the nuclear deal is that we did the heavy lifting in terms of the negotiation and then opened it up to European companies to do business with Iran\u201d while blocking American firms.Airbus has already concluded multi-billion dollar deal with Iran, but in general the Iranian market remains fraught with obstacles.Short of lifting the U.S. trade embargo \u2014 which would make political sense because nothing will undermine the Revolutionary Guards and the hard-liners faster than a more open and competitive Iranian economy where IRGC monopolies are eliminated \u2014 there are steps that should be taken as fast as possible. (Opposition in Congress makes an end to the embargo inconceivable.)On the American side, Kerry needs to keep pressing his message encouraging European banks. The Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) needs to be aggressive in granting licenses of the kind that has enabled Boeing to hold talks with Iran. Technocrats need to come up with a way to insulate from potential fines Iranian transactions by European banks that involve \u201cround-trip\u201d dollar clearing.Iran, in turn, must bring their banks up to international compliance standards when it comes to money laundering. Opaque ownership structures need to be cleared up so that European companies know whom they are dealing with. Iranian transparency is an oxymoron right now. That has to change.The next Iranian presidential election is in June 2017. If Rouhani has nothing to show by then for his nuclear diplomacy, his chances of gaining a second term will be slim. That in turn will put Obama\u2019s biggest foreign policy achievement at risk.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Worrisome Pileup of $100 Million Homes", "Date": "2016-05-28", "News": "Supported byInside WealthOne of the latest symbols of the overinflated luxury housing market is a pink mansion perched above the Mediterranean on the French Riviera.The 13,000-square-foot property, built and owned by the fashion magnate Pierre Cardin, is composed of giant terra cotta orbs arranged in a sprawling hive. The home\u2019s name befits its price. \u201cLe Palais Bulles,\u201d or \u201cthe Bubble Palace,\u201d is being offered for sale at approximately $450 million.If you add in high-priced \u201cwhisper listings\u201d that are offered privately, brokers say the actual number of nine-figure listings worldwide could easily top 40 or 50.\u201cIt\u2019s a bumper crop,\u201d said Dan Conn, chief executive of Christie\u2019s International Real Estate. \u201cIt\u2019s just a new world in terms of what people are building and offering for sale.\u201dThe rise in nine-figure real estate listings comes just as sales of luxury real estate have cooled. Many say the sudden surge in hyperprice homes \u2014 often built and sold by speculative investors \u2014 is the ultimate bubble signal.Last year, only two homes in the world sold for over $100 million, according to Christie\u2019s. One was a 9,455-square-foot house in Hong Kong purchased for $193 million by Jack Ma, the chief of Alibaba. The other was a townhouse in London that sold for $132 million. This year, a ranch in Texas went on the market for $700 million and a home in Dallas listed for $100 million. Both sold, but the actual sale prices have not been disclosed.The last time a sudden pop in $100 million-plus listings occurred was in 2007 and 2008, just before the housing crash. In 2008, at least four homes in the world listed for nine figures. Only one ended up selling for close to that. A mansion in Palm Beach owned by Donald Trump and listed for $100 million sold for $95 million. (Mr. Trump says it sold for $100 million.) A 103-room mansion in Surrey, England, called Updown Court, was listed for $138 million, but sold in 2011 for about $50 million. A log mansion planned for the Yellowstone Club in Montana, with a promised price of $155 million, was never built, and the land sold for $10 million.Of course, anyone can slap a $100 million price tag on a home to get attention. Yet actual sales of nine-figure homes are rare, even in good times. Between 2011 and 2016, only 15 homes in the world have sold for $100 million or more, according to Christies, and five of those were in 2014.\u201cThe era of aspirational pricing is over, and I\u2019m not sure it ever really worked,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cThese prices get headlines, but the properties just don\u2019t sell.\u201dBrokers promoting the listings say their properties are one-of-a-kind masterpieces \u2014 like Picassos or Modiglianis \u2014 that rarely come on the market. They add that the more than 1,800 billionaires in the world see property as a safer store of wealth than stocks or art. Mr. Conn estimates that of the 27 nine-figure listings, a third will sell for under $100 million, a third will sell for around $100 million and a third for far more.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a sign of a bubble,\u201d Mr. Conn said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign of growing wealth in the world and the quality of some of the new construction.\u201dYet the market for megamansions and penthouses has cooled significantly in the last year. Prices for homes in the top 5 percent of the real estate market fell 1.1 percent in the first quarter of 2016, according to Redfin. Prices for the rest of the housing market increased 4.7 percent.Brokers say the very top of the market \u2014 consisting of eight- and nine-figure homes \u2014 is faring the worst as slowing economies overseas and volatile stock markets have spooked buyers. The supply of homes for the rich exploded as builders aimed at the high end after the financial crisis.Of the 10 most expensive listings in the world, seven are in the United States and four of these are in Los Angeles. The most expensive listing in the world is the $500 million compound being built in the Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles by Nile Niami, a film producer and speculative builder. The property will have a 74,000-square-foot main house, a 30-car garage and a \u201cMonaco-style casino.\u201dIn nearby Holmby Hills, a more modest 38,000-square-foot mansion, built by the investor and developer Gala Asher, came on the market in April for $150 million. The ultramodern house, on the prestigious Carolwood Drive, has a 5,300-square-foot master suite and a club level with bar, dance floor, wine room, lap pool, theater complex, beauty parlor and massage rooms. The property also includes several guesthouses and staff housing. The broker, Ginger Glass, said the price of the property was justified.\u201cBuyers today want new construction,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd there isn\u2019t anything that\u2019s new like this in such a great location.\u201dStill more nine-figure homes are on the way. Real estate agents and developers say a home under construction in Bel Air is likely to have more than 50,000 square feet of living space, with finishes rivaling a superyacht\u2019s. The price will be yacht-like, too, at around $300 million. Among the home\u2019s amenities: the world\u2019s largest safe.ROBERT FRANK is the CNBC wealth editor and the author of \u201cRichistan.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ukraine Makes Iffy Progress After Trade Pact With Europe", "Date": "2016-05-09", "News": "Supported by5 PhotosMUKACHEVO, Ukraine \u2014 Before gliding along trails or sliding down slopes, many of the world\u2019s skis start at this bustling, sprawling factory in western Ukraine.Here, skilled machinists combine wobbly ribbons of carbon fiber and thin sheets of stiff titanium, stacking them like cake layers, and then heat-pressing, shaping and polishing them into finished slats for cross-country or downhill use.Here, too, craftworkers steam and bend wood into the sticks used by hockey players around the world under brand names that include Nike and Oxelo.The factory\u2019s Austrian owner, Fischer Sports, pays employees the equivalent of about $307 a month on average \u2014 perhaps one-eighth the amount that skilled woodworkers and machinists might earn in Fischer\u2019s home country.And since January, when a new free-trade pact between Ukraine and the 28-country European Union took effect, Fischer\u2019s costs have been further reduced by the elimination of tariffs on the machinery and raw materials flowing into the country and the finished goods that are shipped back out.The pay may seem paltry by Western standards, but the factory\u2019s 1,500 workers tend to see the jobs as an opportunity. Ukraine is one of the Northern Hemisphere\u2019s poorest countries, with an economy that generates less than $3,100 a year per person.\u201cEurope is our future,\u201d said Yuri V. Oros, a machinist on the ski line.And even as Fischer and some other multinational companies, including Nexans, a French maker of electrical wiring, have invested in Ukrainian operations to take advantage of the free-trade arrangement, many other companies are hesitant to venture into this former Soviet republic.So it is unclear how far any benefits of the trade pact might carry beyond the western edge of Ukraine near the Polish border, where most of these factories are situated, and into the broader economy in this country of 44.4 million, about 5 million of whom are now living in areas claimed by Russia or pro-Russian separatists.\u201cWe will have episodic, anecdotal success stories, but it\u2019s too early to call it a success,\u201d said Tymofiy S. Mylovanov, president of the Kiev School of Economics.Over all, Mr. Mylovanov said, Ukraine\u2019s economy is barely growing, stunted by low labor productivity and widespread corruption. Only over the long run, he said, might the trade agreement help lift Ukrainians from poverty.The new government in Kiev pivoted back to the European agreement, signing it in March 2014. But that same month Russia annexed the Ukrainian province of Crimea, inciting a Russian-backed civil war in eastern Ukraine.By the time the European Union trade pact took effect as scheduled, many Ukrainians were so distracted or demoralized by war and years of recession that they hardly noticed.Yet, here in Mukachevo, a picturesque town of cobble-paved roads and a 14th century hilltop castle left over from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Fischer plant provides a glimpse of what the future of greater European integration could mean for this country.Fischer\u2019s Ukranian subsidiary, privately held, does not disclose financial figures for the factory. But executives say they expect benefits of the trade pact to add about 500,000 euros, or around $565,000, to the factory\u2019s profits this year.\u201cUkraine has all the preconditions for investment,\u201d Vasyl Ryabych, the factory\u2019s director, said in an interview in his office, which overlooks the factory\u2019s groomed lawn surrounded by rose hedges.In the same way the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994 spurred a surge of light-industry manufacturers \u2014 the so-called maquiladoras \u2014 along Mexico\u2019s border with the United States, the association agreement is meant to encourage development along Ukraine\u2019s borders with the European Union. In turn, Ukraine is obliged to alter domestic economic policies through measures like overhauling the judiciary and changing rules for awarding state contracts.The Fischer plant is only one of the signs of foreign investment popping up around Lviv, the regional capital of western Ukraine.Nexans, the French company, recently rented land near Lviv where it plans to spend 120 million hryvnia, or about $4.7 million, on a factory that would put 2,000 people to work making automotive wire. Another Nexans plant in the region already makes wiring for BMW, General Motors and other carmakers.Leoni, a German competitor to Nexans, operates a factory in Stryi, in the Lviv region, making cables for Volkswagen, Opel, Porsche and others.And Fujikura, a Japanese car parts maker, last fall announced plans to open a factory in the next three years that would employ about 3,000 Ukrainians.\u201cThe economy is orienting toward Europe,\u201d said Veronika Movchan, an economist at VoxUkraine, a research organization in Kiev.The tilt westward has increased Ukraine\u2019s trade with the European Union to more than a third of the country\u2019s total imports and exports, compared with less than a quarter in 2012.During that same span, however, Ukrainian exports to Russia fell by more than half, to 12.7 percent \u2014 a share that could slip further because Moscow has put tariffs on goods from Ukraine in retaliation for the European trade pact.And tariff-free trade with the European Union is a two-way street: As more European products compete with local goods, Ukraine might fall short of even its modest forecast of 1 percent growth this year, some economists now say.The trade pact also placed tight restrictions on agricultural imports into the European Union, despite agriculture being one of Ukraine\u2019s strengths. The quotas for tariff-free honey imports are so low, for example, that Ukrainian beekeepers used them up in the first six weeks of the year.\u201cIf Ukraine has any hope at all, it is agriculture,\u201d said Ivan Tchakarov, chief economist for former Soviet states with Citi. \u201cBut the fact that they\u2019ve used up most annual quotas already suggests this agreement is not having the desired effect.\u201dAll the more reason that supporters of the trade pact are counting on continued success from the Fischer plant, which is already branching out beyond skis and hockey sticks.Having demonstrated its agility in handling carbon-fiber materials, and noting the regional growth in car parts, the factory has set up a workshop that takes on the labor-intensive work of polishing components for the auto industry.The sleek, lightweight parts include engine mounts for high-performance BMW M3 models and exterior panels for Audi, Porsche and Tesla. After the polishing, the parts are shipped back to wealthier markets.\u201cWe\u2019re like China,\u2019\u2019 said Mr. Ryabych, the factory director, \u201cbut on the border with Europe.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fearing a Last-Minute Obstacle in a Push to Release 9/11 Findings", "Date": "2016-05-23", "News": "Supported byOn Washington\u201cWe seem to be coming to a point of decision as to whether to release it or not and in what form,\u201d said Bob Graham, the former Democratic senator from Florida, who served as a co-chairman of the 2002 inquiry and has made disclosure of the pages a personal cause since leaving Congress.But last-minute obstacles, often by design, have a way of cropping up in Washington and slowing things down. Mr. Graham hopes he is not seeing an example of that, he said, after suggestions from James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, that Congress will ultimately be left to decide what to do with the pages once intelligence officials finish a review as early as next month.That approach \u2014 first raised in a private meeting last week among Mr. Clapper, Mr. Graham and lawmakers \u2014 took Mr. Graham by surprise. It threatens to add a new layer of complexity to a process that those backing the release thought was reaching its long-sought end.\u201cNo one has ever questioned that this is a decision that rests at the White House,\u201d said Mr. Graham, who noted that Congress had long ago moved to release the pages, only to be stopped by President George W. Bush. \u201cThe idea of adding another elongated, contentious step to the process is befuddling.\u201dMr. Graham said Mr. Clapper had compared the approach to the handling of a Senate report on C.I.A. torture of terror detainees. That document was reviewed by the Obama administration, which redacted parts of it over security concerns, and the Senate ultimately released an executive summary. But that was a messy process that took months of bitter fighting to resolve.The National Archives released a series of memos written by Sept. 11 Commission staff members, a compilation of numerous possible connections between the hijackers and Saudis inside the United States. The document appears to be a glimpse into what is still inside the classified 28 pages of the congressional inquiry into the 2001 attacks.If the decision on making the pages public is returned to Congress, it is not even clear what procedure would be used to make the documents public.Would it take a vote by the House and Senate? Would it be left up to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, which first produced the report? The current chairmen of those panels, Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina and Representative Devin Nunes of California, both Republicans, have expressed reluctance about doing so.\u201cI am just worried,\u201d Mr. Graham said in an interview. \u201cWe have been at this for 13 years now.\u201dA spokesman for Mr. Clapper declined to discuss the meeting with Mr. Graham.The possibility of a renewed role for Congress was just one new wrinkle as the potential for releasing the pages loomed. Some in the intelligence community have raised concerns that some of the original findings proved unsubstantiated and that a release now might do more harm than good.Mr. Graham said he expected skeptics to take that view.\u201cIt is going to be in the eye of the beholder,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the person looking at this without preconception is going to find it very disconcerting what the Saudis did.\u201dThe developments on the potential release of the 28 pages come as Congress is exerting other pressure on Saudi Arabia over the Sept. 11 attacks, with the Senate voting without objection this month to change foreign sovereign immunity laws to give families of those killed on Sept. 11, 2001, the opportunity to hold Saudi Arabia accountable in federal court.Backers of that legislation are increasingly optimistic that it can pass the House and be sent to President Obama.Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican and a chief author of the legislation, said he had kept his Republican colleagues in the House apprised of the Senate legislation. His aides met last week with staff members of the House Judiciary Committee, which would consider the bill, and representatives of Sept. 11 families backing the measure met Monday with House leadership aides.\u201cThis is the right thing to do,\u201d said Representative Peter T. King, a New York Republican and an author of the House version of the immunity legislation.The White House has raised objections to the bill, saying it could spur retaliation against the United States and hurt ties with an important ally. But Senator Chuck Schumer, the New York Democrat who helped write the legislation, said he believed that any veto could be overridden.\u201cThey will have their day in court, and if they weren\u2019t complicit, so be it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if they are, it outweighs diplomatic considerations.\u201dSaudi officials have said for years that they support the release of the 28 pages, but the immunity legislation is a different story. Saudi officials have said a loss of immunity could force them to remove hundreds of billions of dollars in investments from the United States, a move that could have implications for the economies of both nations.The congressional willingness to challenge the Saudis suggests a weakening of their political standing \u2014 a fact the Saudis seem to recognize. The Saudi government prepared a glossy 110-page white paper now being circulated around Washington to show its seriousness about fighting terrorism.That galvanizing, backers of the legislation easing immunity like to note, came well after the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States.Advertisement"}

Later, Mr. Kashkari ran an improbable (and unsuccessful) race for governor of California, in which he felt up close the fear, anxiety and anger of financially squeezed voters.Now president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Mr. Kashkari is no longer a free-market ideologue.\u201cMaybe a humbled pragmatist,\u201d he said. \u201cMarkets can make mistakes, and sometimes those mistakes can be incredibly costly.\u201dThat\u2019s why Mr. Kashkari these days sounds a little like Bernie Sanders, the Democratic presidential candidate. He, too, believes that the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul enacted under President Obama didn\u2019t go far enough \u2014 and that the biggest banks may need to be broken up.That led him to create the \u201cEnding Too Big to Fail\u201d initiative. It hasn\u2019t settled on recommendations for reducing the risk that bailouts would be needed during the next financial crisis, whenever it occurs, but the initiative has unsettled and confused some erstwhile Republican allies.\u201cI\u2019ve had people call me up and say, \u2018What the hell are you doing?\u2019 \u2014 friends of mine,\u201d he said with a grin.His answer, grounded in those harrowing days at the Treasury Department: \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to look out for big risks.\u201dMr. Kashkari fears the financial sector has grown too large as a share of the economy as middle-class incomes have stagnated, but the shift in Mr. Kashkari\u2019s outlook goes only so far.The central cause of the 2008 crisis, he argues, was not fraud but rather \u201cmass delusion\u201d among lenders, borrowers and investors that home prices would keep rising. He thinks some executives should have gone to prison for misrepresenting some of the mortgage-backed securities they sold but faults current laws for making convictions too difficult.He isn\u2019t persuaded by arguments for a national increase in the minimum wage to $15 an hour, saying that\u2019s best left for the states to decide. He doubts the effectiveness of trying to engineer higher pay for workers through mechanisms like the stock grants or profit incentives that top executives command. He questions whether shifting the way in which Wall Street pays its executives can \u201cchange the culture\u201d and protect Main Street.The most effective steps government can take to make average Americans wealthier, he said, are investing in education and infrastructure.The kind of bank breakups that Mr. Kashkari is exploring could come at a cost. Ben S. Bernanke, the former Fed chairman, cautioned at a conference organized by the Minneapolis Fed this week that much smaller Wall Street firms might mean \u201cless efficiency\u201d and \u201cfewer services at higher cost.\u201dMr. Bernanke prefers giving time to Dodd-Frank, which calls for the largest institutions to prepare bankruptcy plans, to gauge its adequacy. Regulators recently directed five big banks to revise their so-called living wills.Mr. Kashkari is reviewing other options besides breakups. They include requiring banks to hold much larger capital cushions as insurance against failure, or taxing the use of \u201cleverage\u201d (borrowed money) to increase investment returns.Fed colleagues have had mixed reactions to his initiative, casting doubt on whether his recommendations will go anywhere once he makes them later this year. Coaxing a gridlocked Congress to engage in advance planning has become an event almost as rare as financial crises themselves.What won\u2019t deter him, Mr. Kashkari insists, are objections from those in the free-market circles he once traveled in while on Wall Street or as part of the George W. Bush administration.\u201cIf that means people are going to be unhappy with me, that\u2019s too bad,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve long since passed the need to be loved.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kerry Rebuts Claims That U.S. Is Undercutting Iran Trade and Investment", "Date": "2016-05-10", "News": "Supported bySecretary of State John Kerry on Tuesday rebutted complaints that the United States is impeding others from investing and trading with Iran despite the easing of sanctions against that country under the nuclear agreement that took effect in January.Mr. Kerry said that some businesses were misusing the United States as an excuse.Many big banks and companies in Europe and Asia have hesitated to engage with Iran, partly for fear of inadvertently violating non-nuclear American sanctions that remain in effect against the Iranians, including severe restrictions on their use of the dollar.The hesitancy has angered Iran, which agreed to wide restraints on its nuclear activities under the deal and had expected a huge lift to its economy in return, an outcome that has yet to happen. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran\u2019s supreme leader, has accused the United States of stealthily subverting the agreement, an assertion that American officials have denied.In a meeting with a small group of reporters in London, where he was preparing to meet with European bankers, Mr. Kerry acknowledged \u201csome confusion\u201d about the rules under the agreement, but he said that the United States was happy to explain them.Mr. Kerry also suggested that some companies were using the American sanctions that remain in force as a guise for not venturing into Iran. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t say, \u2018Oh, we can\u2019t do it because of the United States,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Kerry said. \u201cThat\u2019s just not fair. That\u2019s not accurate. And we sometimes get used as an excuse in this process.\u201dThe system of American sanctions on Iran, he said, is \u201cjust not as complicated as some people make it.\u201dMr. Kerry also rejected suggestions that the next American president would scrap the nuclear agreement. Many Republican politicians have denounced the agreement, including Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee. The two Democrats competing for their party\u2019s nomination, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, have expressed support for it.\u201cI just don\u2019t believe that a new president regardless \u2014 is going to suddenly say, \u2018Let\u2019s go have a war in the Middle East,\u2019 and give up the restraint on a nuclear weapon,\u201d Mr. Kerry said. \u201cI just don\u2019t think the advisers to that president or anybody are going to suggest that that makes sense.\u201dStill, the agreement has done little to ease the atmosphere of hostility and suspicion that has prevailed between Iran and the United States.The Iranians have since seized on other American actions they view as arrogant affronts, including a Supreme Court ruling last month that cleared the way for the use of impounded Iranian assets to compensate American victims of attacks attributed to Iran.The lawsuit, filed by Mr. Hekmati\u2019s lawyers in Washington, is seeking unspecified damages for Mr. Hekmati\u2019s four-and-a-half-year incarceration and torture in Tehran\u2019s Evin Prison. Mr. Hekmati has said that the charges under which Iran detained him were fabricated.\u201cOur intention, with the filing of this lawsuit, is to attempt to provide at least some measure of justice for Amir and his family,\u201d Mr. Hekmati\u2019s lawyer, Scott D. Gilbert, said in a statement.There was no immediate comment on the lawsuit from Iranian officials. But Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, has described any American court proceedings against Iran as a violation of international law.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Making of an Ignoramus", "Date": "2016-05-09", "News": "Supported byTruly, Donald Trump knows nothing. He is more ignorant about policy than you can possibly imagine, even when you take into account the fact that he is more ignorant than you can possibly imagine. But his ignorance isn\u2019t as unique as it may seem: In many ways, he\u2019s just doing a clumsy job of channeling nonsense widely popular in his party, and to some extent in the chattering classes more generally.The Trump solution would, among other things, deprive the world economy of its most crucial safe asset, U.S. debt, at a time when safe assets are already in short supply.Of course, we can be sure that Mr. Trump knows none of this, and nobody in his entourage is likely to tell him. But before we simply ridicule him \u2014 or, actually, at the same time that we\u2019re ridiculing him \u2014 let\u2019s ask where his bad ideas really come from.These numbers mean both that the burden of the debt is fairly small and that even complete repudiation of that debt would have only a minor impact on the government\u2019s cash flow.A lot of this debt hysteria was really about trying to bully us into cutting Social Security and Medicare, which is why so many self-proclaimed fiscal hawks were also eager to cut taxes on the rich. But Mr. Trump apparently wasn\u2019t in on that particular con, and takes the phony debt scare seriously. Sad!Still, even if he misunderstands the fiscal situation, how can he imagine that it would be O.K. for America to default? One answer is that he\u2019s extrapolating from his own business career, in which he has done very well by running up debts, then walking away from them.But it\u2019s also true that much of the Republican Party shares his insouciance about default. Remember, the party\u2019s congressional wing deliberately set about extracting concessions from President Obama, using the threat of gratuitous default via a refusal to raise the debt ceiling.Given that history, it\u2019s not too hard to understand why candidate Trump thinks not paying debts in full makes sense.None of this should be taken as an excuse for Mr. Trump. He really is frighteningly uninformed; worse, he doesn\u2019t appear to know what he doesn\u2019t know. The point, instead, is that his blithe lack of knowledge largely follows from the know-nothing attitudes of the party he now leads.Oh, and just for the record: No, it\u2019s not the same on the other side of the aisle. You may dislike Hillary Clinton, you may disagree sharply with her policies, but she and the people around her do know their facts. Nobody has a monopoly on wisdom, but in this election, one party has largely cornered the market in raw ignorance.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "France\u2019s Socialist Government Survives a Vote, but Remains Fractured", "Date": "2016-05-12", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 It was a bad day of the kind that has become distressingly common for President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.Anti-government demonstrators, tear gas and police sirens filled streets again in Paris and other French cities on Thursday, with protesters voicing their opposition to the centerpiece of Mr. Hollande\u2019s domestic agenda, legislation intended to make it easier for employers to hire \u2014 and fire \u2014 workers.Members of his own Socialist Party were planning openly to get rid of his government, as were members of the opposition. Less than a year out from the presidential election, analysts vied with each other to pronounce his political death sentence. If the polls conducted and cited by the French news media are to be believed, voters have long since given up on him and his soothing smile, which four years ago seemed to promise a new start for France.Mr. Hollande\u2019s smile, like that of the Cheshire cat, may soon be all that is left of him. His government survived a vote of no confidence in the National Assembly Thursday evening, two days after it resorted to a little-used power to force through the sharply contested labor law over opposition from some Socialists and others on the left. But with Mr. Hollande\u2019s support in the presidential race at 13 percent and unemployment still above 10 percent, his chances of re-election, or even of making it to the final round of voting, seem to most analysts to be vanishingly slim.The battle at this point in many ways has shifted from saving Mr. Hollande\u2019s job to resolving the deep ideological contradictions splitting the Socialists.Mr. Hollande, by all accounts an affable man with a penchant for sly humor, came into office in 2012 as a high-level party functionary with no particular ideological convictions. He ran on traditional Socialist policies, including a 75-percent top income tax rate on the rich. Yet upon taking office, he tacked toward the center and more market-friendly policies, urged on by reformers within his party who counseled him that he had to begin retrofitting France to the realities of global competition and the long-term unsustainability of a generous social welfare system.One of those reformers, his present economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, once described the 75 percent proposal as \u201cCuba without the sunshine,\u201d a remark that highlighted the depth of the split between the centrists and the traditional left, which continued to hew to the language and sometimes the policies of anticapitalist redistribution.Mr. Hollande\u2019s weakened condition has attracted predators not just on the left of his own party, but on the right as well. Mr. Macron, a former banker who is market-oriented by conviction, has started his own political movement, \u201cOn the Way,\u201d much to the irritation of his colleagues in the government. Yet the youthful Mr. Macron \u2014 he is only 38 \u2014 is way ahead of Mr. Hollande in recent presidential polls cited in the French news media, and only just behind a career mainstream right politician, Alain Jupp\u00e9, a former prime minister who is currently considered the favorite in the 2017 presidential vote.Mr. Macron has been mocked in the left-leaning press this week for implicitly comparing himself to Joan of Arc, riding in providentially to save France, at a well-attended speech in Orl\u00e9ans on Sunday.The labor law that has provoked months of protests here was Mr. Hollande\u2019s 11th hour bid to bring down unemployment. Much weakened from its original form after months of protests, it gives employers more flexibility negotiating hours and wages with workers. The law takes some of that power away from unions \u2014 which, except for some of the more moderate ones, are generally enraged by the reform law \u2014 and it defines more precisely when and how companies can lay off workers, a process that is currently time consuming and expensive.The fury against Mr. Hollande in his own party for those efforts \u2014 over 50 Socialist members of Parliament tried and failed to file their own motion of no confidence on Wednesday \u2014 has left all but destroyed the Socialists, a party already badly weakened and divided.\u201cThe left has ceased to exist, because it doesn\u2019t represent anything,\u201d said G\u00e9rard Grunberg, a professor at the Sciences Po political science institute. \u201cThere is not one left now, there are a number of lefts,\u201d said Mr. Grunberg. \u201cThe party of Mitterrand,\u201d he said, referring to Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, the nimble politician who led the Socialists back into power in 1981 after years in the wilderness, \u201cno longer exists.\u201dThe immediate result was \u201cthe madness of yesterday,\u201d as Mr. Grunberg put it \u2014 Socialists on the party\u2019s far left attempting to eject a Socialist prime minister. \u201cThat was something unbelievable,\u201d Mr. Grunberg said. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen that before. They were voting to overthrow their own government.\u201d\u201cIt was a very firm warning sent to the government and that is coming from the whole left,\u201d Christian Paul, one of the Socialist rebels, who represents the old region of Mr. Mitterrand, who died in 1996, told French television Thursday. \u201cThe left chose Hollande, and it has been disappointed,\u201d Mr. Paul said.\u201cThis is a law of deregulation,\u201d Mr. Paul said. \u201cThe French will be less protected, without making it easier for companies to hire.\u201dMany mainstream economists disagree with Mr. Paul. They say that with all its worker protections, France has effectively enshrined permanent high unemployment. France has made \u201cthe choice\u201d of having unemployment, Jean Tirole, a Noble Prize-winning economist, said in an interview with Le Monde this week, adding that the country has \u201cchosen institutions that create unemployment.\u201dTo the deafening sound of police sirens in the streets outside the Parliament building Thursday, Mr. Valls, the prime minister and a pugnacious boxer, defended the labor law. He mocked a Communist deputy who has been loud in opposition, saying, \u201cYou\u2019ve been wrong for 100 years.\u201d And he pleaded with the legislators, and the protesters outside, to abandon the assumption of a permanent war between capital and labor.\u201cHow much longer are we going to oppose employers and workers?\u201d Mr. Valls asked. The government merely \u201cwants to allow into the job market, those who are currently excluded. We\u2019ve got to allow our companies to create more jobs.\u201dThe protests, which gathered about 55,000, people on Thursday, according to the Interior Ministry, are scheduled to continue next week.Aurelien Breeden contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Delusions of Competence", "Date": "2016-05-27", "News": "Supported byThis is pretty remarkable given the incoherence and wild irresponsibility of Mr. Trump\u2019s policy pronouncements. Granted, most voters probably don\u2019t know anything about that, in part thanks to substance-free news coverage. But if voters don\u2019t know anything about Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, why their favorable impression of his economic management skills?The answer, I suspect, is that voters see Mr. Trump as a hugely successful businessman, and they believe that business success translates into economic expertise. They are, however, probably wrong about the first, and definitely wrong about the second: Even genuinely brilliant businesspeople are often clueless about economic policy.But leave questions about whether Mr. Trump is the business genius he claims to be on one side. Does business success carry with it the knowledge and instincts needed to make good economic policy? No, it doesn\u2019t.True, the historical record isn\u2019t much of a guide, since only one modern president had a previous successful career in business. And maybe Herbert Hoover was an outlier.But while we haven\u2019t had many business leaders in the White House, we do know what kind of advice prominent businessmen give on economic policy. And it\u2019s often startlingly bad, for two reasons. One is that wealthy, powerful people sometimes don\u2019t know what they don\u2019t know \u2014 and who\u2019s going to tell them? The other is that a country is nothing like a corporation, and running a national economy is nothing like running a business.The truth is that wage cuts are the last thing America needs right now: We sell most of what we produce to ourselves, and wage cuts would hurt domestic sales by reducing purchasing power and increasing the burden of private-sector debt. Lower wages probably wouldn\u2019t even help the fraction of the U.S. economy that competes internationally, since they would normally lead to a stronger dollar, negating any competitive advantage.The point, however, is that these feedback effects from wage cuts aren\u2019t the sort of things even very smart business leaders need to take into account to run their companies. Businesses sell stuff to other people; they don\u2019t need to worry about the effect of their cost-cutting measures on demand for their products. Managing national economic policy, on the other hand, is all about the feedback.I\u2019m not saying that business success is inherently disqualifying when it comes to policy making. A tycoon who has enough humility to realize that he doesn\u2019t already know all the answers, and is willing to listen to other people even when they contradict him, could do fine as an economic manager. But does this describe anyone currently running for president?The truth is that the idea that Donald Trump, of all people, knows how to run the U.S. economy is ludicrous. But will voters ever recognize that truth?Advertisement"}

We want to attack like martial arts, using the force of our opponent. All at the same time!\u201dIn short order, social media was festooned with multilingual, pro-Panama hashtags, often accompanied by photographs of beaches, sunsets, mountains and happy, carefree people:#PanamaParadise.#ILovePanama.#WeArePanama.#WeAreNotPapers.#PanamaIsMoreThanPapers.\u201cThey made the normal, regular Panama come alive and say, \u2018What\u2019s going on? I\u2019m not a piece of paper. I\u2019m not the guy laundering money in London, in France, in Japan. I\u2019m not that,\u2019\u201d said Antonio Alfaro, the president of Panama\u2019s Chamber of Tourism, an industry association. \u201cThey have brought us together.\u201dSome Panamanians have viewed the leak and the resulting international news coverage as an attack on Panamanian sovereignty, or even as a plot by a foreign competitor to wrest banking business from Panama.Many have bridled at the catchy nickname for the scandal \u2014 the Panama Papers \u2014 saying it unfairly shamed an entire nation. They floated alternatives, like the uncatchy \u201cMossack Fonseca Papers.\u201dThe reaction has been widespread, crossing all socioeconomic lines.\u201cMost of the people who have been involved in these papers are foreigners, not Panamanians, so Panama is really the victim of this,\u201d said Fernando Arambur\u00fa Porras, a management consultant and former economics and finance minister of Panama. The national mood \u201cis a little beaten up,\u201d he said.While the reaction has flowed from a reservoir of national pride, some Panamanian commentators said it reflects a certain national fragility \u2014 revealing, perhaps, a lack of self-confidence about the country\u2019s place in the world.Miguel Antonio Bernal, a constitutional lawyer and self-described \u201cagitator of conscience,\u201d said that Panama was still in effect trying to find its footing as an independent democracy after years of living under military dictatorships and within the American sphere of influence during the United States stewardship of the canal, which ended in 1999.\u201cAnd now what are we?\u201d he asked, shrugging. He likened the country to an adolescent. \u201cWe are a 15-year-old little country in the world, but we don\u2019t know what we are. In the last 30 to 40 years we lost our soul. We\u2019re looking for our soul, our identity, what it means to be Panamanian.\u201dWith a stable, fast-growing economy that depends on a well-developed services sector, the country has become a regional trade hub and a popular place for foreign real estate investment. But it also suffers some of the worst income disparity in Latin America, with high rates of poverty among its nearly four million people, particularly in rural areas.The country has closely aligned its identity with the Panama Canal, which for years has been a kind of sacred cow here, immune from criticism. But even that institution has not been an unqualified source of pride for the nation.An ambitious project to expand the canal has run way over budget \u2014 costing about $5.3 billion \u2014 and its opening, now scheduled for June 26, has been delayed for nearly two years. Some Panamanians, albeit quietly, say they have been concerned about damage to the country\u2019s international reputation should the canal\u2019s opening be delayed further.But while Panamanians generally celebrate and embrace their canal, the same cannot be said for their relationship with the robust offshore banking industry. After the Mossack Fonseca leak, many were quick to distance themselves from the lawyers and bankers involved in that industry, and from the politicians who protect it.\u201cThe immense majority of the people of Panama are honest, hard-working people,\u201d Luis Gonz\u00e1lez Mar\u00edn, a top labor union official, said. \u201cWhen there\u2019s a fight between elephants, the thing that suffers is the grass.\u201d\u201cIt made all the Panamanians look bad,\u201d Roger Villarreal, a hotel employee in Panama City\u2019s banking district, said of the scandal. He, too, has participated in the pro-Panama social media campaign, unleashing several tweets pegged with the hashtag #PanamaEsMasQuePapeles, or #PanamaIsMoreThanPapers.He said Twitter had allowed Panamanians to express their sense of liberation after years of living under the thumb of dictators and, to an extent, the United States.\u201cYou know, when you have a weight lifted off of you?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou have the liberty of expressing yourself. You feel capable of defending what\u2019s yours.\u201dAccording to a recent national poll by the Panamanian research firm Dichter & Neira, 91 percent of respondents believed that the Panama Papers affair had \u201cgreatly\u201d affected the country\u2019s image, and 81 percent believed that it would affect the nation\u2019s economy. (The nationwide poll was conducted in face-to-face interviews with 1,200 adults at their homes and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.9 percentage points.)But some Panamanians see the leak and the resulting fallout as a potential watershed for the country, a test of its emotional constitution and its desire to earn the world\u2019s respect.\u201cWhat we need at this time is not crazy patriotism,\u201d said Mr. Bernal, who habitually wears a Panamanian flag pin on his jacket lapel.\u201cWe need to see the crisis as an opportunity to be better: to cure what is necessary inside Panama first, and then to be respected around the world.\u201dHe likened the Panama Papers crisis to a wave: The country catches it, like a surfer, or is crushed. \u201cWe need to surf to the top of the wave to recover the country,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good moment to think and reflect and act.\u201dIndeed, some tourism officials have been trying to figure out how to flip the negative attention to the country\u2019s advantage.Mr. Alfaro, of the Chamber of Tourism, said that a halt to government tourism advertising more than a year ago and delays in the construction of a new convention center have impeded the growth of the sector.But in recent weeks, the country has received more international publicity than it ever dreamed of \u2014 just not the kind it dreamed of, perhaps.Mr. Alfaro also reached for a surfing metaphor: Water is apparently never far from mind in a country squeezed between the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean.\u201cIf we can do it fast enough, then we can probably take a ride on the wave of everybody knowing where Panama is,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to ride that wave in, but we have to do it very carefully.\u201dThe tourism-promotion engines in his mind had started to turn.\u201cThey say we are a fiscal or financial paradise,\u201d he said, a pitch taking shape. \u201cBut we are a tourism paradise!

The country is starved to see its two major parties do big hard things together again. And getting a glimpse \u2014 even just a pretend one \u2014 of Obama and Boehner teaming up reminds you what\u2019s been lost.I think what\u2019s propelling Donald Trump\u2019s success more than anything is the feeling of many Americans that our politics are totally stuck. There is an overwhelming sense of \u201cstuckness\u201d \u2014 and the fantasy that Trump plays to, and plays up, is that he can pull the sword from the stone and do deals. No one was more responsible for this \u201cstuckness,\u201d though, than today\u2019s Republican Party. When Mitch McConnell, the G.O.P. leader in the Senate, said in October 2010 that \u201cthe single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president,\u201d he described the Republicans\u2019 dominant strategy since 2008. The party stopped thinking seriously about market-based alternatives. Into that emptiness entered Trump, like an invasive species.This was a really bad time for us to be stuck. I\u2019m just finishing writing a new book, which is partly about the inflection point we hit around 2007. In 2007, Apple came out with the iPhone, beginning the smartphone/apps revolution; in late 2006 Facebook opened its doors to anyone, not just college and high school students, and took off like a rocket; Google came out with the Android operating system in 2007; Hadoop launched in 2007, helping create the storage/processing power for the big data revolution; Github, launched in 2007, scaling open-source software; Twitter was spun off as its own separate platform in 2007. Amazon came out with the Kindle in 2007. Airbnb started in 2007.That was the real grand bargain we needed. Instead, we had the 2008 economic meltdown, which set off more polarization, and way too much gridlock, given how much rethinking, reimagining and retooling we needed to do. In this vortex a lot of the public got unmoored and disoriented, opening the way for populists with simple answers. Get rid of immigrants, end trade with China or eliminate big banks and all will be fine. It\u2019s nonsense.But if you\u2019re for these things only as they now exist, you\u2019re also wrong. Each one needs retooling. It\u2019s clear: Free trade with China has hurt more people than originally thought. It\u2019s clear: Low-skilled illegal immigration has hurt more American workers than we\u2019ve fully understood. (And more high-skilled immigration in a knowledge age would enhance our economy more than most people understand.) It\u2019s clear: Social Security, Medicare and Obamacare all need fixes to remain sustainable. It\u2019s clear: Capitalism driven more by machines and robots poses new challenges for both white-collar and blue-collar workers.Every one of these challenges can be met if we put our heads and hands together. For that to happen, though, this version of the Republican Party had to be destroyed, so a thinking center-right party can emerge. If that is what Trump has done, he\u2019s done the Lord\u2019s work. We also need Democrats to be a center-left party, though, and not let Bernie Sanders pull them to the far left. If both happen, maybe something good can actually emerge from this crazy election.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saudi Minister Has Task of Easing Dependence on Oil", "Date": "2016-05-08", "News": "Supported byHOUSTON \u2014 He was known as the \u201cmaestro,\u201d the man whose every word was dissected by oil traders and moved markets. For two decades, Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, was the architect of Saudi and OPEC cartel policies, including the one that has now sent the price of oil into a deep collapse.Mr. Naimi\u2019s successor, Khalid al-Falih, is a big supporter of the king\u2019s agenda and now will be charged with the complicated task of sharply cutting the state\u2019s persistent dependence on oil.While the symbolism of the moves was clear, energy experts say they expect no quick or easy change in policy. Sharp departures in economic policy have been the exception rather than the rule for the conservative kingdom over many decades. And Mr. Falih wasted little time in trying to calm markets amid fears that already volatile oil prices could quickly become even more volatile.\u201cSaudi Arabia will maintain its stable petroleum policies,\u201d he said in a statement issued on Sunday. \u201cWe remain committed to maintaining our role in international energy markets and strengthening our position as the world\u2019s most reliable supplier of energy.\u201dInside Saudi Arabia, there is plenty of skepticism that the change at the highest level of the government will be sufficient to drive reforms promised by King Salman and engineered by his powerful son, Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, to reduce the dependence of the unsteady statist economy on the future of oil, which now appears increasingly unreliable.Mr. Naimi\u2019s ouster was part of a shake-up announced on Saturday aimed at restructuring the Saudi government to diversify the economy and improve services for Saudi citizens.At the core of the plan released last month, in which Mr. Falih will now play a major role, is the transformation of the state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco into an industrial conglomerate.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.Prince Mohammed has said that shares of the company will be sold publicly for the first time in its history and that the money will be put into a sovereign wealth fund that will be invested at home and abroad to supplement government revenues.Saudi Aramco has long been the most effective institution in Saudi Arabia, but it has been intensely private about its finances and how it estimates the kingdom\u2019s oil reserves.Opening up the company would subject it to new scrutiny that could change its culture in unpredictable ways, analysts say. And routing its worth into investments merely shifts the focus from one type of revenue \u2014 from oil \u2014 to others that are unpredictable and do nothing to increase the productivity of Saudi workers.Mr. Falih is a Texas A&M graduate in mechanical engineering who worked his way up the ranks of Saudi Aramco, eventually becoming its chief executive. He is viewed by international oil executives and analysts as an agent of change but still a technocrat who has long been tied to the old Saudi Aramco culture.Oil executives and analysts described Mr. Falih as one of the most sophisticated and cosmopolitan officials in the world of oil, already widely recognized as a leader among the ministers of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, who together control a third of the world\u2019s oil production.They expect him to encourage a gradual rise in global oil prices while he moves the kingdom away from wasteful domestic energy consumption, a change that will allow the Saudis to increase oil exports in the years to come. He will take over a newly reorganized ministry that will now hold sway over all facets of energy and industry, not just oil.\u201cKhalid is a very effective executive with a very sophisticated understanding of policy,\u201d said Daniel Yergin, an energy historian and vice chairman of the global consulting firm IHS.\u201cIt\u2019s a natural transition,\u201d Mr. Yergin said. \u201cNow, there is a big new agenda ahead for Saudi Arabia, and Saudi Aramco is central to it. You need somebody who can implement and execute.\u201dMr. Falih\u2019s first concern will be managing OPEC, which is deeply divided between members like Venezuela and Algeria that want to cut production to raise prices and the wealthier Persian Gulf kingdoms that are content to let the price remain low for a while.Low prices are forcing higher-cost producers, like the companies drilling in the American shale fields, Canadian oil sands and Brazilian and West African deepwater fields, to give up investing in expensive projects.While King Salman will make the final decisions, Mr. Falih could use his influence to affect current policy. But his influence can go only so far.The oil market has bounced around in recent days. Prices have been pulled down by persistent reports of record inventories in the United States and elsewhere, and pushed up by reports of rapid production declines in the United States, China, Mexico and now Canada, as fires swirl near the oil sands fields in Alberta.The wild cards in the market are numerous, including how much political instability in Libya, Iraq, Venezuela and Nigeria will curb their oil production.Scores of American companies have gone bankrupt, and cuts in exploration and production budgets have thrown roughly 120,000 employees out of work.Those efforts were stymied by Prince Mohammed, who refused to go along with a freeze unless Iran went along. But Iran, which has sworn to produce several hundred thousand more barrels of oil a day, now that it has been relieved of sanctions over its nuclear program, would not cooperate.Mr. Falih can be expected to stay close to Prince Mohammed\u2019s line. Analysts say this is not likely to change anytime soon, as long as tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran remain high, particularly over conflicts in Syria and Yemen.But Middle East oil executives said a gradual shift in Saudi and OPEC policies might happen now that oil production in many countries was falling and prices had firmed somewhat in recent weeks.They said Mr. Falih might conclude that prolonged low prices would cause a collapse in exploration investments that could set off a sudden, uncontrollable price increase. Such turbulence would not only jeopardize the world economy, but also spur a renewed drilling frenzy in the United States and other countries, which would only lead to another price collapse.\u201cKhalid al-Falih is likely to recognize the dangers of having a very low oil price for a long period,\u201d said Badr Jafar, president of Crescent Petroleum, an oil and gas company based in the United Arab Emirates. \u201cHe may shift the policy to ensure a soft landing on price recovery.\u201dClifford Krauss reported from Houston and Ben Hubbard from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Through the Looking Glass With Ben Rhodes", "Date": "2016-05-13", "News": "Supported byNotebookMy interest in Ben Rhodes began with a photograph I saw from Senator Barack Obama\u2019s insurgent campaign for president in 2008. The photograph showed a group of Obama\u2019s young speechwriters celebrating a victory. In the shallow background was a young writer, sitting at a table, with a dark, wool ski cap pulled down low, nearly over his eyes.The young writer\u2019s name, I learned, was Ben Rhodes. Following the practice I have pursued for the past 25 years, I created a new file on my laptop and labeled it \u201cRhodes.\u201d Every decent journalist I know keeps dozens of files like that on subjects that interest them. We move them around on our screens and tuck them away into other files. Sometimes we deposit them in the trash. Every few months or so, I would scroll through the clips in the file to see if they added up to something larger that I wanted to write about. For several years, the answer was no. So it sat there.My interest heightened during the debates over the Iran nuclear deal, which seemed to highlight the increasingly sophisticated use of digital tools by powerful interests \u2014 including the White House \u2014 to achieve their policy aims, a practice that both amazed and troubled me. The campaign to sell the deal, it seemed to me, had been constructed by someone very smart, someone with a real mastery of an art that I recognized immediately, because I had built my entire career on it and had also taught it for 10 years to graduate students at N.Y.U. and Columbia University: narrative. Through a cascade of tweets, quotes and other social-media posts, a story was being told, with the purpose of motivating people to feel a certain way, in order to achieve a specific foreign-policy aim. The other side was doing the exact same thing, of course, but they weren\u2019t very good at it \u2014 and they weren\u2019t in the White House. When I started asking some of my colleagues for the name of the master storyteller whose narratives I was watching unfold, only one name came back at me: Ben Rhodes.So in my spare time, I began thinking harder about Rhodes and what he actually did, with the aim of writing a long magazine story about him.After the dust-up over the Iran deal was safely over \u2014 I thought \u2014 I pitched my editors at The New York Times Magazine on a profile of Ben Rhodes. They agreed to it. I then asked Rhodes in December of last year if he would be willing to cooperate for the story. He almost immediately said yes. And that is where the story gets complicated \u2014 at least for the people who have written, blogged and tweeted about it over the past week.Rhodes knew who I was. How do I know that? Because the White House is equipped with Google. And because Rhodes told me so himself. He earned a Master of Fine Arts degree at N.Y.U., where I taught, and he appreciates longform narrative journalism, which is what I do. He is a regular reader of the magazines \u2014 like Harper\u2019s, The New Yorker and The Atlantic \u2014 in which I have published dozens of deeply reported stories over the past 20 years. We met a few times, and when I told him what I wanted to write, and why, he understood immediately why it was important and why I wanted to do it. He decided to help me. During the course of my reporting, he opened every door I asked him to open (except for one question I wanted to ask the president). He was always incredibly direct and candid with me. In more than a dozen hours of taped conversation, he went off the record, for very brief periods, only twice.Rhodes wasn\u2019t afraid of the fact that I strongly disagreed with him on specific matters of policy \u2014 like the war in Syria. He welcomed disagreement and encouraged it. He vociferously supported the president\u2019s policies on every single issue we spoke about \u2014 and made some excellent points, some of which changed my mind about things that I thought I felt clearly about. It turned out that Rhodes had been instrumental in reopening diplomatic relations with Cuba and Myanmar. None of the diplomats he worked with seemed to have a single bad word to say about him.When a White House adviser \u2014 not Rhodes \u2014 mentioned a \u201cwar room\u201d for selling the Iran deal, a phrase that disturbed me, I went back to Rhodes and asked what it was and who ran it. He arranged for me to interview anyone I wanted. They were all candid and factual. They explained to me how they had used state-of-the-art tools and a sophisticated understanding of the way information moves in the social-media age to sell a deal that they clearly believed to be in the United States\u2019 national interest.But why were any of them talking to me? I soon surmised that Rhodes\u2019s motivation in allowing me to peek behind the curtain came from a disquiet he felt at the possibility, or the likelihood, that the machinery he managed so brilliantly would soon be in the hands of his successors, who might use it to do things that he thought could be quite dangerous \u2014 like goading the United States into another pointless, bloody foreign war. Rhodes readily admitted to me that the work he does is a potentially dangerous distortion of democracy, but he also felt that it had become a necessary evil, caused by the fracturing of the 20th-century mass audience and the decline of the American press. He expressed a deep personal hopelessness about the possibility of open, rational public debate in a brutally partisan climate. But didn\u2019t the country deserve better? I kept asking him. Over time, our conversations around this point evolved, without either of us directly mentioning it, into a kind of gentleman\u2019s bet: My article would go as hard as I could at the truth as I saw it, The Times would publish it, and one of us would be proved right while the other would be proved wrong.Before I address some of the criticisms of the article, I would like to state two very basic things for the record:1. I stand behind every single word I wrote. This newspaper does, too. The New York Times has looked closely at every complaint leveled against the piece and has found absolutely nothing to correct. If anything is found to merit a correction, it will certainly be corrected.2. I think Ben Rhodes is the bravest person I\u2019ve ever met in Washington. If it sounds weird to say that Rhodes is both a manipulative spin-doctor and a deeply honest, creative person who believes strongly in the policies he spins for, well, that is still the truth.Now, to some of the specific accusations:Let\u2019s consider the Slate article first. It was, like a lot of Slate articles, intentionally provocative. It unfolds as an exercise in rational choice superpower-client state theory. It was designed to be provocative on the way to making a serious point.Near the top of the article I state: \u201cFrom a U.S. point of view, at least, there is little reason to doubt the analysis that a nuclear Iran with a few dozen bombs can be contained at relatively limited cost using the same strategies that successfully constrained an aggressive Soviet Empire armed with nearly 45,000 nuclear warheads at the height of the Cold War.\u201dThe rest of the article proceeds to explain exactly why, \u201cfrom the standpoint of international relations theory, the scariest thing about recent Israeli rhetoric is that an attack on Iran lines up quite well with Israel\u2019s rational interests as a superpower client.\u201dMy analysis of how Israel might see its own rational self-interest was apparently shared by no less distinguished a neocon than President Obama. As Leon Panetta noted in my magazine article, perhaps his main job as secretary of defense was to restrain Israel from bombing Iran \u2014 by convincing them that America would do it for them, if Iran actually threatened to build a bomb.I explained to Smith what I considered to be an important difference between nuclear know-how and infrastructure, one that I thought was being blurred by the rhetoric of both sides in the Iran deal debate. Thanks to Coster-Mullen, I told him, I had the plans for a nuclear bomb in my desk drawer at home \u2014 but I lacked the tens of billions of dollars necessary to proliferate. I thought that Smith\u2019s article was fair to what I wrote, so I agreed to be on his panel.\u201cUnlike many of you, I\u2019m a writer. I\u2019m a journalist. I\u2019m not involved in partisan politics. I\u2019ve generally considered myself to be a liberal Democrat. These principles [of bipartisanship and consensus] historically are noncontroversial ones. They\u2019ve been embraced by every American administration since World War II. To find them being undone in this very rapid way, given the potential consequences of unchecked nuclear proliferation \u2014 not just in the region but also in Asia \u2014 is and should be a terrifying thing for Americans to contemplate, whatever their feelings about this president or Republicans or Democrats. As someone who has reported in and around questions related to nuclear programs and gray market economies, I am startled by the lack of attention and clarity that is obvious in the way these stories are being reported.\u201dFinally, I would like to turn to the protestations of two journalists, Jeffrey Goldberg and Laura Rozen, who felt wounded by a very brief passage in my article, in which they were named as people who \u201chelped retail\u201d the administration\u2019s talking points.The reason I chose to cite Rozen and Goldberg as important conduits for the administration\u2019s foreign policy message is based on two kinds of evidence. One: This very idea was suggested to me in taped interviews with White House staff members who dealt with these journalists; in interviews with other journalists; and in interviews with other people who read their work. Two: My own reading of both Rozen and Goldberg for years had suggested to me that this was a fair thing to say about their work. It seemed at least worth mentioning the names of some journalists in a 9,500-word article about a writer who tells stories to the public, using journalists as one of his instruments. If I didn\u2019t name any of those journalists, readers might fairly conclude that Rhodes was in fact terrible at his job \u2014 or that journalists, especially those who live in Washington, belong to a special category of person who must never be criticized, even gently.And this is why, I think, my story ignited such a firestorm. It was a portrait of an honest, dedicated person with a great deal of power in Washington who happens to be deeply critical of the press \u2014 not out of cynicism or anger, but out of regret over the seemingly vanishing possibilities of free and open discourse. I did not pry this critique out of Rhodes, nor did I introduce him to it. He has far more familiarity with the 21st-century news cycle than I do. It has been fascinating for me to watch my story, which was largely read on its own terms outside of Washington and even by the White House itself, go through the looking glass of social media. The story itself has vanished, replaced by a digital mash-up of slurs and invective, supported by stray phrases that have been mechanically tweezered from different texts. The issues that Rhodes raises in my profile \u2014 about the reshaping of the media, the way American foreign policy has shifted, the way the world works now \u2014 none of these things are being discussed, either. Somehow, for a small group of people with very loud megaphones, the point right now seems to be me \u2014 or rather, a digital pi\u00f1ata they have slapped my name on. It seems fair to say that Rhodes won our bet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton Warns Against Treating Donald Trump as \u2018Normal\u2019 Candidate", "Date": "2016-05-22", "News": "Supported byContinuing to treat a victory over Senator Bernie Sanders as a fait accompli, Hillary Clinton on Sunday questioned Donald J. Trump\u2019s business record and assailed his ideas, warning that the coming weeks represented a critical period in which, if left unchallenged, Mr. Trump could \u201cnormalize himself\u201d as he seeks to broaden his support.But Mr. Sanders pointed to polls showing Mrs. Clinton with dangerously high percentages of people who have unfavorable views of her and asked whether a choice between her and Mr. Trump in the fall would force voters to pick the \u201clesser of two evils.\u201dEven as she contends with Mr. Sanders\u2019s unflagging critique from the left, Mrs. Clinton said it was vital for her to pivot to confront Mr. Trump now, lest he successfully repackage himself for wider consumption, rather than appealing to the Republican primary electorate alone.\u201cI do not want Americans and, you know, good-thinking Republicans, as well as Democrats and independents, to start to believe that this is a normal candidacy,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\u201cI know he has a plurality of Republicans who have voted for him,\u201d she added. \u201cBut I think in the course of this campaign, we are going to demonstrate he has no ideas. There\u2019s no evidence he has any ideas about making America great, as he advertises. He seems to be particularly focused on making himself appear great. And as we go through this campaign, we\u2019re going to be demonstrating the hollowness of his rhetoric.\u201d\u201cBusinesspeople, especially successful businesspeople, who are really successful \u2014 as opposed to pretend successful \u2014 I think, have a lot to offer,\u201d said Mrs. Clinton, whose campaign has begun taunting Mr. Trump with a #PoorDonald hashtag on Twitter, suggesting that he is not nearly as wealthy as he claims. Mr. Trump has cited an audit by the Internal Revenue Service as his reason for keeping his tax returns private.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get below the hype,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cI think we\u2019re beginning to find out, but I don\u2019t think we know enough, and that\u2019s why he should release his tax returns.\u201dIn choosing a running mate, Mrs. Clinton said she would seek, above all, someone prepared to be president and \u201csomeone you can work with \u2014 someone you believe will be a good partner.\u201dMr. Sanders, however, vowed on Sunday to fight all the way to the Democratic convention in July, pointing to polls that indicated he would fare better against Mr. Trump than Mrs. Clinton would. In several television interviews, he complained that Democratic superdelegates had thrown their support to Mrs. Clinton before he had even entered the race.\u201cI ask those superdelegates to take a look at which candidate is the stronger to defeat Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Sanders said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to see the American people voting for the lesser of two evils.\u201dWhen the host George Stephanopoulos followed up by asking if he saw Mrs. Clinton as \u201cthe lesser of two evils,\u201d Mr. Sanders backed away slightly. \u201cWell, if you look at \u2014 no, I wouldn\u2019t describe it, but that\u2019s what the American people are saying,\u201d he said, citing her unfavorable ratings.Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton will be campaigning hard in California, which holds its primary on June 7.In Vista, Calif., on Sunday, Mr. Sanders told a cheering crowd that he was the strongest Democratic candidate to defeat Mr. Trump and that he hoped to have 50 percent of the total pledged delegates by the end of voting. He also stressed that his campaign had more \u201centhusiasm\u201d and \u201cenergy\u201d than his rival\u2019s.\u201cOur vision of social justice, of economic justice, of racial justice and of environmental justice \u2014 our vision is the future of this country,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cAnd I hope the leadership of the Democratic Party understands it must be the vision of the Democratic Party.\u201dMrs. Clinton drew criticism from some Democrats and Republicans recently after telling voters she would put her husband, former President Bill Clinton, \u201cin charge of revitalizing the economy\u201d and job creation. On Sunday, she clarified her intentions, saying his role would be advisory, not ministerial.\u201cI am going to ask my husband, who has a great track record in creating jobs, putting people back to work, revitalizing communities, to be in an advisory role working with me, working with our cabinet, to try to figure out what we can do\u201d in particularly hard-hit areas, Mrs. Clinton said on NBC. \u201cYou know, every first lady has taken on special projects.\u201dYamiche Alcindor contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Remembrance of Booms Past", "Date": "2016-05-23", "News": "Supported byIf Hillary Clinton wins in November, Bill Clinton will occupy a doubly unique role in U.S. political history \u2014 not just as the first First Husband, but also as the first First Spouse who used to be president. Obviously he won\u2019t spend his time baking cookies. So what will he do?But never mind. What I want to do right now is talk about the lessons the Clinton I boom actually holds for a potential Clinton II administration.But why was the Clinton economy so good? It wasn\u2019t because Mr. Clinton had a magic touch, although he did do a good job of responding to crises. Mostly, he had the good luck to hold office when good things were happening for reasons unrelated to politics.Oh, and yes, there was a technology bubble at the end of the decade, but that was a fairly minor part of the overall story \u2014 and because there wasn\u2019t a big rise in private debt, the damage done when the tech bubble burst was much less than the wreckage left behind by the Bush-era housing bubble.But back to the boom: What was Mr. Clinton\u2019s role? Actually, it was fairly limited, since he didn\u2019t cause the technology takeoff. On the other hand, his policies obviously didn\u2019t get in the way of prosperity.The other big lesson from the Clinton I boom is that while there are many ways policy makers can and should try to raise wages, the single most important thing policy can do to help workers is aim for full employment.Unfortunately, we can\u2019t count on another spontaneous surge in technology-driven private investment to drive job creation. But some kinds of private investment might grow rapidly if we take long-overdue steps to address climate change.And in any case, not all productive investment is private. We desperately need to repair and upgrade our infrastructure; meanwhile, the federal government can borrow money incredibly cheaply. So there\u2019s an overwhelming case for a surge in public investment \u2013 and one side benefit of such a surge would be full employment, which would help produce another era of rising wages.So, will Bill Clinton play an important role if Mrs. Clinton wins? I have no idea, and don\u2019t much care. But it will be important to remember what went right and why on Bill\u2019s watch.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton Shapes Potential New Role for Bill Clinton", "Date": "2016-05-16", "News": "Supported byIn an election year when Bill Clinton\u2019s policies and personal indiscretions have faced intense scrutiny, Hillary Clinton is beginning to shape the role her husband would play in her administration, zeroing in on economic growth and job creation as crucial missions for the former president.She has not provided details about how a former president would fit into a policy-making role in his wife\u2019s administration, a position never before seen in American politics. Asked on Monday whether Mr. Clinton would hold a cabinet position, Mrs. Clinton shook her head and said, \u201cNo.\u201dAides said Mr. Clinton\u2019s role would be narrowly defined to focus on hard-hit areas of the country, such as the Rust Belt, and they rejected any implication that Mrs. Clinton would outsource a central part of her administration to her spouse.But even a passing promise that Mr. Clinton would be put in charge of a significant part of a president\u2019s portfolio raised questions about how such an arrangement would work in a White House that has long relied on an appointed Treasury secretary and National Economic Council.\u201cThere is a practical puzzle of how a role like this would jibe with the existing cabinet members whose job is to work on the economy,\u201d said Austan D. Goolsbee, an economic adviser to President Obama and a professor at the University of Chicago.The declaration about Mr. Clinton\u2019s potential place in a Hillary Clinton administration comes as her campaign is preparing to battle the likely Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump, and widening its efforts to win the support of white working-class voters. Those voters hold generally favorable opinions of Mr. Clinton, but view her with more skepticism.And Mr. Clinton\u2019s record \u2014 a balanced budget, the creation of 22.7 million jobs and 7.7 million people lifted out of poverty \u2014 is in many ways simpler for Mrs. Clinton to pitch than Mr. Obama\u2019s economic record, when economic growth has disproportionately benefited the wealthiest Americans.\u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s statement that if elected president she\u2019d put Bill Clinton \u2018in charge of revitalizing the economy \u2026 because, you know, he knows how to do it\u2019 suggests she\u2019s no longer touting the successes of the Obama economy, or even linking herself to it,\u201d said Robert B. Reich, a secretary of labor during the Clinton administration who endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in the Democratic primary.But for all the benefits of relying on Mr. Clinton, and touting the economic prosperity he oversaw, the strategy could open Mrs. Clinton up to further attacks by Mr. Trump, who has outspokenly criticized Mr. Clinton\u2019s personal indiscretions.Mr. Trump, who has campaigned as an economic populist, has also hit Mrs. Clinton over her husband\u2019s trade policies, including the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Mr. Clinton signed into law in 1993 and which many voters believe hurt American workers.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s embrace of her husband\u2019s economic legacy comes after she has spent much of the past year grappling with a challenge from Mr. Sanders and the liberal wing of the Democratic Party. With economic inequality emerging as a main concern among Democratic voters, she has sought to distance herself from the Wall Street deregulation and trade policies associated with the 1990s.\u201cTo what extent does Bill Clinton\u2019s mixed policy agenda map out to the current campaign? That\u2019s the challenge,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and a former economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.Mrs. Clinton often says she is not running for her husband\u2019s third term, but she has also leaned heavily on his economic record.\u201cJobs, jobs, jobs,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said on \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert\u201d last month, when asked what Mr. Clinton would do in the White House. \u201cNobody did it better, created more jobs, helped incomes rise. I want every bit of advice he can give me about how we do the same going forward.\u201dNick Merrill, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, said that the central focus of her campaign has been increasing wages and creating good jobs, and that she would not outsource that effort.\u201cAs she has repeatedly said throughout this campaign, Secretary Clinton is interested in having President Clinton focus on places that have experienced substantial job loss and economic dislocation, like coal country and some inner-cities,\u201d Mr. Merrill said, adding that \u201cshe has put forward an ambitious agenda for serving economically distressed communities\u201d and \u201clooks forward to having President Clinton be a part of these efforts.\u201dWhile Mrs. Clinton has devoted much of her time in the Democratic primary to speaking out against the impact caused by parts of the 1994 crime bill and a 1996 overhaul of the welfare system that cut federal assistance to the poor by nearly $55 billion over six years, she can now more safely embrace the Bill Clinton years, Democrats said.\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen for decades is that the broader electorate thinks the 1990s went pretty damn well,\u201d said Matt Bennett, a former aide to Mr. Clinton and senior vice president for public affairs at Third Way, a centrist think tank. \u201cDid they love every single thing? Of course not.\u201dIf Mrs. Clinton leans on her husband for economic advice, the former president may need to update his approach.To address the growing income inequality and middle-class wages that have remained virtually stagnant for the past 15 years, Mrs. Clinton, in her current campaign, has put forth an economic agenda that is more populist and reliant on government than Mr. Clinton\u2019s centrist approach of deficit reduction and welfare reform.\u201cBill Clinton is well aware that the economy has changed since the 1990s,\u201d said Alan B. Krueger, a professor of economics at Princeton University and a former chairman of Mr. Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers who has advised Mrs. Clinton. \u201cHe would recommend policies that would strengthen the economy, especially for the middle class, in the current environment.\u201dAdvertisement"}

CLEMENTBerwyn, Pa.To the Editor:Hillary Clinton\u2019s plan to attract disaffected Republicans to her camp is a very perilous strategy. Republicans, no matter how much they dislike Donald Trump, are far more likely not to vote at all than they are to vote for a Democrat. In tacking far enough to the right to appeal to Republican voters, Mrs. Clinton risks losing a significant part of her base.Most of Bernie Sanders\u2019s supporters will support Mrs. Clinton at the polls only if they see enough difference between her policies and the Republicans\u2019. If Mrs. Clinton moves too far to the right, however, she will forfeit these votes. An attempt to be all things to all voters will lose more votes from Democrats than it will gain from Republicans.Eight years ago, Mrs. Clinton and her advisers snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. If they do so again this year, the result will be disastrous.RICHARD B.

{"Headline": "Kim Jong-un Seeks to Cement Power at First North Korean Congress in 36 Years", "Date": "2016-05-04", "News": "Supported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 When Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, arrives at the seventh congress of the governing Workers\u2019 Party on Friday, he will essentially be attending his own coronation. Meeting for the first time in a generation, the congress \u2014 in theory, the country\u2019s highest decision-making body \u2014 will cement his status as supreme leader.It will also elect a new central committee, which in turn appoints the party\u2019s Politburo and presidium. Those posts are expected to be filled with a new generation of loyalists whom Mr. Kim has already been elevating through purges and reshuffles, analysts said.Analysts said Mr. Kim\u2019s byungjin policy would be reaffirmed as the official party line, though reviving the North\u2019s moribund economy while the country is under sanctions is a difficult prospect. He has said the congress will present \u201can ambitious blueprint\u201d for his nation.\u201cThe congress is an occasion for Kim Jong-un to officially declare at home and abroad that his era has arrived,\u201d said Koh Yu-hwan, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul. \u201cHe will boast about his nuclear weapons and the security they provide as his biggest achievement, and then will exhort his country to focus on rebuilding the economy.\u201dSome analysts said that after the meeting, Mr. Kim may try to reduce tensions on the Korean Peninsula as a way to encourage China to offer more aid.But others remained skeptical. \u201cKim Jong-un will never stop nuclear weapons development,\u201d said Chang Yong-seok, an analyst at the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies at Seoul National University. \u201cHe does not consider economic reform without nuclear weapons.\u201dMr. Kim\u2019s audience will include foreign journalists invited to cover the event, allowing the world a rare glimpse of the supreme leader\u2019s vision for his impoverished yet nuclear-armed country.During the last party congress, held in 1980, Mr. Kim\u2019s grandfather, the North\u2019s founding president, Kim Il-sung, spoke for five hours on his party\u2019s achievements, frequently interrupted by applauding delegates. At the time, North Korea still enjoyed a degree of economic and military advantage over South Korea.But things have changed. South Korea\u2019s economy surged ahead, while millions of North Koreans died of hunger during a famine in the 1990s. Refugees fled the failed socialist paradise in the North, many ending up in the capitalist South.Still, North Korea stuck to its command economy, even when the Soviet bloc disintegrated and its communist neighbor, China, adopted market reforms and prospered.Mr. Kim\u2019s father, who came to power in 1994, adopted an emergency \u201cmilitary first\u201d rule, relying on the People\u2019s Army as the main governing tool, and never convened a party congress. He sought nuclear weapons in defiance of United Nations sanctions, telling his people that the weapons would protect their independence and dignity from \u201cthe American imperialists.\u201dMr. Kim was still in his late 20s when the death of his father, Kim Jong-il, in 2011 catapulted him to the top of the secretive regime. Outside analysts who had predicted openness and diplomatic compromise under his young leadership \u2014 Mr. Kim had spent time in Switzerland as a teenager \u2014 had a surprise in store.Jeong Joon-hee, a South Korean government spokesman, said he suspected that the North Korean military pressed ahead with the doomed tests to help glorify Mr. Kim\u2019s image ahead of the party congress.Such nationalism has proved popular among young North Koreans, said Mr. Chang, whose Institute for Peace and Unification Studies has been tracking public opinion inside the North by interviewing recent defectors.\u201cHe is definitely more popular among young people than old,\u201d Mr. Chang said.\u201cYouth\u201d has been a defining key word ahead of the party congress, said Park Ju-hwa and Kim Kap-sik, researchers at the government-run Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul.They analyzed more than 1,500 articles the main North Korean party newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, has carried about the congress, and found \u201cyouth\u201d cropping up repeatedly in various political slogans, like \u201cyouth power.\u201d\u201cKim Jong-un sought to dispel anxiety over his young leadership and justify a generational change\u201d he is introducing through the party congress, the researchers wrote in a joint paper.videoAdvertisement"}

By imposing tolls in bridges that have a lot of mass transit options, you would keep a lot of trucks off the street. Because what\u2019s happening now\n                                                            is many trucks are looking to use bridges that don\u2019t have any tolls on them. My plan would add tolls to certain bridges and reduce tolls to other bridges, and that would reduce traffic\n                                                            congestion, especially truck traffic, which is choking many neighborhoods.\n                                                        \n                                                            I have trouble separating that from my larger program because I think if we\u2019re doing things like creating affordable housing or addressing policing issues, for the people involved, that is the highest impact there could be on their quality of life.\n                                                            So I think you\u2019re talking about something that reaches everyone, at least some. Well, I would pick up then in the same place. I think the expansion of bike lanes more deeply into the outer\n                                                            boroughs is an example. I think there\u2019s a lot of areas that still need them and would benefit. The same with bike share. Obviously bike share is nascent, but it\u2019s started closer\n                                                            in Manhattan and the areas closer in. I think if you\u2019re talking about a more holistic impact it would be to really make it five borough in both cases. Make bike lane expansion and bike\n                                                            share expansion truly holistic in the city.\n                                                        \n                                                            I think that when you live in an urban setting, the one treasure that you sort of appreciate and value is open space, quality, calming space, whether it\u2019s for the tranquility that it provides you as an individual, for the activity that it provides\n                                                            your children and your family, for the potential for sports activities and physical activity. That green space in every neighborhood within a short distance from where you live, I think is one.\n                                                        \n                                                            And then the other, and I\u2019m going to just add another, because I think it\u2019s an important quality of life concern for me and I see it on a daily basis. If we\u2019re going to make New York City a really quality livable city, we\u2019re\n                                                            going to have to make our mass transit more aesthetically pleasing and a better experience. There\u2019s got to be much more ability to influence that experience in New York City because so\n                                                            much of our work force and our daily activity relies on the quality of that experience. So I would give attention, whether it\u2019s political pressure as a chief executive or gaining some\n                                                            additional control of the mass transit system.\n                                                        \n                                                            A new idea? The one that I\u2019m basically hung up on is making sure our streets are not given back to the hoodlums, which is not a new idea. That\u2019s my No. 1 pet idea that I believe that people have to be able to walk around and feel safe, to\n                                                            be able to walk around at night and feel safe, to be able to go out at night and feel safe, to be able to park their cars or take the subway and feel safe.\n                                                        \n                                                            I believe that stop-and-frisk is going to go away sooner than later. Twenty-first century technology. You\u2019re on 96th and Broadway, let\u2019s say. And there\u2019s a crime on 98th Street and Columbus Avenue, and the computer knows where the\n                                                            crime is, the computer knows where the cop is, he could get to the scene of the crime within two minutes or less. That is going to help keep New York safer. I really feel that. I don\u2019t\n                                                            know why nobody else has thought about it. That would be my recommendation.\n                                                        \n                                                            One simple idea that I think could improve life in New York City is having the city at the end of each one of its subway lines in the Bronx and in Brooklyn and in Queens create park and ride. The number of people who come into the City of New York that\n                                                            burden our traffic problems could be significantly reduced if we just simply built parking garages and encourage more people coming into the city to use our subway system. If you go to the top\n                                                            of the Bronx or if you go out to Queens at the end of each one of our lines, we don\u2019t have park and ride facilities. It is I think the most common sense approach that we can do to start\n                                                            eliminating some of our traffic congestion problems in the city, encouraging more people to take our subways and mass transit.\n                                                        \n                                                            I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s considered a simple idea, but housing construction has to be a priority for the next administration. Also, I think we need tax reform. Again, I don\u2019t know if people would consider it a simple idea, but my tax\n                                                            reform proposal would put more money in the pockets of middle-class and working men and women in this city.\n                                                        \n                                                            Instead of the flat tax that we have right now, where no matter how much you make, you pretty much pay the same rate of tax, I believe that there should be a much more progressive system of rates, where people making over half a million dollars a year\n                                                            now will pay a little bit more. And everybody else below that threshold will get a reduction in their New York City income tax bill.\n                                                        \n                                                            I want to concentrate on cleaning up the central business districts in every neighborhood in New York City. All of those overflowing garbage cans I want to be empty and orderly. I want to remove the graffiti stickers and clean up all of the business areas\n                                                            outside of Manhattan.\n                                                        \n                                                            I would do that by expanding paid transitional work programs.\n                                                        \n                                                            One simple idea that will make people\u2019s lives easier is when we expand 311 and create a My City Hall app, where you will be able to have all of your interactions with government in one place that is easily accessible to you in a technological way.\n                                                            You can more easily get in touch with us in government and track everything government is doing for you and everything you need from government. So My City Hall will be that.\n                                                        \n                                                            I think that one of the things that has been missed is health disparities in the City of New York, particularly in black and Latino communities. I think it is important that we tie health and mental health components into our schools. I think that would\n                                                            help to create healthier communities. As opposed to just looking at things like vision and hearing and testing for that, looking at things like diabetes and high blood pressure would allow us\n                                                            to address coronary disease and a number of other things early on. And I think that is one of the things that I would really like to do.\n                                                        \n                                                            For too many people in this city, real compassionate health care is elusive. 1.2 million people are completely without coverage; even more are underinsured. That is a challenge that not only affects those that are not getting health care, but all the\n                                                            rest of us because of the drag on the economy that it creates, because of the inability of small businesses to hire, because of the high cost, because of the tax burden that we carry for covering\n                                                            the uninsured. It is big, but it is straightforward. Every New Yorker should have access to quality health care that doesn\u2019t bankrupt them. I\u2019m going to try and make that a reality\n                                                            as mayor.\n                                                        \n                                                            When I talk to parents around the city and some of our poor communities, they understand that I.Q. is not the issue, poverty is the problem. Poverty causes developmental issues. The first three years of a child\u2019s life are pivotal and we\u2019re\n                                                            not addressing it. I want to set up pediatric wellness centers in low-income communities where parents, doctors and teachers work together so when kids come into our schools at 4, 5 years old,\n                                                            they\u2019re not so far behind that they never catch up. And that would go a long way toward addressing some of the root causes of our failing schools. Early intervention, birth to 3, I want\n                                                            to set up pediatric wellness centers in those communities so we can start working with parents and children early on. That would pay dividends.\n                                                        \n                                                            I want a chancellor who will end this conflict over co-locations. Right now I have called for a moratorium until we\u2019ve come up with a plan that truly involves parents in schools early enough. I think that rather than requiring charters to find\n                                                            space outside the schools, I would say it would be my preference that charters find space outside schools. It would be my preference that when they find space in a school and they have the resources\n                                                            to pay for it, as some of them do, that they pay for it. But I think actually if you had a parental involvement plan that was more careful and earlier, so that there was a chance to really work\n                                                            through what the impacts would be, some co-locations would be deemed workable, others would be rejected and that would really reset the whole equation. When the plans were no longer sort of my\n                                                            way or the highway, the D.O.E. has spoken, but actually were adjusted according to the needs within the building and parental concerns, then I think that you could have some healthy and productive\n                                                            co-locations. Ideally, outside schools, but it\u2019s not impossible to do it right with a co-location into a public school.\n                                                        \n                                                            We rely on property tax for a significant amount of our revenue. And we have made New York City a tax-friendly city for homeowners. It is lopsided toward them, and I say that as a homeowner. Many people who left the city discovered that their tax burden\n                                                            was so big that they wanted to return. I have family in Rockland that pay anywhere between $18,000 and $25,000 a year in property tax. They could live on City Island like I do and pay $6,000\n                                                            to $7000 a year. So we\u2019ve encouraged homeownership and that\u2019s a good thing.\n                                                        \n                                                            I think where we have failed is in a number of areas. One, our co-op and condo tax. We\u2019ve had to apply this abatement to bring back some equity or fairness to the taxes, but it\u2019s not structural. We go back and re-approve an abatement that\n                                                            we give co-op and condo owners. So one, we need to create parity, equity and fairness there. If you own a co-op or a condo, that\u2019s your home and we should be friendly to that. I think\n                                                            that we need to stop what I consider a pretty insidious practice or smoke and mirrors game of reassessing the value of commercial property in New York City on an annual basis and not calling\n                                                            it a tax. It has become a disincentive for investment in certain sectors. So you have a business, you rent space in an office building, the office building owner gets reassessed that year. The\n                                                            assessment goes up. And then that landlord is required to either pass on the costs or eat the costs. The landlord will pass on the costs and, of course, that adds to the cost of doing business,\n                                                            becomes a disincentive for job growth. People start looking at, well what are my options here, do I have to be in New York City? Might I be in a suburb of New York City. Might I take my business\n                                                            to Newark or somewhere else? So I think we have to stop that practice, call it a tax and be transparent about it. We can\u2019t continue to backfill the budget gaps with that property class.\n                                                        \n                                                            Look, I grew up in our country here. I\u2019m a firm believer in our Constitution and our Bill of Rights and I would say I do not support surveillance to find out who did some crime. But I would support it for one exception: terrorism that will hurt\n                                                            the masses. A guy who\u2019s going to be a 9/11-type situation, a nuclear bomb-type situation. So I would say I do not support surveillance for, let\u2019s surveil that guy because he didn\u2019t\n                                                            pay his taxes.\n                                                        \n                                                            Proactive surveillance only if we have suspicion, big suspicion of terrorism to hurt the majority of our citizens.\n                                                        \n                                                            I\u2019m not sure what they mean by social sciences, other than the fact that I\u2019ve always been offended by government officials who have decision-making by polls. Decision-making by polling is the absence of profiles in courage. Leaders should\n                                                            be determined based on their convictions and their views. John Kennedy\u2019s book \u201cProfiles in Courage\u201d needs to be read by everyone running for office. Or anybody who wants\n                                                            to be a leader. You have to have convictions and then go forward. Decision-making based on polls is not the way to run a government.\n                                                        \n                                                            I agree with that sentiment and as part of my people\u2019s budget, I have proposed a plan with the associated revenues that would allow all of the libraries in New York City to stay open 7 days a week. The fact of the matter is that the cost of allowing\n                                                            libraries to open 7 days a week is in the tens of millions of dollars, a drop in the bucket in the realm of the city\u2019s $70 billion annual budget, and is always subject to this ridiculous\n                                                            budget dance that occurs year after year after year that introduces uncertainty and therefore instability in our library system. We should make it stable, cut them out of the budget dance and\n                                                            give them the additional funding to do so. And I\u2019ve identified the revenues as part of my people\u2019s budget. Go to peoplesbudgetnyc.com.\n                                                        \n                                                            The appropriate use of it is obviously if a police officer sees specific suspicious conduct, then they have an obligation to investigate that. What I don\u2019t want to see is the distrust between the community and the police. And we have to work toward\n                                                            getting people jobs and create opportunity for them, rather than continuing the practice of throwing minority children up against a wall and searching them.\n                                                        \n                                                            I agree that housing is one of the most enormous problems we have right now in the city. And what we need to do, what I\u2019m going to do when I\u2019m mayor, is fight to get the city control over its rent laws again, so we can protect rent-stabilized\n                                                            tenants, keep those units. I want to build 40,000 new middle-income housing units over the next 10 years, keep the production of housing the mayor has planned and expand for lower-income units\n                                                            as well. I want to make sure we take the 100,000 distressed housing units out there in the city, make them livable, hold the slumlords or the banks accountable, get that money back for New Yorkers.\n                                                            I also want to create for homeless folks a real program where they can get rent subsidies to get out of the shelters. I wish that there was one easy answer. There isn\u2019t. It\u2019s a\n                                                            puzzle and we\u2019re going to have to keep aggressively putting the pieces in it, so we\u2019re adding more housing at different income levels across the city. I\u2019m also looking at\n                                                            the idea of a property tax cap to preserve affordable housing in neighborhoods where it\u2019s a little economically challenging to build new affordable housing.\n                                                        \n                                                            I think as we look at the rise of homelessness, and I think now we probably have over 50,000 people who are homeless in the City of New York. The things that have not been done that we saw that worked before: Things like legal services that prevented\n                                                            homelessness, looking at vouchers and creating priority for homeless families and Section 8 vouchers. Things like putting the money that we have that\u2019s been sitting on the side for the\n                                                            Housing Authority back in renovation, making sure that we renovate and bring those units online. All of that could go into reducing homelessness. I think that we\u2019ve gone away from that.\n                                                            That helped to keep homelessness down in earlier years of this administration. We need to go back and do some of that also. And then part of it is we have to build additional housing. I\u2019ve\n                                                            spoken about that earlier, the need to construct new housing and as we look at affordable housing particularly for poor families. I think whether it\u2019s 80-20 (People receive tax breaks\n                                                            to be able to build. They have to provide 20 percent of the units that are affordable.) or 70-30, I think the opportunity to create more affordable units will drive homelessness down. And last\n                                                            but not least, if we don\u2019t tie social services in to families who have become homeless, once they find apartments, we need to maintain the services to them. That will keep them in apartments\n                                                            and keep them from coming back into the homeless population again.\n                                                        \n                                                            We have a structural challenge that goes well beyond infrastructure. The housing itself is falling apart. Public housing has fallen into terrible neglect because of neglect by the federal government. And we have a problem that the present rise in property\n                                                            values is making it impossible to build affordability. Incentives that we\u2019ve had simply don\u2019t keep up. One thing that we have to be careful not to do, though, is to have a zoning\n                                                            policy that is so far-leaning toward housing that we carve out any ability to have reasonable middle-class jobs. Right now if you want to have a back office space for your big business and you\n                                                            have a choice between Jersey City and Long Island City, you\u2019re going to Jersey City because they figured out the math of reserving portions of their real estate for job creation, not just\n                                                            all for housing.\n                                                        \n                                                            I\u2019ve suggested taking the traditional 80-20 program and making it 60-20-20. The 60 percent now makes about as much profit as the 80 percent used to and does give you room to do middle-class housing. But we are a growing city, and in the mayor\u2019s\n                                                            2030 plan, he has projected that there will be another million people in the city. We have to not only have a place for them to live, but a place for them to work and to live comfortably.\n                                                        Voter Photographs by Byron Smith for The New York TimesAn earlier version of this feature misspelled the surname of one of the mayoral candidates.
