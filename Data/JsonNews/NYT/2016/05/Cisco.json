{"Headline": "Warren Buffett Stake Suggests Apple Is All Grown Up", "Date": "2016-05-19", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseWith this week\u2019s imprimatur from the legendary investor Warren Buffett, it should now be official: Apple, the world\u2019s largest company by market capitalization and a symbol of American technological innovation, is a \u201cvalue\u201d stock.That may prove to be a decidedly mixed blessing.Mr. Buffett is the world\u2019s most prominent and successful proponent of value investing \u2014 an approach that seeks stocks that are undervalued and sell for less than their \u201cintrinsic value,\u201d as Benjamin Graham put it his 1949 classic \u201cThe Intelligent Investor.\u201d Mr. Buffett credits Mr. Graham with shaping his own approach to investing.\u201cWe\u2019ve just looked at it again,\u201d said Bill Smead, who manages the Smead Value Fund, one of the most successful large-cap value mutual funds over the last five years, according to Morningstar. \u201cAnybody that discounts the thinking at Berkshire Hathaway does so at their peril, in my opinion.\u201dValue stocks are typically unpopular among many investors, their shares often battered by disappointing short-term revenue and earnings results. They usually trade at very low price-to-earnings ratios, a common valuation measure. Nonetheless, some academic studies have suggested that over time, they outperform other stocks, in part because expectations are so low.Apple \u201cis going to attract more value investors,\u201d said Toni Sacconaghi, a senior analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein who covers Apple. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for beaten-down stocks with negative sentiment. Apple has traded below a market multiple for years and sentiment has become increasingly pessimistic, especially over the past month.\u201dMr. Sacconaghi has a buy recommendation on the stock, \u201cnot because we believe this will be a high-growth company going forward, but because the current price is discounting a decline in cash flow forever, and we think that\u2019s overly pessimistic.\u201dAccording to the market research firm Thomson Reuters Lipper, just 69 of 357 actively managed value funds in the United States \u2014 fewer than 20 percent \u2014 currently hold positions in Apple.That\u2019s because Apple has long been considered a quintessential growth stock: one of the glamorous high-flying cousins to dowdy value stocks. Growth investors think growth stocks are undervalued, too, because they expect their earnings to grow faster (often much faster) than other investors recognize.As a result, valuation measures for growth stocks can go sky-high. In two prominent growth-stock examples, shares of Facebook trade at a price-earnings ratio of about 73, and Netflix at about 312. (The price-earnings average for stocks in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is currently about 24.)This week Apple\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio was just over 10.If Apple is now a value stock, though, plenty of growth investors haven\u2019t gotten the message. Among actively managed growth funds, 249 of 619, or 40 percent, hold Apple shares, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper. That\u2019s more than the 230 growth funds that owned Apple stock in 2014.Should growth funds suddenly decide that Apple no longer meets their criteria, there could be a mass exodus that would be only partly offset by new purchases from value investors.Some prominent value investors aren\u2019t convinced Apple really is a value stock, despite Mr. Buffett\u2019s blessing, or that its stock price is significantly below its intrinsic value. (Intrinsic value considers all aspects of a business, including both tangible and intangible factors.)That means Apple could fall into the neutral zone of stocks that are neither growth \u2014 because they aren\u2019t growing fast enough \u2014 or value, because they\u2019re still not cheap enough.\u201cApple is extraordinarily cheap, but it\u2019s never been a value stock in the traditional sense,\u201d said Bruce Greenwald, who runs the value investing program at Columbia Business School and is a co-author of \u201cValue Investing: From Graham to Buffett and Beyond\u201d (Wiley, 2001).\u201cValue investing has always focused primarily on asset value,\u201d Professor Greenwald told me. Apple\u2019s book value, or asset value, of $130 billion isn\u2019t even close to its market capitalization of about $515 billion.That means, in theory, that other companies could replicate Apple\u2019s assets at relatively low cost, produce rival products and undermine Apple\u2019s enviably high profit margins.Tech companies typically have low asset values relative to their share prices \u2014 one reason Mr. Buffett and other value investors long shunned the sector \u2014 but their patented technologies and intellectual property nonetheless often create formidable barriers to entry by competitors.For an extraordinarily high-profit-margin technology company like Apple, the question is whether there are such \u201cmoats,\u201d as value investors like to put it, that will continue to protect it from these competitive threats.\u201cThat\u2019s always been the issue with Apple,\u201d Professor Greenwald said. \u201cHow sustainable are these profit levels and how big are the barriers? The fear with Apple is that it will get overwhelmed by new entry and new competitors. The moat doesn\u2019t seem that big. It\u2019s not just giant rivals like Samsung, but smaller companies that can survive with even a small share of the smartphone market.\u201dMr. Smead told me this week he had not added Apple to his value fund\u2019s holdings, even though the stock is so cheap that it meets many of his fund\u2019s investing criteria.\u201cOver the past five or six years, when Apple was doing so well, we joked that we were the best-performing large-cap fund that didn\u2019t own Apple,\u201d Mr. Smead said. \u201cNot that we didn\u2019t wrestle with it many times.\u201d\u201cOur difficulty has been that we don\u2019t understand what kind of moat protects their technology over the next 10 years,\u201d Mr. Smead continued. \u201cThat\u2019s the main problem. The other is that, given Apple\u2019s huge success and its sheer magnitude, it needs a monstrous new product or enhancement of an existing product to move the needle on growth.\u201dFor their part, many growth investors were startled on April 26 when Apple reported its first quarterly revenue drop since 2003. Both revenue and earnings fell short of analyst estimates, and Apple shares plunged 8 percent in one day. They rallied some this week on news of the Berkshire Hathaway investment, but are still down sharply from where they were as recently as mid-April.But Apple still has defenders among growth investors.At the end of the year, Apple was the second-largest holding in the Upright Growth Fund, the top-performing large-cap growth fund so far this year, according to Morningstar.\u201cApple\u2019s best and fastest growing days may be behind us,\u201d David Chiueh, Upright Growth\u2019s president and fund manager, told me. \u201cBut even growth-oriented funds like ours don\u2019t just contain high-growth stocks with 35-50 percent growth rates in our portfolio.\u201dHe said such rapid growth was not sustainable, and added that he was happy with companies that showed \u201csolid 8 percent to 12 percent earnings growth,\u201d a category in which he included Apple. \u201dGive them some time and they will show outstanding performance,\u201d he said.Mr. Chiueh said he was also encouraged that Apple had stepped up its spending on research and development, suggesting that new products with strong growth prospects might still be in the offing.At some fund families, Apple seems to be both a value and a growth stock, even though that seems contradictory. At the fund giant Vanguard, Apple is a major holding in the Vanguard Windsor and Windsor II funds (both value funds) and the Vanguard Morgan Growth Fund and US Growth Fund. A Vanguard spokeswoman declined to comment.All of which suggests that when it comes to Apple, \u201cvalue\u201d and \u201cgrowth\u201d may be in the eye of the beholder.Still, Mr. Buffett\u2019s announcement this week underscores that Apple\u2019s once sizzling growth has slowed, and suggests it may well be on the inexorable path from growth to value stock.That\u2019s not an especially good portent for investors. Among technology companies that have already made the same transition, Professor Greenwald cited IBM, Intel, Cisco, Microsoft and Dell, companies whose share prices, after great rocket rides, have mostly languished in recent years. (Dell was taken private in 2013.)For those who failed to buy the stock early enough, \u201cas investments, they all turned out pretty badly,\u201d he noted.Berkshire Hathaway also disclosed this week that it had increased the stake in IBM it first acquired in 2011. IBM shares have declined over the period, but by Mr. Buffett\u2019s long-term standards, the investment is still too new to judge.\u201cIf you believe the iPhone will be the global standard in 25 years, you\u2019d buy\u201d Apple stock, Professor Greenwald said. But many value investors have already seen where smartphones can go, \u201cwhich is where PCs have already gone.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can a 700 M.P.H. Train in a Tube Be for Real?", "Date": "2016-05-19", "News": "Supported byLast month, at an M.I.T. conference on the future of suburbia, I met a senior-level executive from Hyperloop Technologies. (Hyperloop is a speculative high-speed transportation system that proposes to use passenger and cargo capsules inside a reduced-pressure tube that aims to reach a top speed of 700 miles per hour.) Why put your energies in something that still feels like science fiction? I asked him. Why not invest time, money and ingenuity in high-speed rail? (I live in California; I want to see high-speed rail happen.)Our conversation veered into a surprising direction, much like the proposed curve of a Hyperloop track. He told me about how he and his wife had made the decision not to be together but to share custody of their children and continue to live under the same roof. I looked at him quizzically.The structure of marriage, he continued, didn\u2019t work for him; it was an outdated institution. High-speed rail, he said, was also an outdated institution, so why should we continue to invest in trains?And so, according to his analogy, one might fairly describe Hyperloop as transportation\u2019s new girlfriend: mysterious, unencumbered, exciting, expensive. A wild card with potential. But does she have long-term potential? That remains to be seen.I went to Las Vegas recently to view the first test of Hyperloop. As someone who experiences aging infrastructure daily and desires something better, I was ready to be convinced of the feasibility and future of this idea, which has become one of the purest expressions of techno-optimism.Several separate entities have since been formed to explore the possibilities. The event I attended was presented by Hyperloop Technologies, a group inspired by but not affiliated with Mr. Musk (though riding on his name recognition and involving several of his former employees). Hyperloop Technologies and its competitors are working to develop a structure to move passengers and cargo between two points safely, efficiently and sustainably. And quickly: Mr. Musk\u2019s initial dream was to propel passengers from San Francisco to Los Angeles in about a half an hour (Amtrak takes 12 hours; flight time is an hour).Hyperloop Technologies, which announced its name change to Hyperloop One with much fanfare in Las Vegas, is a well-funded operation with over 100 employees. It\u2019s gaining new investors (such as Vinod Khosla, a founder of Sun Microsystems; Sherpa Ventures; and SNCF, the French train company) and new partners (including the engineering firms Aecom and ARUP, as well as the starchitect Bjarke Ingels) almost as fast as the model on view at its press event.Approximately 200 investors, polo-shirted employees and reporters piled onto buses to converge on a site that looked eerily like a desert scene from \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201d We\u2019d been brought here to watch a test vehicle accelerate down a rail track at speeds of up to 300 m.p.h. using the company\u2019s propulsion technology. The dream is that capsules will hurl through a tube at 700 miles per hour on a cushion of air. That, however, was not what we witnessed.But I have questions. A lot of them.America (and later most of the world) got excited about freeways and built them everywhere over a 30-year span. Little did we know about the negative effects to neighborhoods, the health (obesity) and pollution risks, the excesses of traffic. What are the possible unintended positive and negative consequences of Hyperloop?Will Hyperloop exist as a series of isolated runs or as a comprehensive network?Hyperloop hopes to connect to city centers: What should cities be doing now to accommodate its arrival?Nevada is a famously lax regulatory environment. How will Hyperloop avoid the regulatory obstacles that every other transportation mode faces in more rigorous states?Hyperloop requires narrower rights of way than rails and highways but also requires curvier ones to offset those G-forces. Where will these go?I was told the right of way issue could be avoided by putting Hyperloop underground or underwater, but what are the environmental and cost impacts of that approach?In case of an emergency, how do you evacuate a Hyperloop that\u2019s under a mountain or under water?Will Hyperloop vehicles and tubes have windows? Will passengers want to see the world go by at 400 m.p.h. at ground level?What will Hyperloop do to ensure that people can get to and from its stations?Who is Hyperloop intended to serve? Will lower- and middle-income people be able to afford it? Would we be better off with a less expensive but somewhat slower system that can benefit more people and have lower ticket prices?Skepticism is O.K., Hyperloop\u2019s chief executive told me during our brief conversation at the event, but not cynicism. So I\u2019ll suspend mine a bit to acknowledge that Hyperloop One has achieved an incredible amount of work in a ridiculously short time. It will pain cities that have labored years to get bike lanes painted or bus stops moved to learn that a mere six months ago, this whole operation was little more than a vision. Now it\u2019s an $80 million venture with global partners.\u201cNo one comes close to our progress in commercializing this revolutionary transportation system,\u201d said Brogan BamBrogan, Hyperloop One\u2019s chief technology officer and a founder, before the test run.(That\u2019s two \u201cbros\u201d in one moniker, by the way, an effect even the scriptwriters of \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d wouldn\u2019t have gone for. Mr. BamBrogan\u2019s real first name is Kevin. This is just one of many aspects to this undertaking that makes me feel that it will all be revealed as a breathtaking piece of performance art.)I\u2019ve written in this space about the dearth of awe in infrastructure and so I\u2019ll applaud Hyperloop (again, modeling itself on Mr. Musk\u2019s media mastery) for conjuring an irresistible narrative of possibility. With Hyperloop One, nothing is deferred or delayed; these guys are in a mad rush. They\u2019re following in the product release footsteps of Apple, not the Department of Transportation. The company says that it will be moving cargo in 2019; passengers by 2021. That\u2019s three years from now.I asked Rob Lloyd, Hyperloop One\u2019s chief executive, what he was most proud of. \u201cThe speed with which the technology is being developed,\u201d he replied. \u201cWhen it works, it does change everything.\u201d\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing right now is what I saw in 1996,\u201d said Mr. Lloyd, a former president of sales and development at Cisco. \u201cWe all had I.P. routers and everything was done a certain way. At Cisco, we said, \u2018You can carry that over the Internet,\u2019 and everyone said, \u2018No.\u2019 But those high-speed networks made the Internet possible.\u201d Hyperloop, he said, \u201cwill do to the physical world what the Internet did to the digital one.\u201d\u201cGeography was our destiny, but soon you\u2019ll see opportunity democratized and communities transformed,\u201d said another founder, Shervin Pishevar, echoing the tech industry\u2019s particular skill at casting virtually any endeavor as world-changing.A compelling notion, to be sure, one that I took to heart after being exhorted after the evening event to \u201cgo grab some drinks and get a chance to interface.\u201dAllison Arieff, who specializes in architecture and design, is a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s $1 Billion Investment May Ease Ties With China", "Date": "2016-05-13", "News": "Supported byBut Apple\u2019s surprising interest in the company, called Didi Chuxing, and its out-of-character willingness to publicize the news Thursday evening could go a long way toward showing the Chinese government it is interested in supporting local business.More than any other major American technology company, Apple has had huge success in China. In the last fiscal year, Chinese consumers spent $59 billion on Apple products.With that success has come huge risk. In recent years, Beijing has grown more aggressive in pushing an agenda aimed at expanding local tech companies, forcing multinationals to play by its rules if they want access to China\u2019s markets.\u201cApple must be increasingly sensitive to the need to improve its government relations and to stake out a more entrenched position in the China market,\u201d said Mark Natkin, managing director of the China technology research firm Marbridge Consulting. \u201cSo making a sizable investment in a leading Chinese I.T. company will buy it a lot of good will.\u201dHe added that Apple would probably have to follow up the investment with other partnerships and spending in China if it wanted to stay in Beijing\u2019s good graces.In Apple\u2019s case, the new investment also helps it show Beijing how its operating system and iPhones are closely linked with the rise of app development within China; Didi\u2019s app, for example, is the most downloaded ride-hailing software in China.\u201cDidi exemplifies the innovation taking place in the iOS developer community in China,\u201d Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said in a news release.Many investors hoped that strong growth in China would offset some of the iPhone\u2019s deceleration. Revenue growth in the greater China region, which includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, hovered around 70 percent or more all last year. But last month the company said that quarterly sales in greater China had fallen 26 percent compared with the previous year.For Didi, the deal is a way to beef up its systems. The Chinese company serves close to 300 million users across more than 400 Chinese cities \u2014 more users than Uber \u2014 but lags technologically, analysts say.For more than a year, Apple and Didi \u2014 which share several partners, including Japan\u2019s SoftBank and Coatue \u2014 had been in contact. Apple was one of a handful of technology companies that, over the last year, Didi had talked with to better familiarize itself with the West, according to a person briefed on the deal.In April, Mr. Cook sat down for the first time with the leaders of Didi to discuss working together.In the midst of Didi\u2019s last major round of raising funds, the relationship quickly deepened, the person said. The two companies managed to close the deal with \u201clightning speed,\u201d Didi\u2019s president, Jean Liu, said in a conference call discussing the deal late Thursday.The two will work together on technology, marketing and products, Ms. Liu added.Mr. Cook has repeatedly said that Apple is looking for investment opportunities for its huge cash hoard. Apple has invested small sums in app developers before, and the company views China\u2019s app developer community as a prime source of future growth.\u201cWhat this means to me is that Apple is firmly committed to the Chinese market,\u201d said Brian Blau, an analyst with the Gartner research firm. \u201cThey are going to look at lots of opportunities.\u201dApple\u2019s move also draws it further into a Chinese market crisscrossed with competitive alliances. With the investment, Apple is now aligned with China\u2019s two largest Internet companies, Tencent and Alibaba, as a major shareholder in Didi. And Didi gained Apple as a big-name ally in its battle with Uber in China.Google\u2019s chief legal officer and head of corporate development, David Drummond, is on the board of Uber. And in 2013 Google\u2019s venture capital arm, GV, invested $258 million in Uber.But the partnership between Uber and Google has grown more distant over the past few years as both sides have independently pursued self-driving car projects. Uber has also made moves to wean itself from Google\u2019s map technology, including an acquisition of the mapping start-up deCarta.Investing in ride-hailing services gives Apple a doorway into the world\u2019s largest auto market and smartphone market by cars and phones sold, and an opportunity to better integrate its devices with cars in China. China\u2019s Internet companies are already hard at work developing driverless car technology and entertainment systems for cars, many of which are based on Google\u2019s Android software.\u201cMaybe they could be a technology supplier to Didi,\u201d Mr. Blau said. \u201cMaybe they could learn from Didi.\u201dThe auto market might be one new way that Apple can keep itself relevant to Chinese leaders who often view foreign tech firms in terms of how much utility they have in China as teachers of local companies, Mr. Natkin of Marbridge Consulting said.\u201cAs that utility wanes, the room to maneuver dwindles and the welcome mat starts to get drawn under the door,\u201d he said.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the day Apple\u2019s investment in Didi was announced. The investment was announced Thursday in the United States, not Thursday morning in China.Paul Mozur reported from Hong Kong and Mike Isaac from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "China Quietly Targets U.S. Tech Companies in Security Reviews", "Date": "2016-05-16", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Chinese authorities are quietly scrutinizing technology products sold in China by Apple and other big foreign companies, focusing on whether they pose potential security threats to the country and its consumers and opening up a new front in an already tense relationship with Washington over digital security.Apple and other companies in recent months have been subjected to reviews that target encryption and the data storage of tech products, said people briefed on the reviews who spoke on the condition of anonymity. In the reviews, Chinese officials require executives or employees of the foreign tech companies to answer questions about the products in person, according to these people.The reviews are run by a committee associated with the Cyberspace Administration of China, the country\u2019s Internet control bureau, they said. The bureau includes experts and engineers with ties to the country\u2019s military and security agencies.While other countries, including the United States and Britain, conduct reviews of some tech products, they usually focus on products that will be used by the military or other parts of the government that are concerned with security, and not on products sold to the general public.The Chinese reviews stand out because they are being applied more broadly, including to American consumer software and gadgets popular in China, the people briefed on the reviews said. And because Chinese officials have not disclosed the nature of the checks, both the United States government and American tech companies fear that the reviews could be used to extract tech knowledge as well as ensure that the United States was not using the products to spy.Ultimately, the reviews could be used to block products without explanation or to extract trade secrets in exchange for market access. Those secrets could be leaked to Chinese competitors or expose vulnerabilities, which, in turn, Chinese hackers could exploit.Further, tech companies are concerned that the reviews could set a precedent and that other countries will follow suit, each demanding different checks that would not only be costly but also put the companies at risk of having to hand over further secrets in exchange for market access.China and the United States have been embroiled in a quarrel about tech and security that has strained their relationship. The reviews could be a fresh sticking point, raising questions about the security of American technology and the degree to which American companies will acquiesce to Beijing\u2019s demands for fear of being punished in a huge market still partly controlled by the state.Chinese officials have not formally disclosed that they are conducting the reviews, and their existence has not been previously confirmed outside of rare, brief mentions in local news media.It is not clear specifically what Chinese authorities are demanding as part of the process. There is no indication that foreign companies have provided access to highly guarded material such as source code \u2014 the digital underpinnings of software \u2014 or other commercial secrets.The lack of disclosure by China\u2019s government has made it hard for the United States government to voice its objections, and has fed concerns that China is quietly carrying out further policies to target American technology companies.China\u2019s Internet regulators suggested the possibility of reviews three years ago, after revelations by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, concerning surveillance escalated tensions between China and the United States over computer security.Since then, China has quietly begun carrying out the reviews. That represents a shift in the way China manages foreign technology. Its previous efforts came through proposed new rules and other public measures that let foreign companies and governments resist.China relies on American technology products, even as it has made clear that it is concerned about the security of those products. A majority of Chinese government offices, state-owned enterprises and other institutions that handle potentially secret information, like universities and research institutes, use Microsoft Windows. Most smartphones in China run software made by either Apple or Google. And the high-end computing that supports China\u2019s banks, energy companies and military uses, in part, American-designed chips and servers.China\u2019s tougher tone is part of a broader challenge that governments around the world are posing to the technology industry over issues like privacy and encryption. In the United States, federal law enforcement officials have pressed Apple to help them gain access to encrypted iPhones even as the Obama administration has resisted Chinese policies that would require similar access.Under President Xi Jinping, China has taken steps to keep tabs on technology from American companies and reduce the nation\u2019s dependence on it.For foreign companies, the other option could be worse.\u201cOne viewpoint holds that we must close ourselves off, make a fresh start, thoroughly shake off our reliance on foreign technology and rely on indigenous innovation to pursue development,\u201d Mr. Xi said, according to a transcript of the speech. \u201cOtherwise, we would always follow in the footsteps of others, and would never be able to catch up.\u201dMr. Xi ultimately said China must find a middle ground and determine \u201cwhich things can be imported but have to be secure and controllable; which things may be imported, digested and absorbed for re-innovation; which things can be developed in collaboration with others; and for which things we must rely on our own strength and indigenous innovation.\u201dWhile details on the tech reviews are scant, commentary from the state-run China Daily in 2014 suggested that companies affected could include Cisco Systems and Microsoft. Other state news media has said the reviews will prevent product suppliers from \u201cillegally controlling, interfering in or interrupting user systems, or illegally collecting, storing, handling or exploiting information about users.\u201dCisco and Microsoft declined to comment on the Chinese media statements. Apple also declined to comment.\u201cAs the world connects to the Internet, various forms of attacks and new defensive technologies are ever multiplying, bringing challenges to China\u2019s development of a new digital industry,\u201d the group said.Paul Mozur reported from Hong Kong and Jane Perlez from Beijing.

{"Headline": "Fitbit Strives to Escape the Shadow of Apple", "Date": "2016-05-02", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Earlier this year, Fitbit invited guests to a Las Vegas hotel to witness something that it promised would \u201cignite the world of health and fitness.\u201dThe event, held during the International CES in January, was intended to make a splash for the wearable tech company\u2019s new product, the Blaze, a $200 smartwatch that measures a wearer\u2019s steps, heart rate and sleep.\u201cI was going in thinking, \u2018This is going to be awesome,\u2019\u201d James Park, Fitbit\u2019s chief executive, said of the Blaze introduction in an interview last month. \u201cI was definitely pretty surprised when I looked at some of the aftermath of it.\u201dThe reaction to the Blaze encapsulates the predicament facing Fitbit, the young company that has been a leader in wearable technology: In many people\u2019s eyes, it lives in the shadow of Apple, the Silicon Valley behemoth whose touch-screen smartwatch could potentially stomp its smaller rival out of existence.This even though Fitbit has been trying to do everything right \u2014 and has largely succeeded.Yet the fact that Fitbit\u2019s products focus on one thing \u2014 tracking your fitness \u2014 is not helping the company\u2019s image in this era of Swiss Army knife devices, where products like the iPhone and Apple Watch can do multiple things. History has been unkind to single-purpose gadgets, many of which have flopped, like Cisco\u2019s Flip camcorder, or have struggled, like the action camera from GoPro.As a result, Fitbit\u2019s stock has fallen about 10 percent since it went public last June. \u201cThere were concerns around competition, particularly from Apple,\u201d Katy Huberty, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said of investor skepticism around Fitbit.Mr. Park said \u201cit actually does not bother me at all\u201d when people frequently compare his company to Apple. He said the Apple Watch serves a different market than Fitbit\u2019s $60 to $250 accessories that focus on health monitoring.\u201cWe look at it from a consumer point of view,\u201d Mr. Park said. Apple Watch \u201cis a computing platform, but that\u2019s really the wrong way to approach this category from the very beginning.\u201dAn Apple spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment.Indisputably, Fitbit is growing, both in staff and sales. At the company\u2019s San Francisco headquarters, a timeline on the wall in the fifth-floor hallway illustrates the firm\u2019s history. In 2007, when Mr. Park, a Harvard dropout who had worked on photo-sharing software, founded Fitbit with his business partner Eric N. Friedman, who is now Fitbit\u2019s chief of technology, the start-up had just two employees. By 2015, it had 1,101.Inside the offices, furnished in midcentury modern style, employees are constantly shuffling in and out of conference rooms for meetings. On a recent visit, a group of new hires was touring the headquarters.Still, a concern among investors is whether Fitbit can extract more money from existing customers. Most of its sales are from people who buy Fitbit devices for the first time, not those who upgrade.In addition, many people may end up leaving their Fitbit devices in a drawer. Of those who bought a Fitbit device in 2015, 28 percent stopped using it by the end of the year, according to the company.\u201cThat means that many people who buy Fitbits don\u2019t use them for long, and presumably aren\u2019t going to buy another Fitbit device,\u201d said Jan Dawson, an independent technology analyst. \u201cThey have to constantly find new people to sell Fitbits to, whereas most consumer electronics companies can rely on a good amount of repeat business.\u201dAddressing some of these concerns falls partly to Woody Scal, Fitbit\u2019s chief business officer, who oversees sales and marketing for the company. Last year, Fitbit acquired FitStar, which makes apps offering video instructions on workouts. The apps charge a monthly subscription fee for access to exercise programs, an example of how Fitbit could eventually collect money from software services.The big picture for Fitbit, Mr. Scal said, is its evolution into a digital monitoring platform to discover and prevent health problems. Fitbit has teamed up with corporations that offer wellness programs for employees. BP, for example, offers Fitbits to more than 23,000 employees, partly to ensure they are getting enough sleep before they work on oil rigs. Mr. Scal said the data from sleep monitoring, a feature built in to all Fitbit devices, could lead to new health revelations.\u201cI believe we\u2019ve tracked more nights of sleep than have ever been tracked in the history of man,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can actually now compare it to normative data that we have and we can identify irregularities.\u201dAs for Apple, though Mr. Park said he was not bothered by the rival company, it has long been in his sights. When Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, introduced the iPhone 4S in 2011, for example, Mr. Park had a realization.At the time, the new iPhone added a capability to synchronize with wireless accessories using the standard called Bluetooth. Fitbit trackers back then lacked Bluetooth connectivity, but Mr. Park wanted them to be able to synchronize data immediately with the iPhone.\u201cIt could enable a lot of possibilities in terms of real-time feedback,\u201d he said.So Mr. Park gathered a few top employees into a conference room. They decided to re-engineer the Fitbit products to support the new feature. The decision set product releases back about six months, but the revised devices became best sellers.Mr. Park said Fitbit was poised to innovate products to stay competitive. Sensors are getting more sophisticated, so he imagined a situation where high-end Fitbit devices could eventually support mobile payments or control smart home products like Internet-connected light bulbs.Yet the products will stop short of resembling the Apple Watch.\u201cWe\u2019re going to be very careful with how we include these things over time,\u201d Mr. Park said. \u201cI think one of the general knocks against smartwatches is that people still don\u2019t know what they\u2019re good for, so they\u2019ve crammed everything in.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified who introduced the iPhone 4S in 2011. It was Timothy Cook, who was the company\u2019s chief executive then, not Steve Jobs.Advertisement"}
