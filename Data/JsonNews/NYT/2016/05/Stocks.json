{"Headline": "French Insurer AXA to Exit Tobacco Investments After Activists\u2019 Campaign", "Date": "2016-05-23", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 The French insurer AXA Group said on Monday that it would join the global movement to exit tobacco investments by unloading about $2 billion in cigarette company stocks and bonds.The decision to exit such investments comes after a campaign by activists at the Union for International Cancer Control, the Tobacco Free Portfolios initiative and other organizations. AXA, which is based in Paris, said on Monday that it would immediately unload about 200 million euros, or about $224 million, of tobacco stocks, and that it would sell off its portfolio of tobacco company bonds, valued around \u20ac1.6 billion, as they matured.The move puts an end to the apparent conflict involved with a financial institution that has enormous health and life insurance businesses investing in a product known to cause cancer and other diseases. AXA is one of the world\u2019s top insurance and wealth management companies, with 103 million clients, and revenue last year of \u20ac99 billion.AXA\u2019s announcement on Monday is the latest involving investors divesting themselves of tobacco. Six years ago, the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund, a titan of so-called ethical investing, announced that it was dropping tobacco from its portfolio.Many individual investors are not even aware that their mutual funds or retirement accounts include tobacco stocks, but those who act to buy only ethical investments find there can be a financial price to pay.Mr. Buberl acknowledged that the decision \u201chas a cost for us, but the case for divestment is clear: The human cost of tobacco is tragic; its economic cost is huge.\u201dAXA noted that tobacco was \u201cthe major cause of long-term noncommunicable diseases,\u201d responsible for the deaths of six million people each year.\u201cWe need companies like AXA to signal that investing in an industry which kills its customers is simply the wrong thing to do,\u201d Cary Adams, chief executive of the Union for International Cancer Control, said in the same statement, \u201cand this announcement to divest \u20ac1.8 billion is a milestone step in the right direction.\u201dAdvertisement"}

So far, Tesla has accepted about 375,000 $1,000 deposits from hopeful buyers.Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, has said the company aims to produce 500,000 Model 3s by 2018 at its factory in Fremont, Calif.Many automakers would consider that a stretch, said Jessica Caldwell, a senior analyst at the auto researcher Edmunds.com. A typical auto plant makes 200,000 to 250,000 cars a year, she said.\u201cRaising money is going to help them try to reach that 500,000 number, but a lot of people have doubts,\u201d she said. \u201cIt seems like an unreachable goal.\u201dIt\u2019s also a huge leap from the 15,000 cars Tesla produced in the first three months of the year.Its models include the Model S sedan, which costs about $75,000, and the Model X, a seven-passenger sport utility vehicle priced at about $80,000. The Model 3 will be priced at around $35,000.While Tesla is often hailed for design and innovation, manufacturing has proved more of a challenge. The release of the Model X has been slowed by a recall, and the automaker recently lost two production executives.Of the stock Tesla plans to offer, about $1.4 billion will be new shares. The remaining amount will be sold by Mr. Musk to cover tax expenses stemming from 5.5 million stock options he has exercised.News of the offer hurt Tesla shares in after-hours trading, where they fell $2.52, to $208.65. Earlier in the day, the stock climbed as high as $215.31 after Goldman Sachs changed its recommendation on Tesla shares to buy from neutral.In a note to clients, an analyst for Goldman, Patrick Archambault, said Tesla\u2019s sales goals were \u201cambitious,\u201d but nevertheless he set a stock price target of $250 over the next six months.\u201cWe do not believe Tesla shares are fully capturing the company\u2019s disruptive potential,\u201d Mr. Archambault wrote.In the first quarter of this year, Tesla lost about $283 million on revenue of $1.15 billion. During the same period last year, it reported revenue of about $940 million and a loss of $154 million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Coral vs. Coal", "Date": "2016-05-26", "News": "Supported byMELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 Tim Flannery, a scientist and environmentalist who was named Australian of the Year in 2007, lost his job in 2013. The right-wing government of then-Prime Minister Tony Abbott shut down the Climate Commission that Flannery headed in a peremptory move designed to demonstrate its contempt for climate change. The commission had been established two years earlier to provide \u201cauthoritative information\u201d to the Australian public.Abbott, of the conservative Liberal Party, had no time for such information. Climate change, he argued in his autobiography, was bunk. It had been \u201chappening since the earth\u2019s beginning.\u201d Therefore it made no sense to \u201cimpose certain and substantial costs on the economy now in order to avoid unknown and perhaps even benign changes in the future.\u201d\u201cTo Abbott, I was the devil incarnate,\u201d Flannery told me. Throughout the developed world \u2014 from the \u201cDrill, baby, drill!\u201d crowd in the United States to Abbott\u2019s \u201cax-the-tax\u201d attack on clean-energy legislation in Australia \u2014 denial of climate change has become a tribal, almost masonic badge of the coal and fossil-fuel loving right. In today\u2019s culture wars it\u2019s as much of a wedge issue as any.Through crowdfunding, Flannery raised enough money in short order to turn the state-funded commission into the Climate Council, an independent nonprofit organization with the same role. Earlier this month, he headed for the Great Barrier Reef to see what \u201cbenign changes,\u201d as Abbott would have it, global warming has produced in the world\u2019s largest coral reef. He found what he saw northeast of Port Douglas on the outer rim of the reef devastating.The reef, one of the largest living things on earth, has started to fail. Whether it can recover is unclear. An organism roughly the size of Germany is bleaching to death. More than 90 percent of the reef that Flannery saw had suffered. Bleaching occurs when excessive heat and sunlight cause the algae that give coral reefs their shimmering colors to create toxins.The toxins repel the tiny animals called polyps essential to the ecosystem of the corals. As my colleague Michelle Innis put it, \u201cWhen heat stress continues, they starve to death.\u201d Because the coral reefs support vast fish stocks, the livelihoods \u2014 sometimes the very survival \u2014 of countless people depend on them.The causes of this disaster are clear enough. The impact of rising water temperatures caused by climate change was compounded by the El Ni\u00f1o cycle and by an underwater heat wave. This year, in a survey of 520 reefs that form the northern section of the Great Barrier Reef, scientists found only four free of bleaching. About 620 miles of previously pristine reef had been affected.\u201cI knew there was bleaching but not to this degree,\u201d Flannery told me. \u201cFor me, it was almost like watching my father die, seeing his organism slowly shut down.\u201dSo it\u2019s coral versus coal, the earth\u2019s health against a big industry, and science versus the Abbott-inspired denial gang. As if to illustrate Australia\u2019s divisions, Queensland\u2019s environment minister, alluding to climate change, warned last month of the need to \u201creduce as many pressures\u201d as possible on the Great Barrier Reef just after the state approved leases for what would be Australia\u2019s largest coal mine.Malcolm Turnbull, the Liberal Party prime minister who replaced Abbott and faces a tight election in early July, knows exactly what\u2019s at stake. In 2010, he called for moving to a situation \u201cwhere all or almost all of our energy comes from zero or very near zero emissions sources.\u201d He described forecasts of the devastating effects of climate change as likely erring \u201con the conservative side.\u201d He called for \u201cexpenditures today so as to safeguard our children.\u201d He advocated concentrated solar thermal power, calling it \u201ca more proven technology than clean coal.\u201d Global warming, he declared, would lead, if unchecked, to \u201ctruly catastrophic consequences.\u201dThe state of the Great Barrier Reef is one such consequence. Yet, Turnbull, beholden to Abbott\u2019s right wing of the Liberal Party, has, as leader, done his best to forget what he said six years ago. Climate change? What climate change? \u201cI\u2019ve known Turnbull for 30 years, I know what he believes, but he\u2019s fallen victim to his tribe,\u201d Flannery told me.That\u2019s a great pity. The reef is as irreplaceable as this planet. Australia has overcapacity in electricity generation. It should close several of its old coal-fired plants. Rich in renewable and clean-energy sources, Australia should be a leader, not a laggard, on climate change. Reputations, like the reef, are easily bleached.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Get Away With Insider Trading", "Date": "2016-05-23", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorThe prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission deserve credit, but it\u2019s a mixed victory: Neither the United States attorney nor the S.E.C. is prosecuting other people who benefited from the stock tips, including Mr. Mickelson. Why not? A serious shortfall in our law has hampered prosecutors and allowed insider traders \u2014 particularly those further down the chain of information \u2014 to dance around the rules.Our insider trading law has become overly complex and burdensome for two reasons. First, neither Congress nor the S.E.C. has ever defined \u201cinsider trading\u201d in a comprehensive way. So our laws are largely made by judges who, bound by precedent, rarely update law to fit new circumstances.Second, our laws seek to balance different goals. The United States (unlike some other nations) does not adopt a simple \u201cparity of information\u201d approach under which one cannot trade on material facts that are not publicly available. United States law also values market efficiency: We want to encourage people to seek new information about companies through legitimate research. So the law basically prohibits trading on nonpublic information only when it has been wrongfully obtained or used.He next turned to journalists, but they would not report on his findings for fear of libel suits. When he told his clients, these investors reacted immediately by dumping their stock so that the company\u2019s share price plummeted. Finally, the press paid attention, and the fraud was revealed.Mr. Dirks was widely regarded as the hero of this story, a private-market equivalent of Woodward and Bernstein. But an embarrassed S.E.C. went after Mr. Dirks for insider trading. When the case reached the Supreme Court, it, too, saw Mr. Dirks as the hero and reshaped the law to give security analysts a protective safe harbor: The \u201ctippee\u201d who is given the inside information is liable only when the \u201ctipper receives a direct or indirect personal benefit from the disclosure\u201d \u2014 in effect, a bribe of some kind.The \u201cpersonal benefit\u201d rule makes ignorance bliss. The sophisticated trader will understand that he is insulated from liability so long as he does not learn that a personal benefit was paid or promised. \u201cDon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d may become the new industry code of behavior. The rule overlooks how the \u201cfavor bank\u201d can work in a cozy industry like finance.The Newman decision is making prosecutions harder. Since he became United States attorney for the Southern District of New York in 2009, Preet Bharara has won more than 80 insider trading convictions in just a few years, but in the wake of Newman, at least 14 of those convictions have been overturned, and that number is likely to rise.Although the S.E.C. has resisted defining insider trading for decades, legislation now seems the best answer. We should eliminate the need to prove a \u201cpersonal benefit\u201d to the tipper, but not overrule the rest of the Dirks case. Thus, a trader who knows (or recklessly disregards) that his information was wrongfully obtained should be liable regardless of the benefit to the tipper. But someone who trades on market gossip or an analyst\u2019s projection should not be liable.If a presidential candidate of either party wants to show that he or she has not been \u201ccaptured\u201d by Wall Street, the best signal would be support for insider trading legislation and a promise to prod Congress to enact it. If Washington can ever agree on anything, Washington can agree on that.John C. Coffee Jr. is a professor at Columbia Law School.Advertisement"}

Trump be good or bad for your stocks?The stock market is a nervous animal that can easily find a reason to sell off sharply, but so far it has taken the rise of Mr. Trump in stride.The relatively high valuation of the stock market \u2014 it\u2019s trading at 20 times historical earnings \u2014 indicates that investors don\u2019t see any big threats from his stated policies.\u201cHow much do you think he will get enacted?\u201d said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, who isn\u2019t showing signs of worry. \u201cPoliticians are great at telling you they are very important.\u201dSo why is Wall Street not more worried? And should ordinary investors be worried that Wall Street is not worried?Then there is a belief on Wall Street that a President Trump would end up being no more than a rougher-edged version of Mitt Romney when it comes to policy. In other words, Mr. Trump would dial down his combative policies \u2014 like blocking imports from China and Mexico \u2014 once those views got him the votes needed to win the presidency. The other way this theory works: Congress and the courts prevent him from pursuing goals that could create instability, like the mass deportation of illegal immigrants.Even if Mr. Trump ended up compromising on many of his antagonistic positions, the residual tension could cause harm. The global economy has been vulnerable to political and economic shocks emanating out of one region (Europe) or country (China). The stock market dropped more than 10 percent last year after China devalued its currency by a small amount, for instance.Wall Street\u2019s apparently laid-back reaction to Mr. Trump\u2019s rise is a twist on the notion that gridlock is good for stocks. Much money has been made over the years betting that politicians don\u2019t need to be feared because they can\u2019t do much \u2014 or won\u2019t. But Mr. Trump could test this consensus view. He didn\u2019t adopt confrontational trade policies all of a sudden; he has pushed them for many years. And he has shown little appetite for compromise or bridge-building in his campaign, so why expect it if he were in the White House?It\u2019s too soon for the election to move the stock market by much. But if Mr. Trump were ahead in the fall, it wouldn\u2019t be shocking if the herd suddenly turned.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Workers Are Getting a Bit More of the Economic Pie (and Shareholders Less)", "Date": "2016-05-03", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsAmerican workers are reaping fewer of the gains of a growing economy in the form of pay and benefits. Shareholders are reaping more in the form of corporate profits. That shift has been one of the most important economic stories of the last several decades, and it is the key to understanding stagnant wages for middle-class workers and a soaring stock market in the last quarter-century.Here is what is less widely understood: That trend appears to be reversing itself.It is early and the reversal may not last. And it certainly hasn\u2019t fully undone the shift underway since the 1980s. But the numbers are quite clear that in the last couple of years workers have claimed a bigger piece of the economic pie and shareholders a smaller one.The evidence available so far in 2016 \u2014 steady growth in wages and weak earnings for publicly traded companies \u2014 suggests that the reversal is continuing this year.At the start of 2013, for example, 61 percent of national income went to pay and benefits for workers. But by the end of 2015, that had risen to 62.6 percent. (That said, in the early 1990s, that figure was around 66 percent.)If the proportion of national income going to workers in early 2013 had stayed constant, there would now be $251 billion a year less flowing into Americans\u2019 paychecks than is the case. That is about $1,900 a year per household.At the same time, corporate profits\u2019 share of national income has fallen, from 14.2 percent in the middle of 2014 to 12.1 percent by the end of 2015. That translates to $328 billion less in annual corporate profits than there would be if the earlier proportion had held.You can pick different numerators and denominators to get at the same concept \u2014 using just wages and salaries instead of total compensation, for example, or dividing by gross domestic product instead of the related concept of national income \u2014 but the same basic pattern reveals itself.A big part of the story is a steep decline in the profitability of the energy sector, reflecting a much lower price of oil and natural gas. Total corporate profits were $64 billion lower in 2015 than in 2014. A fall in the profitability of the petroleum and coal products sector accounted for $40 billion of that.There may be something broader going on that is holding back corporate profits beyond simply cheap oil. You might expect that the hit to profits in the energy sector caused by cheaper fuel would be counterbalanced by higher profits in sectors that use fuel, like airlines and trucking firms.That is where the other side of the equation \u2014 higher worker compensation \u2014 comes into play. Part of the reason corporate profits are falling appears to be that companies are having to pay their employees more.Hiring has been quite strong over three years, with millions of Americans getting jobs. That has pushed the unemployment rate steadily downward, to about 5 percent. Very gradually, a labor market that was very much tilted in favor of employers is tilting the other way.That means companies are having to work harder to attract good employees. They do that by paying higher wages and salaries (up 10 percent in 2015 compared with 2013) and more generous benefits package (up 6 percent over the two-year period).It is worth noting that this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that pay is rising by that much for the typical worker. After all, the pay for chief executives and other highly paid people counts in those compensation numbers.Still, paired with other evidence, it doesn\u2019t look as if this is solely a phenomenon of the highest-paid workers making more. For example, average hourly earnings for nonmanagerial private sector workers rose 2.56 percent in 2015 in a year of very low inflation. That number was only 1.69 percent in 2012, when inflation was higher.It is hard to say definitively what has driven these trends, but here\u2019s a try:The shift of national income toward shareholders and away from workers since the 1980s was driven in part by a decline in union power and a rise in shareholder-driven capitalism that made managers more ruthless than their predecessors in seeking to minimize salary expense. (That includes refusing to give raises and laying off employees.)That long-term trend, along with a cyclical downturn during the 2008 recession and its aftermath, left workers with very little bargaining power and shareholders with the upper hand.In the last two or three years, as the economy has firmed up, workers have regained some of that bargaining power they lost in the recession. But they have not, at this point at least, gained the power they lost over the last three decades.In the meantime, workers celebrate getting a little bit bigger piece of the economic pie, and shareholders bemoan their smaller piece.It would be better if the pie were bigger to begin with. If overall national income were rising rapidly (it decidedly isn\u2019t), there would be room for both workers and shareholders to be fat and happy. One of the great questions for the economic future is what it would take to make that happen.An earlier version of this article misstated the 2015 proportion of national income that went to pay and benefits for American workers. It was 62.6 percent, not 63.9 percentAdvertisement"}

The markets aren\u2019t even that scary.\u201d That\u2019s true. And it\u2019s also true that I can\u2019t predict when the next bad market is coming.But I can predict that another bad market will come again, eventually. And when it does, you\u2019ll want to have a plan. That\u2019s precisely why now is such a good time to hash this out. Because you don\u2019t wait until your house is in flames to buy a fire extinguisher, right?Let me set the stage for you. It\u2019s sometime in the near future. The market just got really scary, like 2008 or 2009 scary. You and I are sitting down together for lunch to talk about what you should do. We\u2019re going to start with a couple of assumptions. First, you have a portfolio that was built specifically and intentionally to give you the greatest likelihood of reaching your goals. Second, your portfolio is down 20 percent or more, and you want to sell all of your investments and go to cash because that feels safest.But before you do that, before you make this huge, drastic decision, I will have a little conversation with you. Here\u2019s how that conversation would go.Me: \u201cWhy are you invested the way you are?\u201dYou: \u201cBecause this portfolio gives me the greatest chance of meeting my goals.\u201dMe: \u201cAre your goals still the same?\u201dYou: \u201cYes, they\u2019re still the same.\u201dMe: \u201cO.K., great. Step one, you own the right portfolio. Check.\u201dYou: \u201cBut I just can\u2019t take it anymore! I\u2019ve got to sell everything.\u201dMe: \u201cGot it. Now, just so I understand, if you do that, is that going to be a permanent decision? In other words, are you getting out of the stock market forever?\u201dYou: \u201cWell, no...\u201dMe: \u201cO.K., then. So when do you think you are likely to get back in?\u201dYou: \u201cWhen things settle down!\u201dLet\u2019s hit pause again.Now we know three very important things.\u25a0 You have the right portfolio.\u25a0 You\u2019re not going to abandon the stock market permanently.\u25a0 You\u2019re going to reinvest when things clear up.Let\u2019s flesh this out a bit. I want you to imagine what it will be like when things clear up. So why don\u2019t you go ahead and answer just a few more questions from your Scary Markets Drill Sergeant:\u25a0 When the market clears up, will it be less scary than it is now?\u25a0 When the market clears up, will the economy be better?\u25a0 When the market clears up, will that guy on the financial pornography network be telling everyone and their mother to buy more stocks?\u25a0 When the market clears up, will all your neighbors and friends be sitting around the barbecue grill again chatting about investing?We all know the answers to those questions: yes, yes, yes and yes.But one last question. Drum roll please: If the market isn\u2019t scary, the economy is better, the guy on the financial pornography network is yelling \u201cbuy, buy, buy!\u201d and everyone you know is planning to invest, how do you think the market then will compare to the market now?It\u2019ll be much higher, of course!So, to review: Your plan is to sell your perfectly tailored portfolio, right now while your investments are down. Then, you\u2019re going to wait until the market improves. When it does, you\u2019re going to buy back Plan A at a much higher price.To which I say: Seriously?I hate to be annoying, but I really want to hammer this conversation home. It doesn\u2019t make a lick of sense to sell a portfolio tailored for you when the market is low, and then buy it back when the market is higher. It makes infinitely more sense to simply keep your portfolio through the scary times and tough it out. Right, soldier?Instead of doing what fear is making you want to do, just think back to your Scary Markets Drill Sergeant and remember these three things:\u25a0 You made your portfolio based on your goals.\u25a0 It still matches your goals.\u25a0 If you sell that portfolio now and buy it back later when the markets are better, all you will do is lose money.It\u2019s that simple.

{"Headline": "A Boon for Soil, and for the Environment", "Date": "2016-05-17", "News": "Supported bySpecial Report: Food for TomorrowLONDON \u2014 When Gabe Brown and his wife bought their farm near Bismarck, North Dakota, from her parents in 1991, testing found the soil badly depleted, its carbon down to just a quarter of levels once considered natural in the area. Today the Brown farm and ranch is home to a diverse and thriving mix of plants and animals. And carbon, the building block of the rich humus that gives soil its density and nutrients, has more than tripled. That is a boon not just for the farm\u2019s productivity and its bottom line, but also for the global climate.Agriculture is often cast as an environmental villain, its pesticides tainting water, its hunger for land driving deforestation. Worldwide, it is responsible for nearly a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions.Now, though, a growing number of experts, environmentalists and farmers themselves see their fields as a powerful weapon in the fight to slow climate change, their very soil a potentially vast repository for the carbon that is warming the atmosphere. Critically for an industry that must produce an ever-larger bounty to feed a growing global population, restoring lost carbon to the soil also increases its ability to support crops and withstand drought.\u201cEveryone talks about sustainable,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cWhy do we want to sustain a degraded resource? We need to be regenerative, we need to take that carbon out of the atmosphere and put it back into the cycle, where it belongs.\u201dSince people began farming, the world\u2019s cultivated soils have lost 50 percent to 70 percent of their natural carbon, said Rattan Lal, a professor of soil science at the Ohio State University. That number is even higher in parts of south Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean, he added.Globally, those depleted soils could reabsorb 80 billion to 100 billion metric tons of carbon, reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide by 38 to 50 parts per million, Mr. Lal said. That does not include the carbon that could be simultaneously sequestered into vegetation, but the numbers are significant on their own, equaling up to 40 percent of the increase in concentrations since pre-industrial times. Last year, atmospheric carbon dioxide for the first time hit a monthly average of 400 parts per million, a symbolic threshold but one that many experts say could indicate that warming will soon spiral beyond control. When carbon escapes from soil, it combines with oxygen to form carbon dioxide. Sometimes the loss is gradual, the result of plowing that leaves upturned layers of earth exposed to the elements, or of failure to replant or cover fields after harvest.Sometimes it happens more suddenly. The thick prairie sod of America\u2019s Great Plains was a rich carbon store until settlers tore it up for farms, leaving hundreds of millions of tons of topsoil to be blown away in the Dust Bowl years. The destruction of millions of acres of carbon-rich Indonesian peatlands for palm oil plantations is helping to drive climate change today.Low carbon levels leave the ground nutrient-poor, requiring ever-greater amounts of fertilizer to support crops. They also make for thin soil that is vulnerable to erosion and less able to retain water, so yields suffer quickly in times of drought.To bring levels back up, a set of techniques known as carbon farming, or regenerative farming, encourage and complement the process by which plants draw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, break it down and sequester carbon into soil. They include refraining from tilling, or turning, the soil; mixing crops together rather than growing large fields of just one type; planting trees and shrubs near or among crops; and leaving stalks and other cuttings on fields to decay.Mr. Brown keeps his fields planted for as much of the year as possible to minimize nutrient loss. When he mixes clover and oats in the same field, the clover fixes nitrogen into the soil. After the oats are harvested, livestock graze the clover and leave their manure behind.Such strategies have allowed him to stop using synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, reducing costs. And the rich soil not only yields higher volumes, but the crops are more nutritionally dense than those grown on depleted land, he says.\u201cEconomically, it\u2019s much, much, much more profitable,\u201d he said.Mr. Brown\u2019s approach is very different from the techniques of industrial-scale farming that have taken hold in the United States and other wealthy countries, where single crops stretch over many acres, and fertilizers and pesticides are used heavily.Things are worse in poorer nations, where farmers\u2019 desperation often means they are unable to care for the soil, Mr. Lal said. He recalled seeing a Mexican sharecropper carting corn straw away from the fields to sell: \u201cI said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you leave it on the land? The land will be better next year.\u2019 And he said, \u2018This land will not be mine next year, and I need money now.\u201d\u2019There is some momentum behind a shift. The French government, which helped broker last year\u2019s landmark Paris Agreement on climate change, is pushing an effort to increase soil carbon stocks by 0.4 percent annually, which it says would halt the rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.Mr. Lal called the target unrealistic, but said achieving just a quarter of that sequestration would be meaningful. In a generation, he said, agriculture could become carbon neutral, removing all the emissions it creates, for example through the energy used by farm equipment.Worldwide, 5 percent to 10 percent of growers are using regenerative, climate-friendly techniques, said Louis Bockel, a policy officer at the United Nations\u2019 Food and Agriculture Organization. That number is likely to increase, he said, as multinational institutions and wealthy nations start incorporating carbon sequestration incentives into existing aid to farmers in poor countries.\u201cMore and more additional funding will be available\u201d to encourage such efforts, Mr. Bockel added. \u201cWe are moving quite quickly on this.\u201dFarmers need financing to help them adopt new techniques, though generally only through a two-to-three-year transition period, said Eric Toensmeier, author of \u201cThe Carbon Farming Solution.\u201d That money could come through a higher price charged for foods whose cultivation encourages sequestration, via a carbon tax or through trading systems in which polluters buy credits to offset their emissions, he said. Programs known as payment for environmental services, in which governments or others pay farmers for stewardship of land, are another potential avenue.With that kind of support, the industry could be ready to do things differently, said Ceris Jones, a climate change adviser at the National Farmers Union in Britain.\u201cPeople say that farmers are pretty conservative, but actually practice can change quite quickly,\u201d she said.Another obstacle is the lack of an agreed-upon system for measuring carbon sequestration in soil, which will be required as the basis for any payments, Mr. Toensmeier said.Technically, though, many elements of carbon farming are ready to be put into practice quickly, he said. Something as simple as planting trees around fields drastically increases the amount of carbon fixed into soil, Mr. Toensmeier said.\u201cI would love to see a huge, major transformation of agriculture in the industrialized world, but if we started with just adding trees to the system we have, it\u2019s a huge gain,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can sort of meet farmers where they are\u201d It\u2019s not just crops. The earth beneath the world\u2019s grasslands, from America\u2019s Great Plains to the Tibetan Steppe and the Sahel of Africa, holds about a fifth of all soil carbon stocks, the Food and Agriculture Organization estimates. In many places that soil is badly depleted.\u201cThis land is waiting to be filled up again with carbon if we could manage it sustainably,\u201d said Courtney White, author of the book \u201cGrass, Soil, Hope.\u201dThat means moving livestock frequently so each patch of land is grazed just once a year, mimicking the patterns of the native bison that once roamed the American West, he said. The combination of stimulation during animals\u2019 brief presence and long periods of rest encourages plants to lay down more carbon, Mr. White said. With policies that encourage change, Mr. Toensmeier said, agriculture could benefit the climate rather than harming it. \u201cThere do seem to be a remarkable number of win-win opportunities, which is great news,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t hear a lot of great news about climate change.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It also serves as a display space for the trove of models meticulously assembled and decorated with historical precision by Mr. Hutchins, the obligatory hobby geek ever at his cluttered work space in the rear.Ms. Hutchins\u2019s childhood in wartime France helped foster her son\u2019s fascination with World War II model planes and other historical weaponry.He pores over the latest battleship or fighter plane made from scratch, as classical music fills the shop and his mother looks on proudly and extols her son in her strong French accent.\u201cHere, we show art and history,\u201d Ms. Hutchins said. \u201cFreddie started building models when he was 5 years old and he hasn\u2019t stopped since.

{"Headline": "Change Is in the Air for Pharmaceutical Mergers", "Date": "2016-05-10", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsThe pharmaceuticals merger mind-set may be changing. Allergan, the $87 billion maker of Botox, will devote capital to stock buybacks and paying down debt.Separately, Bill Ackman\u2019s hedge fund is selling a big part of his stake in Zoetis, the animal health company that he considered a takeover target. With luck, the two moves together signal a more subdued approach to deals.Allergan spent the last few years on an acquisition spree powered by borrowing. The decision to sell its generics business to Teva Pharmaceutical for $40.5 billion when drug stocks were peaking in July 2015, and a subsequent attempt to sell the rest of the business to Pfizer in November, indicated that Brent Saunders, the chief of Allergan, had a keen sense of how the merger and acquisition winds were blowing.With the Pfizer deal thwarted by Treasury officials last month, Allergan is reimagining itself without acquisitions as a primary strategy. There will be small deals, and Mr. Saunders isn\u2019t categorically ruling out larger ones. Even so, he says there is \u201cno greater investment than Allergan stock,\u201d suggesting a less merger-and-acquisitions-focused approach. Allergan plans to buy back up to $10 billion in shares, shrink its debt load and fund research and development.Mr. Ackman\u2019s reported $800 million sale of Zoetis shares also suggests a cooler deal market. After a bad run, led by his soured bet on another once-acquisitive pharmaceuticals company, Valeant, his Pershing Square could be in need of extra liquidity, or there may simply be better opportunities. The investment in 2014, however, was largely based on the idea that Zoetis would be bought.After Zoetis was spun off from Pfizer, Mr. Ackman\u2019s fund installed a board director and called the company a \u201cscarce asset,\u201d essentially hanging out a for-sale sign. Shrinking his fund\u2019s position implies that a sale may be less likely as buyers like Valeant head for the sidelines.Health care mergers and acquisitions have accelerated out of control. A record volume of deals were announced last year even after stripping out the $160 billion union of Pfizer and Allergan. Tax benefits overshadowed strategic sense. Valuations and premiums soared. Regulators then got worried. If the pace is indeed slowing, as Tuesday\u2019s news implies, it could be an encouraging sign of a renewed commitment to developing drugs instead of just overpaying for them.Advertisement"}

The company made more money by charging retailers to use its platforms, which connect vendors small and large with China\u2019s growing ranks of connected consumers.But the figures, covering the fourth quarter of the company\u2019s fiscal year, also showed stalling growth in the volume of sales over its platforms. Gross merchandise volume, a closely watched measure of the transactions on the company\u2019s websites, grew 24 percent compared with the same period a year earlier, about the same pace in the prior quarter.\u201cChinese consumers, with their healthy balance sheets and ability to spend, will propel China\u2019s shift from an export- and investment-led economy to a consumption-driven economy,\u201d Mr. Tsai said.For American investors, Alibaba has become a proxy for the Chinese economy. Though a sizable portion of China\u2019s retail sales take place on Alibaba\u2019s marketplace websites \u2014 Chinese consumers spent almost $500 billion on Alibaba last year \u2014 the company\u2019s sales growth outperformed the rise in transactions on its site.The results also showed the growing toll that Alibaba\u2019s forays into hypercompetitive areas outside its core business are taking on its finances. It said that its Koubei business, which allows Chinese consumers to order food and other items and services on their smartphones, had generated $135 million in losses for its parent company in the quarter.In his post, Mr. Tsai pointed to the patience involved in creating the company\u2019s Taobao marketplace, now the major sales driver of the company. He said the company would take a similar long-term view and continue spending on new businesses it thinks can help it grow.Still, Alibaba has made progress making more money from its main business.Unlike Amazon.com in the United States, which keeps its own inventory and sells directly to customers, Alibaba serves as a middleman and makes money from getting vendors on its services to buy advertising and other services. Although the amount spent on Alibaba\u2019s marketplaces has grown about 20 percent this quarter and last, its revenue from ads and commissions on those sites has grown 30 percent or more. In the longer term, investors expect those numbers to align more closely, meaning slower sales growth.Still, Chi Tsang, an HSBC analyst in Hong Kong, pointed to its continued strong cash position and dominance in online shopping as advantages. \u201cPeople don\u2019t think about how much cash this company generates,\u201d he said.Alibaba said on Thursday that sales rose 39 percent in the fourth quarter, to $3.75 billion. Gross merchandise volume rose 24 percent, to $115 billion. Its profit rose more than 80 percent, to $832 million. Minus one-time items, the company posted a profit of 3.02 renminbi, or 46 cents, a share, lower than the 3.60 renminbi a share that analysts had expected.Advertisement"}

But that country has a history of yellow fever vaccination and the spread was relatively slow, Dr. Aylward said. In China, there have been no more cases in a month and all workers traveling to or from Africa are now vaccinated, he said. Many Chinese workers are in Africa building roads and bridges, and employed in oil fields and other industries.There is no treatment for yellow fever, which is related to dengue, Zika and West Nile viruses, and it is spread by the same Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.Unlike the Zika virus, it is not known to cause microcephaly in babies, but it is often lethal in itself, killing through high fevers, liver damage and organ failure.The four manufacturers can make up to 80 million doses a year at full capacity, Dr. Aylward said. The emergency committee was convened partly to consider whether, if the threat of a global epidemic loomed, it would make medical sense to dilute doses to stretch supplies.That idea was rejected because the outbreak appears to be coming under control. Dr. Tomori said the next step would be to build up enough capacity to routinely vaccinate children in the tropics everywhere there is risk.Yellow fever normally circulates in monkeys, and human outbreaks are usually limited to jungle villages, logging camps and mining areas. But Luanda has more than six million people.After more than five million Angolans were vaccinated, cases in Luanda dropped. New clusters appeared in several of the country\u2019s provinces and spread to other countries and China, but vaccination now appears to be containing them.Dilution would be considered again only \u201cif we get any other outbreaks that turn explosive,\u201d Dr. Aylward said.Advertisement"}

The fund, Eaglevale Hellenic Opportunity, had raised $25 million from investors to buy Greek bank stocks and government debt.Eaglevale Partners, a Manhattan hedge fund firm founded by Mr. Mezvinsky and two former Goldman Sachs colleagues, raised money for the Hellenic fund at a time when some on Wall Street had hopes for a revival in the Greek economy. For a time, Mr. Mezvinsky appeared at hedge fund conferences promoting the Greece investment thesis.Betting on Greece has proved to be tricky \u2014 some investors have made huge gains while others have had their fingers burned, depending on the timing of their bets.And the last 17 months have been especially difficult for a number of hedge funds, even ones run by some of the best-known managers.The average hedge fund was down 0.63 percent in the first quarter of this year, according to the HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index.Mr. Mezvinsky and his partners began raising money in 2011 from investors for the firm\u2019s flagship fund. Since then, that portfolio has posted uneven performance.It is not clear why Eaglevale waited until this year to close the Hellenic fund, which already had lost about 40 percent of its value by early last year.The economic situation in Greece is still tenuous as the country continues to squabble with other eurozone nations and its creditors about how to reduce its debt burden. Investors on Wall Street continue to promote investment in Greece nonetheless.During a recent Sohn Investment Conference charity event at Lincoln Center in New York, Richard Deitz, of the hedge fund VR Capital Group, told an audience of investors that he was betting on Greek banks and government bonds.In letters to investors in 2014, Mr. Mezvinsky and his partners expressed confidence that Greece would soon be on the path to a \u201csustainable recovery.\u201d But by the end of that year, Eaglevale\u2019s leaders began to acknowledge that their perspective on the situation in Greece may have been wrong. The fund had earlier stopped taking in new money.The one silver lining for the fund\u2019s investors from all of this is that they will have a somewhat larger tax loss on investments to claim next year.Steve Eder contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "State Officials Investigated Over Their Inquiry Into Exxon Mobil\u2019s Climate Change Research", "Date": "2016-05-19", "News": "Supported bySince last November, a growing number of state attorneys general have been pointing their fingers at Exxon Mobil, investigating whether the energy company\u2019s research about climate change conflicted directly with its public statements on the issue.But now the accusers are being accused, with a battle being waged over principles of free speech, government overreach and collaboration with activist organizations.The attorneys general, Mr. Smith said, are doing the bidding of environmental activists who set out to make pariahs of Exxon Mobil and its industry in pursuit of policies to limit climate change.Those activists and the attorneys general, Mr. Smith said in the letter, have secretly collaborated in the years since a two-day workshop in 2012 \u201cto act under the color of law to persuade attorneys general to use their prosecutorial powers to stifle scientific discourse, intimidate private entities and individuals, and deprive them of their First Amendment rights and freedoms.\u201dStatements made by Exxon Mobil \u2013 including executives and its own scientists \u2013 about climate change over the years.Over time, discussions of legal action involved the Rockefeller family philanthropies, the environmental campaigner Bill McKibben\u2019s 350.org, the Al Gore-founded Climate Reality Project, Greenpeace, and eventually, representatives of Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s office.The state officials have countered that there was nothing nefarious or even unusual about prosecutors consulting with outside experts, including scientists and their counterparts in other states, when gathering facts for an investigation.Eric Soufer, a spokesman for Mr. Schneiderman, said, \u201cIt is remarkable that a do-nothing Congress that has refused to take any action on climate change is now attempting to disrupt this important investigation into potential corporate malfeasance.\u201d The office did not take part in the 2012 meeting, he said. He added, \u201cspeaking with outside experts is a routine part of the investigative process, and we make decisions based on the merits, period.\u201d\u201cThe irony of this letter is breathtaking,\u201d Mr. Soufer said. \u201cIts signatories appear to be part of a multipronged media campaign funded by the fossil fuel industry aimed at suppressing the free exchange of ideas among scientists, academics and responsible law enforcement.\u201dHe added, \u201cAnyone who thinks that Attorney General Schneiderman will be intimidated by this effort has no idea who they\u2019re dealing with.\u201dBut Mr. Schneiderman has said, \u201cThe First Amendment, ladies and gentlemen, doesn\u2019t give you the right to commit fraud.\u201dThe company also said that it \u201crecognizes the risks posed by climate change,\u201d and the accusations are based on the \u201cpreposterous\u201d claim that the company \u201creached definitive conclusions about anthropogenic climate change before the world\u2019s experts\u201d and withheld it.The company shared its findings in peer-reviewed publications, it said.Mr. Walker has gone beyond New York\u2019s efforts by including subpoenas to private organizations like the free-market oriented Competitive Enterprise Institute, looking for evidence that the company funded such groups to spread its message to oppose regulation and sow doubt about climate science.Noting that the company has no \u201cphysical presence\u201d in the Virgin Islands, Exxon Mobil called Mr. Walker\u2019s actions a \u201cflagrant misuse of law enforcement power.\u201dThe new letter from Mr. Smith, which he also sent to 16 other attorneys general, comes as Exxon Mobil\u2019s allies have intensified their own attack on the attorneys general.Mr. Walker did not respond to a request for comment, but his lawyers have sent a letter to a lawyer for the Competitive Enterprise Institute noting that the investigation \u201cis not targeting C.E.I.,\u201d but is simply seeking production of documents related to the investigation of Exxon.The groups cited by Mr. Smith also received copies of the letter, demanding that they turn over documents related to their efforts.The Rockefellers, whose patriarch John Rockefeller built the family fortune with the company that is now as Exxon Mobil, have been increasingly critical of the company and its industry.Another group that received the Smith letter is Greenpeace USA. Annie Leonard, its executive director, said \u201cAmerica\u2019s least respected politicians have now courageously stepped up to defend one of America\u2019s most hated corporations from scrutiny.\u201dThe 13 signers of the Smith letter, she noted, \u201chave been paid millions in campaign contributions from coal, oil and gas companies, so this letter is more proof that the system works \u2014 for corporations.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": " PAID FOR AND POSTED BY To stamp out polio, health workers have had to travel to remote villages, sometimes risking their lives in politically unstable areas. Some have ridden for hours on motorbikes in 100-degree heat, while others carried the vaccines in canoes across rivers. Those working to eradicate polio not only have to contend with poor roads and searing temperatures. They also have had to work in isolation without ways to easily share data, best practices, or ideas. That\u2019s begun to change with the advent of emergency operations centers (EOCs). Developed during the battle against polio in Nigeria, EOCs are centralized management units now in operation in the two remaining polio-endemic countries \u2014 Pakistan and Afghanistan. They serve as data centers and hubs where all partners \u2014 from national governments to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and health specialists \u2014 gather to review the latest developments and strategize, often on a daily basis.The EOCs have provided the infrastructure, technology, accountability and coordination needed to help deliver success, sending incidence of the disease plummeting, and putting polio on the brink of being wiped from the planet.It is a remarkable achievement. As recently as the 1950s, the disease, which can be fatal or cause irreversible paralysis, spread rapidly not only in developing countries but also across Europe and the U.S. Polio was a leading cause of disability in the pre-vaccine era. \u201cOne of the key components was logistics and making sure safe vaccines were available on the ground,\u201d says Reza Hossaini, head of the polio team at Unicef, which has played a critical role in the global campaign.Eradication efforts, however, have not been made easier as the number of cases shrinks. Health workers must travel to ever-more remote and sometimes politically unstable areas to deliver vaccines and monitor progress. EOCs have emerged as a powerful platform in coordinating the final stages of the eradication effort. \u201cThey play a key role,\u201d says Michel Zaffran, director of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative at the WHO. \u201cThey are the one-stop-shop where all the data is accumulated and all the partners are sitting round the table and analyzing the data and making decisions on how it should be interpreted and how activities should be implemented.\u201d\u201cWe had the human resources, but what was missing was the coordination,\u201d says Dr. Andrew Etsano, incident manager at Nigeria\u2019s National Polio Emergency Operations Center. \u201cWe were able to bring all of the partners together under one roof, and they were able to harmonize all the different analyses under one system.\u201dIn northern Nigeria, setting up these kinds of facilities was not easy. \u201cThe quality of buildings is quite poor,\u201d says Evelyn Castle, executive director and co-founder of eHealth Africa (eHA). \u201cYou can\u2019t get high quality equipment and printers. And in Kano state, where one of the first EOCs was, you might see two hours of public power a day if you\u2019re lucky, so you\u2019re running off a generator.\u201dWith Gates Foundation funding, modern structures were renovated and furniture was brought in, as well as high-quality printers and TV monitors that could display data. Local telecommunications companies brought fiber-optic Internet connections for videoconferencing and other services to the region. Satellite technology enabled detailed mapping of the region so that teams did not miss even the smallest, most remote settlement.Technology and data are not the only factors behind the success of the EOCs. \u201cIt became a center where all partners came under one roof, and had one approach, one plan, all decisions were very participatory,\u201d says Unicef\u2019s Hossaini. \u201cSo everyone was reading from the same page.\u201dAt the heart of the EOCs\u2019 operations is a small strategy group made up of representatives from government, WHO, Unicef and CDC. This collaborative, multidisciplinary approach underpins the success of the EOCs. \u201cIf polio is considered an emergency, we have to act as if it\u2019s an emergency and cut across the bureaucracy,\u201d says Melissa Corkum, polio eradication chief in Unicef\u2019s Afghanistan country office who until January worked in Nigeria. \u201cSo we sit together, we have the data at our fingertips, and based on the data, we make decisions quickly.\u201dSays Etsano: \u201cWe brought an efficiency into the program. We enforced accountability and brought in a lot of new tools. And we did a lot of granular data analysis, looking at issues and deploying resources to those areas that we really needed to focus on.\u201dWhile the EOCs are playing a central role in wiping out polio, Castle says that it is important to remember the work done by the campaign\u2019s foot soldiers who travel to remote settlements, where they not only vaccinate children but also become an important part of the community. \u201cThese people have been trained to put a drop of vaccine in a child\u2019s mouth. But really what they\u2019ve had to do is to learn how to work with the communities,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re there to talk to people, see how they\u2019re doing and hear about their concerns \u2014 it\u2019s so much more than a vaccination campaign.\u201dGiven the track record of the EOCs in Nigeria, the model has been introduced to Afghanistan and Pakistan, where it is hoped that coordinated action and accountability will help those working to eradicate the disease succeed.In 2014, polio cases jumped sharply across several parts of Pakistan. Part of the problem was coordination and communication, says Senator Ayesha Raza Farooq, Prime Minister's Focal Person for Polio Eradication. \u201cWhile the national level of the government was talking about how polio was a health emergency, clearly it was not a priority of provincial or district administrations everywhere,\u201d she says.There were also multiple agencies at work but no central place for them to coordinate their efforts.Pakistan\u2019s six EOCs \u2014 one at the federal level in Islamabad, four in provincial capitals and one in the nation\u2019s federally administered territory \u2014 have all become fully operational since late 2015.Each day begins with a morning meeting where team leads reports progress and challenges. There are additional meetings and video conferences among the EOCs as well as coordination with EOCs in Afghanistan. Teams are trained, and data is analyzed. Vaccination campaigns are planned and closely monitored as they are underway. After completion, each is reviewed for learnings that can applied to the next campaign.\u201cThe culture that we have created here is to have one family, one team working under one roof,\u201d Farooq says. \u201cOf course the government in the end has to endorse everything, but we\u2019re really deliberating on every issue together.\u201dBefore EOCs, groups not only worked independently but they also assessed their own performance. Today, independent firms monitor each campaign and report on successes and failures. This process of continuous learning flows throughout the EOCs\u2019 operations. \u201cI don't think the program has ever been this transparent,\u201d Farooq says. \u201cWe're encouraging our local administration at the district level to unearth problems and identify issues, and discuss those issues. If you don't, we won't be able to achieve our goals.\u201dWhile the EOCs are an important strategic tool, they provide the underlying support and infrastructure for a number of solutions that are needed to defeat polio, among them information exchange and alternative forms of immunization.After polio is eradicated, new and safer vaccines and drugs will be needed to assure the virus does not return. Several partners are working with the Gates Foundation on such tools. Besides new vaccines, a technology tool has been developed for the WHO \u2014 the Polio information system, or Polis. The platform collects different sources of data and information from laboratory indicators and the quality of immunization campaigns to human resource allocation and makes it available in one place.Meanwhile, the EOCs will continue to play a critical role in wiping out the last cases of the disease. \u201cThe pieces are all here,\u201d Corkum says. \u201cNow it\u2019s about becoming a well-oiled machine.\u201dThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
{"Headline": "Exxon Investors Seek Assurance as Climate Shifts, Along With Attitudes", "Date": "2016-05-23", "News": "Supported byHOUSTON \u2014 Exxon Mobil has been under pressure for over a year to explain its handling of climate change issues in the past. Now the company faces new pressure to explain its future, particularly how it will change in response to a warming world.At the company\u2019s planned annual meeting on Wednesday in Dallas, shareholders will vote on a resolution to prod Exxon Mobil to disclose the risks of climate change to its business.Such resolutions have been floated before, and they typically do not pass. But there is a growing chorus of investors, many of them large institutional shareholders, who say they are worried that Exxon Mobil, the largest publicly traded energy company in the world, is not adequately preparing for tighter times if countries start acting on the pledges they made last December as part of the Paris climate change accord.Exxon Mobil, for example, projects that global demand for oil will keep growing \u2014 by just over 13 percent from today, to 109 million barrels of oil a day by 2040.But the International Energy Agency\u2019s projections include one situation where demand could drop by 22 percent, to 74 million barrels a day by 2040, if measures are put in place to keep global warming at levels that, while still dangerous, could avoid the most devastating consequences.The shareholder resolution calls for Exxon Mobil to publish an annual assessment of impacts of various climate change policies, including ones that would lead to the steep drops foreseen in the most severe energy agency\u2019s forecast. Another resolution calls for the company to give shareholders a bigger say over governance.Alan T. Jeffers, a company spokesman, said last week that Exxon Mobil welcomed a dialogue with shareholders.Mr. Jeffers added that his company\u2019s projection was not set in stone, and that Exxon Mobil was flexible enough to move in new directions in the future.The issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.But big owners of the stock worry that the optimism of Exxon Mobil\u2019s outlook for oil demand is dangerously misguided.\u201cInvestors can\u2019t afford to have Exxon become the next Kodak,\u201d said Scott M. Stringer, the comptroller of New York City, whose pension fund owns roughly $1 billion worth of Exxon Mobil stock.\u201cIt is impossible for them to do business for the next 100 years as they have the last 100 years,\u201d added Mr. Stringer, who supports the risk-disclosure resolution.Some protesters are exhorting investors to sell all of their fossil-fuel stocks and are conducting campaigns to pressure Exxon Mobil and other companies to \u201ckeep it in the ground\u201d \u2014 that is, to stop extracting the very fossil fuels that are their lifeblood.But many investors are more interested in Exxon Mobil\u2019s plans for the future than what the company did and said decades ago.\u201cOur concern is about looking forward,\u201d said Anne Simpson, an investment director for California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System, which is backing the disclosure resolutions. \u201cThe critical thing now is the next 25 years.\u201dMr. Jeffers noted that shareholders had withdrawn a similar disclosure resolution a few years ago when Exxon Mobil promised to report on the risks it faced because of evolving emissions policies. It concluded that there was no current risk of demand drying up to a degree that the company would have to leave some of its oil reserves in the ground, a problem known as \u201cstranded assets.\u201dThat conclusion did not satisfy Exxon Mobil\u2019s critics.\u201cThe world is changing around Exxon,\u201d said Andrew J. Logan, director of oil and gas and insurance programs at the sustainable investing organization Ceres, which backs the resolutions.He noted that the range of large shareholders promoting the resolutions included New York State, the Church of England and the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund. \u201cThe fact that this array of actors lining up against Exxon is so diverse is a powerful demonstration of just how isolated the company is at the moment,\u201d Mr. Logan said.But many investors said they would be voting with management on the climate resolution.\u201cExxon Mobil goes the extra mile to ensure they are fulfilling their role as a good steward of the environment,\u201d said Paul L. Lucas, a Midland, Tex., energy investor. \u201cThat\u2019s why it costs Exxon more money to do business because they do business the right way.\u201dChevron, which is facing a similar resolution, is having its annual meeting on Wednesday as well. Executives at Chevron say it already carefully assesses various risks to its investments.Foreign energy companies have been more receptive to such resolutions. Last year, even before the Paris agreement was completed, several large European oil companies, including Royal Dutch Shell, Statoil of Norway and BP accepted resolutions that were similar or virtually the same as those facing Exxon Mobil and Chevron.Those companies, which are based in countries where the governments and public opinion are demanding new climate change initiatives, have pledged to seek renewable energy opportunities.Analysts sympathetic to companies like Exxon Mobil and Chevron say that some of the activists, especially divestment groups on college campuses, are trying to lower the equity values of oil companies and choke off capital for exploration.That, these analysts say, would keep the benefits of cheap energy out of the hands of the poor and emerging middle classes in the developing world.But proponents of the resolutions say transparency about climate risks can help shareholders better assess their investment and prod Exxon Mobil and other companies to take part in a more sustainable future.Proponents point to a recent paper, for example, by Chatham House, a research organization based in London, that said Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Shell \u201care faced with the choice of managing a gentle decline by downsizing or risking a rapid collapse by trying to carry on business as usual.\u201dClifford Krauss reported from Houston and John Schwartz from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is This the West\u2019s Weimar Moment?", "Date": "2016-05-31", "News": "Supported bySetting aside debate about whether the rise of Nazism was built into the German DNA, there were four trends that led the country to reject its post-World War I constitutional, parliamentary democracy, known as the Weimar Republic: economic depression, loss of trust in institutions, social humiliation and political blunder. To a certain degree, these trends can be found across the West today.First, the history. The Black Friday stock-market collapse of 1929 set off a global depression. As bad as things were in America, they were even worse in Germany, where industrial production shrank by half in the following three years. Stocks lost two-thirds of their value. Deflation and unemployment rocked the country. The Weimar government, already held in low esteem by many Germans, seemed to have no clue about what to do.All this happened as traditional ways of life and values were being shaken by the modernization of the 1920s. Women suddenly went to work, to vote, to party and to sleep with whomever they wanted. This produced a widening cultural gap between the tradition-oriented working and middle classes and the cosmopolitan avant-garde \u2014 in politics, business and the arts \u2014 that reached a peak just when economic disaster struck. The elites were blamed for the resulting chaos, and the masses were ripe for a strongman to return order to society.Some people today imagine that Hitler sneaked up on Germany, that too few people understood the threat. In fact, many mainstream politicians recognized the danger but they failed to stop him. Some didn\u2019t want to: The conservative parties and the nobility believed the little hothead could serve as their useful idiot, that as chancellor he would be contained by a squad of reasonable ministers. Franz von Papen, a nobleman who was Hitler\u2019s first vice chancellor, said of the new leader, \u201cWe\u2019ve hired him.\u201dAt the same time, even the imminent threat of a fascist dictatorship couldn\u2019t persuade the left-wing parties to join forces. Instead of being conciliatory for the sake of the national interest, Ernst Th\u00e4lmann, the head of the German Communist Party, branded the center-left Social Democrats the \u201cmoderate wing of fascism.\u201d No wonder Hitler had an easy time uniting broad sections of the German public.Are we at another Weimar moment now?The 2008 financial crisis and the subsequent global recession were nowhere nearly as painful as the Great Depression. But the effects are similar. The heady growth of the 2000s led Europeans and Americans to believe they were on firm economic ground; the shattering of banks, real estate markets and governments in the wake of the crash left tens of millions of people at sea, angry at the institutions that had failed them, above all the politicians who claimed to be in charge.Why, voters ask, did the government allow so many bankers to behave like criminals in the first place? Why did it then bail out banks while letting car factories go under? Why is it welcoming millions of immigrants? Are there separate rules for the elites, defined by a hypermodern liberal worldview that ridicules the working class \u2014 and their traditional values \u2014 as yokels?In America and Europe, the rise of anti-establishment movements is a symptom of a cultural shock against globalized postmodernity, similar to the 1930s\u2019 rejection of modernity. The common accusation by the \u201cmasses\u201d is that liberal democracy has somehow gone too far, that it has become an ideology for an elite at the expense of everyone else.

{"Headline": "Bargain-Hunting Frenzy Threatens Traditional Department Stores", "Date": "2016-05-13", "News": "Supported byWomen\u2019s shoe clearance! We\u2019ve got your size! Save 20 percent!Macy\u2019s has discount fever, and signs like these pepper its sprawling flagship store in Manhattan. But while shoppers love a sale, those discounts are coming at a steep price to Macy\u2019s and the country\u2019s other large department stores.\u201cIt\u2019s poison,\u201d said Mark Cohen, the director of retail studies at Columbia Business School. \u201cThey\u2019ve created no motivation for consumers to respond to their promotions, since if you missed this week\u2019s sale you just need to wait around until next week.\u201dOr not at all. Shoppers may be addicted to discounts, but not necessarily those at the leading department stores. This week, Macy\u2019s, Nordstrom, Kohl\u2019s and J. C. Penney all reported unexpectedly weak sales, driving their stocks sharply lower.The headwinds facing department stores are coming from several directions, including from online shopping. The companies\u2019 earnings look especially bleak in comparison with the broad retail picture in the United States. On Friday, the government reported that overall retail spending had ticked higher in April.But the results this week reinforced the degree to which companies have failed to adjust to discount retail chains like Ross and the TJX companies, T. J. Maxx and Marshalls, which have spent years developing their niche and are attracting more people.Bargain-hunting, of course, is nothing new. But the hunt itself has changed. The economic collapse of 2008 forced many Americans to cling tighter to their purse strings, and forced many shoppers to more aggressively hunt for low-cost options.That spurred many consumers toward so-called off-price retailers like T. J. Maxx, Marshalls and Ross, where many have remained, according to Jharonne Martis, the director of consumer research for Thomson Reuters.\u201cDuring the recession, they were a favorite among customers,\u201d Ms. Martis said.A decade ago, Mr. Saunders said, there were sharper distinctions between the customers who shopped at Nordstrom and those who picked through the racks at off-price stores. In 2005, 5.1 percent of shoppers who regularly used off-price retailers also shopped at department stores for clothing, he said. Last year, that figure rose to 12.9 percent.\u201cPeople that used off-price and discount channels tended to be a bit more isolated,\u201d Mr. Saunders said. \u201cNow, there\u2019s a lot more customer sharing, and a lot more people who use department stores also use off-price retailers much more freely.\u201dThe difference between the products offered at the different retailers is also getting blurry. Department stores and discount chains have sold increasingly similar products. Macy\u2019s and Nordstrom may have once been associated with brands like Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren, but those labels now frequently appear in the off-price aisles as well, Ms. Martis said. That has made department stores less of a destination, she said.Still, department stores are trying to match the demand for discount shopping, slashing prices and combining points in a frenzied attempt to keep up with an increasing variety of low-cost rivals. But they have not done enough to stem the tide of losses.\u201cWhen you have a significant amount of clearance, you dilute your own brand,\u201d Ms. Martis said. \u201cThe department stores were built for a different decade.\u201dMacy\u2019s and J. C. Penney declined to comment for this article. Nordstrom and Kohl\u2019s could not be reached for comment.Ms. Martis and other retail analysts said that department stores had done a poor job of keeping up with younger consumers. Those shoppers are often cost-conscious and generally less inclined to shop at the same stores that their parents once did. The promotions might do a good job of targeting people looking for low prices, but the brands sometimes do not.At Macy\u2019s in Herald Square on Thursday, shoppers combed through entire rooms dedicated to discount shoes. But the assortment, however plentiful, may not have been for everyone. \u201cThey probably missed out on that whole sneaker thing,\u201d said Jacqui Booker, 38, who had come to Macy\u2019s to look at appliances.\u201cThe fact that they don\u2019t sell a Jordan in here is probably keeping every kid away,\u201d Ms. Booker said, referring to Air Jordan, Nike\u2019s popular athletic shoe.On Friday, J. C. Penney reported a loss of 32 cents a share, and said that sales at stores open more than a year had fallen 0.4 percent. Same-store sales at Macy\u2019s fell 5.6 percent in the first quarter.Some department stores, like Nordstrom, have been aggressive about opening their own discount chains. But while business improved at Nordstrom\u2019s discount division, Nordstrom Rack, full-price net sales fell 2.2 percent.Also on Friday, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales rose 1.3 percent in April, driven in large part by sales of automobiles and gas, along with online shopping.\u201cThe retail sales numbers underscore the shift, underscore the challenges department stores are having,\u201d said Richard Jaffe, a managing director and retail analyst with Stifel Nicolaus.Amazon represents one of those main challenges. The online shopping giant has increasingly pulled consumers away from traditional brick-and-mortar stores, and has shown every indication that it intends to grow.But while Amazon accounts for half of all e-commerce by some estimates, most shopping in the United States still happens in person. The problems at the larger department stores, Mr. Saunders argued, run deeper.\u201cAmazon plays a big part of this, but it\u2019s not the only part,\u201d Mr. Saunders said. \u201cI think retailers have to take some share of the blame themselves.\u201dIncluding, some might say, for their discounts.\u201cI think at this point,\u201d Ms. Booker said, \u201ceveryone that knows Macy\u2019s knows that you go on Sale Wednesday.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Warren Buffett Stake Suggests Apple Is All Grown Up", "Date": "2016-05-19", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseWith this week\u2019s imprimatur from the legendary investor Warren Buffett, it should now be official: Apple, the world\u2019s largest company by market capitalization and a symbol of American technological innovation, is a \u201cvalue\u201d stock.That may prove to be a decidedly mixed blessing.Mr. Buffett is the world\u2019s most prominent and successful proponent of value investing \u2014 an approach that seeks stocks that are undervalued and sell for less than their \u201cintrinsic value,\u201d as Benjamin Graham put it his 1949 classic \u201cThe Intelligent Investor.\u201d Mr. Buffett credits Mr. Graham with shaping his own approach to investing.\u201cWe\u2019ve just looked at it again,\u201d said Bill Smead, who manages the Smead Value Fund, one of the most successful large-cap value mutual funds over the last five years, according to Morningstar. \u201cAnybody that discounts the thinking at Berkshire Hathaway does so at their peril, in my opinion.\u201dValue stocks are typically unpopular among many investors, their shares often battered by disappointing short-term revenue and earnings results. They usually trade at very low price-to-earnings ratios, a common valuation measure. Nonetheless, some academic studies have suggested that over time, they outperform other stocks, in part because expectations are so low.Apple \u201cis going to attract more value investors,\u201d said Toni Sacconaghi, a senior analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein who covers Apple. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for beaten-down stocks with negative sentiment. Apple has traded below a market multiple for years and sentiment has become increasingly pessimistic, especially over the past month.\u201dMr. Sacconaghi has a buy recommendation on the stock, \u201cnot because we believe this will be a high-growth company going forward, but because the current price is discounting a decline in cash flow forever, and we think that\u2019s overly pessimistic.\u201dAccording to the market research firm Thomson Reuters Lipper, just 69 of 357 actively managed value funds in the United States \u2014 fewer than 20 percent \u2014 currently hold positions in Apple.That\u2019s because Apple has long been considered a quintessential growth stock: one of the glamorous high-flying cousins to dowdy value stocks. Growth investors think growth stocks are undervalued, too, because they expect their earnings to grow faster (often much faster) than other investors recognize.As a result, valuation measures for growth stocks can go sky-high. In two prominent growth-stock examples, shares of Facebook trade at a price-earnings ratio of about 73, and Netflix at about 312. (The price-earnings average for stocks in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is currently about 24.)This week Apple\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio was just over 10.If Apple is now a value stock, though, plenty of growth investors haven\u2019t gotten the message. Among actively managed growth funds, 249 of 619, or 40 percent, hold Apple shares, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper. That\u2019s more than the 230 growth funds that owned Apple stock in 2014.Should growth funds suddenly decide that Apple no longer meets their criteria, there could be a mass exodus that would be only partly offset by new purchases from value investors.Some prominent value investors aren\u2019t convinced Apple really is a value stock, despite Mr. Buffett\u2019s blessing, or that its stock price is significantly below its intrinsic value. (Intrinsic value considers all aspects of a business, including both tangible and intangible factors.)That means Apple could fall into the neutral zone of stocks that are neither growth \u2014 because they aren\u2019t growing fast enough \u2014 or value, because they\u2019re still not cheap enough.\u201cApple is extraordinarily cheap, but it\u2019s never been a value stock in the traditional sense,\u201d said Bruce Greenwald, who runs the value investing program at Columbia Business School and is a co-author of \u201cValue Investing: From Graham to Buffett and Beyond\u201d (Wiley, 2001).\u201cValue investing has always focused primarily on asset value,\u201d Professor Greenwald told me. Apple\u2019s book value, or asset value, of $130 billion isn\u2019t even close to its market capitalization of about $515 billion.That means, in theory, that other companies could replicate Apple\u2019s assets at relatively low cost, produce rival products and undermine Apple\u2019s enviably high profit margins.Tech companies typically have low asset values relative to their share prices \u2014 one reason Mr. Buffett and other value investors long shunned the sector \u2014 but their patented technologies and intellectual property nonetheless often create formidable barriers to entry by competitors.For an extraordinarily high-profit-margin technology company like Apple, the question is whether there are such \u201cmoats,\u201d as value investors like to put it, that will continue to protect it from these competitive threats.\u201cThat\u2019s always been the issue with Apple,\u201d Professor Greenwald said. \u201cHow sustainable are these profit levels and how big are the barriers? The fear with Apple is that it will get overwhelmed by new entry and new competitors. The moat doesn\u2019t seem that big. It\u2019s not just giant rivals like Samsung, but smaller companies that can survive with even a small share of the smartphone market.\u201dMr. Smead told me this week he had not added Apple to his value fund\u2019s holdings, even though the stock is so cheap that it meets many of his fund\u2019s investing criteria.\u201cOver the past five or six years, when Apple was doing so well, we joked that we were the best-performing large-cap fund that didn\u2019t own Apple,\u201d Mr. Smead said. \u201cNot that we didn\u2019t wrestle with it many times.\u201d\u201cOur difficulty has been that we don\u2019t understand what kind of moat protects their technology over the next 10 years,\u201d Mr. Smead continued. \u201cThat\u2019s the main problem. The other is that, given Apple\u2019s huge success and its sheer magnitude, it needs a monstrous new product or enhancement of an existing product to move the needle on growth.\u201dFor their part, many growth investors were startled on April 26 when Apple reported its first quarterly revenue drop since 2003. Both revenue and earnings fell short of analyst estimates, and Apple shares plunged 8 percent in one day. They rallied some this week on news of the Berkshire Hathaway investment, but are still down sharply from where they were as recently as mid-April.But Apple still has defenders among growth investors.At the end of the year, Apple was the second-largest holding in the Upright Growth Fund, the top-performing large-cap growth fund so far this year, according to Morningstar.\u201cApple\u2019s best and fastest growing days may be behind us,\u201d David Chiueh, Upright Growth\u2019s president and fund manager, told me. \u201cBut even growth-oriented funds like ours don\u2019t just contain high-growth stocks with 35-50 percent growth rates in our portfolio.\u201dHe said such rapid growth was not sustainable, and added that he was happy with companies that showed \u201csolid 8 percent to 12 percent earnings growth,\u201d a category in which he included Apple. \u201dGive them some time and they will show outstanding performance,\u201d he said.Mr. Chiueh said he was also encouraged that Apple had stepped up its spending on research and development, suggesting that new products with strong growth prospects might still be in the offing.At some fund families, Apple seems to be both a value and a growth stock, even though that seems contradictory. At the fund giant Vanguard, Apple is a major holding in the Vanguard Windsor and Windsor II funds (both value funds) and the Vanguard Morgan Growth Fund and US Growth Fund. A Vanguard spokeswoman declined to comment.All of which suggests that when it comes to Apple, \u201cvalue\u201d and \u201cgrowth\u201d may be in the eye of the beholder.Still, Mr. Buffett\u2019s announcement this week underscores that Apple\u2019s once sizzling growth has slowed, and suggests it may well be on the inexorable path from growth to value stock.That\u2019s not an especially good portent for investors. Among technology companies that have already made the same transition, Professor Greenwald cited IBM, Intel, Cisco, Microsoft and Dell, companies whose share prices, after great rocket rides, have mostly languished in recent years. (Dell was taken private in 2013.)For those who failed to buy the stock early enough, \u201cas investments, they all turned out pretty badly,\u201d he noted.Berkshire Hathaway also disclosed this week that it had increased the stake in IBM it first acquired in 2011. IBM shares have declined over the period, but by Mr. Buffett\u2019s long-term standards, the investment is still too new to judge.\u201cIf you believe the iPhone will be the global standard in 25 years, you\u2019d buy\u201d Apple stock, Professor Greenwald said. But many value investors have already seen where smartphones can go, \u201cwhich is where PCs have already gone.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Climate Change Activists Either Prod Exxon Mobil or Dump It", "Date": "2016-05-25", "News": "Supported byDALLAS \u2014 Fight or flight?Those are, in essence, the two very different approaches that the activist community is taking with Exxon Mobil these days.One group is made up of investors who want to hold on to their stakes in the company and prod the oil and gas giant, through shareholder resolutions and by applying steady pressure, to adopt new policies that reflect the realities of climate change.The other major group is campaigning to make Exxon Mobil a pariah and is urging big institutional shareholders to dump all their fossil-fuel stocks.Both groups showed up in force on Wednesday at Exxon\u2019s annual shareholder meeting here. Outside, several dozen protesters waved signs reading \u201cARREST EXXON\u201d and \u201cKEEP IT IN THE GROUND,\u201d and chanted slogans like \u201cExxon lies, oceans rise!\u201d and \u201cWindmills, not toxic spills!\u201d\u201cOur voice has been very important,\u201d said Sister Daly, on corporate policies that affect sustainability and human rights.The climate resolutions were voted down on Wednesday, but a \u201cproxy access\u201d resolution that called for the company to give large shareholders a bigger say over corporate governance passed with nearly 62 percent of the votes. Two other proposals related to corporate governance also passed.A proposal calling for the company to report on how climate change regulations would affect its business received 38.2 percent of the vote. Advocates said that was the biggest showing ever for a climate resolution at an Exxon meeting and a sign of increasing support for such measures over time.\u201cWe believe that addressing the risk of climate change is a global issue\u201d that will require the cooperation of governments, business and individuals, he said, and he repeated the company\u2019s support of a carbon tax.Mr. Tillerson also predicted that oil and gas would long be an important part of the company\u2019s mix, because \u201cabundant energy supplies are vital for modern life.\u201dDemand for oil and gas will remain high, he said, though \u201cstringent energy policies will increase the cost of carbon dioxide emissions over time.\u201d That would further depress the fortunes of coal, he added, but would bolster the use of natural gas, nuclear power and renewable energy.The company, he said, had worked tirelessly \u201cto understand and reduce the risk of climate change.\u201dThe activist shareholders, of course, disagree, and are impatient to see Exxon Mobil change its ways. But is one approach more effective than the other?Some have a big-tent philosophy, seeing the value in efforts to both work with and assail the company.By his count, there have been 62 shareholder resolutions asking Exxon Mobil to act on climate change, and none have passed, as a majority of shareholders have sided with management to vote them down.\u201cIt might finally be time for shareholders of conscience to simply break ties with this company,\u201d he said. \u201cFool me 62 times, shame on me \u2014 and in fairly large quantities.\u201dYet on college campuses, where the movement began roughly four years ago, divestment drives appear to be meeting some resistance. This spring\u2019s crop of protests on campus did not produce major victories at premier schools.At New York University last month, 18 students occupied a campus elevator for 33 hours. The elevator led to the offices of top administrators; the school threatened the students with suspension \u2014 which could have made it impossible for them to enter on-campus housing or to take their final exams \u2014 and contacted their parents.Olivia Rich, one of the protesters, said parents began calling them, saying, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get out of the elevator!\u201d Although the school did not agree to sell any investments, N.Y.U. did agree to some of the students\u2019 demands, including a meeting with the school\u2019s investment committee.The issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.\u201cI would say it was a win,\u201d Ms. Rich said.The divestment activists say their push makes economic as well as moral sense. They argue that oil and other energy companies will inevitably face a reckoning, just like the coal industry, now that most nations have pledged to take the steps necessary to slow global warming after last year\u2019s climate talks in Paris.Those costs, wrote Professor Hendrik Bessembinder of Arizona State University, the author of the report, would \u201crange between approximately 2 and 12 percent of the endowment\u2019s value, which, for a typical large university endowment, would translate to a decline in value of between $1.4 billion and $7.4 billion\u201d over a 20-year period.But those organizing the protests say that focusing on the losses of individual funds misses the point. As with the campus divestment protests about South African apartheid in the 1980s, much of the activism is focused on changing the national \u2014 and global \u2014 conversation.\u201cStudents are leading the way and shifting the narrative on climate,\u201d said Sara Blazevic, the campus strategy coordinator of the Fossil Fuel Divestment Student Network. \u201cWe are winning the fight over the story of the climate crisis.\u201dAnd in a much-debated decision, the American Geophysical Union declined to drop Exxon as a sponsor at events such as a student breakfast during the group\u2019s fall meeting.The Methodist decision, like many others, is at least in part about staying in the game as the more effective way to lobby for change.\u201cIf we divested tomorrow, we\u2019re not going to put Exxon Mobil out of business,\u201d said Thomas P. DiNapoli, New York State comptroller. \u201cAnd one of the things we will lose is the ability to move them in a different direction as a shareholder.\u201dThe divestment fight, he argued, glosses over shared responsibility for climate change.\u201cEvery organization, every business, has a fossil fuel footprint,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a real challenge out there that goes beyond whether you have Exxon Mobil stock.\u201dThat responsibility, he added, is personal as well.\u201cIt\u2019s great to say you\u2019re for divestment,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you get in your car and fill the gas tank on the way to the rally, it undercuts your argument.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Start-Ups Once Showered With Cash Now Have to Work for It", "Date": "2016-05-20", "News": "Supported by\u201cThe talks were much more thorough\u201d with investors this time, Mr. Hitchcock said, adding that he had been thinking about resigning as chief executive before the fund-raising round.Now investors have the advantage. Instead of venture capitalists begging to be allowed to invest, entrepreneurs are coming to them begging for cash. Investors are exerting their newfound power by asking more questions about a start-up\u2019s prospects and taking more time to invest. Some are pushing for management changes or for financing terms that would help cushion any losses they might face.\u201cVenture capitalists are putting founders through everything short of a proctology exam before they invest,\u201d said Venky Ganesan, a partner at Menlo Ventures, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm.The changing balance of power is evident in the numbers. Venture capitalists have put less money into start-ups in the United States in the last two quarters, according to the National Venture Capital Association; funding dropped 11 percent to $12.1 billion in the first quarter from a year earlier. With a smaller capital pie, entrepreneurs have to work harder for a piece.\u201cInvestors have materially more time to do diligence than before,\u201d said Ben Ling, a partner at venture capital firm Khosla Ventures. \u201cAcross our portfolio, even for the best companies, fund-raising is a longer process.\u201dMr. Ling added that while particularly strong companies were being funded as always, valuations for others were generally flat to about 20 percent lower than this time last year.One start-up whose valuation was recently reduced was CARD. com, an online banking start-up. The Los Angeles-based company closed a $5.5 million financing round in February that valued it lower than its last funding round in December 2014, something known in industry parlance as a down round.Ben Katz, CARD.com\u2019s chief executive, said it was growing by 3,000 new accounts a day, had its first month with $1 million in revenue in February and should have $1 billion in new deposits this year. Even so, Mr. Katz, 37, was pragmatic about taking money at a lower valuation.\u201cEntrepreneurs shouldn\u2019t be too stressed by a down round as long as they are getting the capital they need to build their vision,\u201d he said.Venture capital firms that might have invested outside of their comfort zone in boom times have now reverted to form, said Justin Langseth, chief executive of Zoomdata, a data analytics start-up. When he tried to raise money at the end of last year, many venture capitalists deemed Zoomdata, which is four years old, too big or too small for their liking, he said.Mr. Stein, 36, said some start-ups were postponing fund-raising in the hope that they would have more leverage later. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to build more traction,\u201d he said.With the shifting power balance come shifting messages from investors. Whereas investors once worshiped growth at nearly any cost at a start-up, many are now more concerned about profitability, entrepreneurs said.Justin Yoshimura, 25, who invests in young companies and is chairman of the online jewelry business Ice.com, said his start-ups had generally eschewed raising large amounts of money to control spending. Yet some investors in recent years encouraged him and the companies he has invested in to take a lot of money and spend it on marketing and other growth tactics.Now he is bemused to hear that investors are suggesting smaller rounds, less spending and a focus on not losing money.\u201cEveryone told us we were wrong last year, that we needed to spend,\u201d Mr. Yoshimura said. \u201cNow when you say you\u2019re profitable, everyone wants to invest.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Big Insurers Send a Wake-Up Call to Hedge Fund Investors", "Date": "2016-05-12", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseLike many sophisticated investors, the nation\u2019s largest insurers drank the hedge fund Kool-Aid, pouring billions into the high-fee investment funds and helping drive hedge fund assets to over $3 trillion.Now comes the hangover.Steep losses in hedge fund investments during the last quarter damaged many insurance company earnings, reinforcing decisions to rethink the premises that led them to follow the Pied Pipers of finance in the first place.The American International Group said it would cut its hedge fund exposure in half, to $5.5 billion by the end of 2017 from $11 billion at the end of last year. MetLife said it would slash its hedge fund portfolio by two-thirds, to $600 million from $1.8 billion.The pain from the last quarter has shown up most visibly in recent insurers\u2019 results, but it is also spreading to pension funds, endowments and other giant investment funds. Last month, New York City\u2019s largest pension fund said it was abandoning hedge funds entirely, and the Illinois State Board of Investment voted to reduce its hedge fund portfolio by $1 billion.\u201cThey\u2019re finally getting the mediocre results they deserve,\u201d said Simon Lack, an early skeptic about hedge funds and author of \u201dThe Hedge Fund Mirage: The Illusion of Big Money and Why It\u2019s Too Good to Be True.\u201d\u201cI imagine you\u2019ll see more and more institutional investors re-examining their commitment to hedge funds,\u201d Mr. Lack added, \u201cas they see what they\u2019re getting for those outrageously high fees they pay.\u201dListen to the chorus of recent hedge fund criticism. Warren E. Buffett blasted their high fees and mediocre performance at his recent investors\u2019 conference in Omaha. The activist investor and hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb called their recent performance \u201ccatastrophic\u201d in his latest letter to investors.Even the legendary hedge fund manager Steven A. Cohen, whose fund averaged 30 percent annual returns before Mr. Cohen\u2019s close brush with insider trading charges, complained this month: \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to maximize returns and maximize assets.\u201dApart from industry experts, most people probably didn\u2019t realize that insurance companies, which belong to one of the most heavily regulated industries in the country, were big investors in hedge funds, one of the most lightly regulated of all investment vehicles. Then again, before the financial crisis, hardly anyone realized A.I.G. was exposed to trillions of dollars in derivatives tied to mortgage-backed securities until catastrophe struck and the company had to be bailed out by taxpayers for more than $180 billion.Luckily, there\u2019s little danger of that now with hedge funds, because they make up only a small fraction of insurers\u2019 vast investment portfolios. Even at A.I.G., the $11 billion hedge fund portfolio represented just 3 percent of its approximately $340 billion in total investments. At MetLife, hedge funds account for less than one half of a percent.Still, losses from even these small percentages can have a big impact on earnings. A.I.G. reported pretax hedge fund losses of $537 million for the first quarter, which wiped out operating profit and led to an overall loss of $183 million. MetLife reported a 19 percent drop in operating earnings for the quarter, in part because of what Steven J. Goulart, its chief investment officer, said were \u201cnegative\u201d results from hedge funds.Insurers strive to match their liabilities to their assets, which generally means low-volatility United States Treasuries, along with other bonds and fixed income positions. But they are allowed to invest their excess capital any way they see fit.To be sure, those investments are subject to stiffer capital requirements: generally 30 percent in the case of stocks and equity-like investments, which include hedge funds and other so-called alternative investments.Hedge funds promised to provide high equitylike returns, with less volatility, that were uncorrelated with the ups and downs of the stock market \u2014 in other words, a variation on the age-old siren song of higher returns with lower risk.Hardly any of that turned out to be true, at least for insurance companies.What went wrong? Pretty much every everything, based on conversations I had this week with chief investment officers at several insurance companies. \u201cTheir marketing skill proved to be much better than their investing ability,\u201d Mr. Lack said of hedge fund managers.For starters, hedge funds didn\u2019t deliver equitylike returns. Hedge funds have trailed the benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index every year since 2009, often by significant amounts. Even ordinary investors can earn very close to that simply by buying a low-fee index fund.To some extent, that was to be expected in a strong bull market. But the volatile market of the last year was exactly the environment in which so-called long-short hedge funds were supposed to thrive. They didn\u2019t.A major culprit, everyone I spoke to agreed, was the sheer size of assets managed by hedge funds.\u201cWe thought a lot about what\u2019s wrong with the hedge fund space,\u201d said Mr. Goulart, who also serves as an executive vice president at MetLife. \u201cOne problem is that there are just too many funds, roughly 10,000 with almost $3 trillion invested. There\u2019s too much money chasing a limited number of attractive trades.\u201dMany hedge funds found themselves crowded into positions in the same handful of stocks \u2014 such as the controversial drug maker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International \u2014 and found they couldn\u2019t exit positions without causing further big losses even while being hit with investor redemptions.\u201cThe last quarter showed there were a lot of guys in the same trades,\u201d said Douglas Dachille, A.I.G.\u2019s chief investment officer. \u201cThey all looked good until the trade turned against them. Then the exit door turned out to be very small. The result was a lot of bad performance.\u201dMr. Cohen, speaking at the Milken Institute in Santa Monica, Calif., made a similar point: \u201cOne of my biggest worries is that there are so many players out there trying to do similar strategies.\u201d Noting that his fund lost 8 percent in February, he added, \u201cMy worst fears were realized.\u201dHedge funds\u2019 lack of transparency was another problem. Investment officers had trouble matching investment assets to their existing balance sheets when they didn\u2019t know what was in a hedge fund\u2019s portfolio.This was especially true for so-called activist hedge funds, which take large equity positions, hoping to shake up management or otherwise influence corporate strategy. A.I.G., for example, discovered it was invested in hedge funds that were making opposite bets on the same company.And with so many managers \u2014 at its peak, A.I.G. had more than 100 hedge funds \u2014 due diligence was time-consuming and distracting. Mr. Dachille said it took months to review A.I.G.\u2019s positions after he arrived last year.\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder A.I.G. experienced weak performance,\u201d Mr. Lack said. \u201cWith that many funds, you get the average, and the average is mediocre. If you aren\u2019t highly skilled in picking hedge funds, there\u2019s no point in being there.\u201dGiven their weak performance, hedge funds\u2019 high fees \u2014 the so-called two-and-20 formula that characterizes the industry (2 percent of assets under management and 20 percent of any gain) \u2014 were increasingly hard to swallow. \u201cI have no trouble paying great people,\u201d Mr. Dachille said. \u201cBut I get upset when I pay mediocre people great compensation.\u201dHedge funds aren\u2019t about to disappear. A few hedge fund managers continue to post sterling returns, and both A.I.G. and MetLife said they planned to retain some hedge funds that fit their investment strategies and met performance targets.But the hedge fund fever that gripped the investment world for the last decade \u2014 minting scores of billionaires \u2014 may have broken.Over all, hedge fund assets dropped by $14.4 billion during the first quarter of this year after a $26.8 billion decline in the last quarter of 2015.\u201cThere is no doubt,\u201d Mr. Loeb wrote in his letter to investors, \u201cthat we are in the first innings of a washout in hedge funds.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "One-Thing Shops: Soda, Los Angeles", "Date": "2016-05-31", "News": "Supported byOne-Thing ShopsNese\u2019s father\u2019s first job was selling newspapers in front of the store as a kid; around twenty-five years later he returned to the same spot, but as partner. Business was good for a while and the family gained full ownership of the store, but by the early \u201890s, sales were hurting. \u201cChain stores took over the distribution channels and suddenly the prices for small groceries skyrocketed,\u201d Nese says. \u201cIt was cheaper for us to go buy one can of tomatoes from a supermarket than buy in bulk.\u201d Nese watched nervously as other independents went out of business one by one.A turning point came when a Pepsi retailer visited the store. The salesman waltzed in promising the best price on a pallet of Pepsi, but Nese would only make $30 from the hundreds of sodas and he\u2019d have to charge customers more than they\u2019d pay at a chain store. When he said he wasn\u2019t interested, the salesman just laughed and insisted that customers would demand Pepsi.It seemed like the beginning of the end, and Nese was devastated. \u201cThen, suddenly, I realized I oughta thank Pepsi Cola for reminding me that I own my shelf space, they don\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I went out looking and found 25 little brands of soda by independent bottlers.\u201d The small bottlers were struggling too; many of the people Nese found were down to producing one or two soda flavors from a dozen in their heyday. \u201cThey were pretty down in the dumps,\u201d he says, \u201cI remember, I asked one guy to make Bubble Up and he said, \u2018Why do you want it? Nobody\u2019s gonna buy it.\u2019 I just told him \u2018If I don\u2019t have it on my shelf, you\u2019re right, nobody is ever going to buy it.\u2019\u201d It sold well and continues to sell at Galco\u2019s.Business slowly picked up as customers came in to track down the sodas of their childhood or simply taste something different. Nese\u2019s father remained skeptical. \u201cI have an early newspaper article here where they quote my father saying, \u2018You need more tomatoes and pasta in here,\u2019\u201d Nese says with a belly laugh. (The clipping is framed on the wall; his father died in 1995.)Soda flavors include strawberry, birch, honey cream, peach, pineapple, rhubarb, lavender, lemongrass, butterscotch and huckleberry. Galco\u2019s imports a grape soda from the Republic of Georgia and Fentimans from England; they carry the family-run Barritt\u2019s Ginger Beer, a Bermuda-based line that has been in production since 1874. There\u2019s passion fruit ginger ale and coffee soda, plus dozens of root beers. Detroit\u2019s Faygo is made with 100-percent natural cane sugar; each batch of Natrona\u2019s Red Ribbon line is individually mixed by hand before undergoing pinpoint carbonation, which produces especially small bubbles.\u201cCoca-Cola and Pepsi and all the big labels have sacrificed taste for profit,\u201d Nese says. \u201cThey switched from oils to extracts because it\u2019s cheaper. They\u2019ve pumped up the carbonation because that means using less syrup, which in turn increases profit margins. The sodas they make aren\u2019t crisp, they\u2019re not clean; they just don\u2019t pop.\u201dBut, if you want to know what they used to taste like, Nese can point you in the right direction. Customers who want to know what Dr Pepper was like before it went big should try Dublin Black Cherry. Anyone who was drinking RC Cola 50 or 60 years ago will recognize the taste in Dublin Vintage Cola. Fans of Pepsi and Coke should try it too; Nese says that a guy who conducted the first Pepsi Challenge stopped in once and explained that it was originally a three-way taste test that included RC Cola. \u201cApparently, Pepsi could beat Coke regularly, but it couldn\u2019t beat RC Cola, so they just eliminated RC from the challenge!\u201d Nese says, with another belly laugh.Now, Galco\u2019s\u2019 business is booming. While soda saved the family business, it\u2019s not yet clear whether the business will carry on in the family. Nese\u2019s only daughter is a chiropractor (\u201cand very good at her job\u201d), but his grandchildren \u2014 11-year-old twins \u2014 have shown an interest. \u201cThey told me they\u2019re ready to go to work \u2026 as the soda tasters.\u201dAsked about his own favorite, Nese couldn\u2019t pick. \u201cEarly on, I learned to never say what\u2019s best,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople come in here and that\u2019s the first question they ask, but if there was a best soda, I\u2019d only carry one.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "China Lending Inflates Real Estate, Stocks, Even Egg Futures", "Date": "2016-05-01", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 China is pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into its economy in a new effort to support growth. Some of it is going into roads and bridges and other big projects that will keep the economy humming.And some of it is going into eggs.Egg futures have surged by as much as one-third since March, the sort of move that would be justified if investors believed China\u2019s chicken flocks were headed for an unfortunate fate.But the market\u2019s usual participants say the flocks are fine. In fact, the actual price of eggs in the country\u2019s markets has fallen from a year ago, according to government statistics.\u201cMany commodities prices have gone up crazily,\u201d said Du Shaoxing, a futures trader in Guangzhou, in southern China. \u201cWe surely hope for a more stabilized trend where futures can reflect economic fundamentals. The way in which recent commodity prices went up is worrisome.\u201dChina\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.China is the world\u2019s biggest producer of eggs, but it is not clear whether the investment surge in eggs will have an impact on real-world prices. Jumps in the futures prices on commodities markets can take months to trickle down to the real world, and if the commodities surge subsides, then the price of eggs in local markets may not budge.By mid-April, the frenzy made Shanghai futures contracts in steel rebar, the rods used in construction to reinforce concrete, the most actively traded in the world \u2014 overtaking trading volumes of two major oil futures contracts, West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude, that have helped set oil prices for decades, analysts at Citigroup said in a report last week.\u201cThere is very little rational or fundamental basis for why prices have gotten as out of hand as they have, or why volumes are so high, other than just irrational exuberance,\u201d said Alex Wolf, an emerging markets economist at Standard Life Investments in Edinburgh, who previously worked as an American diplomat based in Beijing and Taipei.Economists blame Beijing\u2019s new efforts to shore up its economy. Government officials increased lending by state-controlled banks and offered other support measures in the first few months of the year as economic growth slowed and longtime drivers like manufacturing and exports showed continued weakness.Saad Rahim, the chief economist at Trafigura, one of the world\u2019s biggest traders of metals and oil, calculates that China added about $1 trillion in new liquidity in the first quarter of the year \u2014 an amount that would be roughly equal to the entire quarterly economic output of Germany during the same period.\u201cThis kind of scale is unprecedented and some of it will leak into speculative investments,\u201d Mr. Rahim said.But in turning to its old playbook, China risks adding to its already fast-growing pile of debt, which by some estimates is nearly 300 percent of gross domestic product.But the renewed push for credit-fueled growth shows that policy makers\u2019 concerns about China\u2019s debt burden appear to have been set aside for now. By delaying efforts to wean itself off cheap credit, China may be setting itself up for some problems related to debt and industrial overcapacity.A property market bubble arose from the huge stimulus that Beijing deployed after the 2008 financial crisis, which set off a building boom.Stocks overtook property in investor interest last year. A raging bull market that was cheered on by official news outlets like People\u2019s Daily, the Communist Party\u2019s newspaper, skidded to a halt in June.Her company supplies eggs to KFC and McDonald\u2019s restaurants, and sells them at more than 10,000 supermarkets across China, including those of chains like Walmart, Carrefour and Metro.Hubei Shendan uses the futures market to hedge its bets against swings in actual egg prices. An abnormally volatile futures market makes that job more difficult.\u201cThe reason we are in the egg futures market is because the big swings in egg prices will affect our profitability, and a good futures market will help us in that regard,\u201d Ms. Chen said.Owen Guo in Beijing contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Global Warming Cited as Wildfires Increase in Fragile Boreal Forest", "Date": "2016-05-10", "News": "Scientists say the near-destruction of Fort McMurray last week by a wildfire is the latest indication that the vital boreal forest is at risk from climate change.Supported byThe near-destruction of a Canadian city last week by a fire that sent almost 90,000 people fleeing for their lives is grim proof that the threat to these vast stands of spruce and other resinous trees, collectively known as the boreal forest, is real. And scientists say a large-scale loss of the forest could have profound consequences for efforts to limit the damage from climate change.In retrospect, it is clear that Fort McMurray, in northern Alberta, was particularly vulnerable as one of the largest human outposts in the boreal forest. But the destruction of patches of this forest by fire, as well as invasions by insects surviving warmer winters, has occurred throughout the hemisphere.In Russia, about 70 million acres burned in 2012, new statistics suggest, much of that in isolated areas of Siberia. Alaska, home to most of the boreal forest in the United States, had its second-largest fire season on record in 2015, with 768 fires burning more than five million acres.Global warming is suspected as a prime culprit in the rise of these fires. The warming is hitting northern regions especially hard: Temperatures are climbing faster there than for the Earth as a whole, snow cover is melting prematurely, and forests are drying out earlier than in the past. The excess heat may even be causing an increase in lightning, which often sets off the most devastating wildfires.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that the warming temperatures and extraordinary drought are major players here,\u201d said Thomas W. Swetnam, an emeritus scientist at the University of Arizona who studies the ecology and history of wildfires. \u201cWe probably wouldn\u2019t be seeing the scale of some of these fires if it weren\u2019t for those factors.\u201dThe weather pattern known as El Ni\u00f1o has been pumping a huge amount of heat from the ocean and into the atmosphere for more than a year, and scientists say that could also have played a role in setting the conditions for this year\u2019s fires. Temperatures in parts of Alberta were as much as 30 degrees Fahrenheit above normal in the weeks before the fires began, desiccating the landscape.Yet the same scientists say the overall increase in fire in northern regions would not be happening without global warming. The rising danger was predicted decades ago, as one of the likely consequences of human emissions.One of the scientists who published such a forecast in the 1990s, Brian J. Stocks, who retired from the Canadian Forest Service and is now a consultant, said this week that the worst was yet to come.\u201cWe\u2019re kind of at a crossroads,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe anticipate more fires, and more intense fires, in the future.\u201dThe situation, he and other experts said, demands new thinking by governments about how to manage forests and protect nearby human settlements. Fort McMurray, for instance, has just a single road for people to leave the city. But the dangers go far beyond the risk to the communities on the front lines, and they are global in scope.The forests of the world are helping to offset rising human emissions of greenhouse gases, absorbing a significant portion of the carbon dioxide that the burning of fossil fuels throws into the air. So far, even as fires and other disturbances increase, the forests are growing more than enough to compensate.Experts fear that more fires, and more soot, could further accelerate the melting of the ice sheet, which has the potential \u2014 should it disintegrate entirely \u2014 to raise the global sea level by more than 20 feet.Scientists have been trying for years to call attention to the boreal forest. (\u201cBoreal\u201d essentially means \u201cnorthern.\u201d) The forest gets less public attention than tropical forests, but it represents close to a third of the forest land on the planet. It is ecologically unique, and vital to human welfare for its ability to limit the risks of global warming by soaking up some of humanity\u2019s greenhouse emissions.The boreal forest consists mainly of cone-bearing trees like pines, spruces and larches, adapted to survive the long, cold winters of the northern region. The forest encircles the Northern Hemisphere in a band near and just below the Arctic Circle, through Alaska, Canada, Scandinavia and Russia.In Russia, extensive mining and drilling for fossil fuels are damaging the forest. More people means more activity that can spark forest fires, according to Sergei A. Bartalav, the director of a laboratory that helps monitor fires in Russia. But he added that the government had been slow to put in the necessary personnel and equipment to control the fires.\u201cNow we have an imbalance,\u201d he said. \u201cThe influence comes, we have the new wells drilled, but the firefighting doesn\u2019t follow.\u201dForest fires are a natural part of the history of the boreal forest, but records from recent decades suggest they may be reaching an unnatural level of frequency and intensity.Official Russian figures do not show an increase of forest fires in recent decades. But American scientists, working with colleagues in Russia, have concluded that the official figures \u201cgrossly underestimate the burned areas,\u201d said Susan G. Conard, a retired United States Forest Service scientist who remains active in the field and has worked extensively in Russia.She and her colleagues have lately constructed what they consider to be a more accurate record, using satellite data. The results have not yet been published, but they were presented at a scientific meeting in Vienna last year.They roughly track the Canadian and Alaskan figures in showing a sharp increase in the area burned in Russia since about 2000, culminating in the immense fires that accompanied a devastating heat wave in 2012.One of the explanations for the increase in fires seems to be an earlier melting of the spring snowpack across the Northern Hemisphere, another trend identified by satellites. The melt leads to a drying of the landscape early in the fire season. The resinous trees of the boreal zone become more susceptible to fire, and lightning sets off intense fires that are nearly impossible to control.Andrew E. Kramer and Oleg Matsnev contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Erdogan Moved to Solidify Power by Ousting a Pivotal Ally", "Date": "2016-05-05", "News": "Supported byClearly shaken, but a loyal party soldier to the end, Mr. Davutoglu described his relationship with Mr. Erdogan as \u201cbrotherly.\u201d\u201cYou will never hear me say negative things about our president,\u201d he said Thursday, his voice quavering. \u201cMy loyalty to him will last until the end.\u201dMr. Davutoglu\u2019s resignation exposed a rift between the two men over Mr. Erdogan\u2019s moves to expand his power. Their split signals that Mr. Erdogan\u2019s transformation from democrat to autocrat is nearly complete, his ambition of establishing an executive presidency closer at hand.As an Islamist leader who presided over a growing economy and seemed serious about advancing democracy in Turkey, Mr. Erdogan was embraced by the West when he came to power in 2003. A dazzling and charismatic reformer, he seemed to embody the promise that Islam and democracy could coexist.In recent years, critics have argued that Mr. Erdogan never intended to become a liberal leader, citing an old quote attributed to him that \u201cdemocracy is like a bus, when you arrive at your destination, you step off.\u201dThe ouster of Mr. Davutoglu offered another vivid example of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s autocratic style and his mastery of power politics that Turks this week likened to characters from \u201cThe Godfather\u201d or \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201dMr. Erdogan is often compared to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia for his authoritarian style and his ability to keep winning elections while eroding the quality of Turkey\u2019s democratic institutions. Mr. Erdogan burnished that image when he switched from prime minister to president, something Mr. Putin had done to preserve his political supremacy.Mr. Davutoglu, long seen as subservient to Mr. Erdogan, was often compared to Dmitri A. Medvedev, Mr. Putin\u2019s loyal deputy. But Mr. Medvedev has stuck around and Mr. Davutoglu is out.\u201cMr. Erdogan doesn\u2019t even want someone like Davutoglu, who was pretty much singing his tune, with some nuances,\u201d said Suat Kiniklioglu, a former lawmaker with the A.K.P. and the chairman of the Center For Strategic Communication in Ankara. \u201cStep by step, he\u2019s making sure his political objective, which is the presidential system, is achieved.\u201dThe resignation of Mr. Davutoglu follows one of his greatest successes as prime minister: a deal with the European Union to stem the flow of refugees from Turkey to the Continent.Mr. Davutoglu, not Mr. Erdogan, was front and center in those negotiations, and the international attention he received angered Mr. Erdogan, analysts said. Mr. Davutoglu also sought a meeting with President Obama, according to Turkish news media reports, and though the meeting did not transpire, the analysts said it nevertheless raised the ire of Mr. Erdogan.In public, Mr. Davutoglu has largely been deferential to Mr. Erdogan. \u201cHe was praising him and glorifying him,\u201d said Mr. Kiniklioglu, the former lawmaker.But Mr. Davutoglu was known to be less enthusiastic than Mr. Erdogan in pushing for a presidential system, something that would have eliminated any remaining authority in the office of prime minister, which under Turkey\u2019s Constitution is the most powerful position.\u201cThere is no major ideological divide between the two,\u201d said Omer Taspinar, an expert on Turkey at the Brookings Institution. \u201cIt\u2019s a power struggle, with Erdogan pushing for total loyalty and full support for his presidential agenda and Davutoglu showing slight resistance in order to keep checks and balances to protect his role as prime minister.\u201dWhile his public comments indicated little distance between him and Mr. Erdogan, there were signs lately that Mr. Davutoglu was trying to assert himself and, at least modestly, challenge Mr. Erdogan\u2019s authority.\u201cThe basic problem is that Erdogan seeks to eliminate anyone in the party who has any ambitions of authority of their own,\u201d said Svante E. Cornell, a Turkey analyst with the Central Asia-Caucasus Institute, a research organization.The split between Turkey\u2019s top two political leaders added another element of turmoil at a time when the country is facing numerous challenges: a war in the southeast against Kurdish militants; spillover from the war in Syria, with cross-border shelling; and the arrival of millions of refugees.Mr. Davutoglu had been the chief architect of Turkey\u2019s Syria policy, which is widely viewed as a failure.For years, Turkey allowed its southern border with Syria to be an easy conduit for weapons and fighters, a policy criticized by the United States and other allies for allowing the rise of the Islamic State. The refugee crisis shows no signs of abating, and Syria\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad, remains firmly in power, backed by Russia and Iran.Analysts say Mr. Davutoglu will most likely be cast as the scapegoat for Turkey\u2019s Syria policy by Mr. Erdogan and his inner circle.The country also endured a period of political instability last year, after the A.K.P. lost its parliamentary majority before regaining control in a snap election. During this period, Turkish stocks fell and the Turkish lira lost value against the dollar, reflecting investors\u2019 concerns about Mr. Erdogan\u2019s unchecked power.Mr. Kiniklioglu said that Mr. Davutoglu\u2019s assertiveness on international issues very likely raised concerns among Mr. Erdogan and his inner circle that the prime minister was slowly trying to exercise his own authority.Referring to Mr. Erdogan, Mr. Kiniklioglu said, \u201cHe just wants someone who sits quietly in Ankara until the executive presidency is in place.\u201dMr. Davutoglu said he would step aside after a special party congress to choose a new leader to be held on May 22.Mr. Erdogan, who as president is supposed to be above party politics, is expected to help choose a successor to his former acolyte who will be subservient and lead his effort to rewrite the Constitution and establish a presidential system.

{"Headline": "Panama Papers May Inspire More Big Leaks, if Not Reform", "Date": "2016-05-29", "News": "Supported byThe disclosure by an anonymous leaker of 11.5 million documents from a Panamanian law firm at the center of the offshore industry to a German newspaper was a landmark in another way as well. It was the latest and biggest in a series of recent megaleaks, establishing the large-scale, unauthorized disclosure of government and corporate secrets as a contagious phenomenon that is unlikely to go away.Since 2010, when a low-ranking intelligence analyst in Iraq copied thousands of classified files onto CDs labeled as Lady Gaga songs and gave them to the antisecrecy organization WikiLeaks, it has become clear that technology has revolutionized leaking. Pfc. Chelsea Manning, then known as Bradley, disclosed hundreds of thousands of diplomatic cables and military field reports. In 2013, Edward J. Snowden, citing Private Manning as an inspiration, gave a similar number of highly classified National Security Agency documents to a few journalists.Trevor Timm, the executive director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which supports what it calls transparency journalism, said the impact of each leak had inspired the next leaker.\u201cEspecially with the Panama Papers, I think it\u2019s now a trend,\u201d Mr. Timm said. \u201cWhen people inside organizations see the impact that whistle-blowing on this scale can have, they follow that example.\u201dNone of this would have been conceivable in the photocopier era, when the Panama Papers would have required a fleet of tractor-trailers to deliver. \u201cThese are disclosures not of documents but of databases \u2014 entire libraries,\u201d said Steven Aftergood, who tracks government secrecy for the Federation of American Scientists. John Doe\u2019s manifesto was tellingly titled \u201cThe Revolution Will Be Digitized.\u201dFor Mr. Obermayer and a colleague at S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, Frederik Obermaier, the fact that anonymous companies created by Mossack Fonseca were being used to evade taxes and launder illicit money justified publication. They shared the Panama Papers with the international journalists\u2019 group to bring strength and local expertise to the data.When the articles were published, their newspaper\u2019s web servers crashed from the initial volume of readers. Mr. Obermayer said it was \u201ca really strange feeling \u2014 that something that started with you has led to mass demonstrations in several countries.\u201dIn fact, some experts believe the \u201cPanama\u201d label is misleading, obscuring the central role of several states, including Delaware, Wyoming and Nevada, in registering companies with hidden ownership. Mossack Fonseca probably represents just 5 or 10 percent of the industry creating anonymous companies, Mr. Zucman of Berkeley said, so the disclosures have left the vast majority hidden.And no matter where shell companies may be registered, he said, much of the wealth they own is invested in the United States, in real estate, stocks and bonds. \u201cThe U.S. could find out who the true owners are,\u201d Mr. Zucman said.But the United States may illustrate the difficulty of moving from splashy revelations to serious change. States with a stake in the lucrative corporate registration business are likely to resist serious changes, and Congress appears unlikely to act anytime soon on comprehensive reform bills.\u201cThe offshore system is incredibly resilient, with a ton of smart lawyers and accountants to find new ways to hide money,\u201d said Marina Walker Guevara, the deputy director of the international journalists\u2019 consortium.Mr. Marchant said he believed the reform push from the leak would fade. \u201cThe people using the offshore system to evade their financial responsibilities tend to be very wealthy and influential people,\u201d he said. He predicted that any changes in laws and regulations after the disclosures would be \u201cmostly window dressing.\u201dOn the other hand, Mr. Marchant said, the example of John Doe will probably be followed by other leakers. \u201cThis is the age we live in,\u201d he said. \u201cThis record will be broken before long.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "PAID FOR AND POSTED BY While the pay was good, the hours were stressful, and the time away from her family was taking a toll on her marriage. \u201cMy work means a lot to me \u2026 but it\u2019s not everything,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more depressing to me than having to spend an entire day in an office building,\u201d McKendree says. Work provided income, but that was about it. Rogers and McKendree realized what each wanted from their lives and what they needed to achieve it. They quit the idea of 9-to-5 life to pursue what was most important to each of them, be it family or pursuing a passion, and succeeded.  This change in thinking begins with the optimistic desire for something in their lives that was lacking. In each case, this need triggered a shift in ambition, allowing Rogers and McKendree to achieve a livelihood they were content with. Years ago, the idea of quitting a job to create the life one wanted was unheard of. But more and more in our dynamic society, the way we live and work is changing to reflect turning points in our lives. The transformation is being led by millennials, immigrants and families, and enabled by technology. As this change spreads to create a better workplace, it's being set in stone by policies.  Shifts in ambition often begin with newcomers to the work force. Millennials and immigrants may not seem to have much in common, but each has encountered obstacles in connecting with the mainstream economy.  When fleeing Cuba in the 1960s as teenagers, Alberto and Betty Calvo were permitted to take nothing but two changes of clothing. That initial struggle kept the two grounded as Alberto Calvo studied engineering and Betty created a wholesaling business in the Boston area importing Latin foods.  Eventually Alberto, now 69, joined the business, and today is the president of Stop and Compare specialty supermarkets, which was built from the foundations built by Betty.  \u201cImmigrants have proven to be entrepreneurial, willing to take risks and are overall, good for the U.S. economy,\u201d says Victor Romano, associate professor of sociology at Barry University, in Miami, Fla.  Through their desire to achieve the American Dream, the Calvos forged their own path by wanting to satisfy the needs of other immigrants like themselves.  A similar path is being followed by millennials, whose ambitions were formed by economic hardship and a desire to help others.  At 23, Meghan Navoy was living and working hard in New York toward what she thought were her career goals. But she began to think about her values more and more.  \u201cI try to live as intentionally and authentically as I can,\u201d she says. She knew then that working her way up the corporate ladder wasn\u2019t for her. Navoy quit, moved back to the Midwest and, with the help of technology, started A Wool Story, an online business where she repurposes wool clothing into fashionable knit accessories. \u201cKnowing this is my life and I know I can live it as I see fit, I don\u2019t feel like putting in endless hours for a cause I don\u2019t believe in.\u201d  \u201cYou can\u2019t talk about millennials without discussing the Great Recession and how it impacted them,\u201d Romano says. \u201cBut they have made substantial investments in higher education and ... have an ability to adapt to changes within society.\u201d  They\u2019re more willing than previous generations to move jobs \u2014 or start new businesses \u2014 if they feel their needs aren\u2019t being met, he says.  \u201cMillennials have this self-confidence, so they feel they have options,\u201d says Ron Alsop, author of \u201cThe Trophy Kids Grow Up: How the Millennial Generation is Shaking Up the Workplace.\u201d  McKendree, 31, another millennial, left his job and moved to Rhode Island, where he pursued his passion of surfing while creating a line of American-made shirts called Huxter.  Partly due to necessity and partly due to choice, both groups of newcomers are charting unique paths through the economy through their hard work. Women have also helped power the broader shift in ambition. Fifty years ago, women such as Navoy might not have dreamed of careers in New York, let alone starting their own business halfway across the country.\u201cMore educated women are still having children, but they\u2019re doing it a little later in life, and it leads to a career interruption,\u201d says Paul Taylor, author of \u201cThe Next America: Boomers, Millennials and the Looming Generational Showdown.\u201d \u201cAnd that\u2019s where the work-life challenge comes in \u2014 not when you\u2019re hiring someone at 24, but at 30 or so, when they start to have kids.\u201dIn 1980In 2000couplesIn 2010In 2010couplesThis is often the time when people like Rogers are faced with the decision of choosing between work or family. But technology has allowed the workplace to shift \u2013 giving individuals an opportunity for a work-life balance, allowing parents like Rogers to work when and where they want \u2014 or in her case, making sure she\u2019s there for her daughter\u2019s stage performances.While technology has helped society make the shift to a more mobile work force, society itself is changing as the ambitions of millennials, immigrants and women pass to the next generation.Companies are hearing this message and responding. The Society of Human Resource Management found that employers are expanding opportunities to volunteer, implementing sustainability and social responsibility programs and providing flexibility. While these are steps toward positive change, there is still room to grow. Employers who hesitate may be overrun by societal changes, as public shifts in values lead legislators to implement new policies. These kinds of changes are just the beginning of a larger shift in society. Technology continues to provide those with a thirst for knowledge the means to educate themselves as well as a means for forging their own path. And while policies may take some time catching up to all the progress being made, optimism is what keeps the ambition alive. \"So many young people are starting their own business(es) and trying to create positive change \u2014 it's really inspiring,\" Navoy says.

{"Headline": "Making Big Donations to Change the World", "Date": "2016-05-13", "News": "Supported byWealth MattersPhilanthropists may proclaim their desire for social change, but few, it turns out, follow through.That is why someone like Paul Salem, a private equity investor in Rhode Island, is rare. He has made two big bets with his philanthropic dollars: one in a company that makes Plumpy\u2019Nut, a peanut paste to feed malnourished children, and another in Year Up, a nonprofit group started in Boston that teaches young urban adults the skills needed for a professional career.Mr. Salem, senior managing director at Providence Equity Partners, said he decided to make the big bets \u2014 defined as donations greater than $10 million \u2014 only after growing tired of being asked for donations and not knowing what impact his money was having.\u201cYou get bombarded by amazing opportunities to invest in charities that come in over the transom,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can give $5,000 here or $2,000 there. I still do that, but I consider it being nice. My wife and I decided we wanted to focus our giving on something that matters. It\u2019s a way I like to invest money.\u201dWilliam Foster, the head of Bridgespan\u2019s consulting practice and the author of the study \u201cBig Bets for Social Change,\u201d said, \u201cThe desire to give to social change is genuine,\u201d but that the study found that only 20 percent of big donors followed through. The wealthiest people want their money to make an impact on the biggest problems, he said. \u201cBut there are two reasons reality doesn\u2019t match the aspiration.\u201dThe first is it\u2019s hard and takes a lot of time. Big institutions have plenty of projects that a donor can finance and have confidence that they will be completed and their name will be put on the door.More complex problems, not surprisingly, are more challenging to finance. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear that if you wake up one morning and want to write a check to save the fish stocks of the ocean, where to write that check,\u201d Mr. Foster said.The second reason is more nuanced. After decades of the type of success that gives someone the means to make a gift of more than $10 million, many philanthropists do not want to look foolish with their donations.\u201cBeing an expert in a particular industry or field does not make you an expert in anything else,\u201d said Steve Prostano, head of family wealth advisers at Bank of the West Wealth Management. \u201cThe very successful person would like to be successful in everything they do.\u201dThat takes time and requires advice, he said.\u201cThe rewards of giving to a larger, established institution are readily apparent \u2014 the admiration and respect of your peer group, and the certainty that it\u2019s a professional and well-run institution that will use the money well,\u201d Mr. Foster said. \u201cWhen someone makes a gift to their 25th anniversary fund at Princeton, they\u2019re saying, \u2018It\u2019s Princeton. It\u2019s great.\u2019 They don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to change the trajectory of education at Princeton in the next 25 years.\u201dBut such giving isn\u2019t rewarding enough for some philanthropists. Emily Nielsen Jones and her husband, Ross Jones, a private equity executive, began giving in ways that would seem big by most standards. They helped finance the creation of a preschool in Boston that has grown into the Park Street School.Still, as their wealth increased, she wanted to do more on a big issue: stopping the trafficking of women and girls and, more broadly, changing gender norms around the world.\u201cIt came from a deep feeling that we needed to ramp up ethically,\u201d Ms. Jones said. \u201cBut then it was, how do you do that?\u201dMs. Jones, who started the Imago Dei Fund, wanted to look broadly for groups to finance, from the innovative projects at larger nonprofit groups to working directly with religious leaders.\u201cThat changed the direction of our philanthropy overall to make sure we were not guilty of a blind spot of just funding the rock star social innovators who went to the Kennedy School but also change agents working around the world,\u201d she said.One of these is Tostan, an organization in Senegal that aims to end female genital cutting and forced marriage. Her big bet on that group was particularly rewarding, she said. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with these imams who led the anti-genital cutting practice,\u201d she said. \u201cThey described that they had been resistant because this was how it was for centuries but they said when you get new information, you need to move on.\u201dMr. Foster said he advised philanthropists to give to several organizations in the area where they want to bring about change but also not to micromanage the institutions.\u201cIf you say, \u2018I care deeply about the ocean and I\u2019m going to try the three best organizations and give them some money and trust them and not hold their feet to the fire for every T that is crossed and I that is dotted,\u2019 that would probably work out pretty well,\u201d he said.Of course, not everyone agrees with the idea that philanthropists talk about social change in theory but shy away from it in practice \u2014 or that big donations are even a good thing.Paul Connolly, director of philanthropic advisory services at Bessemer Trust, said many philanthropists can finance social change through institutions. Ms. Jones, for example, said she still gave to Dartmouth College, which she and her husband attended, but she focuses on scholarships and entrepreneurial programs.The riskier issue, though, is when philanthropists donate too heartily to a social change organization without thinking through how that donation could affect that group.\u201cThere\u2019s a limited number of nonprofits that can absorb a very large gift,\u201d Mr. Connolly said. \u201cThere are 1.4 million nonprofits, but two-thirds have less than a $500,000 annual budget and only 5 percent have a budget of $10 million or more. If you\u2019re going to make a $10 million gift, you can do harm.\u201dAnd even if a single big donation doesn\u2019t overwhelm a small organization, it could wipe out its base of smaller donors, who feel the group no longer needs their money. Mr. Connolly said he was working with a client who wants to give $350 million to 20 organizations. He said his team\u2019s goal is to make sure those donations are not split equally among the groups but scaled to each organization\u2019s size.With Year Up, Mr. Salem said his involvement has grown over many years. And he has worked closely with its founder and chief executive, Gerald Chertavian, to expand the program beyond Boston to 16 other locations.For his part, Mr. Chertavian, who started and sold a technology consulting company before founding Year Up in 2000, said he had begun raising \u201cfunds\u201d similar to those in the private equity world to bring in donations that will be spent over five years. The first raised $18 million, the second, in 2011, brought in $55 million. \u201cYou can\u2019t grow quickly if you don\u2019t have patient capital,\u201d he said.Those funds have the added benefit of keeping donors involved for at least five years.Mr. Salem, who has given more than $10 million to Year Up over 13 years, said that while he believed in making big bets, he tried to look at his contributions like his private equity investments.\u201cWhen I die, I\u2019ll say I did my part to close the opportunity divide, but I\u2019ll also say the money I put in, I got a return on my investment,\u201d he said. \u201cNot all bets work out.\u201d he added. \u201cBut if I looked at Year Up like an investment in some of my portfolio companies, this was a home run.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lending Club, a Story Stock That Skimped on the Details", "Date": "2016-05-13", "News": "Supported byFair GameThe recent tribulations of Lending Club, a former highflying \u201cpeer to peer\u201d lender, provide an object lesson for both companies and their investors: When it comes to financial disclosures, less is definitely not more.Celebrated as a Silicon Valley disrupter set to transform the financial industry, Lending Club first issued public shares at $15 in December 2014. Like other wildly popular disrupters (Theranos, the blood-testing company that is now under siege, comes to mind), Lending Club had a star-studded board and a concept that made investors swoon.Its shares peaked at almost $28 in late 2014, giving Lending Club a $10 billion market value. Not bad for a company that generated a $33 million loss on $211 million in net revenue that year.Lending Club was the quintessential story stock. Disrupting finance, though, turned out to be harder than promised.Six months after its public offering the company\u2019s shares had fallen below the deal price. And in recent months, as doubts about the peer-to-peer lending industry emerged, Lending Club\u2019s shares continued to decline.The company cited two reasons for Mr. Laplanche\u2019s exit. First, Lending Club had improperly sold $22 million of loans to an institutional investor that did not meet the investor\u2019s standards. In addition, Mr. Laplanche had not disclosed to company directors his stake in a fund in which Lending Club was weighing an investment.Compared with some of the corporate shenanigans we\u2019ve seen lately, these disclosure failings look relatively minor. So why have Lending Club\u2019s shares taken such a beating?Here\u2019s a hypothesis: Investors don\u2019t have enough information about the company\u2019s operations to keep them confident about its prospects. When shareholders have to rely more on a company\u2019s promise than on the reality of its operations, they often flee at the first sign of trouble.In contrast with traditional financial companies, Lending Club\u2019s disclosures are thin. And the company\u2019s practices in the area were the subject of a whistle-blower submission to the Securities and Exchange Commission last July. The submission, which I reviewed, contended that the company does not disclose crucial operational measures that investors need to evaluate its business.Lacking, for example, is detailed data on Lending Club\u2019s credit decisions and scoring models, its investors\u2019 returns and loan performance. Nor does the company provide specifics showing investor satisfaction with its platform.I asked Lending Club about these areas of its financial disclosures. Taylor Hamilton, a spokesman, pointed me to additional information on the company\u2019s website. But this data was only modestly enlightening.How does Lending Club assess risks among its borrowers? In its most recent annual filing, the company said that in addition to common tools like borrowers\u2019 credit scores, it uses \u201cproprietary algorithms that leverage behavioral data, transactional data and employment information.\u201d The company contends that its \u201cstrong record of loan performance\u201d is evident in its loan origination growth.Nevertheless, Lending Club provides scant details on borrower performance by type, product or vintage (the year in which a loan was made). Other financial institutions provide this kind of data routinely.In its filings, the company does show two tables of charge-off rates on its loans, reflecting borrower defaults. One table spans three years, the other, five. Good luck figuring them out.Since the company is a peer-to-peer lender, the performance on smaller loan purchases would be a more helpful measure.Lending Club filings also state that \u201chigh reinvestment rates\u201d prove that its investor-lenders have confidence in its marketplace. But the company has not disclosed actual reinvestment rates in its regulatory filings.Scott Sanborn, the company\u2019s president, recently told investors in a conference call that its reinvestment rate hit 85 percent \u201cover the past two quarters.\u201dIf the company published these figures regularly, shareholders could watch for investor churn, a risk to its business that Lending Club has acknowledged. It must \u201cmaintain relationships with existing borrowers and investors,\u201d it says in filings.But in its most recent annual report, issued in February, Lending Club noted that \u201ca relatively small number of investors account for a large dollar amount of investment in loans funded through our marketplace.\u201dIf most of Lending Club\u2019s loans come from a handful of investors, such as brokerage firms, hedge funds or pension plans, that\u2019s not so revolutionary a business model. That looks a lot like a bank. More troubling, if one or two of these investors pulled back from Lending Club, the company\u2019s funding capacity could drop significantly.On Tuesday, the company told regulators that its quarterly financial filing, due that day, would be delayed until Monday. That filing, Lending Club said, \u201cwill reflect significant changes in the company\u2019s results of operations for the first quarter of 2016 as compared to those of the first quarter of 2015.\u201dFull and detailed data about a public company\u2019s operations is crucial if investors are to remain confident about its prospects. While it\u2019s not unusual for companies to want to limit their disclosures, Lending Club no longer has that luxury. If it wants to regain its shareholders\u2019 trust, being more forthcoming is a good way to start.The investor lesson here is also clear: Don\u2019t let enthusiasm for a purportedly innovative business model replace hard-nosed analysis of a company\u2019s operations.

Deng often wore the Mao suit, while his successors embraced Western business attire.But Mr. Xi has become so attached to his windbreaker that it might now be called the \u201cXi jacket.\u201dWhile Mr. Xi is not known to have publicly discussed his wardrobe choices, the jacket has become a fitting sartorial symbol of his rule.Its man-of-the-people look, along with a cloying media campaign calling him \u201cPapa Xi,\u201d help soften his harder authoritarian edges, while its calculated lack of pretense and extravagance sets the tone for a leader seeking to rein in official corruption and profligacy.An article circulated by Xinhua, the main official news agency, said it imparted \u201cthe aura of Mr. Efficiency.\u201dCasual, practical and, like the Mao suit, reflecting a determined lack of glamour, the jacket conveys a populist, man-in-a-hurry image.The jacket\u2019s message, she said, is, \u201cRunning the country is my job, I labor at it, I am a political worker.\u201dThe State Council Information Office, which answers questions about the government, did not respond to faxed questions about Chinese leaders\u2019 dress codes.Squinting at photographs has so far failed to reveal what brand of windbreaker Mr. Xi wears. And that\u2019s not the kind of information that the Communist Party publicizes.In Beijing Department Store (yes, that\u2019s its name), a store that stocks ready-to-wear suited for the rising cadre, there were over a dozen brands of navy blue zippered windbreakers, ranging in price from about $70 to $700.\u201cThey\u2019re much cheaper in my hometown,\u201d said Li Chuande, a retiree from Hubei Province in central China who was outside the store, wearing a navy blue zippered windbreaker. He said he wore that kind of jacket long before Mr. Xi came on the scene.\u201cXi Jinping is showing he\u2019s like us ordinary people,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can wear this anywhere and it\u2019s O.K.\u201dMr. Xi appears to prefer shoes with fake laces \u2014 little plastic protrusions \u2014 sparing him the time-sapping drudgery of tying them, she said.\u201cPresident Xi in his formal meetings always has a dark, generally nondescript suit, white shirt, usually a bright tie and the trousers are often pulled up a tad higher than others,\u201d Ms. Lehr said by email. \u201cNice suits but not too nice, and practical like his shoes with fake laces.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Sales fell more than 6 percent, to $21 billion for the year ending Jan. 30. Office Depot closed 349 stores in 2014 and 2015 and had identified at least 400 retail stores for closing through 2016. Sales fell 10 percent last year, to $14.5 billion. Eaglevale Partners, the Manhattan hedge fund firm that Mr. Mezvinsky founded with two former colleagues at Goldman Sachs, had raised money for the Hellenic fund about two years ago when some on Wall Street had hopes for a revival. But betting on Greece has proved to be tricky and it has been a rough 17 months for hedge funds. It is unclear why Eaglevale waited until this year to close the Hellenic fund, which had already lost about 40 percent of its value by early last year. Greece edged near economic collapse and the situation remains tenuous with the country still arguing with other eurozone nations and its creditors over how to reduce its debt burden. Sam Gilford, a consumer bureau spokesman, confirmed that staff members and the consumer advisory board had discussed seller financing, specifically an arrangement called a contract for deed or a land contract which is a long-term, high-interest installment financing deal. The buyer only becomes the owner after the last payment is made and the contracts can last for as long as 40 years.These contracts have proliferated as banks have retrenched from lending to low-income families and private investment firms like hedge funds have stepped in to fill the void. The foreclosure crisis created a bountiful supply of cheap, often dilapidated homes for investors to buy and left millions of people with damaged credit histories.  Now many of the homes that have been foreclosed are being sold under contracts for deeds. Homes sold through a contract for deed often require buyers to spend a significant portion of their disposable incomes on repairs and renovations. When they do not or cannot, this leads to problems.  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bubble Indemnity", "Date": "2016-05-10", "News": "Supported byOn MoneyIt was a striking admission. This \u201clargely worthless\u201d start-up scene, according to the research firm CB Insights, has raised an estimated $238 billion over the last five years \u2014 a remarkable bull run in private technology stocks. Forbes reports that there are now close to 200 \u201cunicorns,\u201d to use the Valley term of art for private companies worth more than a billion dollars on paper. Since the financial crisis, these companies, along with their more established public predecessors, have been seen by many Americans as the last redoubt of confidence and productivity in an otherwise uneven recovery. V.C.s have spent years dismissing speculation about a private-equity bubble as merely an expression, by know-nothing spectators, of resentment and alarmism; media onlookers, they argue, should talk instead about the triumphal progress of the genuinely great start-ups as they try to solve our most difficult problems. Over the past year, however, as allegations of mismanagement and unsustainability have grown \u2014 Square went public for approximately half its last private valuation; Fidelity and other large mutual funds wrote down their positions in Dropbox, MongoDB, and Snapchat; and both Zenefits and Theranos were accused of deceptive practices \u2014 that confidence has come to look more like hubris.This past January, after a long autumn of minor misfortune left the market in a stall, I spent a week loitering in the command concourse of American V.C., Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, Calif., where the soft, spruce-filtered sunlight falls through plate glass into quiet offices of beige on beige. There was some selection bias at work, as all my introductions were brokered by a smart and thoughtful friend, but not a single investor I talked to fit the description of the supercilious techno-optimist \u2014 and most, in private, didn\u2019t hesitate to concede Palihapitiya\u2019s point. Of course they believed private valuations had become preposterous; of course the run in private tech stocks couldn\u2019t possibly last; and of course, many start-ups, especially those of the \u201cUber for garden-gnome rearrangement\u201d variety, are in fact largely worthless.Where they differed from the naysayers, however, was in their rating of the \u00adcauses\u00ad and consequences; the fault, they said, didn\u2019t belong to the technological elite but to everybody else: What has driven inflated valuations, in a time of extremely low interest rates and meager returns elsewhere, is \u201cdumb money,\u201d all the alien capital that has flowed into the Valley in recent years. Dumb money is a hedge-funder who\u2019s jealous of a V.C. Dumb money is sovereign wealth. Dumb money is an Emirati home office. Dumb money is a Facebook millionaire in a Maserati who wants to look like a player. Dumb money wants to get in on tech because it\u2019s a box to check off. Dumb money isn\u2019t in it for the long run. Dumb money doesn\u2019t actually care about the technology. Dumb money doesn\u2019t create value. Dumb money thinks what you lose on the margin you\u2019ll make up for in volume. Dumb money wants to get in on Uber at any price, and will accept a \u201climited-edition private offer\u201d to join the scarce ranks in a \u201cspecial purpose vehicle\u201d that bears all the risks of one company with none of the hedging benefits of a portfolio. Dumb money is those pinkish guys with bull necks in Zegna suits. The weird thing about dumb money, unfortunately, is that it can act with fiendish intelligence, insisting on stipulations that guarantee returns at the expense of founders, employees and other investors.Luckily for the American economy, the dumb money this time around is no longer a mob of deluded pensioners waist-deep in Webvan. (It\u2019s also, the V.C.s noted, a lot less money in total, and at least in theory it\u2019s coming from people who can afford the losses; the last dot-com crash erased an estimated $6.2 trillion in household wealth.) So the coming correction will allow the smart money to roll up its brushed-microfiber sleeves and get back to basics. A lot of $10 billion companies will become $1 billion companies, and $1 billion companies will be acquired for $100 million, and the dumb money will slink away. Operating expenses and burn rates will come way down, and companies that didn\u2019t worry about profitability or unit economics will. There will be layoffs, sure, but the only serious effects will be that the traffic on I-280 will no longer back up three exits, it\u2019ll be easier to get a table at the Village Pub and engineers three minutes out of Stanford will no longer expect $150,000 a year and backlit fountains of complimentary fruit water.Defenders of that system argue that all they really need are the expected half-dozen mega-I.P.O.s (Slack, Palantir, Snapchat, Uber, Airbnb) to make enough cash returns to offset the losses. But that fantasy math holds for only a tiny cohort of V.C. firms. It also overlooks the well-being of tens of thousands of employees, especially support staff, who have worked for years for a share in the wealth they\u2019ve created. Perhaps worst of all, it betrays a callow belief that the genuinely transformative long-term endeavors that V.C.s have come to support \u2014 erstwhile academic research into artificial intelligence, bioengineering and sustainable energy \u2014 will be somehow insulated from an industry downturn. An exploded bubble could very well mean that those \u201ctotally audacious\u201d bets will go unfunded entirely. That might seem like a satisfying comeuppance for the imperious Valley, but it\u2019s not something to be smug about. Smart money convinces itself of its highly differentiated intelligence at what might prove to be all of our expense.Gideon Lewis-Kraus is a contributing writer for the magazine.

There are four chairs at two tables. Very nearby at the counter are five stools. Sitting at one, you see dime-store jars of hard candy, a lamp with a fringed pink shade, a Depression glass vase under a cloud of baby\u2019s breath. You see a wicker monkey hanging by one arm above a window into the kitchen, where chickens make leisurely circles on a rotisserie.Five main courses and about twice as many side dishes are spelled in white on a letter board that has a blue-and-red Pepsi logo at the top. You pick two sides and a sauce at no extra cost. They will be served next to your main course on a sectioned china or glass plate, each in its own well, another tune from the past.We\u2019re not supposed to want to eat this way anymore. Maybe that\u2019s why, when I got my chicken-fried pork cheeks with Swiss chard and crab imperial, I was filled with gratitude. The chard was cooked with a little garlic and lemon and bread crumbs. The crab tasted of mayonnaise and Tabasco and had been browned and warmed inside a heavy foil dish in the shape of a crab shell. I spread it on saltines from a crinkly cellophane wrapper and ate it with the sensation of having found something I\u2019d lost such a long time ago that I\u2019d forgotten about it.10 PhotosThe rotisserie chicken tasted like rotisserie chicken.With so few voices in the room, you almost always hear the music, which is soft and sounds as if it were coming from a tube radio that is still picking up an AM show that was broadcast a couple of years before the Beatles played Shea Stadium. It\u2019s all big bands and crooners singing sweet words that are sad underneath, like \u201cI\u2019ll be seeing you in all the old familiar places.\u201d (The only place he\u2019ll be seeing her is in his head.)Cheap nostalgia hands you a fake past to make you smile. True nostalgia is mixed with pain because it conjures a past that was real and isn\u2019t coming back. The nostalgia Ms. Redding and Mr. Danzer bring to Mr. Donahue\u2019s is the second kind. Every detail shows their longing for the bygone world of Mr. Danzer\u2019s grandfather Frank Donahue. He was a detective. His police cap sits on a shelf.For dessert, there is a root-beer float, if that\u2019s what you want. Me, I\u2019ll probably keep ordering the banana pudding forever, or until this mirage on Mott Street goes under and joins the past.Jammed behind one end of the counter, they arrange cheeses with house-made jam, warm some marinated olives that are as smoky as bacon, toast sliced baguettes for a knockout tomato chutney, plate some crisp, young radishes with bagna cauda, spread out sliced cross sections of fennel bulbs marinated simply and deliciously with sherry vinegar and fennel seeds, and plunge an immersion blender into batters that will go into the tiny convection oven and emerge as three-inch souffl\u00e9s.The cheese souffl\u00e9, almost like a tower of soft scrambled eggs, makes a lush spread for toast darkened with a swirl of balsamic vinegar. The last time I went, it had been replaced by an equally good one with crab.I expected to like the beef tartare, but its sherry vinegar dressing made it too soupy and sour. I had no expectations of lentil salad, but it\u2019s one of the best things on the menu. A variety of lentils and other legumes are firm, separate, not at all mushy, seasoned with dried chiles and curry leaves, swirled with yogurt sauce, and sprinkled with crisp threads of sev, the chickpea-flour snacks. Suddenly, dull old lentil salad is an exciting Indian street festival. (Mr. Ochoa and Mr. Alexandre met Patrick Cournot, an owner and a sommelier at Ruffian, when they all worked at Tabla.)There is usually a savory pie, either a big and imposing thing to be carved into wedges, or a small turnover filled let\u2019s say with a well-seasoned mince of rabbit meat.The profiteroles are odd and overelaborated, with an acidic cream of mandarin oranges. The chocolate souffl\u00e9 is better, if you have time to wait. In this kitchen, the only way to cook is one dish at a time.But of course you have time; you\u2019re here to drink wine from a list that evidences Mr. Cournot\u2019s open-minded curiosity. Like every other wine bar in town, Ruffian stocks some stars of the natural wine movement. It\u2019s also picking up on the Georgian signals coming out of the Caucasus. But other choices show an independence from the latest trends, like a violet-scented pinot noir from Chile.Elena Hull Cournot, Mr. Cournot\u2019s wife, has given this tight alley a surprisingly light, almost airy design, although the detail I remember most is the portrait of a horse on the back wall. She painted it with it a garland of orange flowers around its neck, like a lei. It has kind eyes and a nonjudgmental expression, fine traits in a portrait that hangs in a bar.

{"Headline": "A Worrisome Pileup of $100 Million Homes", "Date": "2016-05-28", "News": "Supported byInside WealthOne of the latest symbols of the overinflated luxury housing market is a pink mansion perched above the Mediterranean on the French Riviera.The 13,000-square-foot property, built and owned by the fashion magnate Pierre Cardin, is composed of giant terra cotta orbs arranged in a sprawling hive. The home\u2019s name befits its price. \u201cLe Palais Bulles,\u201d or \u201cthe Bubble Palace,\u201d is being offered for sale at approximately $450 million.If you add in high-priced \u201cwhisper listings\u201d that are offered privately, brokers say the actual number of nine-figure listings worldwide could easily top 40 or 50.\u201cIt\u2019s a bumper crop,\u201d said Dan Conn, chief executive of Christie\u2019s International Real Estate. \u201cIt\u2019s just a new world in terms of what people are building and offering for sale.\u201dThe rise in nine-figure real estate listings comes just as sales of luxury real estate have cooled. Many say the sudden surge in hyperprice homes \u2014 often built and sold by speculative investors \u2014 is the ultimate bubble signal.Last year, only two homes in the world sold for over $100 million, according to Christie\u2019s. One was a 9,455-square-foot house in Hong Kong purchased for $193 million by Jack Ma, the chief of Alibaba. The other was a townhouse in London that sold for $132 million. This year, a ranch in Texas went on the market for $700 million and a home in Dallas listed for $100 million. Both sold, but the actual sale prices have not been disclosed.The last time a sudden pop in $100 million-plus listings occurred was in 2007 and 2008, just before the housing crash. In 2008, at least four homes in the world listed for nine figures. Only one ended up selling for close to that. A mansion in Palm Beach owned by Donald Trump and listed for $100 million sold for $95 million. (Mr. Trump says it sold for $100 million.) A 103-room mansion in Surrey, England, called Updown Court, was listed for $138 million, but sold in 2011 for about $50 million. A log mansion planned for the Yellowstone Club in Montana, with a promised price of $155 million, was never built, and the land sold for $10 million.Of course, anyone can slap a $100 million price tag on a home to get attention. Yet actual sales of nine-figure homes are rare, even in good times. Between 2011 and 2016, only 15 homes in the world have sold for $100 million or more, according to Christies, and five of those were in 2014.\u201cThe era of aspirational pricing is over, and I\u2019m not sure it ever really worked,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cThese prices get headlines, but the properties just don\u2019t sell.\u201dBrokers promoting the listings say their properties are one-of-a-kind masterpieces \u2014 like Picassos or Modiglianis \u2014 that rarely come on the market. They add that the more than 1,800 billionaires in the world see property as a safer store of wealth than stocks or art. Mr. Conn estimates that of the 27 nine-figure listings, a third will sell for under $100 million, a third will sell for around $100 million and a third for far more.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a sign of a bubble,\u201d Mr. Conn said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign of growing wealth in the world and the quality of some of the new construction.\u201dYet the market for megamansions and penthouses has cooled significantly in the last year. Prices for homes in the top 5 percent of the real estate market fell 1.1 percent in the first quarter of 2016, according to Redfin. Prices for the rest of the housing market increased 4.7 percent.Brokers say the very top of the market \u2014 consisting of eight- and nine-figure homes \u2014 is faring the worst as slowing economies overseas and volatile stock markets have spooked buyers. The supply of homes for the rich exploded as builders aimed at the high end after the financial crisis.Of the 10 most expensive listings in the world, seven are in the United States and four of these are in Los Angeles. The most expensive listing in the world is the $500 million compound being built in the Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles by Nile Niami, a film producer and speculative builder. The property will have a 74,000-square-foot main house, a 30-car garage and a \u201cMonaco-style casino.\u201dIn nearby Holmby Hills, a more modest 38,000-square-foot mansion, built by the investor and developer Gala Asher, came on the market in April for $150 million. The ultramodern house, on the prestigious Carolwood Drive, has a 5,300-square-foot master suite and a club level with bar, dance floor, wine room, lap pool, theater complex, beauty parlor and massage rooms. The property also includes several guesthouses and staff housing. The broker, Ginger Glass, said the price of the property was justified.\u201cBuyers today want new construction,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd there isn\u2019t anything that\u2019s new like this in such a great location.\u201dStill more nine-figure homes are on the way. Real estate agents and developers say a home under construction in Bel Air is likely to have more than 50,000 square feet of living space, with finishes rivaling a superyacht\u2019s. The price will be yacht-like, too, at around $300 million.

{"Headline": "In the Clear, Phil Mickelson Can Thank an Insider Trading Ruling", "Date": "2016-05-20", "News": "Supported bySports BusinessPhil Mickelson, meet Todd Newman.It\u2019s unlikely that the famous golfer knows the former portfolio manager for Diamondback Capital Management, a hedge fund based in Stamford, Conn., that went out of business in 2013. But Mickelson ought to consider reaching out to thank him. Newman is quite likely a key reason Mickelson was not charged Thursday with insider trading by the Securities and Exchange Commission.Newman and another hedge fund manager, Anthony Chiasson, were indicted in 2012 on insider trading charges by Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York. (The S.E.C. also brought civil charges.) Newman was accused of regularly receiving information about two stocks \u2014 Dell, the computer company, and Nvidia, a chip maker \u2014 from company insiders, allowing him to make what amounted to illegal trades.Why? Because, the court said, for a crime to have been committed, the company insider \u2014 the so-called tipper \u2014 had to have received a personal benefit in return for offering up inside information. In addition, the person who received the tip \u2014 the \u201ctippee\u201d \u2014 had to know that the tipper was receiving that personal benefit. By all appearances, Newman didn\u2019t even know who the tippers were; the information got to him through a series of intermediaries, the last of whom was an analyst at Diamondback. Without that knowledge of a personal benefit, Newman had not committed a crime.Critics of the appeals court\u2019s Newman decision, including Bharara, say that the judges essentially redefined what constituted insider trading, making it much more difficult to bring cases even when it is obvious that wrongful behavior has taken place. Defenders, including many lawyers in the white-collar defense bar, say the court was simply reiterating the law as the Supreme Court had always intended it to be, and was finally reining in overly aggressive prosecutions by Bharara.At the time, Mickelson owed Walters gambling debts. Although he was a serious gambler, Mickelson was not a big stock trader, with only about $250,000 in the market, according to the S.E.C. Yet on July 30 and 31, 2012, after a series of phone calls and texts with Walters, Mickelson bought $2.4 million worth of Dean Foods stock \u2014 some of it with money he borrowed. \u201cThese were his first ever Dean Foods purchases,\u201d the S.E.C. noted.The case against Walters, as outlined by the S.E.C. and the United States attorney\u2019s office, appears to be strong. In all, the government says, the inside information Walters got from Davis was worth $40 million. The government goes out of its way to play up the personal benefit Davis received in return. An inveterate gambler trying to keep up an unsustainable lifestyle, he owed money to the I.R.S. and others, including Walters. More than once, Walters bailed him out by either lending him money or arranging for a loan. The loans totaled nearly $2 million.It is also clear that Walters, who is alleged to have tipped off Mickelson in turn, got a benefit from his tippee. According to the S.E.C., Mickelson used some of his Dean Foods profits to pay back his gambling debt to Walters. But did Mickelson know about the personal benefit the original tipper, Davis, was receiving? I know it sounds a little strange, but that really is the key legal question in the wake of the Newman decision. If he didn\u2019t know that Davis was receiving a personal benefit in return for giving inside information to Walters, he\u2019s off the hook.(A quick aside: According to Forbes, Mickelson has reaped around $500 million in career earnings, and gets some $50 million a year in endorsement income. The fact that he was trading in Dean Foods to repay a debt to Walters surely raises questions about Mickelson\u2019s financial decision-making, well apart from whether he traded on inside information.)In its complaint against Walters, the S.E.C. seems to have highlighted Mickelson\u2019s involvement in the case. But ultimately, it merely named him a \u201crelief defendant,\u201d meaning that all he had to do was return the money he had made from the Dean Foods trade, plus interest. He readily agreed. (The total is about $1.03 million.)A spokesman for Mickelson issued a statement Thursday in which he said that Mickelson didn\u2019t want to \u201cbenefit from any transaction that the S.E.C. sees as questionable.\u201d He added that Mickelson regretted any \u201cappearance\u201d that he had fallen short of \u201cthe high professional and ethical standards that the companies he represents expect of their employees, associates and Phil himself.\u201dThat should do the trick: Several of the companies Mickelson endorses have already said they\u2019ll stick with him. For Mickelson, this too shall pass \u2014 and probably pretty quickly.
