{"Headline": "Tesla to Sell $2 Billion in Shares to Bolster Model 3 Output", "Date": "2016-05-18", "News": "Supported byTesla Motors said on Wednesday it would offer about $2 billion in stock, mainly to help it ramp up production of its new Model 3 electric car over the next two years.The company unveiled the Model 3, its first mass-market car, in March and has been flooded with orders even though the compact sedan will not be available for a year or more. So far, Tesla has accepted about 375,000 $1,000 deposits from hopeful buyers.Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, has said the company aims to produce 500,000 Model 3s by 2018 at its factory in Fremont, Calif.Many automakers would consider that a stretch, said Jessica Caldwell, a senior analyst at the auto researcher Edmunds.com. A typical auto plant makes 200,000 to 250,000 cars a year, she said.\u201cRaising money is going to help them try to reach that 500,000 number, but a lot of people have doubts,\u201d she said. \u201cIt seems like an unreachable goal.\u201dIt\u2019s also a huge leap from the 15,000 cars Tesla produced in the first three months of the year.Its models include the Model S sedan, which costs about $75,000, and the Model X, a seven-passenger sport utility vehicle priced at about $80,000. The Model 3 will be priced at around $35,000.While Tesla is often hailed for design and innovation, manufacturing has proved more of a challenge. The release of the Model X has been slowed by a recall, and the automaker recently lost two production executives.Of the stock Tesla plans to offer, about $1.4 billion will be new shares. The remaining amount will be sold by Mr. Musk to cover tax expenses stemming from 5.5 million stock options he has exercised.News of the offer hurt Tesla shares in after-hours trading, where they fell $2.52, to $208.65. Earlier in the day, the stock climbed as high as $215.31 after Goldman Sachs changed its recommendation on Tesla shares to buy from neutral.In a note to clients, an analyst for Goldman, Patrick Archambault, said Tesla\u2019s sales goals were \u201cambitious,\u201d but nevertheless he set a stock price target of $250 over the next six months.\u201cWe do not believe Tesla shares are fully capturing the company\u2019s disruptive potential,\u201d Mr. Archambault wrote.In the first quarter of this year, Tesla lost about $283 million on revenue of $1.15 billion. During the same period last year, it reported revenue of about $940 million and a loss of $154 million.Advertisement"}

Let\u2019s look at some of the clues that required some heavy-duty thinking. It\u2019s Saturday, so there are plenty of them, but here are a few we haven\u2019t mentioned to get you started:\u2013 26A\u2019s \u201cSpot at an airport\u201d is not talking about seeing someone you know, it\u2019s about the BLIP on an airport control tower\u2019s radar screen.\u2013 29A\u2019s \u201cSouth of Brazil?\u201d is one of those misdirected clues with a question mark, so we\u2019re not talking about countries that are literally south of Brazil, like Paraguay or Uruguay. We\u2019re being asked what the word \u201csouth\u201d would be to Portuguese speakers of Brazil, and the answer is SUL.\u2013 CANES! Ha ha, what a witty gift for a 40th birthday! Who wouldn\u2019t appreciate a gag gift like that? I did not receive a cane for my 40th birthday, but I did get a bottle of Geritol and a fake AARP card. \u2013 \u201cOne way to \u2026\u201d clues like the one at 2D are asking you to think of a different meaning for a phrase in the clue.

At 32D, \u201cHead overseas?\u201d sounds like Mr. Healy is planning some travel, but we\u2019re really being asked for a foreign language word for \u201chead.\u201d In addition, we\u2019re not necessarily talking about the head that sits on top of our shoulders.

{"Headline": "Peter Thiel, Tech Billionaire, Reveals Secret War With Gawker", "Date": "2016-05-25", "News": "Supported byA billionaire Silicon Valley entrepreneur was outed as being gay by a media organization. His friends suffered at the hands of the same gossip site. Nearly a decade later, the entrepreneur secretly financed a lawsuit to try to put the media company out of business.What the jury \u2014 and the public \u2014 did not know was that Mr. Bollea had a secret benefactor paying about $10 million for the lawsuit: Peter Thiel, a co-founder of PayPal and one of the earliest investors in Facebook.\u201cIt\u2019s less about revenge and more about specific deterrence,\u201d he said on Wednesday in his first interview since his identity was revealed. \u201cI saw Gawker pioneer a unique and incredibly damaging way of getting attention by bullying people even when there was no connection with the public interest.\u201dMr. Thiel said that Gawker published articles that were \u201cvery painful and paralyzing for people who were targeted.\u201d He said, \u201cI thought it was worth fighting back.\u201dMr. Thiel added: \u201cI can defend myself. Most of the people they attack are not people in my category. They usually attack less prominent, far less wealthy people that simply can\u2019t defend themselves.\u201d He said that \u201ceven someone like Terry Bollea who is a millionaire and famous and a successful person didn\u2019t quite have the resources to do this alone.\u201dMr. Thiel said that he had decided several years ago to set his plan in motion. \u201cI didn\u2019t really want to do anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought it would do more harm to me than good. One of my friends convinced me that if I didn\u2019t do something, nobody would.\u201dHe continued, \u201cIt\u2019s not like it is some sort of speaking truth to power or something going on here. The way I\u2019ve thought about this is that Gawker has been a singularly terrible bully. In a way, if I didn\u2019t think Gawker was unique, I wouldn\u2019t have done any of this. If the entire media was more or less like this, this would be like trying to boil the ocean.\u201d Mr. Thiel said he had not targeted any other media companies.But the revelation this week that Mr. Thiel was covertly backing Mr. Bollea\u2019s case as well as others has raised a series of new questions about the First Amendment as well as about the role of big money in the court system \u2014 specifically the emerging field of litigation finance, in which third parties like hedge funds and investment firms pay for other people\u2019s lawsuits.Roy D. Simon, a professor emeritus of legal ethics at Hofstra University School of Law, suggested that the practice has helped \u201clevel the playing field\u201d by providing resources for people to mount cases against big institutions that would be impossible otherwise.But he said there was a risk when a lawsuit was funded by a single person with a potential agenda. \u201cI am troubled by Thiel,\u201d Professor Simon said. \u201cI guess that one guy is much more likely to have an agenda driven by revenge or personal dislike or wanting to prove a point.\u201dBut other legal experts said that the mere fact of Mr. Thiel\u2019s involvement did not change the case. And while there is no legal requirement that underwriters like Mr. Thiel reveal their involvement to the opposing side or the jury, it is considered fair game for lawyers to ask questions about financial backing \u2014 something that Gawker Media did on Wednesday in court as part of its efforts to overturn the Hogan judgment.\u201cIf you really do have concerns about the merits of this case, finding out who bankrolled it doesn\u2019t really help you at all,\u201d said Mary Anne Franks, a professor at the University of Miami School of Law. Absent any indication that there is something unlawful about how the funding took place, she said, \u201cyou would still need to show that there\u2019s something substantively wrong with the ruling.\u201dIn a statement, Nick Denton, the founder of Gawker Media, who was also personally named in the Hogan suit, said: \u201cJust because Peter Thiel is a Silicon Valley billionaire, his opinion does not trump our millions of readers who know us for routinely driving big news stories including Hillary Clinton\u2019s secret email account, Bill Cosby\u2019s history with women, the mayor of Toronto as a crack smoker, Tom Cruise\u2019s role within Scientology, the N.F.L. cover-up of domestic abuse by players and just this month the hidden power of Facebook to determine the news you see.\u201dMr. Thiel is known as a brilliant entrepreneur. Born in West Germany and raised in California, he became a chess prodigy, an academic star and a promising lawyer before settling down in the Bay Area to found companies.He achieved demigod status among Silicon Valley business leaders, thanks largely to his role at PayPal, where he became the de facto don of the early employee group known as the PayPal mafia. That group went on to become power players at such Silicon Valley institutions as Tesla, YouTube, LinkedIn and Yelp.Mr. Thiel is also known for his lucrative investment in Facebook, where he is a board member, and his three venture firms, Founders Fund, Mithril and Valar. (His defunct hedge fund, Clarium Capital, has been long forgotten.) He also co-founded the secretive data-crunching start-up Palantir and bankrolled Breakout Labs, which only funds what Mr. Thiel calls \u201chard tech\u201d start-ups that tackle things like new energy, transportation and biotech companies. \u201cWe wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters,\u201d is the Founders Fund tag line.But unlike most Silicon Valley billionaires, Mr. Thiel openly supports a wide array of eccentric philanthropic and social efforts aimed at radically altering life as we know it. His Thiel fellowship gives high school and college-age students money to drop out of school and start companies. He has donated to organizations that seek to extend the human life span, such as the Methuselah Foundation. And he co-founded the Seasteading Institute, which aims to create cities that float at sea, beyond the reach of governments and their laws.A libertarian, Mr. Thiel is a pledged delegate for Donald J. Trump for the 2016 Republican National Convention.He said that he hired a legal team several years ago to look for cases that he could help financially support. \u201cWithout going into all the details, we would get in touch with the plaintiffs who otherwise would have accepted a pittance for a settlement, and they were obviously quite happy to have this sort of support,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a way very similar to how a plaintiff\u2019s lawyer on contingency would do it.\u201d Mr. Thiel declined to disclose what other cases he had supported but there are at least two current cases against Gawker.Without revealing an exact figure, he said that estimates of $10 million in expenses so far were \u201croughly in the ballpark.\u201d He added: \u201cI would underscore that I don\u2019t expect to make any money from this. This is not a business venture.\u201dHe would not say whether he had compensated any of the people, including Mr. Bollea, which could raise questions in an appeal. He insisted \u201cthere was no gray area\u201d in what he had done.Mr. Thiel was not the only boldface name in Silicon Valley who was outed as gay by Gawker Media \u2014 Timothy D. Cook, the chief executive of Apple, is another example.Owen Thomas, the former editor of Valleywag who wrote the article about Mr. Thiel, offered his side of the story in a telephone interview on Wednesday. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said before, I did not \u2018out\u2019 Peter Thiel,\u201d said Mr. Thomas, now business editor at The San Francisco Chronicle. \u201cI did discuss his sexuality, but it was known to a wide circle who felt that it was not fit for discussion beyond that circle. I thought that attitude was retrograde and homophobic, and that informed my reporting. I believe that he was out and not in the closet.\u201dMr. Thiel said he considered his financial backing of the cases against Gawker to be \u201cone of my greater philanthropic things that I\u2019ve done. I think of it in those terms.\u201dHe refused to divulge exactly what other cases he has funded but said, \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say this is not the only one.\u201dSpeculation that a secret benefactor was backing Mr. Bollea\u2019s case was whispered during the trial but largely dismissed as a conspiracy theory. It gained currency in large part as a result of an unusual decision Mr. Bollea\u2019s legal team made: It purposely excluded a claim that would have allowed Gawker\u2019s insurance company to help pay for its defense as well as damages. The move struck observers as odd because most plaintiffs seeking damages usually hope to settle the case by leveraging the deep pockets of an insurer.Mr. Thiel said, \u201cI figured it would eventually come out,\u201d adding that he was happy his role might spur a conversation about it being \u201cextremely hard for the most common victims to get justice.\u201dHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s not for me to decide what happens to Gawker. If America rallies around Gawker and decides we want more people to be outed and more sex tapes to be posted without consent, then they will find a way to save Gawker, and I can\u2019t stop it.\u201dJohn Herrman, Matthew Goldstein and Katie Benner contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Want to Buy a Self-Driving Car? Big-Rig Trucks May Come First", "Date": "2016-05-17", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Imagine you are driving on a highway late at night when a big-rig truck closes in behind you. You relax because it is keeping a safe distance and seems to be obeying the speed limit. Now imagine that truck is driving itself.Despite Silicon Valley\u2019s enthusiasm for self-driving cars, it could be years before there are many of them on the road. But autonomous 18-wheelers? One start-up is betting that is a different matter.That start-up is Otto, led by 15 former Google employees, including eight engineers. Among its staff members are major figures from Google\u2019s self-driving car and maps projects, and it is aiming at the long-haul freeway driving that is the bread and butter of the commercial trucking industry.The engineers think that automating trucks rather than passenger vehicles could be more palatable financially and to regulators. Nationally, trucks drive 5.6 percent of all vehicle miles and are responsible for 9.5 percent of highway fatalities, according to Department of Transportation data.Adding self-driving technology \u2014 at least as it stands now \u2014 into regular passenger cars could make them absurdly expensive for anyone without the cash of a Silicon Valley mogul. Until recently, the laser sensor used on the Google car project cost $75,000.Those costs are coming down, but it will be some time before they have a realistic price for consumers. But a new, big tractor-trailer truck can easily cost more than $150,000, so the added cost of robotic features could make more sense.In addition, it could make trucking more efficient, allowing, for example, a human driver to rest in the sleeper cabin while the truck takes the wheel.Still, automating commercial driving is controversial and \u2014 potentially \u2014 a job killer.There are more than three million truck drivers in the United States, according to the American Trucking Associations, and about one in every 15 workers in the country is employed in the trucking business.There is concern that if commercial trucking is completely automated, it would be economically devastating for small towns in America that thrive from supporting the long-haul trucking industry.Autonomous vehicles have in recent years become one of the tech industry\u2019s favorite projects. Uber sees them as a way to stop dealing with its pesky drivers. Tesla, along with other car manufacturers, sees autonomous technology as an important safety feature to help human drivers.Even Apple is thought to be working on some sort of self-driving car tech.Since the Google car and map veterans, Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron, founded Otto in January, the company has expanded to 41 employees and has been test-driving three Volvo trucks, logging in more than 10,000 miles.Over the weekend, Otto tested a self-driving truck in Nevada.Mr. Levandowski achieved some celebrity in 2004 while he was an industrial engineering graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley. He designed a self-driving motorcycle, stabilized by a gyroscope, that was entered in the Pentagon\u2019s first autonomous vehicle contest. Later, his start-up, 510 Systems, was acquired by Google when it began its self-driving car project.He said that he had decided to leave Google because he was eager to commercialize a self-driving vehicle as quickly as possible.\u201cGoogle is very focused on doing what they\u2019re doing and I felt that it was time to see something come to market and I really liked the idea of bringing trucks to market,\u201d he said.Mr. Ron, Otto\u2019s co-founder, is also a veteran Google software engineer. With a background in Israeli Army intelligence, he was originally the lead engineer for Google Maps.He also worked in the company\u2019s Motorola mobile phone business for three years and then in its secretive robotics research effort.But start-up life isn\u2019t like working for Google on its bucolic Silicon Valley campus.Otto has set up shop in a rickety auto garage, close to a freeway entrance in San Francisco\u2019s South of Market neighborhood. But the new office has enough space to house the firm\u2019s three new Volvo trucks, which have been equipped with cameras, radars, and spinning laser sensors known as Lidar.It is basically the same sensor array used on prototype vehicles being developed by Google, Nissan, Baidu and others. But Mr. Levandowski said that costly commercial trucks gave his designers more freedom to add high-quality sensors.Otto will offer its technology as an upgrade that a long-haul truck owner could purchase, or perhaps as a service a trucking operator could subscribe to.\u201cInitially there will be certain roads that we know we can drive more safely,\u201d Mr. Levandowski said. \u201cOn those roads we\u2019ll tell the driver, \u2018You\u2019re welcome to go take your nap or your break right now.\u2019 If that\u2019s 500 miles, that\u2019s 10 hours, so he gets his full rest.\u201dThe co-founders declined to reveal how much has been invested in the new company so far. They also would say only that they intend to \u201cdemonstrate commercial viability soon.\u201dEven as their technology progresses, Otto still faces a regulatory maze and plenty of competition.California motor vehicle regulations prohibit Otto\u2019s vision of a truck traveling on the freeway with only a sleeping driver in the cab, for example. But many states would permit that technical advance.\u201cRight now, if you want to drive across Texas with nobody at the wheel, you\u2019re 100 percent legal,\u201d said Mr. Levandowski, who as a Google engineer, helped write draft legislation that permitted self-driving vehicles, which later became law in Nevada.The company is initially aiming for the owner-operators market \u2014 truck drivers who own their own rigs and would be able to increase their productivity by sleeping during long-haul trips and dispensing with the need for a second driver.\u201cIt will take a very long time to transition three million people,\u201d Mr. Levandowski said, referring to the number of truck drivers in the United States. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s also the nature of progress. There used to be elevator operators in New York City and there are not anymore.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about a start-up that is developing self-driving tractor-trailer trucks described incorrectly 15 employees of the start-up, called Otto, who came from Google. Eight of them are engineers, not all 15.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Natural Beauty 2.0: Credo Comes to Town", "Date": "2016-05-18", "News": "Supported byWhen the founders of Credo, a beauty boutique that opened in New York last week, were planning how the store should look, they checked out other green spaces \u2014 ones that sold, say, yoga mats made of recycled rubber \u2014 and thought a lot about the differences between a Tesla and a Prius.\u201cWe wanted to be Tesla,\u201d said Annie Jackson, Credo\u2019s vice president for merchandising and planning. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want the terrariums and the Zen music in our store.\u201dShashi Batra, the founder and chief executive, who once worked at Sephora, often cites the statistic that Europe has banned 1,400 cosmetic ingredients, while the United States forbids only 11.But what Credo is really selling is the idea of switching up your beauty routine to one that seems healthier in a way that won\u2019t take you far out of your comfort zone, much as Whole Foods did with groceries or Gwyneth Paltrow does with everything. This is the kind of wellness aimed at those who recycle their Nespresso pods.In general, when it comes to knowing if what is in your moisturizing balm is bad for you, it\u2019s a murky, marketing-driven world. The Food and Drug Administration oversees only certain topical products like sunscreen, and other than requiring that labels don\u2019t misstate benefits, it lets the beauty industry regulate itself. Words like natural, nontoxic and safe have no official or legal meaning when it comes to cosmetic labeling, and dermatologists routinely caution that people can be allergic to any ingredient, natural or not.Mr. Batra deliberately puts his stores near beloved \u2014 and definitely not chemical-free \u2014 beauty companies. (The San Francisco store is close to NARS Cosmetics and the New York store is near Le Labo fragrances.)\u201cWe want you to buy all of the brands you love and then buy ours,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to dis the brand you love.\u201dThe new store, at 9 Prince Street in NoLIta, is marked by a bright blue storefront, with windows big enough to please any exhibitionist. In the airy, whitewashed space, blond-wood display cases are stocked with artisanal products, all with sleek logos and modern wrapping \u2014 skin care on one side of the store, makeup on the other. Nothing is made of hemp.Some brands tend to have personal back stories, like Suntegrity Skincare, a line of plant-derived sunscreen that was developed after the founder\u2019s mother died from skin cancer. The green skin-care doyenne Tata Harper\u2019s line is front and center, and there are hard-to-find natural products like gel eyeliners (made by Evelyn Iona) and roll-on deodorants (from True Organic of Sweden). Credo also carries kohl eyeliners and glossy eye shadows by the makeup artist Jillian Dempsey (she\u2019s planning to sculpt a display case for the products herself).\u201cWe don\u2019t spend a lot of time going off on a tangent about why it\u2019s good for you,\u201d Mr. Batra said. \u201cYou just come in, say you want a good moisturizer and SPF, and we get you a good moisturizer and SPF.\u201d The store also offers brow waxing, mini facials and makeup touch ups.\u201cIt\u2019s still totally about beauty,\u201d Ms. Jackson said. \u201cWe want to tap into that emotional part of buying beauty. We want customers to buy an $18 lip gloss, throw it in their bag and feel happy.\u201dRose-Marie Swift, a makeup artist and the founder of the organic color cosmetics line RMS Beauty, who has her products at Credo, says she tends to prefer stores with both green and mainstream brands because her products sell better there. \u201cWe need to be next to where the Chanel and Cr\u00e8me de la Mer are,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one\u2019s interested in the hippie thing.\u201dBut Ms. Swift thinks Credo could be the exception. \u201cCredo is doing it right because they\u2019re making it look like you\u2019re walking into Barneys,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re making it look chic.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "New Crowdfunding Rules Let the Small Fry Swim With Sharks", "Date": "2016-05-14", "News": "Supported byStarting Monday, new rules will permit anyone, not just the moneyed, to risk $2,000 a year or more investing in small companies in exchange for a stake in the business. Companies can raise up to $1 million a year this way.It is also an opportunity for start-ups and other small businesses, which can raise money with fairly few regulatory burdens. For instance, small companies seeking less than $500,000 and most first-time issuers will not need to provide audited financial statements, just unaudited ones.That was four years ago. It took a long time to iron out the details, in part because the Securities and Exchange Commission was concerned that ordinary people could lose their life savings because of fraud or na\u00efvet\u00e9.\u201cWhen high-growth companies are looking to raise money, it\u2019s not just for the money,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re also looking for validation, and they want it from venture funds or well-known angels. They won\u2019t get that from a crowdfunding offer.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re building a tribe of women around the world who are passionate about African textiles and want to support these emerging designers,\u201d Ms. Anyadiegwu said.Ms. Anyadiegwu wants to increase her part-time workers\u2019 hours, move her base of operations from Sayreville, N.J., to Atlanta, where she has built a clientele, and do more marketing. To finance that, she\u2019s willing to part with some of her equity in the business.\u201cOur customer base is so engaged,\u201d she said. \u201cThis could be a perfect opportunity for them to participate and be a part of the company in another way.\u201d\u201cWe can build a community around our company. That\u2019s an intangible that you don\u2019t get from private fund-raising,\u201d said Kyle Henson, 23, the company\u2019s chief business officer. He is preparing Rorus to comply with the new securities rules, he said, if it chooses to do a crowdfunding offering.But are the 230 million adult Americans who aren\u2019t millionaires really that interested in becoming do-it-yourself venture capitalists? While supporters cheer the new rules as a democratization of high finance, potentially opening up to the masses deals once reserved for the rich, skeptics worry that regular investors might get only the leftovers.They may dream of discovering the next Facebook. But the most promising companies \u2014 the high-growth ventures delivering the monster returns that keep the entire venture-capital industry afloat \u2014 may also be the ones least likely to bother raising money in small dribs from the crowd, they fear.But what got people excited was the crowdfunding provision allowing companies to raise up to $1 million with few regulatory obstacles.The company caught Mr. Hensch\u2019s eye nearly two years ago, after it raised $1.1 million on Kickstarter. He scoured tech blogs for tidbits, signed up for the company\u2019s newsletter and followed along as executives posted updates from China about their production process.So when Virtuix announced in March that it would crowdfund its next investment round, Mr. Hensch and Ms. Roumagoux jumped in. \u201cI\u2019ve seen where Robert\u2019s recommendations have gone in the market. Typically, when he identifies something early on, it becomes a blockbuster item,\u201d said Ms. Roumagoux, recalling her husband\u2019s early enthusiasm for Tesla, Netflix and a \u201creally neat\u201d search engine called Google.Ms. Roumagoux works as a lawyer, and Mr. Hensch is a real estate business manager. As financiers, \u201cwe\u2019re definitely novices,\u201d she said with a laugh, but both like the idea of diversifying their retirement fund and other investments by gambling on a small portfolio of fledgling technology ventures.Jan Goetgeluk, Virtuix\u2019s founder and chief executive, likes the idea of having hundreds or thousands of stakeholders along for the ride. \u201cThis allows us to turn those fans into true brand advocates. It\u2019s incredibly powerful.\u201dMr. Goetgeluk, a 32-year-old mechanical engineer, had dreamed of becoming an entrepreneur since moving to the United States from Belgium nine years ago. The money he raised from 3,000 backers on Kickstarter funded Virtuix\u2019s early production, and the publicity the campaign created got him a spot pitching his company to a panel of rich investors on \u201cShark Tank\u201d \u2014 where he failed to land a deal.\u201cIf my husband brought this into my house, I would divorce him immediately,\u201d Barbara Corcoran, a real estate entrepreneur, announced on the show.The rules that take effect on Monday make crowdfunding far cheaper and easier for companies to use. But the cost of that concession is a $1 million cap on the amount they can raise in a 12-month period.\u201cWe had no idea that it would take the S.E.C. four years to write all these rules,\u201d Mr. Tommarello said. \u201cWe had to figure out how to stay alive and not go bankrupt.\u201dStill, this isn\u2019t like investing in the stock market. Want to sell Facebook? Just call your broker. Want to sell your shares in Ms. Anyadiegwu\u2019s company, Zuvaa? Well, under the new crowdfunding rules, people must generally hold their shares for at least a year. And even then, there are few marketplaces for finding another buyer.But Ms. Roumagoux, who said she had skimmed the circular, isn\u2019t worried. She and her husband may not be millionaires, but she says they\u2019re financially sophisticated enough to judge the risk that they\u2019re taking.\u201cI know all these rules are there to protect us, but honestly, I don\u2019t think we need the protection,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re relatively young, and this is a long-term investment.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Building an Artist\u2019s \u2018Magic Mountains\u2019 to Draw Visitors to the Desert", "Date": "2016-05-11", "News": "Supported byThe other day, looking from a great distance on Interstate 15 toward the same lake bed, a few pinpoints of brightness were visible, neon anomalies against the dun-colored scrubland. Upon approach, the points quickly grew bigger, brighter, weirder, like a roadside attraction made by an atomically enlarged infant \u2014 seven totem-pole stacks of limestone boulders, the rocks painted in Kool-Aid shades so intense they were sometimes hard to look at in the full sunlight.The work, which officially went on view May 11, is one of the largest land-art pieces created in the United States in the last 40 years, in a part of the West that defined the land-art movement beginning in the 1960s with artists like Mr. Heizer, Robert Smithson (\u201cSpiral Jetty\u201d in Utah), Nancy Holt (\u201cSun Tunnels,\u201d west of the Bonneville Salt Flats) and Walter de Maria (\u201cThe Lightning Field\u201d in western New Mexico).Building on a renowned collection of photographs by artists like Robert Adams and Edward Burtynsky who have charted humanity\u2019s impact on the land beginning in the late 20th century, the museum founded the Center for Art and Environment in 2008, devoted to what it calls \u201ccreative interactions between people and their environments.\u201d The center is home to a rapidly growing archive, now one of the largest in the world, committed to land art, very broadly defined. And with the Rondinone project, the museum is now moving past exhibiting photographs, documentation and artifacts from historical land-art pieces and decisively entering the business of ushering new pieces into the world.\u201cI saw no reason when I came here in 2007 to strive to make this into an encyclopedic museum or one that would have a general collecting focus,\u201d said David B. Walker, the museum\u2019s executive director and chief executive, who came to the job after past lives as an academic dean, an art-magazine publisher and the singer and guitarist in two California rock bands. \u201cOr you could also go down the easy, convention-center path \u2014 taking these big flashy traveling shows and drawing big crowds to those and making a lot of people happy without much to show for it.\u201dQuoting a McKinsey consultant he once heard (who was probably paraphrasing a piece of life advice often attributed to Jerry Garcia), Mr. Walker said it became apparent to him that in the 21st century, places like his would lose in the game of trying to make themselves smaller versions of large, wealthy urban museums and that the way to succeed was not to try being the best at what you did \u201cbut to be the only one who does what you do.\u201dOf course, institutions like the Dia Art Foundation in New York and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art have long-established histories with land art. But Mr. Walker and his curators, including William L. Fox, a poet and historian of land art who runs the Center for Art and Environment, believe that the museum, in its city perched on the western edge of the Great Basin, is a logical home for such a focus and can distinguish itself by delving deeper than larger establishments are likely to do.\u201cIt feels very good when you can come back from L.A. with a half-million-dollar check for a project in Nevada that\u2019s really pretty out there,\u201d said Mr. Walker in his office at the museum, an angular black zinc-clad building completed in 2003 on the site of the institution\u2019s modest former home, a repurposed title company building.Jamie Kingham, via Nevada Museum of ArtThe Rondinone project, which the artist describes in a poetic written statement of purpose as partly about \u201cthe contrary air between the desert and the city lights\u201d and the solidarities between \u201cthe natural and the artificial,\u201d is in many ways a fitting first flag for the museum to plant. The sculptures, which will remain in place for two years and were financed mostly by private and corporate donors, connect themselves to the history of postwar American land art but also push it raucously, impishly into the 21st century, recalling a phrase that Mr. Fox likes to quote from the art critic Jeff Kelley to describe Las Vegas: \u201cThe American dream in drag.\u201dAll of the documents and ephemera chronicling the creation of the pieces, and they are legion \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t think I have any files as fat with legal documents,\u201d Mr. Fox said \u2014 will go into the museum\u2019s archives. And the outsize presence of the sculptures within easy driving distance of Las Vegas, rising from a scatter of mesquite bushes, yucca and stumps of dead Joshua trees, is like a high-art billboard for the institution\u2019s particular ambitions.Mr. Rondinone, who had seen the sculptures as the boulders were being shaped, connected and painted at a nearby quarry but never in their intended setting, looking like sentinels stationed before the sweep of the McCullough mountain range, walked around them quietly, almost reverently, as the sun went down. He said he welcomed whatever the desert would do to the pieces over the next two years. The erosion, fading and dirt would become part of the works. (Human intervention, in the form of spray paint or target-practice bullets, is not invited; the pieces have been coated with an antigraffiti shield and will be repaired if damaged.)\u201cBut then I realized that size doesn\u2019t mean anything out here,\u201d said Mr. Rondinone, 51, who was raised in the Swiss resort town of Brunnen and lives and works in Harlem. \u201cThe scale makes everything look small. That\u2019s what you quickly figure out in the desert.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like they even have their own personalities,\u201d he added. \u201cNot exactly human, I guess. But maybe kindly disposed toward us.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can a 700 M.P.H. Train in a Tube Be for Real?", "Date": "2016-05-19", "News": "Supported byLast month, at an M.I.T. conference on the future of suburbia, I met a senior-level executive from Hyperloop Technologies. (Hyperloop is a speculative high-speed transportation system that proposes to use passenger and cargo capsules inside a reduced-pressure tube that aims to reach a top speed of 700 miles per hour.) Why put your energies in something that still feels like science fiction? I asked him. Why not invest time, money and ingenuity in high-speed rail? (I live in California; I want to see high-speed rail happen.)Our conversation veered into a surprising direction, much like the proposed curve of a Hyperloop track. He told me about how he and his wife had made the decision not to be together but to share custody of their children and continue to live under the same roof. I looked at him quizzically.The structure of marriage, he continued, didn\u2019t work for him; it was an outdated institution. High-speed rail, he said, was also an outdated institution, so why should we continue to invest in trains?And so, according to his analogy, one might fairly describe Hyperloop as transportation\u2019s new girlfriend: mysterious, unencumbered, exciting, expensive. A wild card with potential. But does she have long-term potential? That remains to be seen.I went to Las Vegas recently to view the first test of Hyperloop. As someone who experiences aging infrastructure daily and desires something better, I was ready to be convinced of the feasibility and future of this idea, which has become one of the purest expressions of techno-optimism.Several separate entities have since been formed to explore the possibilities. The event I attended was presented by Hyperloop Technologies, a group inspired by but not affiliated with Mr. Musk (though riding on his name recognition and involving several of his former employees). Hyperloop Technologies and its competitors are working to develop a structure to move passengers and cargo between two points safely, efficiently and sustainably. And quickly: Mr. Musk\u2019s initial dream was to propel passengers from San Francisco to Los Angeles in about a half an hour (Amtrak takes 12 hours; flight time is an hour).Hyperloop Technologies, which announced its name change to Hyperloop One with much fanfare in Las Vegas, is a well-funded operation with over 100 employees. It\u2019s gaining new investors (such as Vinod Khosla, a founder of Sun Microsystems; Sherpa Ventures; and SNCF, the French train company) and new partners (including the engineering firms Aecom and ARUP, as well as the starchitect Bjarke Ingels) almost as fast as the model on view at its press event.Approximately 200 investors, polo-shirted employees and reporters piled onto buses to converge on a site that looked eerily like a desert scene from \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201d We\u2019d been brought here to watch a test vehicle accelerate down a rail track at speeds of up to 300 m.p.h. using the company\u2019s propulsion technology. The dream is that capsules will hurl through a tube at 700 miles per hour on a cushion of air. That, however, was not what we witnessed.But I have questions. A lot of them.America (and later most of the world) got excited about freeways and built them everywhere over a 30-year span. Little did we know about the negative effects to neighborhoods, the health (obesity) and pollution risks, the excesses of traffic. What are the possible unintended positive and negative consequences of Hyperloop?Will Hyperloop exist as a series of isolated runs or as a comprehensive network?Hyperloop hopes to connect to city centers: What should cities be doing now to accommodate its arrival?Nevada is a famously lax regulatory environment. How will Hyperloop avoid the regulatory obstacles that every other transportation mode faces in more rigorous states?Hyperloop requires narrower rights of way than rails and highways but also requires curvier ones to offset those G-forces. Where will these go?I was told the right of way issue could be avoided by putting Hyperloop underground or underwater, but what are the environmental and cost impacts of that approach?In case of an emergency, how do you evacuate a Hyperloop that\u2019s under a mountain or under water?Will Hyperloop vehicles and tubes have windows? Will passengers want to see the world go by at 400 m.p.h. at ground level?What will Hyperloop do to ensure that people can get to and from its stations?Who is Hyperloop intended to serve? Will lower- and middle-income people be able to afford it? Would we be better off with a less expensive but somewhat slower system that can benefit more people and have lower ticket prices?Skepticism is O.K., Hyperloop\u2019s chief executive told me during our brief conversation at the event, but not cynicism. So I\u2019ll suspend mine a bit to acknowledge that Hyperloop One has achieved an incredible amount of work in a ridiculously short time. It will pain cities that have labored years to get bike lanes painted or bus stops moved to learn that a mere six months ago, this whole operation was little more than a vision. Now it\u2019s an $80 million venture with global partners.\u201cNo one comes close to our progress in commercializing this revolutionary transportation system,\u201d said Brogan BamBrogan, Hyperloop One\u2019s chief technology officer and a founder, before the test run.(That\u2019s two \u201cbros\u201d in one moniker, by the way, an effect even the scriptwriters of \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d wouldn\u2019t have gone for. Mr. BamBrogan\u2019s real first name is Kevin. This is just one of many aspects to this undertaking that makes me feel that it will all be revealed as a breathtaking piece of performance art.)I\u2019ve written in this space about the dearth of awe in infrastructure and so I\u2019ll applaud Hyperloop (again, modeling itself on Mr. Musk\u2019s media mastery) for conjuring an irresistible narrative of possibility. With Hyperloop One, nothing is deferred or delayed; these guys are in a mad rush. They\u2019re following in the product release footsteps of Apple, not the Department of Transportation. The company says that it will be moving cargo in 2019; passengers by 2021. That\u2019s three years from now.I asked Rob Lloyd, Hyperloop One\u2019s chief executive, what he was most proud of. \u201cThe speed with which the technology is being developed,\u201d he replied. \u201cWhen it works, it does change everything.\u201d\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing right now is what I saw in 1996,\u201d said Mr. Lloyd, a former president of sales and development at Cisco. \u201cWe all had I.P. routers and everything was done a certain way. At Cisco, we said, \u2018You can carry that over the Internet,\u2019 and everyone said, \u2018No.\u2019 But those high-speed networks made the Internet possible.\u201d Hyperloop, he said, \u201cwill do to the physical world what the Internet did to the digital one.\u201d\u201cGeography was our destiny, but soon you\u2019ll see opportunity democratized and communities transformed,\u201d said another founder, Shervin Pishevar, echoing the tech industry\u2019s particular skill at casting virtually any endeavor as world-changing.A compelling notion, to be sure, one that I took to heart after being exhorted after the evening event to \u201cgo grab some drinks and get a chance to interface.\u201dAllison Arieff, who specializes in architecture and design, is a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tesla Says It Will Sharply Ramp Up Production of Model 3", "Date": "2016-05-04", "News": "Supported byDETROIT \u2014 Tesla Motors said on Wednesday that it was confident it could accelerate production to meet high demand for its forthcoming Model 3 electric vehicle, despite the departure of two top manufacturing executives.The carmaker\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, said that Tesla expected to produce a total of 500,000 vehicles by 2018, two years sooner than previously announced.The goal represents a huge leap from Tesla\u2019s production of about 15,000 vehicles in the first three months of this year. But Mr. Musk expressed confidence that the company could meet the ambitious target, and begin filling more than 325,000 orders for the Model 3 by late next year.\u201cI think we have done a good job on the design and technology of our products,\u201d Mr. Musk said in a conference call with analysts. \u201cThe big thing we need to achieve in the future is also to be the leader in manufacturing.\u201dThe expansion will take place without the help of Greg Reichow, Tesla\u2019s vice president for production, who is taking a leave of absence after five years with the company. Also leaving the company is John Ensign, who had been vice president for manufacturing since 2014.Mr. Musk, who said he was recruiting new manufacturing executives, gave no reason for the unexpected departures.\u201cWe\u2019re confident that with the strength of the team, high-quality manufacturing at Tesla will continue,\u201d he said.The company said Mr. Reichow would assist in the transition.\u201cMy belief in Tesla\u2019s ability to successfully deliver great cars and inspire the world to drive electric remains as strong as ever,\u201d Mr. Reichow said in a statement released by the company.Mr. Musk did not share details of how Tesla would increase vehicle production, but he said in a letter to shareholders that the move \u201cwill likely require some additional capital\u201d to finance the expansion.The company is also building a major battery plant for its vehicles in Nevada, and expects to produce its first battery cells there by the end of this year.An expansion is necessary to meet the extraordinary demand for the Model 3, which will be the company\u2019s first electric vehicle aimed at mass-market consumers.One industry analyst said converting all the orders into sales could be a difficult task, particularly if new electric cars from other automakers hit the market before the Model 3.\u201cWhile pre-orders suggest demand could be there, with recent executive departures and more competitive offerings, this may be tough to achieve,\u201d Efraim Levy at S&P Global Market Intelligence said in a research note.Mr. Musk reiterated earlier forecasts that Tesla would sell up to 90,000 Model X S.U.V.s and Model S luxury sedans this year.For the first quarter, Tesla reported wider losses, but larger revenues, than in the same period in 2015. The company said that it lost about $283 million, on revenues of $1.15 billion, in the first three months of this year. During the same period last year, it reported revenues of about $940 million and a loss of $154 million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ultra-Luxury for the 1%", "Date": "2016-04-30", "News": "Supported byLettersReaders discuss how certain businesses, like cruise lines, are catering to the very wealthy.The privileged will always carve out enclaves of splendor. These are targeted by some of The Times\u2019s ads. The threat to democracy is not from a disparity in dining options on cruises, but from an entrenched gap in critical services. The article only touches on the real divide \u2014 where public services favor the wealthy. Forget the false dichotomy of luxury travel. Look at the bifurcated legal system, asymmetric political influence, and imbalances in education, medical options and, sadly, even potable water. This is where, and why, the income gap matters.MARGARET V. SIEBELWashingtonTo the Editor: A generation ago, only the very wealthy idle rich could take cruises. Now, cruising is within the reach of large segments of the population, and that democratization of the cruising experience should be celebrated, not scorned. With the demand so large and democratized, cruise companies can now segment the market and provide fancier amenities for those who want and can pay for them, while providing a vacation experience to tens of thousands that could only have been imagined a few decades ago. And that segmentation should also be celebrated because the higher profits from the luxury passengers effectively subsidize the mass-market passengers, making a cruise vacation more affordable for more people.Rather than illustrating some sort of fundamental unfairness or inequality, the article demonstrates how free markets benefit those of modest means by making goods and services more affordable.ROBERT ATKINSONSparta, N.J.To the Editor: To even suggest that this is news angers me. Ninety-nine percent of us have known this for decades. We shop at Sam\u2019s Club, drive an older vehicle, are knee deep in credit card debt and have a mortgage we can\u2019t afford. Many of us are paying off exorbitant college loans. If we do take a vacation, it is just another debt to be paid off later with more sacrifice and harder work.This is no \u201cage of privilege\u201d for most of us. Your \u201cmoney-based caste system\u201d is not news to us. That businesses are catering to the wealthy is not news either. Businesses know that we, at the bottom of the income heap, are pumped dry. They will always follow the money. What\u2019s the news?PATRICK A. STEVENSMoose Lake, Minn.To the Editor: Given all the real problems we face in providing adequate health and housing for all citizens, I was shocked that The Times devoted so much space on its front page to a caste system on cruise ships. What\u2019s next? An expos\u00e9 revealing that first-class passengers on airlines get preferential treatment, knee room, free drinks and almost edible food?JEAN VANDERVOORT CULLENNew YorkTo the Editor: To say the cruise industry has recently begun catering to the affluent at the expense of the rest of the public is wrong for at least three reasons.Special services for well-heeled guests is a long maritime tradition. Such opulence was well depicted in the movie \u201cTitanic.\u201d Given this tradition, Norwegian Cruise Line\u2019s Haven oasis and Royal Caribbean\u2019s super suites aren\u2019t anything particularly new.Another grand maritime tradition is that every new ship must outdo all ships previously built. That race has been focused on size and speed. But recently, the industry\u2019s one-upsmanship has focused on guest experience innovations, nearly all of which are available equally to all guests. Many cabins today have private balconies, luxurious bathrooms, fine linens and flat screen TVs, and ships offer world-class spas, Broadway-quality entertainment and fine-dining experiences for all.All of these innovations are available at prices that have never been more accessible.Today, more than ever, cruise ships are a melting pot of people from different economic circumstances all enjoying their vacation experience together.ADAM SNITZERMiami BeachThe writer has been a cruise industry executive and consultant for 20 years.To the Editor: I would venture that almost all the people reading this article, whether they realize it or not, are part of the pampered few when compared with much of the world\u2019s population. Having a home, food and many of our conveniences is the equivalent of living in the elite Haven on a Norwegian cruise ship.LOUIS KRAMBERGRego Park, QueensTo the Editor: The two cruise lines featured in this article, Norwegian and Royal Caribbean, cater to middle-class families. There are about a half dozen cruise lines that cater exclusively to wealthy consumers \u2014 the entire ship is a \u201cHaven\u201d \u2014 so what\u2019s interesting is whether Norwegian is trying to poach customers from those lines or to get their current customer base to upgrade.It\u2019s a concept called \u201caffordable luxury.\u201d You may not be able to buy a $3 million house or drive a Tesla, but you can buy a $500 espresso machine or a $200 pair of jeans or take a $10,000 cruise and feel wealthy, at least for the moment. That\u2019s what most of the article\u2019s examples sound like to me \u2014 ways for middle-class consumers to splurge and feel like the 1 percent.ALAN WOLKMillburn, N.J.To the Editor: \u201cA little envy can be good for the bottom line,\u201d according to your article \u2014 a sentiment worthy of Marie Antoinette, just before the French Revolution. How long will Americans whose shrinking incomes render them far more than simply envious put up with the forces that exacerbate the inequalities they see daily?While most of the \u201chave-nots\u201d in this country can\u2019t really envision any kind of cruise, much less $10,000 quarters on a luxury ship, promoters of segregation based on class are stoking fires that in other cultures have led to riots and even revolution. Oblivious to the struggles of even those in the middle class, the very wealthy flaunt their positions. Funding for social services has declined as tax breaks for the wealthy have risen.One wonders where this trajectory will lead \u2014 but it does not inspire hope.BARBARA A.

{"Headline": "The Rolex Daytona is the Hottest Watch That Money Can\u2019t Buy", "Date": "2016-05-02", "News": "Supported byOn TimeThis sleekly contemporary update of one of the most collectible watches of the last 50 years drew audible oohs when it debuted at the Baselworld watch fair in March.Despite the $12,400 price, dealers were bombarded with orders. \u201cFrom the moment it was announced, demand was unlike anything we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said Ira Melnitsky, the chief executive of Tourneau, the watch retailer.There was just one problem: Daytonas are scarce. Considered a timepiece for cognoscenti, not first-time buyers, the company typically parcels them out in limited numbers to dealers, who, in turn, set aside the few they can get for their most loyal customers.Anyone who knows how many, or few, Daytonas will actually be made is not telling. A spokeswoman for Rolex, a company that is discreet to say the least, declined to discuss production or distribution plans for the new model or even the official release date. (Many aficionados expect it in stores this summer.)\u201cWe\u2019ll never have enough to satisfy demand,\u201d Mr. Melnitsky said.This is hardly the first time that the Rolex Daytona has created a fuss. The storied chronograph, named after the Daytona speedway in Florida, debuted in the 1960s as a tool for auto racing enthusiasts. With its three subdials for timing laps, it was basically the world\u2019s most regal stopwatch.By the 1970s, it was already achieving icon status, with a big boost from Paul Newman, who adopted it as his signature timepiece when he developed a passion for motor sports.Anticipation of the new model has been building for years, especially after Rolex redesigned its Submariner and GMT-Master II models with Cerachrom, a scuff- and fade-resistant ceramic that infuses these venerable midcentury models with a 21st-century flair.The wait was finally over in March. \u201cMy phone started vibrating nonstop at Baselworld moments after Rolex raised the green window shades,\u201d said Stephen Pulvirent, a watch journalist and editor at Surface magazine. \u201cEverybody was chirping, \u2018It\u2019s finally here.\u2019\u201dThat same day, some even lined up outside the Fifth Avenue flagship of Wempe Jewelers, a prominent Rolex dealer, before it opened, said Ruediger Albers, the president of American Wempe Corporation.But for Rolex devotees, the heady rush quickly gave way to a gnawing realization that they were going to have to wait a long time to possess one. To some, it feels like an horological version of \u201cWaiting for Godot.\u201dTo some dealers, even two years seems optimistic. Mr. Albers said the wait could reach five years.\u201cManaging expectations is a challenge,\u201d said Mr. Albers, who is considering engraving the purchaser\u2019s names on the back of each watch to discourage buyers only looking to resell for a profit. He is also considering setting aside a couple of Daytonas for loyal customers to borrow for a week, so they can at least \u201cenjoy the newness.\u201dEven so, the Daytona is likely to remain the most unattainable status symbol in town. \u201cIt certainly takes less time to get great \u2018Hamilton\u2019 tickets,\u201d Mr. Albers said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple, Set to Move to Its Spaceship, Should Try More Moonshots", "Date": "2016-05-04", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtApple is running out of parking spaces. If you drop by its Infinite Loop headquarters, you will find the place stretched beyond capacity. Even the valets, who double and triple-park the Teslas and Porsches that now flock to the world\u2019s most valuable company, have given up finding free spots.That is still true. Several analysts project that over the next year, Apple\u2019s iPhone sales will return to slow growth rather than decline, which should keep its bottom line at its current stratospheric level.But you don\u2019t build spaceship-shaped corporate monuments on the prospect of doing just fine. The deeper question is whether Apple can keep its place as the North Star of the tech firmament. Can the company build the next great platform in computing, as it did the last one? Are its best days ahead of it, as Timothy D. Cook, the chief executive, insists \u2014 or is the new campus the capstone of an era of Apple dominance that we will never see again?I will offer a suggestion. To thrive in the next era of tech, Apple needs to take a series of bigger, bolder risks.But the next moment in tech is likely to be dominated by data-driven online services \u2014 more products like Siri and Apple Pay, fewer stand-alone hardware innovations like the iPhone.In that environment, the slow search for precision and perfection might no longer be in Apple\u2019s best interest. Mr. Cook\u2019s goal, now, should be to alter Apple\u2019s governing ethos to induce a small measure of chaos into his company.It is likely that Apple is already working on some bold plans in secret (a car and a pay TV service are among several that have long been reported). The shift I\u2019m calling for would not be radical, just evolutionary. It should be more nimble and slightly more public with its experiments, and push more of them out sooner. When it releases stuff, it should move faster to fix and improve what is wrong. Above all, it should take more risks; it should say yes more often.These changes will be difficult because they could upset Apple\u2019s customer base and its brand. Experimenting more means failing more, usually in public. Failing means looking bad, and looking bad isn\u2019t something Apple does well.In this environment, the best new products are not likely to be obvious. They will most likely be ridiculed at first and they may actually be kind of useless in early versions. But over time, with brainstorming and updates based on consumer feedback, you might discover something precious.Apple has accumulated many of the pieces to create technologies of the future. It has expertise in voice recognition, data mining, wearables, and of course, hardware and software design. Most importantly, it also has a huge installed base of users who willingly try its newest products.What it doesn\u2019t have quite yet is enough of an appetite for the speed and risks that come with creating and maintaining new services. Some of its sins here have been unforgivable. Siri was one of the earliest voice-recognition technologies released to the public. It wasn\u2019t perfect when it came out and Apple has made slow improvements over time. Today\u2019s Siri is vastly more powerful than yesterday\u2019s.But it still feels like a missed opportunity. There is so much Siri should be able to do that it cannot. Why can\u2019t Siri plug into more parts of my phone? Why can\u2019t it tap into the Uber app to call a car for me, or start up HBO Now when I say, \u201cHey, show me last week\u2019s \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019?\u201dI\u2019m not sure I quite buy Mr. Thompson\u2019s thesis about the cause of some of Apple\u2019s mistakes in its online services. It is not clear that Apple needs a wholesale restructuring rather than simply a greater push from Mr. Cook to be bolder in these products.It is important to note, too, that Apple has very patient customers and that the overall value of its ecosystem often makes up for particular deficits in some of its services. Consider Apple Music, a subscription music service that offered no great improvements over competing services like Spotify. Yet despite being late to market and not as pleasant to use as rivals, Apple Music has snapped up 13 million subscribers paying $120 a year.\u201cIt\u2019s already become a $2 billion business, and it did not exist last year,\u201d said Kulbinder Garcha, an analyst at Credit Suisse who has said that Apple can realize significant growth in its profits by creating and improving online services. If Apple moves quickly to fix some of the problems with Apple Music \u2014 cleaning up its user interface, adding handy features like Spotify\u2019s in-app lyrics browser \u2014 it could easily build on that early growth.\u201cThese things don\u2019t have to be a hit from day one, but what\u2019s important is that they keep learning from their mistakes and keep updating them,\u201d Mr. Garcha said. In other words, Be faster, take more risks, go bold.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Audi\u2019s Virtual Cockpit, Technology Is Your Co-Pilot", "Date": "2016-05-19", "News": "Supported byTHE video game experience has arrived in the automobile.It\u2019s called the virtual cockpit and, starting with Audi, it will become a more common feature in cars in the not too distant future.Gone are the traditional mechanical dials \u2014 the speedometer, the tachometer, the various gauges and pointers \u2014 and in their place is a 12.3-inch LCD screen that houses an animated instrument cluster.The high-resolution screen, which lights up behind the steering wheel, directly in the driver\u2019s line of sight, can be programmed to show several functions \u2014 for navigation, a cellphone, radio and media, Google Earth 3-D graphics, and traffic data. That is in addition to the usual functions of showing speed, engine revolutions, outside temperature and the gas level.By any standard, it\u2019s an abundance of information, all on one screen. But it also has some drivers and experts asking: How much is too much, and will consumers understand it?Paul A. Green, a research professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s Transportation Research Institute, expressed concern over displays.\u201cOne of the principles here is that displays that people use while driving generally should not be dynamic,\u201d said Mr. Green, who said that he had not spent any time auditioning the system. \u201cIt becomes like a movie that you\u2019re watching, and anything that adds even a half a second or so is problematic.\u201dAudi said that a central objective in designing the virtual cockpit was simplicity.\u201cIf you look at the virtual cockpit and notice something different, we\u2019ve failed,\u201d said Justin Goduto, a spokesman for Audi. \u201cHow can we achieve a functional operation in as few steps as possible?\u201dThe on-screen menus are designed to allow access to items with a single click of the steering wheel buttons, Mr. Goduto said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want people having to dive down.\u201dThe heart of the virtual cockpit is a powerful computer processor made by Nvidia.Nvidia said that precision and safety were two important goals of the virtual cockpit.\u201cDriver distraction is a big issue, and if you have graphics that don\u2019t look good, poor-quality maps that lag, that are hard to read, it becomes a distraction,\u201d said Danny Shapiro, senior director for automotive development at Nvidia.The virtual cockpit does have its adherents.Michael Wong test-drove a new Audi Q7 with and without the system, and wound up ordering the vehicle with the virtual cockpit.\u201cIf it was a feature to sell Audis, they\u2019ve accomplished their mission,\u201d he said.\u201cI\u2019d rather have the luxury of having those functions than not,\u201d said Mr. Wong, who lives in Stamford, Conn., and is in the Army Reserve. He allowed that duplicating the information on the virtual cockpit and the center screen might be overkill. He also noted that having dueling information available can be distracting, but added, \u201cPicking up a phone call can be distracting. You got to pick your poison.\u201dBecause the Audi technology is so new and integrated into only a few of the brand\u2019s vehicles \u2014 the 2016 TT and the 2017 A4 sedan, Q7 sport utility vehicle and R8 sports car \u2014 mass-market reaction has been limited.But a study about to be made public raises concerns about how challenging it is to use Audi\u2019s Virtual Cockpit 1.0, said Kristin Kolodge, executive director of driver interaction at J. D. Power, the research firm.The study, which asked about buyers\u2019 attitudes toward the system in the Audi TT two-seater coupe, found that the TT\u2019s virtual cockpit presented a \u201ccomplex system with a number of layers,\u201d she said.\u201cIt\u2019s going to take a significant amount of time for the consumer to learn it,\u201d said Ms. Kolodge, who declined to divulge specific data from the study before it was released.The virtual cockpit is not a standard feature in base models. To add it to the A4 Premium Plus model requires buying a $3,250 technology package option.But to Aadel Khan, it\u2019s worth it. He bought the system for his two-month-old Audi Q7, which cost $73,000.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons I bought the car,\u201d said Mr. Khan, who works in auto performance tuning in Houston.\u201cI love being able to toggle the gauges from larger to smaller,\u201d Mr. Khan said. \u201cHey, do you need your speedometer to be big? You just need a digital readout to tell you how fast you\u2019re going. And having the map right in front of you is nice, because you\u2019re only glancing up and down, and you don\u2019t have to look to the right.\u201dMr. Shapiro of Nvidia said that his company was working with several other manufacturers, including Tesla, Honda, the Volkswagen group (Audi is part of that family) and Mercedes-Benz, which last year showed its own system that incorporates an array of digital displays in and around the dashboard.Not all automakers, including General Motors, agree with the approach, however.\u201cWe recognize the need to push the tech, but we have different philosophies in how we present the information to the driver,\u201d said Nick Richards, a spokesman for General Motors. \u201cWe have a belief that information should be displayed in multiple locations.\u201dHe added, \u201cThere are some functions you want to have redundant on a nice big beautiful display in the center.\u201dG.M. is also taking another view at cockpit display technology: the rear view.Cadillac\u2019s CT6 sedan offers a feature called the \u201cfull display mirror,\u201d which transforms the inside rearview mirror into a high-resolution digital display that is fed images from a backward-facing camera mounted atop the car.The device, developed by Gentex Corporation, is a hybrid as well, with a toggle to revert to a conventional mirror if the electronic display fails.\u201cIt is a mirror first and foremost, because there are cases when the drivers want to look at the people behind them during conversations,\u201d said Neil Boehm, vice president for engineering at Gentex.\u201cOn the other hand, with passengers in the back, or luggage piled up, or you\u2019re bringing the kids home from school, by having the display you still have a great view of what\u2019s behind,\u201d he said.Gentex\u2019s mirror will be offered in the coming Chevrolet Bolt and by other manufacturers in coming months, Mr. Boehm said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ukraine Makes Iffy Progress After Trade Pact With Europe", "Date": "2016-05-09", "News": "Supported by5 PhotosMUKACHEVO, Ukraine \u2014 Before gliding along trails or sliding down slopes, many of the world\u2019s skis start at this bustling, sprawling factory in western Ukraine.Here, skilled machinists combine wobbly ribbons of carbon fiber and thin sheets of stiff titanium, stacking them like cake layers, and then heat-pressing, shaping and polishing them into finished slats for cross-country or downhill use.Here, too, craftworkers steam and bend wood into the sticks used by hockey players around the world under brand names that include Nike and Oxelo.The factory\u2019s Austrian owner, Fischer Sports, pays employees the equivalent of about $307 a month on average \u2014 perhaps one-eighth the amount that skilled woodworkers and machinists might earn in Fischer\u2019s home country.And since January, when a new free-trade pact between Ukraine and the 28-country European Union took effect, Fischer\u2019s costs have been further reduced by the elimination of tariffs on the machinery and raw materials flowing into the country and the finished goods that are shipped back out.The pay may seem paltry by Western standards, but the factory\u2019s 1,500 workers tend to see the jobs as an opportunity. Ukraine is one of the Northern Hemisphere\u2019s poorest countries, with an economy that generates less than $3,100 a year per person.\u201cEurope is our future,\u201d said Yuri V. Oros, a machinist on the ski line.And even as Fischer and some other multinational companies, including Nexans, a French maker of electrical wiring, have invested in Ukrainian operations to take advantage of the free-trade arrangement, many other companies are hesitant to venture into this former Soviet republic.So it is unclear how far any benefits of the trade pact might carry beyond the western edge of Ukraine near the Polish border, where most of these factories are situated, and into the broader economy in this country of 44.4 million, about 5 million of whom are now living in areas claimed by Russia or pro-Russian separatists.\u201cWe will have episodic, anecdotal success stories, but it\u2019s too early to call it a success,\u201d said Tymofiy S. Mylovanov, president of the Kiev School of Economics.Over all, Mr. Mylovanov said, Ukraine\u2019s economy is barely growing, stunted by low labor productivity and widespread corruption. Only over the long run, he said, might the trade agreement help lift Ukrainians from poverty.The new government in Kiev pivoted back to the European agreement, signing it in March 2014. But that same month Russia annexed the Ukrainian province of Crimea, inciting a Russian-backed civil war in eastern Ukraine.By the time the European Union trade pact took effect as scheduled, many Ukrainians were so distracted or demoralized by war and years of recession that they hardly noticed.Yet, here in Mukachevo, a picturesque town of cobble-paved roads and a 14th century hilltop castle left over from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Fischer plant provides a glimpse of what the future of greater European integration could mean for this country.Fischer\u2019s Ukranian subsidiary, privately held, does not disclose financial figures for the factory. But executives say they expect benefits of the trade pact to add about 500,000 euros, or around $565,000, to the factory\u2019s profits this year.\u201cUkraine has all the preconditions for investment,\u201d Vasyl Ryabych, the factory\u2019s director, said in an interview in his office, which overlooks the factory\u2019s groomed lawn surrounded by rose hedges.In the same way the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994 spurred a surge of light-industry manufacturers \u2014 the so-called maquiladoras \u2014 along Mexico\u2019s border with the United States, the association agreement is meant to encourage development along Ukraine\u2019s borders with the European Union. In turn, Ukraine is obliged to alter domestic economic policies through measures like overhauling the judiciary and changing rules for awarding state contracts.The Fischer plant is only one of the signs of foreign investment popping up around Lviv, the regional capital of western Ukraine.Nexans, the French company, recently rented land near Lviv where it plans to spend 120 million hryvnia, or about $4.7 million, on a factory that would put 2,000 people to work making automotive wire. Another Nexans plant in the region already makes wiring for BMW, General Motors and other carmakers.Leoni, a German competitor to Nexans, operates a factory in Stryi, in the Lviv region, making cables for Volkswagen, Opel, Porsche and others.And Fujikura, a Japanese car parts maker, last fall announced plans to open a factory in the next three years that would employ about 3,000 Ukrainians.\u201cThe economy is orienting toward Europe,\u201d said Veronika Movchan, an economist at VoxUkraine, a research organization in Kiev.The tilt westward has increased Ukraine\u2019s trade with the European Union to more than a third of the country\u2019s total imports and exports, compared with less than a quarter in 2012.During that same span, however, Ukrainian exports to Russia fell by more than half, to 12.7 percent \u2014 a share that could slip further because Moscow has put tariffs on goods from Ukraine in retaliation for the European trade pact.And tariff-free trade with the European Union is a two-way street: As more European products compete with local goods, Ukraine might fall short of even its modest forecast of 1 percent growth this year, some economists now say.The trade pact also placed tight restrictions on agricultural imports into the European Union, despite agriculture being one of Ukraine\u2019s strengths. The quotas for tariff-free honey imports are so low, for example, that Ukrainian beekeepers used them up in the first six weeks of the year.\u201cIf Ukraine has any hope at all, it is agriculture,\u201d said Ivan Tchakarov, chief economist for former Soviet states with Citi. \u201cBut the fact that they\u2019ve used up most annual quotas already suggests this agreement is not having the desired effect.\u201dAll the more reason that supporters of the trade pact are counting on continued success from the Fischer plant, which is already branching out beyond skis and hockey sticks.Having demonstrated its agility in handling carbon-fiber materials, and noting the regional growth in car parts, the factory has set up a workshop that takes on the labor-intensive work of polishing components for the auto industry.The sleek, lightweight parts include engine mounts for high-performance BMW M3 models and exterior panels for Audi, Porsche and Tesla. After the polishing, the parts are shipped back to wealthier markets.\u201cWe\u2019re like China,\u2019\u2019 said Mr. Ryabych, the factory director, \u201cbut on the border with Europe.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Automakers Befriend Start-Ups Like Uber, Girding Against a Changing Car Culture", "Date": "2016-05-24", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Automakers are looking toward a technology-driven future, one where they increasingly acknowledge that getting around may not require owning a car.The alliances are the latest in a string of pairings between technology companies and traditional automakers that are scrambling to reposition themselves. For decades, automakers had abided by the well-worn formula of making bigger and more powerful cars to fuel their growth.But start-ups like Uber and Lyft and technology companies like Google and Tesla have disrupted that cadence. These companies, mostly located in Silicon Valley, have in the last few years sped the development of self-driving cars, electric vehicles and ride services.Automakers have become increasingly concerned about those technologies and their potential to help people travel easily and cheaply without owning a car \u2014 or even without knowing how to drive.In some American cities, small groups of people are already choosing not to own cars by relying on ride-hailing services like Uber, through which consumers can order a ride through their smartphone, and car-sharing companies like Zipcar, where they essentially pick up a car whenever they need to drive one. Eventually, self-driving cars will be a reality, which would let Uber and others field fleets of driverless vehicles that can operate around the clock and further cut the cost of ride services.Karl Brauer, an analyst at the research firm Kelley Blue Book, said there was no sign that car-sharing or ride-sharing \u2014 sometimes called \u201cmobility services\u201d \u2014 was slowing auto sales today. Auto sales in the United States hit a record high in 2015 and are on the rise this year, and China and other international markets will ensure the global auto market continues to grow.Nevertheless, auto companies are investing in companies like Uber \u201cto be ahead of the curve\u201d if they do shake up car ownership down the road, Mr. Brauer said. \u201cHistory has shown that if you wait for the market to decide, you\u2019re dead,\u201d he said.Last June, Uber said it had approximately 20,000 regular drivers in the Chinese city of Chengdu alone, on par with the approximately 22,000 drivers in San Francisco and 26,000 in New York at the time.Toyota said that in its work with Uber, the companies would also cooperate on trials in countries where ride-hailing is growing.The companies also plan to develop in-car apps that support Uber drivers, and to share their knowledge and research, they said.Next month, Volkswagen is supposed to detail a plan to buy back or repair about 500,000 diesel models that had the cheating software and were sold in the United States.About the same time, Volkswagen is also planning to unveil a \u201cStrategy 2025\u201d in which mobility initiatives will play major roles. In April, Volkswagen said it intended to set up a separate mobility company to oversee investments and initiatives on this front.\u201cWe aim to become a world leading mobility provider by 2025,\u201d Matthias M\u00fcller, chief executive of Volkswagen, said in a statement.Shahar Waiser, Gett\u2019s chief executive, stressed the synchronicity his company had with Volkswagen\u2019s European sales, and how the companies were focused on both consumer and business clients. Mr. Waiser said Gett had $500 million in revenue, 30 percent of which came from the company\u2019s 4,000 corporate and business clients, and that it was profitable in some markets.Gett, which is popular in more than 60 European cities, as well as Moscow and New York, said it planned to use the capital to continue expanding its European operations.\u201cBy now, people realize that the landscape is so big \u2014 and every market is so different \u2014 there will be more than a monopoly or a duopoly,\u201d Mr. Waiser said. \u201cYou will always see two, maybe three major players in this space, wherever you go.\u201dMike Isaac reported from San Francisco, and Neal E.
