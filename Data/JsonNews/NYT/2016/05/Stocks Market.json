{"Headline": "Tesla to Sell $2 Billion in Shares to Bolster Model 3 Output", "Date": "2016-05-18", "News": "Supported byTesla Motors said on Wednesday it would offer about $2 billion in stock, mainly to help it ramp up production of its new Model 3 electric car over the next two years.The company unveiled the Model 3, its first mass-market car, in March and has been flooded with orders even though the compact sedan will not be available for a year or more. So far, Tesla has accepted about 375,000 $1,000 deposits from hopeful buyers.Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, has said the company aims to produce 500,000 Model 3s by 2018 at its factory in Fremont, Calif.Many automakers would consider that a stretch, said Jessica Caldwell, a senior analyst at the auto researcher Edmunds.com. A typical auto plant makes 200,000 to 250,000 cars a year, she said.\u201cRaising money is going to help them try to reach that 500,000 number, but a lot of people have doubts,\u201d she said. \u201cIt seems like an unreachable goal.\u201dIt\u2019s also a huge leap from the 15,000 cars Tesla produced in the first three months of the year.Its models include the Model S sedan, which costs about $75,000, and the Model X, a seven-passenger sport utility vehicle priced at about $80,000. The Model 3 will be priced at around $35,000.While Tesla is often hailed for design and innovation, manufacturing has proved more of a challenge. The release of the Model X has been slowed by a recall, and the automaker recently lost two production executives.Of the stock Tesla plans to offer, about $1.4 billion will be new shares. The remaining amount will be sold by Mr. Musk to cover tax expenses stemming from 5.5 million stock options he has exercised.News of the offer hurt Tesla shares in after-hours trading, where they fell $2.52, to $208.65. Earlier in the day, the stock climbed as high as $215.31 after Goldman Sachs changed its recommendation on Tesla shares to buy from neutral.In a note to clients, an analyst for Goldman, Patrick Archambault, said Tesla\u2019s sales goals were \u201cambitious,\u201d but nevertheless he set a stock price target of $250 over the next six months.\u201cWe do not believe Tesla shares are fully capturing the company\u2019s disruptive potential,\u201d Mr. Archambault wrote.In the first quarter of this year, Tesla lost about $283 million on revenue of $1.15 billion. During the same period last year, it reported revenue of about $940 million and a loss of $154 million.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Get Away With Insider Trading", "Date": "2016-05-23", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorThe prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission deserve credit, but it\u2019s a mixed victory: Neither the United States attorney nor the S.E.C. is prosecuting other people who benefited from the stock tips, including Mr. Mickelson. Why not? A serious shortfall in our law has hampered prosecutors and allowed insider traders \u2014 particularly those further down the chain of information \u2014 to dance around the rules.Our insider trading law has become overly complex and burdensome for two reasons. First, neither Congress nor the S.E.C. has ever defined \u201cinsider trading\u201d in a comprehensive way. So our laws are largely made by judges who, bound by precedent, rarely update law to fit new circumstances.Second, our laws seek to balance different goals. The United States (unlike some other nations) does not adopt a simple \u201cparity of information\u201d approach under which one cannot trade on material facts that are not publicly available. United States law also values market efficiency: We want to encourage people to seek new information about companies through legitimate research. So the law basically prohibits trading on nonpublic information only when it has been wrongfully obtained or used.He next turned to journalists, but they would not report on his findings for fear of libel suits. When he told his clients, these investors reacted immediately by dumping their stock so that the company\u2019s share price plummeted. Finally, the press paid attention, and the fraud was revealed.Mr. Dirks was widely regarded as the hero of this story, a private-market equivalent of Woodward and Bernstein. But an embarrassed S.E.C. went after Mr. Dirks for insider trading. When the case reached the Supreme Court, it, too, saw Mr. Dirks as the hero and reshaped the law to give security analysts a protective safe harbor: The \u201ctippee\u201d who is given the inside information is liable only when the \u201ctipper receives a direct or indirect personal benefit from the disclosure\u201d \u2014 in effect, a bribe of some kind.The \u201cpersonal benefit\u201d rule makes ignorance bliss. The sophisticated trader will understand that he is insulated from liability so long as he does not learn that a personal benefit was paid or promised. \u201cDon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d may become the new industry code of behavior. The rule overlooks how the \u201cfavor bank\u201d can work in a cozy industry like finance.The Newman decision is making prosecutions harder. Since he became United States attorney for the Southern District of New York in 2009, Preet Bharara has won more than 80 insider trading convictions in just a few years, but in the wake of Newman, at least 14 of those convictions have been overturned, and that number is likely to rise.Although the S.E.C. has resisted defining insider trading for decades, legislation now seems the best answer. We should eliminate the need to prove a \u201cpersonal benefit\u201d to the tipper, but not overrule the rest of the Dirks case. Thus, a trader who knows (or recklessly disregards) that his information was wrongfully obtained should be liable regardless of the benefit to the tipper. But someone who trades on market gossip or an analyst\u2019s projection should not be liable.If a presidential candidate of either party wants to show that he or she has not been \u201ccaptured\u201d by Wall Street, the best signal would be support for insider trading legislation and a promise to prod Congress to enact it. If Washington can ever agree on anything, Washington can agree on that.John C. Coffee Jr. is a professor at Columbia Law School.Advertisement"}

Trump be good or bad for your stocks?The stock market is a nervous animal that can easily find a reason to sell off sharply, but so far it has taken the rise of Mr. Trump in stride.The relatively high valuation of the stock market \u2014 it\u2019s trading at 20 times historical earnings \u2014 indicates that investors don\u2019t see any big threats from his stated policies.\u201cHow much do you think he will get enacted?\u201d said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, who isn\u2019t showing signs of worry. \u201cPoliticians are great at telling you they are very important.\u201dSo why is Wall Street not more worried? And should ordinary investors be worried that Wall Street is not worried?Then there is a belief on Wall Street that a President Trump would end up being no more than a rougher-edged version of Mitt Romney when it comes to policy. In other words, Mr. Trump would dial down his combative policies \u2014 like blocking imports from China and Mexico \u2014 once those views got him the votes needed to win the presidency. The other way this theory works: Congress and the courts prevent him from pursuing goals that could create instability, like the mass deportation of illegal immigrants.Even if Mr. Trump ended up compromising on many of his antagonistic positions, the residual tension could cause harm. The global economy has been vulnerable to political and economic shocks emanating out of one region (Europe) or country (China). The stock market dropped more than 10 percent last year after China devalued its currency by a small amount, for instance.Wall Street\u2019s apparently laid-back reaction to Mr. Trump\u2019s rise is a twist on the notion that gridlock is good for stocks. Much money has been made over the years betting that politicians don\u2019t need to be feared because they can\u2019t do much \u2014 or won\u2019t. But Mr. Trump could test this consensus view. He didn\u2019t adopt confrontational trade policies all of a sudden; he has pushed them for many years.

{"Headline": "Workers Are Getting a Bit More of the Economic Pie (and Shareholders Less)", "Date": "2016-05-03", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsAmerican workers are reaping fewer of the gains of a growing economy in the form of pay and benefits. Shareholders are reaping more in the form of corporate profits. That shift has been one of the most important economic stories of the last several decades, and it is the key to understanding stagnant wages for middle-class workers and a soaring stock market in the last quarter-century.Here is what is less widely understood: That trend appears to be reversing itself.It is early and the reversal may not last. And it certainly hasn\u2019t fully undone the shift underway since the 1980s. But the numbers are quite clear that in the last couple of years workers have claimed a bigger piece of the economic pie and shareholders a smaller one.The evidence available so far in 2016 \u2014 steady growth in wages and weak earnings for publicly traded companies \u2014 suggests that the reversal is continuing this year.At the start of 2013, for example, 61 percent of national income went to pay and benefits for workers. But by the end of 2015, that had risen to 62.6 percent. (That said, in the early 1990s, that figure was around 66 percent.)If the proportion of national income going to workers in early 2013 had stayed constant, there would now be $251 billion a year less flowing into Americans\u2019 paychecks than is the case. That is about $1,900 a year per household.At the same time, corporate profits\u2019 share of national income has fallen, from 14.2 percent in the middle of 2014 to 12.1 percent by the end of 2015. That translates to $328 billion less in annual corporate profits than there would be if the earlier proportion had held.You can pick different numerators and denominators to get at the same concept \u2014 using just wages and salaries instead of total compensation, for example, or dividing by gross domestic product instead of the related concept of national income \u2014 but the same basic pattern reveals itself.A big part of the story is a steep decline in the profitability of the energy sector, reflecting a much lower price of oil and natural gas. Total corporate profits were $64 billion lower in 2015 than in 2014. A fall in the profitability of the petroleum and coal products sector accounted for $40 billion of that.There may be something broader going on that is holding back corporate profits beyond simply cheap oil. You might expect that the hit to profits in the energy sector caused by cheaper fuel would be counterbalanced by higher profits in sectors that use fuel, like airlines and trucking firms.That is where the other side of the equation \u2014 higher worker compensation \u2014 comes into play. Part of the reason corporate profits are falling appears to be that companies are having to pay their employees more.Hiring has been quite strong over three years, with millions of Americans getting jobs. That has pushed the unemployment rate steadily downward, to about 5 percent. Very gradually, a labor market that was very much tilted in favor of employers is tilting the other way.That means companies are having to work harder to attract good employees. They do that by paying higher wages and salaries (up 10 percent in 2015 compared with 2013) and more generous benefits package (up 6 percent over the two-year period).It is worth noting that this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that pay is rising by that much for the typical worker. After all, the pay for chief executives and other highly paid people counts in those compensation numbers.Still, paired with other evidence, it doesn\u2019t look as if this is solely a phenomenon of the highest-paid workers making more. For example, average hourly earnings for nonmanagerial private sector workers rose 2.56 percent in 2015 in a year of very low inflation. That number was only 1.69 percent in 2012, when inflation was higher.It is hard to say definitively what has driven these trends, but here\u2019s a try:The shift of national income toward shareholders and away from workers since the 1980s was driven in part by a decline in union power and a rise in shareholder-driven capitalism that made managers more ruthless than their predecessors in seeking to minimize salary expense. (That includes refusing to give raises and laying off employees.)That long-term trend, along with a cyclical downturn during the 2008 recession and its aftermath, left workers with very little bargaining power and shareholders with the upper hand.In the last two or three years, as the economy has firmed up, workers have regained some of that bargaining power they lost in the recession. But they have not, at this point at least, gained the power they lost over the last three decades.In the meantime, workers celebrate getting a little bit bigger piece of the economic pie, and shareholders bemoan their smaller piece.It would be better if the pie were bigger to begin with. If overall national income were rising rapidly (it decidedly isn\u2019t), there would be room for both workers and shareholders to be fat and happy. One of the great questions for the economic future is what it would take to make that happen.An earlier version of this article misstated the 2015 proportion of national income that went to pay and benefits for American workers. It was 62.6 percent, not 63.9 percentAdvertisement"}

So why don\u2019t you go ahead and answer just a few more questions from your Scary Markets Drill Sergeant:\u25a0 When the market clears up, will it be less scary than it is now?\u25a0 When the market clears up, will the economy be better?\u25a0 When the market clears up, will that guy on the financial pornography network be telling everyone and their mother to buy more stocks?\u25a0 When the market clears up, will all your neighbors and friends be sitting around the barbecue grill again chatting about investing?We all know the answers to those questions: yes, yes, yes and yes.But one last question. Drum roll please: If the market isn\u2019t scary, the economy is better, the guy on the financial pornography network is yelling \u201cbuy, buy, buy!\u201d and everyone you know is planning to invest, how do you think the market then will compare to the market now?It\u2019ll be much higher, of course!So, to review: Your plan is to sell your perfectly tailored portfolio, right now while your investments are down. Then, you\u2019re going to wait until the market improves. When it does, you\u2019re going to buy back Plan A at a much higher price.To which I say: Seriously?I hate to be annoying, but I really want to hammer this conversation home. It doesn\u2019t make a lick of sense to sell a portfolio tailored for you when the market is low, and then buy it back when the market is higher. It makes infinitely more sense to simply keep your portfolio through the scary times and tough it out. Right, soldier?Instead of doing what fear is making you want to do, just think back to your Scary Markets Drill Sergeant and remember these three things:\u25a0 You made your portfolio based on your goals.\u25a0 It still matches your goals.\u25a0 If you sell that portfolio now and buy it back later when the markets are better, all you will do is lose money.It\u2019s that simple. Just. Don\u2019t. Do it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Change Is in the Air for Pharmaceutical Mergers", "Date": "2016-05-10", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsThe pharmaceuticals merger mind-set may be changing. Allergan, the $87 billion maker of Botox, will devote capital to stock buybacks and paying down debt.Separately, Bill Ackman\u2019s hedge fund is selling a big part of his stake in Zoetis, the animal health company that he considered a takeover target. With luck, the two moves together signal a more subdued approach to deals.Allergan spent the last few years on an acquisition spree powered by borrowing. The decision to sell its generics business to Teva Pharmaceutical for $40.5 billion when drug stocks were peaking in July 2015, and a subsequent attempt to sell the rest of the business to Pfizer in November, indicated that Brent Saunders, the chief of Allergan, had a keen sense of how the merger and acquisition winds were blowing.With the Pfizer deal thwarted by Treasury officials last month, Allergan is reimagining itself without acquisitions as a primary strategy. There will be small deals, and Mr. Saunders isn\u2019t categorically ruling out larger ones. Even so, he says there is \u201cno greater investment than Allergan stock,\u201d suggesting a less merger-and-acquisitions-focused approach. Allergan plans to buy back up to $10 billion in shares, shrink its debt load and fund research and development.Mr. Ackman\u2019s reported $800 million sale of Zoetis shares also suggests a cooler deal market. After a bad run, led by his soured bet on another once-acquisitive pharmaceuticals company, Valeant, his Pershing Square could be in need of extra liquidity, or there may simply be better opportunities. The investment in 2014, however, was largely based on the idea that Zoetis would be bought.After Zoetis was spun off from Pfizer, Mr. Ackman\u2019s fund installed a board director and called the company a \u201cscarce asset,\u201d essentially hanging out a for-sale sign. Shrinking his fund\u2019s position implies that a sale may be less likely as buyers like Valeant head for the sidelines.Health care mergers and acquisitions have accelerated out of control. A record volume of deals were announced last year even after stripping out the $160 billion union of Pfizer and Allergan. Tax benefits overshadowed strategic sense. Valuations and premiums soared. Regulators then got worried. If the pace is indeed slowing, as Tuesday\u2019s news implies, it could be an encouraging sign of a renewed commitment to developing drugs instead of just overpaying for them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "State Officials Investigated Over Their Inquiry Into Exxon Mobil\u2019s Climate Change Research", "Date": "2016-05-19", "News": "Supported bySince last November, a growing number of state attorneys general have been pointing their fingers at Exxon Mobil, investigating whether the energy company\u2019s research about climate change conflicted directly with its public statements on the issue.But now the accusers are being accused, with a battle being waged over principles of free speech, government overreach and collaboration with activist organizations.The attorneys general, Mr. Smith said, are doing the bidding of environmental activists who set out to make pariahs of Exxon Mobil and its industry in pursuit of policies to limit climate change.Those activists and the attorneys general, Mr. Smith said in the letter, have secretly collaborated in the years since a two-day workshop in 2012 \u201cto act under the color of law to persuade attorneys general to use their prosecutorial powers to stifle scientific discourse, intimidate private entities and individuals, and deprive them of their First Amendment rights and freedoms.\u201dStatements made by Exxon Mobil \u2013 including executives and its own scientists \u2013 about climate change over the years.Over time, discussions of legal action involved the Rockefeller family philanthropies, the environmental campaigner Bill McKibben\u2019s 350.org, the Al Gore-founded Climate Reality Project, Greenpeace, and eventually, representatives of Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s office.The state officials have countered that there was nothing nefarious or even unusual about prosecutors consulting with outside experts, including scientists and their counterparts in other states, when gathering facts for an investigation.Eric Soufer, a spokesman for Mr. Schneiderman, said, \u201cIt is remarkable that a do-nothing Congress that has refused to take any action on climate change is now attempting to disrupt this important investigation into potential corporate malfeasance.\u201d The office did not take part in the 2012 meeting, he said. He added, \u201cspeaking with outside experts is a routine part of the investigative process, and we make decisions based on the merits, period.\u201d\u201cThe irony of this letter is breathtaking,\u201d Mr. Soufer said. \u201cIts signatories appear to be part of a multipronged media campaign funded by the fossil fuel industry aimed at suppressing the free exchange of ideas among scientists, academics and responsible law enforcement.\u201dHe added, \u201cAnyone who thinks that Attorney General Schneiderman will be intimidated by this effort has no idea who they\u2019re dealing with.\u201dBut Mr. Schneiderman has said, \u201cThe First Amendment, ladies and gentlemen, doesn\u2019t give you the right to commit fraud.\u201dThe company also said that it \u201crecognizes the risks posed by climate change,\u201d and the accusations are based on the \u201cpreposterous\u201d claim that the company \u201creached definitive conclusions about anthropogenic climate change before the world\u2019s experts\u201d and withheld it.The company shared its findings in peer-reviewed publications, it said.Mr. Walker has gone beyond New York\u2019s efforts by including subpoenas to private organizations like the free-market oriented Competitive Enterprise Institute, looking for evidence that the company funded such groups to spread its message to oppose regulation and sow doubt about climate science.Noting that the company has no \u201cphysical presence\u201d in the Virgin Islands, Exxon Mobil called Mr. Walker\u2019s actions a \u201cflagrant misuse of law enforcement power.\u201dThe new letter from Mr. Smith, which he also sent to 16 other attorneys general, comes as Exxon Mobil\u2019s allies have intensified their own attack on the attorneys general.Mr. Walker did not respond to a request for comment, but his lawyers have sent a letter to a lawyer for the Competitive Enterprise Institute noting that the investigation \u201cis not targeting C.E.I.,\u201d but is simply seeking production of documents related to the investigation of Exxon.The groups cited by Mr. Smith also received copies of the letter, demanding that they turn over documents related to their efforts.The Rockefellers, whose patriarch John Rockefeller built the family fortune with the company that is now as Exxon Mobil, have been increasingly critical of the company and its industry.Another group that received the Smith letter is Greenpeace USA. Annie Leonard, its executive director, said \u201cAmerica\u2019s least respected politicians have now courageously stepped up to defend one of America\u2019s most hated corporations from scrutiny.\u201dThe 13 signers of the Smith letter, she noted, \u201chave been paid millions in campaign contributions from coal, oil and gas companies, so this letter is more proof that the system works \u2014 for corporations.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is This the West\u2019s Weimar Moment?", "Date": "2016-05-31", "News": "Supported bySetting aside debate about whether the rise of Nazism was built into the German DNA, there were four trends that led the country to reject its post-World War I constitutional, parliamentary democracy, known as the Weimar Republic: economic depression, loss of trust in institutions, social humiliation and political blunder. To a certain degree, these trends can be found across the West today.First, the history. The Black Friday stock-market collapse of 1929 set off a global depression. As bad as things were in America, they were even worse in Germany, where industrial production shrank by half in the following three years. Stocks lost two-thirds of their value. Deflation and unemployment rocked the country. The Weimar government, already held in low esteem by many Germans, seemed to have no clue about what to do.All this happened as traditional ways of life and values were being shaken by the modernization of the 1920s. Women suddenly went to work, to vote, to party and to sleep with whomever they wanted. This produced a widening cultural gap between the tradition-oriented working and middle classes and the cosmopolitan avant-garde \u2014 in politics, business and the arts \u2014 that reached a peak just when economic disaster struck. The elites were blamed for the resulting chaos, and the masses were ripe for a strongman to return order to society.Some people today imagine that Hitler sneaked up on Germany, that too few people understood the threat. In fact, many mainstream politicians recognized the danger but they failed to stop him. Some didn\u2019t want to: The conservative parties and the nobility believed the little hothead could serve as their useful idiot, that as chancellor he would be contained by a squad of reasonable ministers. Franz von Papen, a nobleman who was Hitler\u2019s first vice chancellor, said of the new leader, \u201cWe\u2019ve hired him.\u201dAt the same time, even the imminent threat of a fascist dictatorship couldn\u2019t persuade the left-wing parties to join forces. Instead of being conciliatory for the sake of the national interest, Ernst Th\u00e4lmann, the head of the German Communist Party, branded the center-left Social Democrats the \u201cmoderate wing of fascism.\u201d No wonder Hitler had an easy time uniting broad sections of the German public.Are we at another Weimar moment now?The 2008 financial crisis and the subsequent global recession were nowhere nearly as painful as the Great Depression. But the effects are similar. The heady growth of the 2000s led Europeans and Americans to believe they were on firm economic ground; the shattering of banks, real estate markets and governments in the wake of the crash left tens of millions of people at sea, angry at the institutions that had failed them, above all the politicians who claimed to be in charge.Why, voters ask, did the government allow so many bankers to behave like criminals in the first place? Why did it then bail out banks while letting car factories go under? Why is it welcoming millions of immigrants? Are there separate rules for the elites, defined by a hypermodern liberal worldview that ridicules the working class \u2014 and their traditional values \u2014 as yokels?In America and Europe, the rise of anti-establishment movements is a symptom of a cultural shock against globalized postmodernity, similar to the 1930s\u2019 rejection of modernity. The common accusation by the \u201cmasses\u201d is that liberal democracy has somehow gone too far, that it has become an ideology for an elite at the expense of everyone else. Marine Le Pen, chief of the French National Front, calls these normal folk \u201cles invisibles et les oubli\u00e9s,\u201d the invisible and the forgotten.Of course this isn\u2019t 1933. Democratic institutions are much more stable today. But the power of nostalgia doesn\u2019t depend on the times you live in. This is why, for all the differences, we are indeed witnessing another 1930s moment across the West.It\u2019s easy to say that people need to accept the new realities and work toward feasible reforms \u2014 however true that is. And yet most mainstream parties haven\u2019t done even this, at least not in a compelling way. Instead, they fight among themselves, and see the rise of demagogues as a solution to their problems, not a threat to their nations. Mr. Trump is no Hitler, but that\u2019s not the point. Today, as in the 1930s, we are seeing the failure of the liberal mainstream to respond to serious challenges, even those that threaten its very existence.An Op-Ed article on May 31, about the far right in Europe, misstated an element of Germany\u2019s economic collapse during the Great Depression. It was deflation, not inflationJochen Bittner is a political editor for the weekly newspaper Die Zeit and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Warren Buffett Stake Suggests Apple Is All Grown Up", "Date": "2016-05-19", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseWith this week\u2019s imprimatur from the legendary investor Warren Buffett, it should now be official: Apple, the world\u2019s largest company by market capitalization and a symbol of American technological innovation, is a \u201cvalue\u201d stock.That may prove to be a decidedly mixed blessing.Mr. Buffett is the world\u2019s most prominent and successful proponent of value investing \u2014 an approach that seeks stocks that are undervalued and sell for less than their \u201cintrinsic value,\u201d as Benjamin Graham put it his 1949 classic \u201cThe Intelligent Investor.\u201d Mr. Buffett credits Mr. Graham with shaping his own approach to investing.\u201cWe\u2019ve just looked at it again,\u201d said Bill Smead, who manages the Smead Value Fund, one of the most successful large-cap value mutual funds over the last five years, according to Morningstar. \u201cAnybody that discounts the thinking at Berkshire Hathaway does so at their peril, in my opinion.\u201dValue stocks are typically unpopular among many investors, their shares often battered by disappointing short-term revenue and earnings results. They usually trade at very low price-to-earnings ratios, a common valuation measure. Nonetheless, some academic studies have suggested that over time, they outperform other stocks, in part because expectations are so low.Apple \u201cis going to attract more value investors,\u201d said Toni Sacconaghi, a senior analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein who covers Apple. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for beaten-down stocks with negative sentiment. Apple has traded below a market multiple for years and sentiment has become increasingly pessimistic, especially over the past month.\u201dMr. Sacconaghi has a buy recommendation on the stock, \u201cnot because we believe this will be a high-growth company going forward, but because the current price is discounting a decline in cash flow forever, and we think that\u2019s overly pessimistic.\u201dAccording to the market research firm Thomson Reuters Lipper, just 69 of 357 actively managed value funds in the United States \u2014 fewer than 20 percent \u2014 currently hold positions in Apple.That\u2019s because Apple has long been considered a quintessential growth stock: one of the glamorous high-flying cousins to dowdy value stocks. Growth investors think growth stocks are undervalued, too, because they expect their earnings to grow faster (often much faster) than other investors recognize.As a result, valuation measures for growth stocks can go sky-high. In two prominent growth-stock examples, shares of Facebook trade at a price-earnings ratio of about 73, and Netflix at about 312. (The price-earnings average for stocks in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is currently about 24.)This week Apple\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio was just over 10.If Apple is now a value stock, though, plenty of growth investors haven\u2019t gotten the message. Among actively managed growth funds, 249 of 619, or 40 percent, hold Apple shares, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper. That\u2019s more than the 230 growth funds that owned Apple stock in 2014.Should growth funds suddenly decide that Apple no longer meets their criteria, there could be a mass exodus that would be only partly offset by new purchases from value investors.Some prominent value investors aren\u2019t convinced Apple really is a value stock, despite Mr. Buffett\u2019s blessing, or that its stock price is significantly below its intrinsic value. (Intrinsic value considers all aspects of a business, including both tangible and intangible factors.)That means Apple could fall into the neutral zone of stocks that are neither growth \u2014 because they aren\u2019t growing fast enough \u2014 or value, because they\u2019re still not cheap enough.\u201cApple is extraordinarily cheap, but it\u2019s never been a value stock in the traditional sense,\u201d said Bruce Greenwald, who runs the value investing program at Columbia Business School and is a co-author of \u201cValue Investing: From Graham to Buffett and Beyond\u201d (Wiley, 2001).\u201cValue investing has always focused primarily on asset value,\u201d Professor Greenwald told me. Apple\u2019s book value, or asset value, of $130 billion isn\u2019t even close to its market capitalization of about $515 billion.That means, in theory, that other companies could replicate Apple\u2019s assets at relatively low cost, produce rival products and undermine Apple\u2019s enviably high profit margins.Tech companies typically have low asset values relative to their share prices \u2014 one reason Mr. Buffett and other value investors long shunned the sector \u2014 but their patented technologies and intellectual property nonetheless often create formidable barriers to entry by competitors.For an extraordinarily high-profit-margin technology company like Apple, the question is whether there are such \u201cmoats,\u201d as value investors like to put it, that will continue to protect it from these competitive threats.\u201cThat\u2019s always been the issue with Apple,\u201d Professor Greenwald said. \u201cHow sustainable are these profit levels and how big are the barriers? The fear with Apple is that it will get overwhelmed by new entry and new competitors. The moat doesn\u2019t seem that big. It\u2019s not just giant rivals like Samsung, but smaller companies that can survive with even a small share of the smartphone market.\u201dMr. Smead told me this week he had not added Apple to his value fund\u2019s holdings, even though the stock is so cheap that it meets many of his fund\u2019s investing criteria.\u201cOver the past five or six years, when Apple was doing so well, we joked that we were the best-performing large-cap fund that didn\u2019t own Apple,\u201d Mr. Smead said. \u201cNot that we didn\u2019t wrestle with it many times.\u201d\u201cOur difficulty has been that we don\u2019t understand what kind of moat protects their technology over the next 10 years,\u201d Mr. Smead continued. \u201cThat\u2019s the main problem. The other is that, given Apple\u2019s huge success and its sheer magnitude, it needs a monstrous new product or enhancement of an existing product to move the needle on growth.\u201dFor their part, many growth investors were startled on April 26 when Apple reported its first quarterly revenue drop since 2003. Both revenue and earnings fell short of analyst estimates, and Apple shares plunged 8 percent in one day. They rallied some this week on news of the Berkshire Hathaway investment, but are still down sharply from where they were as recently as mid-April.But Apple still has defenders among growth investors.At the end of the year, Apple was the second-largest holding in the Upright Growth Fund, the top-performing large-cap growth fund so far this year, according to Morningstar.\u201cApple\u2019s best and fastest growing days may be behind us,\u201d David Chiueh, Upright Growth\u2019s president and fund manager, told me. \u201cBut even growth-oriented funds like ours don\u2019t just contain high-growth stocks with 35-50 percent growth rates in our portfolio.\u201dHe said such rapid growth was not sustainable, and added that he was happy with companies that showed \u201csolid 8 percent to 12 percent earnings growth,\u201d a category in which he included Apple. \u201dGive them some time and they will show outstanding performance,\u201d he said.Mr. Chiueh said he was also encouraged that Apple had stepped up its spending on research and development, suggesting that new products with strong growth prospects might still be in the offing.At some fund families, Apple seems to be both a value and a growth stock, even though that seems contradictory. At the fund giant Vanguard, Apple is a major holding in the Vanguard Windsor and Windsor II funds (both value funds) and the Vanguard Morgan Growth Fund and US Growth Fund. A Vanguard spokeswoman declined to comment.All of which suggests that when it comes to Apple, \u201cvalue\u201d and \u201cgrowth\u201d may be in the eye of the beholder.Still, Mr. Buffett\u2019s announcement this week underscores that Apple\u2019s once sizzling growth has slowed, and suggests it may well be on the inexorable path from growth to value stock.That\u2019s not an especially good portent for investors. Among technology companies that have already made the same transition, Professor Greenwald cited IBM, Intel, Cisco, Microsoft and Dell, companies whose share prices, after great rocket rides, have mostly languished in recent years. (Dell was taken private in 2013.)For those who failed to buy the stock early enough, \u201cas investments, they all turned out pretty badly,\u201d he noted.Berkshire Hathaway also disclosed this week that it had increased the stake in IBM it first acquired in 2011. IBM shares have declined over the period, but by Mr. Buffett\u2019s long-term standards, the investment is still too new to judge.\u201cIf you believe the iPhone will be the global standard in 25 years, you\u2019d buy\u201d Apple stock, Professor Greenwald said. But many value investors have already seen where smartphones can go, \u201cwhich is where PCs have already gone.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Big Insurers Send a Wake-Up Call to Hedge Fund Investors", "Date": "2016-05-12", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseLike many sophisticated investors, the nation\u2019s largest insurers drank the hedge fund Kool-Aid, pouring billions into the high-fee investment funds and helping drive hedge fund assets to over $3 trillion.Now comes the hangover.Steep losses in hedge fund investments during the last quarter damaged many insurance company earnings, reinforcing decisions to rethink the premises that led them to follow the Pied Pipers of finance in the first place.The American International Group said it would cut its hedge fund exposure in half, to $5.5 billion by the end of 2017 from $11 billion at the end of last year. MetLife said it would slash its hedge fund portfolio by two-thirds, to $600 million from $1.8 billion.The pain from the last quarter has shown up most visibly in recent insurers\u2019 results, but it is also spreading to pension funds, endowments and other giant investment funds. Last month, New York City\u2019s largest pension fund said it was abandoning hedge funds entirely, and the Illinois State Board of Investment voted to reduce its hedge fund portfolio by $1 billion.\u201cThey\u2019re finally getting the mediocre results they deserve,\u201d said Simon Lack, an early skeptic about hedge funds and author of \u201dThe Hedge Fund Mirage: The Illusion of Big Money and Why It\u2019s Too Good to Be True.\u201d\u201cI imagine you\u2019ll see more and more institutional investors re-examining their commitment to hedge funds,\u201d Mr. Lack added, \u201cas they see what they\u2019re getting for those outrageously high fees they pay.\u201dListen to the chorus of recent hedge fund criticism. Warren E. Buffett blasted their high fees and mediocre performance at his recent investors\u2019 conference in Omaha. The activist investor and hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb called their recent performance \u201ccatastrophic\u201d in his latest letter to investors.Even the legendary hedge fund manager Steven A. Cohen, whose fund averaged 30 percent annual returns before Mr. Cohen\u2019s close brush with insider trading charges, complained this month: \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to maximize returns and maximize assets.\u201dApart from industry experts, most people probably didn\u2019t realize that insurance companies, which belong to one of the most heavily regulated industries in the country, were big investors in hedge funds, one of the most lightly regulated of all investment vehicles. Then again, before the financial crisis, hardly anyone realized A.I.G. was exposed to trillions of dollars in derivatives tied to mortgage-backed securities until catastrophe struck and the company had to be bailed out by taxpayers for more than $180 billion.Luckily, there\u2019s little danger of that now with hedge funds, because they make up only a small fraction of insurers\u2019 vast investment portfolios. Even at A.I.G., the $11 billion hedge fund portfolio represented just 3 percent of its approximately $340 billion in total investments. At MetLife, hedge funds account for less than one half of a percent.Still, losses from even these small percentages can have a big impact on earnings. A.I.G. reported pretax hedge fund losses of $537 million for the first quarter, which wiped out operating profit and led to an overall loss of $183 million. MetLife reported a 19 percent drop in operating earnings for the quarter, in part because of what Steven J. Goulart, its chief investment officer, said were \u201cnegative\u201d results from hedge funds.Insurers strive to match their liabilities to their assets, which generally means low-volatility United States Treasuries, along with other bonds and fixed income positions. But they are allowed to invest their excess capital any way they see fit.To be sure, those investments are subject to stiffer capital requirements: generally 30 percent in the case of stocks and equity-like investments, which include hedge funds and other so-called alternative investments.Hedge funds promised to provide high equitylike returns, with less volatility, that were uncorrelated with the ups and downs of the stock market \u2014 in other words, a variation on the age-old siren song of higher returns with lower risk.Hardly any of that turned out to be true, at least for insurance companies.What went wrong? Pretty much every everything, based on conversations I had this week with chief investment officers at several insurance companies. \u201cTheir marketing skill proved to be much better than their investing ability,\u201d Mr. Lack said of hedge fund managers.For starters, hedge funds didn\u2019t deliver equitylike returns. Hedge funds have trailed the benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index every year since 2009, often by significant amounts. Even ordinary investors can earn very close to that simply by buying a low-fee index fund.To some extent, that was to be expected in a strong bull market. But the volatile market of the last year was exactly the environment in which so-called long-short hedge funds were supposed to thrive. They didn\u2019t.A major culprit, everyone I spoke to agreed, was the sheer size of assets managed by hedge funds.\u201cWe thought a lot about what\u2019s wrong with the hedge fund space,\u201d said Mr. Goulart, who also serves as an executive vice president at MetLife. \u201cOne problem is that there are just too many funds, roughly 10,000 with almost $3 trillion invested. There\u2019s too much money chasing a limited number of attractive trades.\u201dMany hedge funds found themselves crowded into positions in the same handful of stocks \u2014 such as the controversial drug maker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International \u2014 and found they couldn\u2019t exit positions without causing further big losses even while being hit with investor redemptions.\u201cThe last quarter showed there were a lot of guys in the same trades,\u201d said Douglas Dachille, A.I.G.\u2019s chief investment officer. \u201cThey all looked good until the trade turned against them. Then the exit door turned out to be very small. The result was a lot of bad performance.\u201dMr. Cohen, speaking at the Milken Institute in Santa Monica, Calif., made a similar point: \u201cOne of my biggest worries is that there are so many players out there trying to do similar strategies.\u201d Noting that his fund lost 8 percent in February, he added, \u201cMy worst fears were realized.\u201dHedge funds\u2019 lack of transparency was another problem. Investment officers had trouble matching investment assets to their existing balance sheets when they didn\u2019t know what was in a hedge fund\u2019s portfolio.This was especially true for so-called activist hedge funds, which take large equity positions, hoping to shake up management or otherwise influence corporate strategy. A.I.G., for example, discovered it was invested in hedge funds that were making opposite bets on the same company.And with so many managers \u2014 at its peak, A.I.G. had more than 100 hedge funds \u2014 due diligence was time-consuming and distracting. Mr. Dachille said it took months to review A.I.G.\u2019s positions after he arrived last year.\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder A.I.G. experienced weak performance,\u201d Mr. Lack said. \u201cWith that many funds, you get the average, and the average is mediocre. If you aren\u2019t highly skilled in picking hedge funds, there\u2019s no point in being there.\u201dGiven their weak performance, hedge funds\u2019 high fees \u2014 the so-called two-and-20 formula that characterizes the industry (2 percent of assets under management and 20 percent of any gain) \u2014 were increasingly hard to swallow. \u201cI have no trouble paying great people,\u201d Mr. Dachille said. \u201cBut I get upset when I pay mediocre people great compensation.\u201dHedge funds aren\u2019t about to disappear. A few hedge fund managers continue to post sterling returns, and both A.I.G. and MetLife said they planned to retain some hedge funds that fit their investment strategies and met performance targets.But the hedge fund fever that gripped the investment world for the last decade \u2014 minting scores of billionaires \u2014 may have broken.Over all, hedge fund assets dropped by $14.4 billion during the first quarter of this year after a $26.8 billion decline in the last quarter of 2015.\u201cThere is no doubt,\u201d Mr. Loeb wrote in his letter to investors, \u201cthat we are in the first innings of a washout in hedge funds.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "China Lending Inflates Real Estate, Stocks, Even Egg Futures", "Date": "2016-05-01", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 China is pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into its economy in a new effort to support growth. Some of it is going into roads and bridges and other big projects that will keep the economy humming.And some of it is going into eggs.Egg futures have surged by as much as one-third since March, the sort of move that would be justified if investors believed China\u2019s chicken flocks were headed for an unfortunate fate.But the market\u2019s usual participants say the flocks are fine. In fact, the actual price of eggs in the country\u2019s markets has fallen from a year ago, according to government statistics.\u201cMany commodities prices have gone up crazily,\u201d said Du Shaoxing, a futures trader in Guangzhou, in southern China. \u201cWe surely hope for a more stabilized trend where futures can reflect economic fundamentals. The way in which recent commodity prices went up is worrisome.\u201dChina\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.China is the world\u2019s biggest producer of eggs, but it is not clear whether the investment surge in eggs will have an impact on real-world prices. Jumps in the futures prices on commodities markets can take months to trickle down to the real world, and if the commodities surge subsides, then the price of eggs in local markets may not budge.By mid-April, the frenzy made Shanghai futures contracts in steel rebar, the rods used in construction to reinforce concrete, the most actively traded in the world \u2014 overtaking trading volumes of two major oil futures contracts, West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude, that have helped set oil prices for decades, analysts at Citigroup said in a report last week.\u201cThere is very little rational or fundamental basis for why prices have gotten as out of hand as they have, or why volumes are so high, other than just irrational exuberance,\u201d said Alex Wolf, an emerging markets economist at Standard Life Investments in Edinburgh, who previously worked as an American diplomat based in Beijing and Taipei.Economists blame Beijing\u2019s new efforts to shore up its economy. Government officials increased lending by state-controlled banks and offered other support measures in the first few months of the year as economic growth slowed and longtime drivers like manufacturing and exports showed continued weakness.Saad Rahim, the chief economist at Trafigura, one of the world\u2019s biggest traders of metals and oil, calculates that China added about $1 trillion in new liquidity in the first quarter of the year \u2014 an amount that would be roughly equal to the entire quarterly economic output of Germany during the same period.\u201cThis kind of scale is unprecedented and some of it will leak into speculative investments,\u201d Mr. Rahim said.But in turning to its old playbook, China risks adding to its already fast-growing pile of debt, which by some estimates is nearly 300 percent of gross domestic product.But the renewed push for credit-fueled growth shows that policy makers\u2019 concerns about China\u2019s debt burden appear to have been set aside for now. By delaying efforts to wean itself off cheap credit, China may be setting itself up for some problems related to debt and industrial overcapacity.A property market bubble arose from the huge stimulus that Beijing deployed after the 2008 financial crisis, which set off a building boom.Stocks overtook property in investor interest last year. A raging bull market that was cheered on by official news outlets like People\u2019s Daily, the Communist Party\u2019s newspaper, skidded to a halt in June.Her company supplies eggs to KFC and McDonald\u2019s restaurants, and sells them at more than 10,000 supermarkets across China, including those of chains like Walmart, Carrefour and Metro.Hubei Shendan uses the futures market to hedge its bets against swings in actual egg prices. An abnormally volatile futures market makes that job more difficult.\u201cThe reason we are in the egg futures market is because the big swings in egg prices will affect our profitability, and a good futures market will help us in that regard,\u201d Ms. Chen said.Owen Guo in Beijing contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Panama Papers May Inspire More Big Leaks, if Not Reform", "Date": "2016-05-29", "News": "Supported byThe disclosure by an anonymous leaker of 11.5 million documents from a Panamanian law firm at the center of the offshore industry to a German newspaper was a landmark in another way as well. It was the latest and biggest in a series of recent megaleaks, establishing the large-scale, unauthorized disclosure of government and corporate secrets as a contagious phenomenon that is unlikely to go away.Since 2010, when a low-ranking intelligence analyst in Iraq copied thousands of classified files onto CDs labeled as Lady Gaga songs and gave them to the antisecrecy organization WikiLeaks, it has become clear that technology has revolutionized leaking. Pfc. Chelsea Manning, then known as Bradley, disclosed hundreds of thousands of diplomatic cables and military field reports. In 2013, Edward J. Snowden, citing Private Manning as an inspiration, gave a similar number of highly classified National Security Agency documents to a few journalists.Trevor Timm, the executive director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which supports what it calls transparency journalism, said the impact of each leak had inspired the next leaker.\u201cEspecially with the Panama Papers, I think it\u2019s now a trend,\u201d Mr. Timm said. \u201cWhen people inside organizations see the impact that whistle-blowing on this scale can have, they follow that example.\u201dNone of this would have been conceivable in the photocopier era, when the Panama Papers would have required a fleet of tractor-trailers to deliver. \u201cThese are disclosures not of documents but of databases \u2014 entire libraries,\u201d said Steven Aftergood, who tracks government secrecy for the Federation of American Scientists. John Doe\u2019s manifesto was tellingly titled \u201cThe Revolution Will Be Digitized.\u201dFor Mr. Obermayer and a colleague at S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, Frederik Obermaier, the fact that anonymous companies created by Mossack Fonseca were being used to evade taxes and launder illicit money justified publication. They shared the Panama Papers with the international journalists\u2019 group to bring strength and local expertise to the data.When the articles were published, their newspaper\u2019s web servers crashed from the initial volume of readers. Mr. Obermayer said it was \u201ca really strange feeling \u2014 that something that started with you has led to mass demonstrations in several countries.\u201dIn fact, some experts believe the \u201cPanama\u201d label is misleading, obscuring the central role of several states, including Delaware, Wyoming and Nevada, in registering companies with hidden ownership. Mossack Fonseca probably represents just 5 or 10 percent of the industry creating anonymous companies, Mr. Zucman of Berkeley said, so the disclosures have left the vast majority hidden.And no matter where shell companies may be registered, he said, much of the wealth they own is invested in the United States, in real estate, stocks and bonds. \u201cThe U.S. could find out who the true owners are,\u201d Mr. Zucman said.But the United States may illustrate the difficulty of moving from splashy revelations to serious change. States with a stake in the lucrative corporate registration business are likely to resist serious changes, and Congress appears unlikely to act anytime soon on comprehensive reform bills.\u201cThe offshore system is incredibly resilient, with a ton of smart lawyers and accountants to find new ways to hide money,\u201d said Marina Walker Guevara, the deputy director of the international journalists\u2019 consortium.Mr. Marchant said he believed the reform push from the leak would fade. \u201cThe people using the offshore system to evade their financial responsibilities tend to be very wealthy and influential people,\u201d he said. He predicted that any changes in laws and regulations after the disclosures would be \u201cmostly window dressing.\u201dOn the other hand, Mr. Marchant said, the example of John Doe will probably be followed by other leakers. \u201cThis is the age we live in,\u201d he said. \u201cThis record will be broken before long.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Lending Club, a Story Stock That Skimped on the Details", "Date": "2016-05-13", "News": "Supported byFair GameThe recent tribulations of Lending Club, a former highflying \u201cpeer to peer\u201d lender, provide an object lesson for both companies and their investors: When it comes to financial disclosures, less is definitely not more.Celebrated as a Silicon Valley disrupter set to transform the financial industry, Lending Club first issued public shares at $15 in December 2014. Like other wildly popular disrupters (Theranos, the blood-testing company that is now under siege, comes to mind), Lending Club had a star-studded board and a concept that made investors swoon.Its shares peaked at almost $28 in late 2014, giving Lending Club a $10 billion market value. Not bad for a company that generated a $33 million loss on $211 million in net revenue that year.Lending Club was the quintessential story stock. Disrupting finance, though, turned out to be harder than promised.Six months after its public offering the company\u2019s shares had fallen below the deal price. And in recent months, as doubts about the peer-to-peer lending industry emerged, Lending Club\u2019s shares continued to decline.The company cited two reasons for Mr. Laplanche\u2019s exit. First, Lending Club had improperly sold $22 million of loans to an institutional investor that did not meet the investor\u2019s standards. In addition, Mr. Laplanche had not disclosed to company directors his stake in a fund in which Lending Club was weighing an investment.Compared with some of the corporate shenanigans we\u2019ve seen lately, these disclosure failings look relatively minor. So why have Lending Club\u2019s shares taken such a beating?Here\u2019s a hypothesis: Investors don\u2019t have enough information about the company\u2019s operations to keep them confident about its prospects. When shareholders have to rely more on a company\u2019s promise than on the reality of its operations, they often flee at the first sign of trouble.In contrast with traditional financial companies, Lending Club\u2019s disclosures are thin. And the company\u2019s practices in the area were the subject of a whistle-blower submission to the Securities and Exchange Commission last July. The submission, which I reviewed, contended that the company does not disclose crucial operational measures that investors need to evaluate its business.Lacking, for example, is detailed data on Lending Club\u2019s credit decisions and scoring models, its investors\u2019 returns and loan performance. Nor does the company provide specifics showing investor satisfaction with its platform.I asked Lending Club about these areas of its financial disclosures. Taylor Hamilton, a spokesman, pointed me to additional information on the company\u2019s website. But this data was only modestly enlightening.How does Lending Club assess risks among its borrowers? In its most recent annual filing, the company said that in addition to common tools like borrowers\u2019 credit scores, it uses \u201cproprietary algorithms that leverage behavioral data, transactional data and employment information.\u201d The company contends that its \u201cstrong record of loan performance\u201d is evident in its loan origination growth.Nevertheless, Lending Club provides scant details on borrower performance by type, product or vintage (the year in which a loan was made). Other financial institutions provide this kind of data routinely.In its filings, the company does show two tables of charge-off rates on its loans, reflecting borrower defaults. One table spans three years, the other, five. Good luck figuring them out.Since the company is a peer-to-peer lender, the performance on smaller loan purchases would be a more helpful measure.Lending Club filings also state that \u201chigh reinvestment rates\u201d prove that its investor-lenders have confidence in its marketplace. But the company has not disclosed actual reinvestment rates in its regulatory filings.Scott Sanborn, the company\u2019s president, recently told investors in a conference call that its reinvestment rate hit 85 percent \u201cover the past two quarters.\u201dIf the company published these figures regularly, shareholders could watch for investor churn, a risk to its business that Lending Club has acknowledged. It must \u201cmaintain relationships with existing borrowers and investors,\u201d it says in filings.But in its most recent annual report, issued in February, Lending Club noted that \u201ca relatively small number of investors account for a large dollar amount of investment in loans funded through our marketplace.\u201dIf most of Lending Club\u2019s loans come from a handful of investors, such as brokerage firms, hedge funds or pension plans, that\u2019s not so revolutionary a business model. That looks a lot like a bank. More troubling, if one or two of these investors pulled back from Lending Club, the company\u2019s funding capacity could drop significantly.On Tuesday, the company told regulators that its quarterly financial filing, due that day, would be delayed until Monday. That filing, Lending Club said, \u201cwill reflect significant changes in the company\u2019s results of operations for the first quarter of 2016 as compared to those of the first quarter of 2015.\u201dFull and detailed data about a public company\u2019s operations is crucial if investors are to remain confident about its prospects. While it\u2019s not unusual for companies to want to limit their disclosures, Lending Club no longer has that luxury. If it wants to regain its shareholders\u2019 trust, being more forthcoming is a good way to start.The investor lesson here is also clear: Don\u2019t let enthusiasm for a purportedly innovative business model replace hard-nosed analysis of a company\u2019s operations. And if the data to do that analysis isn\u2019t there, move on.Twitter:@gmorgensonAdvertisement"}

Eaglevale Partners, the Manhattan hedge fund firm that Mr. Mezvinsky founded with two former colleagues at Goldman Sachs, had raised money for the Hellenic fund about two years ago when some on Wall Street had hopes for a revival. But betting on Greece has proved to be tricky and it has been a rough 17 months for hedge funds. It is unclear why Eaglevale waited until this year to close the Hellenic fund, which had already lost about 40 percent of its value by early last year. Greece edged near economic collapse and the situation remains tenuous with the country still arguing with other eurozone nations and its creditors over how to reduce its debt burden. Sam Gilford, a consumer bureau spokesman, confirmed that staff members and the consumer advisory board had discussed seller financing, specifically an arrangement called a contract for deed or a land contract which is a long-term, high-interest installment financing deal. The buyer only becomes the owner after the last payment is made and the contracts can last for as long as 40 years.These contracts have proliferated as banks have retrenched from lending to low-income families and private investment firms like hedge funds have stepped in to fill the void. The foreclosure crisis created a bountiful supply of cheap, often dilapidated homes for investors to buy and left millions of people with damaged credit histories.  Now many of the homes that have been foreclosed are being sold under contracts for deeds. Homes sold through a contract for deed often require buyers to spend a significant portion of their disposable incomes on repairs and renovations. When they do not or cannot, this leads to problems.  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bubble Indemnity", "Date": "2016-05-10", "News": "Supported byOn MoneyIt was a striking admission. This \u201clargely worthless\u201d start-up scene, according to the research firm CB Insights, has raised an estimated $238 billion over the last five years \u2014 a remarkable bull run in private technology stocks. Forbes reports that there are now close to 200 \u201cunicorns,\u201d to use the Valley term of art for private companies worth more than a billion dollars on paper. Since the financial crisis, these companies, along with their more established public predecessors, have been seen by many Americans as the last redoubt of confidence and productivity in an otherwise uneven recovery. V.C.s have spent years dismissing speculation about a private-equity bubble as merely an expression, by know-nothing spectators, of resentment and alarmism; media onlookers, they argue, should talk instead about the triumphal progress of the genuinely great start-ups as they try to solve our most difficult problems. Over the past year, however, as allegations of mismanagement and unsustainability have grown \u2014 Square went public for approximately half its last private valuation; Fidelity and other large mutual funds wrote down their positions in Dropbox, MongoDB, and Snapchat; and both Zenefits and Theranos were accused of deceptive practices \u2014 that confidence has come to look more like hubris.This past January, after a long autumn of minor misfortune left the market in a stall, I spent a week loitering in the command concourse of American V.C., Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, Calif., where the soft, spruce-filtered sunlight falls through plate glass into quiet offices of beige on beige. There was some selection bias at work, as all my introductions were brokered by a smart and thoughtful friend, but not a single investor I talked to fit the description of the supercilious techno-optimist \u2014 and most, in private, didn\u2019t hesitate to concede Palihapitiya\u2019s point. Of course they believed private valuations had become preposterous; of course the run in private tech stocks couldn\u2019t possibly last; and of course, many start-ups, especially those of the \u201cUber for garden-gnome rearrangement\u201d variety, are in fact largely worthless.Where they differed from the naysayers, however, was in their rating of the \u00adcauses\u00ad and consequences; the fault, they said, didn\u2019t belong to the technological elite but to everybody else: What has driven inflated valuations, in a time of extremely low interest rates and meager returns elsewhere, is \u201cdumb money,\u201d all the alien capital that has flowed into the Valley in recent years. Dumb money is a hedge-funder who\u2019s jealous of a V.C. Dumb money is sovereign wealth. Dumb money is an Emirati home office. Dumb money is a Facebook millionaire in a Maserati who wants to look like a player. Dumb money wants to get in on tech because it\u2019s a box to check off. Dumb money isn\u2019t in it for the long run. Dumb money doesn\u2019t actually care about the technology. Dumb money doesn\u2019t create value. Dumb money thinks what you lose on the margin you\u2019ll make up for in volume. Dumb money wants to get in on Uber at any price, and will accept a \u201climited-edition private offer\u201d to join the scarce ranks in a \u201cspecial purpose vehicle\u201d that bears all the risks of one company with none of the hedging benefits of a portfolio. Dumb money is those pinkish guys with bull necks in Zegna suits. The weird thing about dumb money, unfortunately, is that it can act with fiendish intelligence, insisting on stipulations that guarantee returns at the expense of founders, employees and other investors.Luckily for the American economy, the dumb money this time around is no longer a mob of deluded pensioners waist-deep in Webvan. (It\u2019s also, the V.C.s noted, a lot less money in total, and at least in theory it\u2019s coming from people who can afford the losses; the last dot-com crash erased an estimated $6.2 trillion in household wealth.) So the coming correction will allow the smart money to roll up its brushed-microfiber sleeves and get back to basics. A lot of $10 billion companies will become $1 billion companies, and $1 billion companies will be acquired for $100 million, and the dumb money will slink away. Operating expenses and burn rates will come way down, and companies that didn\u2019t worry about profitability or unit economics will. There will be layoffs, sure, but the only serious effects will be that the traffic on I-280 will no longer back up three exits, it\u2019ll be easier to get a table at the Village Pub and engineers three minutes out of Stanford will no longer expect $150,000 a year and backlit fountains of complimentary fruit water.Defenders of that system argue that all they really need are the expected half-dozen mega-I.P.O.s (Slack, Palantir, Snapchat, Uber, Airbnb) to make enough cash returns to offset the losses. But that fantasy math holds for only a tiny cohort of V.C. firms. It also overlooks the well-being of tens of thousands of employees, especially support staff, who have worked for years for a share in the wealth they\u2019ve created. Perhaps worst of all, it betrays a callow belief that the genuinely transformative long-term endeavors that V.C.s have come to support \u2014 erstwhile academic research into artificial intelligence, bioengineering and sustainable energy \u2014 will be somehow insulated from an industry downturn. An exploded bubble could very well mean that those \u201ctotally audacious\u201d bets will go unfunded entirely. That might seem like a satisfying comeuppance for the imperious Valley, but it\u2019s not something to be smug about. Smart money convinces itself of its highly differentiated intelligence at what might prove to be all of our expense.Gideon Lewis-Kraus is a contributing writer for the magazine.

{"Headline": "A Worrisome Pileup of $100 Million Homes", "Date": "2016-05-28", "News": "Supported byInside WealthOne of the latest symbols of the overinflated luxury housing market is a pink mansion perched above the Mediterranean on the French Riviera.The 13,000-square-foot property, built and owned by the fashion magnate Pierre Cardin, is composed of giant terra cotta orbs arranged in a sprawling hive. The home\u2019s name befits its price. \u201cLe Palais Bulles,\u201d or \u201cthe Bubble Palace,\u201d is being offered for sale at approximately $450 million.If you add in high-priced \u201cwhisper listings\u201d that are offered privately, brokers say the actual number of nine-figure listings worldwide could easily top 40 or 50.\u201cIt\u2019s a bumper crop,\u201d said Dan Conn, chief executive of Christie\u2019s International Real Estate. \u201cIt\u2019s just a new world in terms of what people are building and offering for sale.\u201dThe rise in nine-figure real estate listings comes just as sales of luxury real estate have cooled. Many say the sudden surge in hyperprice homes \u2014 often built and sold by speculative investors \u2014 is the ultimate bubble signal.Last year, only two homes in the world sold for over $100 million, according to Christie\u2019s. One was a 9,455-square-foot house in Hong Kong purchased for $193 million by Jack Ma, the chief of Alibaba. The other was a townhouse in London that sold for $132 million. This year, a ranch in Texas went on the market for $700 million and a home in Dallas listed for $100 million. Both sold, but the actual sale prices have not been disclosed.The last time a sudden pop in $100 million-plus listings occurred was in 2007 and 2008, just before the housing crash. In 2008, at least four homes in the world listed for nine figures. Only one ended up selling for close to that. A mansion in Palm Beach owned by Donald Trump and listed for $100 million sold for $95 million. (Mr. Trump says it sold for $100 million.) A 103-room mansion in Surrey, England, called Updown Court, was listed for $138 million, but sold in 2011 for about $50 million. A log mansion planned for the Yellowstone Club in Montana, with a promised price of $155 million, was never built, and the land sold for $10 million.Of course, anyone can slap a $100 million price tag on a home to get attention. Yet actual sales of nine-figure homes are rare, even in good times. Between 2011 and 2016, only 15 homes in the world have sold for $100 million or more, according to Christies, and five of those were in 2014.\u201cThe era of aspirational pricing is over, and I\u2019m not sure it ever really worked,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cThese prices get headlines, but the properties just don\u2019t sell.\u201dBrokers promoting the listings say their properties are one-of-a-kind masterpieces \u2014 like Picassos or Modiglianis \u2014 that rarely come on the market. They add that the more than 1,800 billionaires in the world see property as a safer store of wealth than stocks or art. Mr. Conn estimates that of the 27 nine-figure listings, a third will sell for under $100 million, a third will sell for around $100 million and a third for far more.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a sign of a bubble,\u201d Mr. Conn said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign of growing wealth in the world and the quality of some of the new construction.\u201dYet the market for megamansions and penthouses has cooled significantly in the last year. Prices for homes in the top 5 percent of the real estate market fell 1.1 percent in the first quarter of 2016, according to Redfin. Prices for the rest of the housing market increased 4.7 percent.Brokers say the very top of the market \u2014 consisting of eight- and nine-figure homes \u2014 is faring the worst as slowing economies overseas and volatile stock markets have spooked buyers. The supply of homes for the rich exploded as builders aimed at the high end after the financial crisis.Of the 10 most expensive listings in the world, seven are in the United States and four of these are in Los Angeles. The most expensive listing in the world is the $500 million compound being built in the Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles by Nile Niami, a film producer and speculative builder. The property will have a 74,000-square-foot main house, a 30-car garage and a \u201cMonaco-style casino.\u201dIn nearby Holmby Hills, a more modest 38,000-square-foot mansion, built by the investor and developer Gala Asher, came on the market in April for $150 million. The ultramodern house, on the prestigious Carolwood Drive, has a 5,300-square-foot master suite and a club level with bar, dance floor, wine room, lap pool, theater complex, beauty parlor and massage rooms. The property also includes several guesthouses and staff housing. The broker, Ginger Glass, said the price of the property was justified.\u201cBuyers today want new construction,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd there isn\u2019t anything that\u2019s new like this in such a great location.\u201dStill more nine-figure homes are on the way. Real estate agents and developers say a home under construction in Bel Air is likely to have more than 50,000 square feet of living space, with finishes rivaling a superyacht\u2019s. The price will be yacht-like, too, at around $300 million. Among the home\u2019s amenities: the world\u2019s largest safe.ROBERT FRANK is the CNBC wealth editor and the author of \u201cRichistan.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In the Clear, Phil Mickelson Can Thank an Insider Trading Ruling", "Date": "2016-05-20", "News": "Supported bySports BusinessPhil Mickelson, meet Todd Newman.It\u2019s unlikely that the famous golfer knows the former portfolio manager for Diamondback Capital Management, a hedge fund based in Stamford, Conn., that went out of business in 2013. But Mickelson ought to consider reaching out to thank him. Newman is quite likely a key reason Mickelson was not charged Thursday with insider trading by the Securities and Exchange Commission.Newman and another hedge fund manager, Anthony Chiasson, were indicted in 2012 on insider trading charges by Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York. (The S.E.C. also brought civil charges.) Newman was accused of regularly receiving information about two stocks \u2014 Dell, the computer company, and Nvidia, a chip maker \u2014 from company insiders, allowing him to make what amounted to illegal trades.Why? Because, the court said, for a crime to have been committed, the company insider \u2014 the so-called tipper \u2014 had to have received a personal benefit in return for offering up inside information. In addition, the person who received the tip \u2014 the \u201ctippee\u201d \u2014 had to know that the tipper was receiving that personal benefit. By all appearances, Newman didn\u2019t even know who the tippers were; the information got to him through a series of intermediaries, the last of whom was an analyst at Diamondback. Without that knowledge of a personal benefit, Newman had not committed a crime.Critics of the appeals court\u2019s Newman decision, including Bharara, say that the judges essentially redefined what constituted insider trading, making it much more difficult to bring cases even when it is obvious that wrongful behavior has taken place. Defenders, including many lawyers in the white-collar defense bar, say the court was simply reiterating the law as the Supreme Court had always intended it to be, and was finally reining in overly aggressive prosecutions by Bharara.At the time, Mickelson owed Walters gambling debts. Although he was a serious gambler, Mickelson was not a big stock trader, with only about $250,000 in the market, according to the S.E.C. Yet on July 30 and 31, 2012, after a series of phone calls and texts with Walters, Mickelson bought $2.4 million worth of Dean Foods stock \u2014 some of it with money he borrowed. \u201cThese were his first ever Dean Foods purchases,\u201d the S.E.C. noted.The case against Walters, as outlined by the S.E.C. and the United States attorney\u2019s office, appears to be strong. In all, the government says, the inside information Walters got from Davis was worth $40 million. The government goes out of its way to play up the personal benefit Davis received in return. An inveterate gambler trying to keep up an unsustainable lifestyle, he owed money to the I.R.S. and others, including Walters. More than once, Walters bailed him out by either lending him money or arranging for a loan. The loans totaled nearly $2 million.It is also clear that Walters, who is alleged to have tipped off Mickelson in turn, got a benefit from his tippee. According to the S.E.C., Mickelson used some of his Dean Foods profits to pay back his gambling debt to Walters. But did Mickelson know about the personal benefit the original tipper, Davis, was receiving? I know it sounds a little strange, but that really is the key legal question in the wake of the Newman decision. If he didn\u2019t know that Davis was receiving a personal benefit in return for giving inside information to Walters, he\u2019s off the hook.(A quick aside: According to Forbes, Mickelson has reaped around $500 million in career earnings, and gets some $50 million a year in endorsement income. The fact that he was trading in Dean Foods to repay a debt to Walters surely raises questions about Mickelson\u2019s financial decision-making, well apart from whether he traded on inside information.)In its complaint against Walters, the S.E.C. seems to have highlighted Mickelson\u2019s involvement in the case. But ultimately, it merely named him a \u201crelief defendant,\u201d meaning that all he had to do was return the money he had made from the Dean Foods trade, plus interest. He readily agreed. (The total is about $1.03 million.)A spokesman for Mickelson issued a statement Thursday in which he said that Mickelson didn\u2019t want to \u201cbenefit from any transaction that the S.E.C. sees as questionable.\u201d He added that Mickelson regretted any \u201cappearance\u201d that he had fallen short of \u201cthe high professional and ethical standards that the companies he represents expect of their employees, associates and Phil himself.\u201dThat should do the trick: Several of the companies Mickelson endorses have already said they\u2019ll stick with him. For Mickelson, this too shall pass \u2014 and probably pretty quickly. Still, given the set of facts laid out by the government, it\u2019s a little hard to believe that he didn\u2019t know what he was doing.The government won\u2019t explicitly say the Newman case caused the government to back away from bringing charges against Mickelson. But at his news conference on Thursday, after declining to comment on that very question, Bharara did say this: \u201cConduct we think is nefarious, and undermines faith in the market and the fairness of the markets, will not be able to be prosecuted because of the Newman decision.\u201dOn Thursday, Phil Mickelson became Exhibit A.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the year in which a court overturned the insider trading case against Todd Newman. It was 2014, not 2012.Advertisement"}
