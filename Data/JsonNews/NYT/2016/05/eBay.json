{"Headline": "Just Add Salt: How to Make Bacon and Pancetta at Home", "Date": "2016-05-17", "News": "Supported byCuring meat is why humans could stay put when there was nothing to grow, kill or steal. It is how conquerors and discoverers lasted while they traveled the world.But the refrigerator and the modern food industry \u2014 with its cans, plastic bags and chemicals \u2014 have made the average home cook afraid of this most simple and useful food preparation.There is no good reason for this: All you really need is salt. And the result? Malcolm, my 17-year-old son, may have said it best, \u201cWhatever is on my bagel is really good.\u201dHe was a test taster for home-cured lox I made while madly seasoning and drying out flesh over several months for this article. I had worried that I left the fish socked with salt in the refrigerator too long. The outside was dry, jerkylike, not the silky sort from a package of even average lox. I had to cut deeper \u2014 into fresh wild salmon infused with smoked salt, sugar, fennel fronds and fennel pollen \u2014 to reach the prize.I was surprised by how good it was, and this is no humble brag. You can buy wonderful lox from a store: This was a different taste planet.It was also easy. I made it myself with exactly the fish and flavors I wanted. And the boy liked it, a lot.Unlike the decision to become a better cook generally, which pays off every day, the resolve to do your own curing prompts a few basic questions before you start. Mostly: Why bother?A second question is one of ambition. Curing spans a range from bacon or basic corned beef to the elaborate, lard-chunked salamis of Italian or French charcuterie. The latter take much practice; dredging eBay and Amazon for humidifiers, grinders, slicers, casings and pH readers, even building a drying room for precise temperatures and moisture.I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a satisfying hobby, but it\u2019s also an insane amount of work \u2014 and requires elevated caution about safety. Cured food is, by definition, not cooked. Without proper precautions, it can foster dangerous bacteria. Rot can be good for wine, beer, cheese or yogurt. It can also make you sick or die. Cured meat that involves fermentation raises that risk.What I\u2019ve been experimenting with for the last eight or so years is not grinding and fermenting but drying out solid pieces of meat as they are transformed with just salt, spices and air. Turns out our ancestors stumbled onto something magical: Salt preserves the meat by sucking the water out, retarding spoilage and concentrating flavor.The process also allows the added flavors to infuse into the meat, making it something different altogether, as well as making it more your own.How long it lasts depends on whom you ask. It\u2019s safe to say dried meat will last a few weeks in the refrigerator without problems and much longer if frozen, which is perfectly fine.Fresh products like bacon or nondried pancetta go rancid much more quickly and should be checked carefully. Trouble is easy to detect: I\u2019ve noticed dried meats don\u2019t so much spoil as grow yellowish and don\u2019t smell fresh. Then it\u2019s time to toss them.Don\u2019t think of curing as an heirloom exercise in recreating life how it used to be. Like Mr. Bertolli, many proponents of curing learned it from relatives who did it partly out of love, partly out of necessity. So despite the last few generations of mass produced and preserved food, curing is an art that was never lost. Maybe out of fashion, but ever alive.\u201cFor me, it\u2019s the pleasure of making things you are going to consume yourself,\u201d Mr. Bertolli said. \u201cThere is a pride in it.\u201dI\u2019ve developed a basic and useful repertoire that requires no special equipment, space or even much time: bacon, both American and Italian (pancetta); lox, and duck prosciutto, an impressive and fun little trick that I learned from Mr. Polcyn and that you can brag over at your next dinner party as if you just brought it back from Parma. It cures for just one day under kosher salt alone.Romans say with snobby certainty you can make carbonara only with guanciale, not pancetta or bacon. I\u2019m fine with any, but there is no question that guanciale makes the dish taste like Rome.It promised the exotic without much pain or cost: salt, sugar, pepper, garlic, coriander and rosemary rubbed over the cheek and plopped into a Ziploc bag in the refrigerator for just three days. To use right away, you roast it for about three hours. It is sublime.We are fortunate enough to have a fireplace, so I thought: Why not dry it the way they do in Italy? I did, even if it drove the dogs mad, hanging temptingly just behind the screen in the unlit fireplace.Three weeks later I was rewarded with something I felt I didn\u2019t do enough to deserve: It looked Old World on the outside, all tough and dry, the inside a strip of meat encased in almost buttery, flavorful fat.I realize most cooks aren\u2019t going to find regular use for guanciale, though it adds wonders to other pastas, soups and even seafood dishes. For me, though, it lit a fuse: I moved from the pig\u2019s cheek to its belly. Salts, sugar and maple syrup are all you need for tremendous American bacon.Nutmeg, juniper, garlic, thyme and bay leaf make pancetta, which can be used dry or fresh and is singularly versatile in the kitchen. Fish, salmon especially, cures in a few days and makes a New York bagel brunch a special occasion. (I just tried a recipe from Mr. Polcyn curing salmon with beets and fresh horseradish. I recommend it.)The list goes on, for every taste and ambition: jerky, pastrami, corned beef, full hams. I don\u2019t own a smoker, but it notches the art up with little effort. There are websites devoted to prosciutto, which requires only salt, patience and the optimism of being alive in the year or so an entire pig leg takes to dry. Results, apparently, are spectacular.A few basics for new curers: It\u2019s nice to have a fireplace, for temperature and air flow, but you can hang meat to dry in many places. People use closets, garages, basements, old refrigerators, a kitchen\u2019s out-of-the-way nook.You won\u2019t smell much of anything as it cures, since it generally is wrapped in plastic for many reasons, mostly because the meat gets quite wet as the salt pulls out the water. But the aroma is terrific: sweet and salty, with flavors like rosemary and cracked pepper at high decibel.Then there are the inevitable controversies of curing, which I\u2019ll cover here only in outline. This is what the Internet was invented for, and readers of age can decide for themselves.There is also a theological debate over whether to use the most common curing salt, often called pink salt or Prague powder. It is a nitrite, and thus poisonous in quantity. Some curers prefer alternatives as safer and more natural. Experts I consulted recommended using it (in the prescribed small amounts) for several reasons: It\u2019s effective in killing dangerous bacteria and contributes to the taste and color of good cured meat. I do, without apology.Finally, I\u2019ll say that curing is handy (this was the whole point, before history was even invented) and can save a bundle. One recent rainy Sunday, our younger son, Nelson, came home from a day of hard New York skateboarding with a friend, starving, as 15-year-olds tend to be. We had not strategized dinner. We considered ordering out, but Indian food or sushi would run $60 at least.Took 20 minutes. Cost less than $20 for four. The boys didn\u2019t care where that crazy-great, salty bacon came from, but they ate and were happy. I was, too, and the pleasure was not just in my stomach.cookingcookingcookingcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Child Care Gap in the R\u00e9sum\u00e9: Whether to Explain or Not", "Date": "2016-05-19", "News": "Supported byWhen Brooke Bleyl started job hunting after taking 10 years off to care for her children, her interviews did not go well.\u201cThey even said they typically don\u2019t hire people with such a gap,\u201d said Ms. Bleyl, who lives outside Cleveland and has three children, ages 7, 10 and 12.Ms. Bleyl, who worked as an employment recruiter before taking time off, said she tried to fill in gaps on her r\u00e9sum\u00e9, including online selling to earn extra money. \u201cBut when you see eBay on someone\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9, you know that\u2019s a stay-at-home job,\u201d she said, \u201cand that you\u2019re just selling stuff out of your basement.\u201dAfter receiving \u201crejection after rejection after rejection,\u201d Ms. Bleyl said, \u201cI was very defeated.\u201d She eventually found a job as an account manager at a staffing service, but only with the help of a personal connection.For women hoping to return to the workplace after caring for their children, the advice is often \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell.\u201d Many women who described themselves as stay-at-home mothers can attest to receiving denigrating nods and hasty rebuffs. Researchers have repeatedly found ample evidence of discrimination against mothers in the hiring process and the workplace.But, Professor Hersch said, \u201cwomen who conceal personal information dramatically lower their hiring prospects.\u201dMs. Bleyl, despite her own experience, shares that view. \u201cIt\u2019s better to be upfront, because it\u2019s who you are,\u201d she said. \u201cI was so hungry to get in there and work, work, work.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t apologize for it,\u201d Ms. Cohen said. \u201cSay, \u2018Yes, I took a career break for child care reasons, and now I can\u2019t wait to get back to work.\u2019\u201dNot everybody will be open to such an approach. But many will.\u201cI think it comes down to the hiring manager,\u201d Ms. Cohen said. \u201cIf the individual has someone in their own personal orbit who has taken a career break, they are much more likely to be interested in the caliber and potential of that population than someone who has not had the experience.\u201dPlaying up volunteer and freelance work is important, she said, but it\u2019s a mistake to emphasize \u201cmom skills\u201d that are required for managing family life. The interviewer could be doing all that and working as well.Some experts were skeptical of the experiment Professor Hersch and her co-author, Jennifer Bennett Shinall, an assistant law professor at Vanderbilt, conducted for their study. They said it was too far removed from the actual job-hunting experience.Instead, they asked more than 3,000 people recruited online to act as potential employers and choose one of two candidates with similar experience.One applicant provided an explanation for a 10-year gap in her job history \u2014 such as taking time off to raise children and then going through a divorce \u2014 while the other provided no explanation at all. Those who revealed the personal information were 30 to 40 percent more likely to be chosen than those without.\u201cThe number of people who preferred the woman who explained her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 gap was staggering,\u201d Professor Hersch said. \u201cI was shocked.\u201dThe commission, for example, warns employers, \u201cQuestions about marital status and number and ages of children are frequently used to discriminate against women and may violate Title VII if used to deny or limit employment opportunities.\u201dProfessor Hersch says that more neutral language that invites employers to broach the issue of family with all candidates \u2014 both men and women \u2014 would be preferable.A lot of the interview process is about ensuring a good fit, she said, but now there is \u201can environment where you\u2019re dancing around the elephant in the room.\u201dOfer Sharone, a sociologist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, who researches career transitions and hiring, disagrees. He said that changing the E.E.O.C. guidelines would be disastrous.Marriage and children tend to hurt women much more than men in the workplace, he said, and Professor Hersch\u2019s and Professor Shinall\u2019s recommendation \u201cwould greatly exacerbate that discrimination.\u201dEmployers often wrongly assume that mothers will not be able to commit to their jobs as much if they\u2019re committed to their families. Saying a candidate is the wrong fit can be code for discrimination, Professor Sharone said.Reducing the choice to one woman who explains a gap and another who doesn\u2019t, he said, misses the more likely reality: that both would probably be screened out before they got to the interview stage. Employers are looking to filter through a huge number of applications in the quickest way possible. \u201cIf there\u2019s a gap,\u201d Professor Sharone said recruiters had consistently told him, they are \u201cgoing to go with someone without a gap.\u201dProfessor Sharone and other researchers did agree that if a candidate made it to the interview stage, then explaining a gap was better than leaving it to the employers\u2019 imagination.When Stephanie Bond decided to re-enter the work force after taking off a couple of years to care for her two sons in 2012, she ended up getting hired by a recruiter she had contacted. \u201cI said I was a road warrior and took the opportunity to reconnect with my family,\u201d said Ms. Bond, who was also able to list consulting work on her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to cover any gap.During the interview, she said, \u201cI was very upfront about the flexibility I needed to have,\u201d which included working from home at times.Her own experience as a hiring manager has taught her what to look for in candidates with a career gap. But for some employers, she said, a gap is \u201ca complete red flag and you wouldn\u2019t get an opportunity to explain.\u201dFollow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Building an Estate Sale Business by Franchising a Name and Brand", "Date": "2016-05-04", "News": "Supported byIn the unregulated world of estate sales, it can often be a challenge finding a reliable company to handle the unforgiving task of assessing and selling a person\u2019s lifetime of possessions in just a few days.That was the issue Melanie Stepanovich faced. As executor of her cousin\u2019s estate, she had the daunting task of clearing out his home in Downey, Calif.Hundreds of boxes, stacked to the ceiling, were crammed into a 2,200-square-foot house. Some contained antique bronze statues, 1920s Lalique perfume bottles, vintage Disney memorabilia and Tiffany-style lamps. Rolled-up Persian rugs and antique furniture were scattered around the house. Ms. Stepanovich, 67, a retired high school teacher, had no idea where to start.\u201cDo you know the \u2018Hoarders\u2019 TV show? That\u2019s what the house looked like, except it wasn\u2019t garbage or trash,\u201d Ms. Stepanovich said. \u201cI was overwhelmed, depressed and stressed to the max. I knew I had to get help.\u201dThe art of pricing antiques and selling hidden gems may seem easy in an era of eBay auctions and dazzling finds on \u201cAntiques Roadshow\u201d on PBS. In reality, turning estate sales into a profitable business can be difficult.Still, would-be entrepreneurs have entered the estate sale business in droves. More than 12,000 estate sale companies operate across the country, with more than 98 percent of them mom-and-pop businesses, estimates Micky McQuade, chief executive of EstateSales.net, a listing site for estate sales.Unlike appraisers and auctioneers, estate sale companies are not licensed or regulated, making it difficult for consumers to assess or compare businesses.Simone Kelly, who founded Grasons, is betting that building a business in this fragmented industry and franchising its name in cities across the country will give the company a leg up.\u201cHaving a brand name that is trusted and reputable is humongous for us,\u201d Ms. Kelly said. She conducts background checks on all employees and potential franchisees, she said, and has rejected 14 people for franchises because they did not meet her standards.Grasons held 245 estate sales through 11 franchises in three states in 2015, up from 27 estate sales in its first full year in 2012. Ms. Kelly said she expected to have 40 franchises nationwide by the end of 2016 and 300 by 2020.Grasons, the parent company, makes money by charging a $30,000 franchisee fee and a 4.5 percent royalty on the franchisee\u2019s gross estate sales. It plans to raise the franchise fee to $40,000 and charge a flat $500 a sale, Ms. Kelly said. Its revenue, $103,000 in 2012, rose to more than $375,000 in 2015, she said. She predicted that revenue would reach $920,000 in 2016 and exceed $9.8 million in 2020.Ms. Kelly said she was lobbying Matthew Harper, a California state assemblyman, to write legislation to regulate the industry. Madeleine Cooper, Mr. Harper\u2019s legislative director, confirmed that the state was considering ways to impose penalties or regulations on it.The estate sale business requires a deftness for both appraising and handling people.Ms. Kelly recalled a large estate in September 2013, in which the deceased man\u2019s only surviving relative was his 94-year-old mother. Possessions at the home, in Huntington Beach, Calif., included three Rolls-Royces, a 1992 Jaguar XJS, a 2006 Cadillac Escalade, Arizona Leather Interiors furniture, four flat-screen TVs, a gun collection and a grand piano.Tagging and pricing the items was challenging enough. Adding to the stress were the strangers dropping in, professing to be long-lost relatives or friends who were entitled to some of the property, she said. Some were testy, insisting that pen scrawls on napkins and random pieces of paper were proof of their claims.Some even \u201cwent searching through the koi pond\u201d looking for treasures, she said. \u201cIt was crazy. It was the most disgusting display of humanity I\u2019d ever seen.\u201dMs. Kelly calmly referred all of them to the estate\u2019s lawyer, who sorted out what was owed to whom.Grasons franchisees hope some of the experience and credibility that Ms. Kelly acquired will help their operations. The franchisees make their money by charging a commission, usually 30 percent, on the proceeds of each estate sale.In some instances, they pocket as much as 50 percent for \u201choarding\u201d clean-out jobs and as little as 10 percent for big-ticket items, such as cars and rare coins.Franchisees say the estate sale business is often tough work. \u201cWe have two or three days to empty a house that took 60 years to fill, and that takes skill,\u201d said Kathleen Shattles, who goes by Kendra. She owned a small estate sale company called America\u2019s Attic in Huntington Beach, Calif., before she bought Grasons\u2019s first franchise in 2014. She recently bought a second franchise.Combing through a labyrinth of possessions is also daunting. Elderly clients, in particular, are notorious for hiding valuables, sometimes sewing them into the hems of draperies or taping them under floorboards.\u201cWe literally pull up carpets. We stomp on the floors. We hit the walls. We hit the ceiling. We climb up into attics. Every drawer is removed, and we look underneath it and behind it,\u201d Ms. Shattles said.Building a business was one of Ms. Kelly\u2019s longtime goals. She flexed her entrepreneurial muscle early, digging up worms in the backyard to sell to fishermen while living in Muskegon, Mich., at 9 years old, and setting up a lemonade stand at 11.Even though she had no college education, she started a loan company, W.E. Financial in Fountain Valley, Calif., in 2002, and in 2003, she bought a Re/Max franchise in Huntington Harbour, Calif., for $25,000. When she sold the franchise and ancillary businesses after a divorce in 2006, it had 55 agents and was valued at more than $400,000.While running the real estate business, she discovered estate sales. She saw potential for huge demand, given the need for property sales after a divorce, death of a parent or downsizing. She scoured books, antiques websites and auctions to learn about appraising and pricing items. In late 2011, she started Grasons, which is named after her sons, Grant and Jason.One customer, Cindy Rossi, said she had contacted three estate sale companies before choosing Grasons to handle the sale of her former husband\u2019s estate in Huntington Harbour in 2014.The sprawling 5,500-square-foot home was chock-full of antiques and collectibles, including paintings, a 1970 Rolls-Royce and 1975 Stutz Blackhawk.Ms. Rossi said the Grasons brand made a difference.\u201cAnytime you\u2019ve got more than one office, you\u2019re looking at somebody whose business is doing well, or they wouldn\u2019t be expanding,\u201d Ms. Rossi said.Caring, which started in 2006 and has 169 locations, focuses on a different niche. Most of its customers are older people who are moving to a smaller home or an assisted living center. It offers estate liquidation and relocation services, which include packing and moving a client to a new home.Ms. Kelly said her company did not compete directly with Caring and sometimes even referred clients to it. For his part, Chris Seman, president of Caring Transitions, said the expansion of franchise operations would help the industry.\u201cThe rising tide lifts all boats,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s good for the industry and will bring in a level of professionalism and quality that, frankly, is not there today.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Joshua Ferris Reviews Don DeLillo\u2019s \u2018Zero K\u2019", "Date": "2016-05-02", "News": "Supported byFictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Something feels not quite right about subjecting Don DeLillo to the ordinary critical apparatus. I don\u2019t read a DeLillo novel for its plot, character, setting; for who betrayed whom and how hard life with Mother was; for Phoenix days and Bombay nights; or for how to tune a fiddle. I read a DeLillo novel for its sentences. And sentence by sentence, DeLillo magically slips the knot of criticism and gives his readers what Nabokov maintained was all that mattered in life and art: individual genius. Sentence by sentence, DeLillo seduces. And I don\u2019t just mean on the question of thumbs up or down; I mean that his sentences juke and weave around the best defenses, so that not only is the playing field of the past 50 years strewn with conservative critics of all stripes, but text, subtext, ultimate meanings remain elusive and the game, at least in part, now seems original to him.For instance. Charles Maitland, a British security consultant in DeLillo\u2019s 1982 novel \u201cThe Names,\u201d compares Western expatriates \u2014 diplomats, businessmen, risk analysts \u2014 to members of the British Empire whose insouciant lives were full of \u201copportunity, adventure, sunsets, dusty death.\u201d Even with so dour a conclusion, it all sounds winsome and romantic in Maitland\u2019s formulation, which fails to take into account at whose expense opportunity and adventure are made. Later, Maitland complains: \u201cThey keep changing the names .\u2008.\u2008. Persia for one. We grew up with Persia. What a vast picture that name evoked. A vast carpet of sand. .\u2008.\u2008. I find I take these changes quite personally. .\u2008.\u2008. Every time another people\u2019s republic emerges from the dust, I have the feeling someone has tampered with my childhood.\u201d Clueless but effervescent, this is wit and world-weariness as two sides of the Western coin, the sort of thing one might smile at when spoken at a cocktail party. But it masks a deeper intent. DeLillo artfully reveals Maitland\u2019s Western view of things while guiding the reader to ask: Who\u2019s changing the names, and why? Smile, and the history of colonialism and the civil wars it ignited will be scrubbed out with a quip.Local pleasures make palatable \u00adDeLillo\u2019s deep and disquieting engagement with the world on many levels: \u00adsocial, political, philosophical, linguistic, interpersonal. In book after book, his characters fall through constructed surfaces and constructed selves into deeper, more terrifying but also more numinous realities. They quest for truer or purer or more permanent identities, for the hidden key that will resolve them of their limitations, weaknesses and mortal bearings. More often than not, that quest leads to disillusionment and death. Thus does David Bell, in \u201cAmericana,\u201d hope to discover in the small towns and bit players of this uncontainable country something that will make him one with the pure incandescent image. Thus does Owen Brademas, searching in \u201cThe Names\u201d for the resolution of a fallen world in a language of divine order, find that search travestied by a murderous cult seeking similar ends. And thus does Lee Harvey Oswald, in \u201cLibra,\u201d hope to be absorbed into History with a single act of violence in order to be absolved of his otherwise small and insignificant self.In \u201cZero K,\u201d DeLillo\u2019s 16th and latest novel, Jeffrey Lockhart arrives in the middle of the desert at a remote compound called the Convergence. Variously described as an \u201cendeavor,\u201d a \u201cfaith-based technology\u201d and \u201cthe first split second of the first cosmic year,\u201d the Convergence is a cross between a think tank and a state-of-the-art hospice: the Santa Fe Institute meets Sloan Kettering, with a dollop of Heaven\u2019s Gate, all of it given over to Christo for interior decorating. Whatever it is, the Convergence coolly ignites the imagination. Jeff hopes to get his bearings, at least geographically, when he asks his father, the billionaire Ross Lockhart, where they are. \u201cThe nearest city of any size is across the border, called Bishkek,\u201d Ross answers from deep within blastproof walls. He continues: \u201cOnce you know the local names and how to spell them, you\u2019ll feel less detached.\u201dWe are, in other words, far from the neocolonial world described so tendentiously by Charles Maitland. We are in a vision of the future, a postracial, post-postcolonial world where Westerners like Ross and Jeff are but one contingent of a technocratic cult with a single aim: to rid the world of that absolute, all-\u00addefining force, that ultimate despotic colonizer, death. For the Convergence, as it turns out, is a cryonic suspension facility where the dead are frozen in anticipation of that day when resuscitation is medically feasible. Jeff has arrived there to say a temporary goodbye to his stepmother, the archaeologist \u00adArtis Martineau, who is dying of several disabling diseases.Ross Lockhart, who made his billions assessing the financial risk of natural disasters, is a true believer in the promise of the Convergence. He pours money and \u00adresources into the endeavor, not to mention old-fashioned dogma. The first half of the book is devoted to abolishing any skepticism Jeff (and the reader) might have for the cryogenically inclined. \u201cRespect the idea,\u201d Ross tells Jeff of the Convergence, after Jeff, intending only a little disrespect, says, \u201cPeople \u00adenroll their pets.\u201d Yet, despite the proselytizing, Jeff, who spends his downtime wandering past door after door in a series of unending hallways, can\u2019t bring himself to understand what\u2019s all around him as anything more than it seems: a lark, a punch line, a cruel delusion. Artis \u201cwould die,\u201d he thinks, \u201cchemically prompted, in a subzero vault, in a highly precise medical procedure guided by mass delusion, by superstition and arrogance and self-deception.\u201d His skepticism extends to the very rooms and doorways of the Convergence, as he becomes convinced they\u2019re decoys, elaborate fictions to some inscrutable end. He knocks on one, and to his surprise, a man answers in turban and tie. Not a lark, after all. \u201cI must have the wrong door,\u201d Jeff says by way of apology. \u201cThey\u2019re all the wrong door,\u201d the man replies. A lark, after all.This is fiction in touch with the starker parables, with Kafka and Beckett, with the austerity of bare rooms and declarative, uninflected sentences. I was uncertain as I read these early pages. Had DeLillo created a world of pure abstraction where the reader would be left to float in the \u00adzero-gravity chamber of the death fable, everything to think about and nothing to latch on to? But this is only one of several canny feints in the book, which continually shape-shifts and reimagines itself. In the end, it all adds up to one of the most mysterious, emotionally moving and formally rewarding books of DeLillo\u2019s long career.Slowly, Jeff comes to understand what\u2019s intended out there on the outskirts of Bishkek: technological utopia. Cells will be refashioned. Nanobots will restore the body and augment the brain. The old factions born of religion and geopolitics will be permanently mooted in a post-death world. Jeff\u2019s incredulity at such things \u00adallows DeLillo to render the Convergence at once otherworldly and entirely believable, one more high-flying human scheme revved on false hope and doomed to fail. What put me in mind, in the early going, of brushed-steel surfaces and lonely centrifuges becomes something warmer and more elegiac as Artis\u2019s death nears and the enormity of Ross\u2019s loss comes into view. Death, even at the Convergence, remains just that, at least for the foreseeable future. And the man does love his wife.At about the same time, the philosophical implications of cryogenic success deepen. The primary architects of the Convergence, a pair of siblings Jeff calls the Stenmark twins, hold a kind of slapstick seminar on their project; it plays like the Marx Brothers doing a TED talk with the mind-body philosophers Paul and Patricia Churchland. I found myself asking: What would happen if the souls of the cryogenically preserved went to heaven? Would they resurrect as zombies when science restored their bodies? The book inspires a lot of intellectual play as it drifts away from stark Kafka landscape into Borges-\u00adinspired mindspace, even flirting with the trippier themes of Philip K. Dick, and elegy starts to compete not with science fiction, exactly, but with fiction about science.Meanwhile, the real world \u2014 I mean yours and mine (and Jeff\u2019s), the world of headlines and global warming \u2014 enters from the wings in the form of disaster footage projected onto white screens in those hallways Jeff roams. \u201cThere were temples flooded, homes pitching down hillsides,\u201d he tells us. \u201cI watched as water kept rising in city streets, cars and drivers going under.\u201d If literature is Pound\u2019s \u201cnews that stays news,\u201d this is news about news that stays news, for in a place like the Convergence where death has been antiquated, newspaper headlines turn into art installations. Soon the book is pulling a good number of levers, both emotional and intellectual, and really humming, so much so that when Ross, perfectly healthy, announces his intention to follow his wife on the first leg of what they hope to be a round-trip journey \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m going with her,\u201d he tells his son, in a cold declaration of his suicide \u2014 I was wide-eyed, and reading as much for plot as for prose style.DeLillo, the most perceptive (almost occult) chronicler of contemporary life, has not invented the Convergence out of whole cloth: Its DNA comes from an old evangelism dressed in a new rhetoric and streaming out of Silicon Valley. \u201cDeath makes me very angry,\u201d Larry Ellison, the founder of Oracle, told his biographer, perhaps to explain why he has given nearly half a billion dollars to medical research to halt human aging. Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay, together with his wife, has given millions of dollars to the research of biological resiliency. Then there is the Breakthrough Prize, founded by Sergey Brin, Mark Zuckerberg and other tech luminaries, with an annual pot of $3 million going to researchers who make discoveries that extend human life. And there is Larry Page\u2019s founding of Calico (or California Life Company), an \u00adanti-aging research center in San Francisco, with a multimillion-dollar \u00adinvestment from Google. The list goes on. We have entered an age of messianism through philanthropy and are only a billionaire\u2019s whim away from the Convergence and its dreams of \u201ca promise more assured than the ineffable hereafters of the world\u2019s organized religions.\u201dThe full scope of DeLillo\u2019s vision for \u201cZero K\u201d comes into view with the book\u2019s second half, when the real world, in the form of New York City and the crisis in Ukraine, floods the page. Two years have passed since Artis\u2019s death, and Jeff now finds himself involved with a woman named Emma and her politically precocious son, whom she adopted from Ukraine. The strife there, hopeless and cyclical, is soon to rear its terrible head, with consequences for all of them. But before any of this can transpire, we get familiar DeLillo street life, witty repartee in the backs of cabs, rooftop views of the city at dusk. We have our attention focused on those easily overlooked moments of everyday life, like standing shoeless in the airport, and those quotidian \u00addetails \u2014 \u201cfresh towels on the racks, nice new bar of soap, clean sheets on the bed\u201d \u2014 that give texture and pleasure to the day. We visit Emma at the school where she works with developmentally disabled children, admiring her, as Jeff does, for her tenderness with troubled souls. This teeming life, these unexpectedly touching scenes, come to the reader as both refreshing breeze and melancholy plaint, for what is observed here, what is gloried, is also what is inevitably lost with dying. The careful structure of the book won\u2019t let us forget that: The Convergence, the dying part, came first. This is \u00adelegy as formal design. We carry the Convergence with us through the vibrant city like a memento mori, for toward a convergence we all must go, and with it, every attachment, every lustful look, the whole worldly kit and caboodle.The Convergence, with its promises of everlasting life, is a seductive dream, just as Charles Maitland\u2019s assessment of Western entanglement in far-flung lands is seductive. \u201cIt will be very gentle,\u201d Ross says about Artis\u2019s death. \u201cIt will be quick, safe and painless.\u201d Death, painless! \u201cThis is real,\u201d one of the Stenmark twins says. \u201cTake the existential leap. Rewrite the sad grim grieving playscript of death in the usual manner.\u201d When death is indistinguishable from a long night\u2019s sleep among excellent accommodations and in the company of loved ones, after which one awakes rejuvenated and augmented by nanobots with spoken Greek and all of Proust, who wouldn\u2019t love the turndown service at the Convergence?But the seduction is every bit as illusory as Charles Maitland\u2019s. After all, we are as far from a postracial, post-postcolonial world as we are near to arriving at whatever technique or technology is necessary for eternal life. For those inclined to believe that the rationalist mind-set, in league with science and technology, is better poised to bring about results than the old emissaries of heaven, \u201cZero K\u201d reminds them that human nature is one of permanent conflict. Eternal life would only become one more instrument of power and source of human sorrow.The good news, modest as it must be, is \u201cZero K.\u201d DeLillo\u2019s novels generally \u00adoffer consolation simply by enacting so well the mystery and awe of the real world, by probing deeply and mystically into so much, and by offering the pleasures of his unique style. Just as his characters plunge through constructed realities in quest of truer selves, so do we, as DeLillo\u2019s readers, find in his pages something akin to insight of a gnostic order. DeLillo\u2019s characters long to penetrate the enigmas and intrigues of his conjured worlds; DeLillo\u2019s readers devour his sentences, images and narratives for what amounts to something similar: for all that DeLillo \u2014 the seeker, the prophet, the mystic, the guide \u2014 sees.That consolation is every bit as present in \u201cZero K\u201d as it is in the best of DeLillo\u2019s previous novels, down to the pleasures of the final page. The scene takes place in New York, with Jeff on a crosstown bus. It ends the book powerfully. I finished it stunned and grateful. DeLillo has written a handful of the past half-century\u2019s finest novels. Now, as he approaches 80, he gives us one more, written distinctly for the 21st.Joshua Ferris\u2019s novels include \u201cThen We Came to the End,\u201d\u2009 \u201cThe Unnamed\u201d and \u201cTo Rise Again at a Decent Hour.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It Depends on the Seats", "Date": "2016-05-26", "News": "Supported byBut in a recent production of \u201cThe Flick\u201d at the tiny Threshold Repertory Theater in Charleston, S.C., audiences were in and out in just over two hours. That\u2019s what happens when your fictional movie theater has just 24 chairs.\u201cThey didn\u2019t spend a lot of time cleaning up,\u201d said Courtney Daniel, the theater\u2019s executive director. \u201cObviously we\u2019ve got popcorn and things they have to pick up because it\u2019s essential to the show, but I think the audience got it: You\u2019re cleaning.\u201d\u201cWe added some gum to them in the front row, but all that wear is how they came, which is why we love it so much,\u201d Mr. Zinn said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to know that there\u2019s a warehouse somewhere filled with dirty movie theater seats.\u201dThe on-set projector, flown overseas after being used at Barrow Street, proved to be a challenge, and not just because London theaters run on a different voltage than those in the United States.\u201cWhat\u2019s complicated is that we are asking a film projector to behave unlike a film projector: Start immediately and shut off immediately,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe had to Frankenstein projectors together to allow that to happen.\u201d\u201cIn the script Annie says she disappears for like 15 seconds,\u201d said Mr. Tei. \u201cHere you don\u2019t have to act. You just have to walk up the stairs.\u201dThe actors, who actually clean the theater during performances, are in good favor with the janitorial staff. \u201cWe sweep up just like the cleaning crew does after us,\u201d said Mr. Tei. \u201cWe tell them, look, we\u2019ve already cleaned it for you. But please don\u2019t throw out the trash. We need it for props.\u201dThis 99-seat theater, in a storefront space between a Chinese restaurant and a sandwich shop, featured a micro-cinema-size set, without the center aisle typically built in elsewhere. The audience in the front row sat about five feet from the stage.Mike Kordek, the set designer, got the seats free from a theater in Savannah, Ga., that posted an ad on Craigslist. The back wall consists of flats with painted-on curtains. Total expense: about $500.\u201cBecause we are such a small theater, we try to keep costs down as much as possible,\u201d Mr. Kordek said. \u201cI checked the price of curtains, and it was outrageous.\u201dThe 8-millimeter projector and film canisters in the booth were donated by Trident Technical College in Charleston, S.C. During scene changes, the actors threw bags of popcorn and other garbage on the floor.\u201cWe ate a lot of Starbursts to have the wrappers,\u201d Mr. Kordek said of the now-closed show.Markas Henry said he had no specific theater in mind for his design. \u201cI grew up in the country, so going to the movies was a once-a-year kind of experience,\u201d he said. The biggest challenge was designing for a theater, a former church, that has no wing, fly or backstage space. \u201cIf something needs to be moved onstage, you have to build it into your design,\u201d he said.Mr. Henry spent about $800 on the \u201950s-style seats, found through a Craigslist ad. Their curved plywood backs have a golden varnish; the upholstery on the cushions was a pale-blue gray with some tan and brown, colors that inspired the rest of the set. Two colors of inexpensive Home Depot carpet line the walls. The rest of the set cost an additional $2,500.Pieces of an old projector, seen inside the booth, were accentuated with painted fake parts to gave it the hefty appearance of a 70-millimeter projector. \u201cIt\u2019s all smoke and mirrors,\u201d Mr. Henry said of the play, now closed.There\u2019s dingy, then there\u2019s Chet Longley\u2019s design, which was inspired, he said, by a \u201cworn-out mall where you got your potato skins at Bennigan\u2019s before watching a movie.\u201d The seats were given to the company by Spotlight Cinemas, a dollar movie theater in Columbia that was going digital. Most of the set, which had a budget of about $1,200, was assembled from \u201cfreecycled sources,\u201d as Mr. Longley put it.The coverings at the top of the seats are some sort of vinyl fabric that Mr. Longley figures were added by Spotlight Cinemas to extend the life of the fabric \u201cand hide dirt and stains.\u201dSpotlight also lent the theater a 35-millimeter projector, reels and film canisters. The projector and the reels have to be returned, but the seats are going to a scrap salvager after the run ends.Jack Magaw visited some of Chicago\u2019s grandest movie theaters to assess what he didn\u2019t want to incorporate into his design. \u201cIt was more about cheesy ceiling tiles, the suburban equivalent of a single-screen theater,\u201d he said.The chairs were purchased off eBay from a former church in Indiana for about $2,000, and the carpeting is from Exposition Carpet, on Chicago\u2019s North Side. Steppenwolf hired Julian Antos, a projectionist from the Music Box, as a consultant.The backs of the chairs were outfitted with small boxes filled with prop garbage; electromagnets controlled by the stage manager released the contents onto the floor during blackouts. \u201cWhen the lights come up they have more stuff to clean up,\u201d said Mr. Magaw. \u201cWhen I saw a video of it, I thought it as the coolest thing I\u2019d ever seen.\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice if this theater was built in the \u201960s and \u201970s and survived this long with minimal upgrades over the years?\u201d That was how James Kronzer approached his set design to go into Signature\u2019s black-box theater. The chairs were a donation from Laurel Haunt, a haunted house in Laurel, Md., that takes places in an abandoned movie theater. The original chairs were light blue metal with dark blue upholstery, and since Mr. Kronzer\u2019s design called for black metal and red upholstery, they were reupholstered and repainted. In total, the chairs cost around $4,000, about half of the show\u2019s props budget.Mr. Kronzer said eagle-eyed audience members will spot hyperrealistic touches on the set, including dust on top of the exit lights, dried mop water in the corners and gum in the carpets. \u201cThis is not a highly skilled work force that works in this room,\u201d he said of the characters.The set designer Robert Winn said the biggest challenge was putting a movie theater in the company\u2019s small basement space, which has 90 seats and concrete columns every 15 feet. \u201cIt\u2019s intimate,\u201d he said. He was inspired by the Art Deco touches of the Arlyne Theater, a movie house built during the oil boom of the early \u201930s in Longview, Tex., where he grew up, but as if retrofitted during the 1970s.For $300, Mr. Winn got the seats from an abandoned movie theater in Austin that has had other lives as a Mexican wrestling venue and a bazaar. As part of the deal, he also got the curtains, mop buckets and film reel canisters.Peeking out from the booth window is a 16-millimeter projector and posters of \u201cBeach Girls and the Monster,\u201d a \u201950s horror movie, and Wes Anderson\u2019s \u201cBottle Rocket,\u201d which was shot in Dallas.Advertisement"}

Trump, said he had filed his personal financial disclosure with the Federal Election Commission, as required by law for presidential candidates.\u201cI filed my P.F.D., which I am proud to say is the largest in the history of the F.E.C.,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a statement Tuesday.\u201cDespite Donald Trump\u2019s boasting, submitting his personal financial disclosure form is no breakthrough for transparency,\u201d Christina Reynolds, a Clinton spokeswoman, said in a statement.Personal financial disclosures have become a familiar practice for the Clintons after their decades in public office. Mrs. Clinton also had to file the standard forms while serving as secretary of state, revealing Bill Clinton\u2019s investments and paid speeches while his wife served as the nation\u2019s top diplomat.The 2015 forms show Mrs. Clinton slowed her paid-speaking schedule as she prepared to run for president, with the final speech delivered \u2014 weeks before she announced her candidacy \u2014 to the American Camp Association for an honorarium of $260,000. A speech to eBay, also delivered the month before her April announcement, earned Mrs. Clinton $315,000, according to the disclosure.Mr. Clinton made a total of $4.6 million in paid speeches last year, some delivered after Mrs. Clinton made her campaign official.Those speeches paid Mr. Clinton up to $285,000 each. But unlike in previous years when he gave speeches to overseas groups, in some cases for nearly twice that amount, his speeches in 2015, in preparation for his wife\u2019s second presidential bid, were made to domestic trade groups and companies.Mr. Clinton received $250,000 for a question-and-answer session at an \u201cupfront\u201d presentation in New York for the Spanish language network Univision. Haim Saban, a major Clinton donor and an owner of Univision, sat in the front row as Mr. Clinton headlined the event, where executives pitched the channel to advertisers.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s disclosure on Tuesday seemed timed to hit Mr. Trump. Earlier in the day, his campaign said his forms would reveal that Mr. Trump\u2019s income last year was in excess of $557 million, not including dividends, interest, capital gains, rents and royalties, and that his net worth is in excess of $10 billion. (Fortune has calculated his net worth at $3.72 billion, and Forbes has reported that his worth was roughly $4.5 billion as of September.)The Clinton campaign has used Mr. Trump\u2019s reluctance to reveal his tax returns to imply that he is not as wealthy as he claims, a criticism that has irked Mr. Trump. \u201cWhat Is Donald Trump Hiding?\u201d read the subject of an email blasted out on Tuesday by the Clinton campaign.

Both Paddle8 and Auctionata focus on what they call the \u201cmiddle market\u201d for art sales: objects more valuable than can be sold on eBay, but generally topping out at $500,000.The start-ups\u2019 aim is to disrupt scores of smaller auction houses, largely brick-and-mortar and without an online presence. By contrast, the two start-ups were born with the express intent of reaching broad audiences by tapping the Internet for both objects to be sold and potential buyers.\u201cWe will be able to pick up an object and sell it quicker than anyone else in the world,\u201d Alexander Zacke, the chief executive of Auctionata, said in a telephone interview.Together, Auctionata and Paddle8 reported sales in 2015 of around $140 million and have a combined user base of nearly 800,000.Both companies have drawn backing from big names in the world of art and luxury: Auctionata\u2019s investors include Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, while Paddle8\u2019s include the artist Damien Hirst and the gallery owner David Zwirner. All existing investors are expected to remain on board with the newly combined auction house.The two companies have known each other for years. Mr. Zacke regularly meets with Paddle8\u2019s founders, according to Aditya Julka, a Paddle8 founder. But nearly two years ago, Mr. Zacke conceded that his company would have a difficult time breaking into the United States, and Mr. Julka said his start-up would struggle to move into Europe.Combining would allow each company to more easily move into new geographies and markets, as well as share new technologies.Founders of both companies declined to disclose specific terms of the deal, though Mr. Zacke said that because Auctionata was bigger in terms of sales, its shareholders would receive more equity in the combined company.Mr. Zacke will also lead the combined company, though all the founders will remain in top roles.Both Mr. Zacke and Mr. Julka repeatedly called the deal a merger, meant to fuse both companies\u2019 cultures together.

{"Headline": "From a Middling Infielder to a Kindred Spirit", "Date": "2016-05-28", "News": "Supported byThere was a time not so long ago when young sports fans wrote actual letters to their heroes and sometimes received a photo or even a note or letter in return \u2014 not from an agent or public relations firm, but from the athlete himself. Sometimes the response came autographed, no invoice attached.Which is why in 1971 I wrote, via a family friend, to Mets shortstop Bud Harrelson. My efforts were like those of extraterrestrial intelligence seekers, sending a signal into the darkness in the hope that something might be out there to respond. I wanted Harrelson\u2019s home address so I could invite him to my bar mitzvah, which was coming up in two years. I would also invite President Richard M. Nixon and Don Adams, the actor who had starred on the sitcom \u201cGet Smart.\u2019\u2019Harrelson was gentleman enough to answer my letter. He wrote back on a piece of lined notebook paper that he had passed around the clubhouse for teammates and coaches to sign \u2014 and in 1971 those individuals included Tom Seaver, Nolan Ryan, Gil Hodges, Yogi Berra and others who, with Harrelson, were part of the 1969 Miracle Mets team that won the World Series and taught me that absolutely anything was possible.Harrelson, it should be noted, was also the third-base coach on the 1986 championship Mets team being honored this weekend at Citi Field. He was the one giddily accompanying Ray Knight toward home plate after the ball went through Bill Buckner\u2019s legs in Game 6.But that was a different miracle. Back in 1971, he apologized for not being able to provide his home address but encouraged me to write back to him at Shea Stadium. He also advised me to stay in school, though I was 11 at the time and was not really thinking about quitting to try my luck in the bigs.In our current era, when autographed sports memorabilia shows up on eBay for thousands of dollars, I am less interested in what this letter is now worth than what led me to choose Harrelson as my favorite player in the first place.After all, he weighed all of 165 pounds and boasted a lifetime batting average of .236. He was alternately nicknamed Twiggy, and Mighty Mouse and Mini Hawk. On a team of extroverts he was subdued \u2014 though always irreverently funny, as when he said of his notorious brawl with Pete Rose in 1973, \u201cI hit him in the fist with my eye.\u201dBut Harrelson was also a tiny wizard with a fielder\u2019s mitt, a humble alchemist at shortstop who could pluck a base hit from the space-time continuum and convert it to a double play. He finished his career with a .969 fielding percentage, won a Gold Glove in 1971 and played in two All-Star Games. He could also rise to an occasion, as when he hit one of his few career homers over the head of Rose on his first visit back to Cincinnati after their fight.I see now that something in Harrelson reflected the way I viewed myself as a boy: That I possessed a subtle but inherent power, an unpolished brilliance that would reveal itself when it was most needed, like instinctively snagging a hot grounder out of the dirt and transforming it into glittering art with a pivot and a sidearm whip-crack to first. I would never be Rusty Staub, I knew back then, but surely there were other ways to excel.When Harrelson brawled with Rose that October day in 1973, taking on one of the toughest players in the game (who also outweighed him by 40 pounds), I felt as if I had been recognized for my own hidden abilities \u2014 those qualities that would one day rise out of me like an apparent line-drive double that ascends to clear the fence. It was as though Harrelson knew this about me even before I did, and that was why he had written back at all.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of a capsule summary with this article misstated the event a young fan wanted the shortstop Bud Harrelson to attend. It was a bar mitzvah, not a bat mitzvah.Advertisement"}

Kirtley, a professor of media ethics and law at the University of Minnesota and the former executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said that the Gawker case may raise the stakes for press freedom.\u201cIt\u2019s often the scrappy, unconventional news outlets that challenge conventional wisdom, and in doing so, they serve an important purpose,\u201d Ms. Kirtley said. \u201cBut they are also very vulnerable financially. It\u2019s expensive to defend suits like this.\u201d\u201cCombined with press consolidation, or ever-greater influence among the 0.0001 percenters, it is a little unnerving,\u201d she said in an interview.\u201cThe circumstance that brought on the lawsuit could not be more dissimilar,\u201d Ms. Jeffery said, referring to her magazine\u2019s case. \u201cBut what is similar is the pattern of press intimidation.\u201dWell-known figures in Silicon Valley began to dissect Mr. Thiel\u2019s political motivations publicly and debate whether it was appropriate for outside parties to fund lawsuits like the one brought against Gawker.Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay who in 2013 created First Look Media, a studio and digital media company, drew a connection between Mr. Thiel\u2019s actions and past comments from Mr. Trump.Jack Doppelt, a media ethics professor at Northwestern University, called Mr. Trump a \u201cgreat example\u201d of a wealthy figure who has used the civil legal system to his advantage, and added Mr. Thiel to that group.\u201cDonald Trump knows that if he sues somebody for something, it will drown the other side,\u201d Mr. Doppelt said. \u201cHe\u2019s got the resources to be able to do that. It\u2019s a real distortion of what we want our civil legal system to be about.\u201d\u201cWhether the case is civil or criminal, the key to the courthouse door is the dollar bill.\u201dMr. Thiel\u2019s involvement in the Gawker case and his apparent support of Mr. Trump place him at an extraordinary intersection of American political currents.The Hogan case had become a cause for online groups like GamerGate, a loose movement that started in opposition to perceived problems in video game journalism but has since become a broad and often aggressive campaign against the news media and what members refer to as \u201csocial justice warriors.\u201dDisdain for the media, but especially for Gawker, is a theme in online communities supporting Mr. Trump, less for controversial reporting than for perceived promotion of an agenda of social justice and \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d \u2014 a subject Mr. Thiel has written about extensively.(Mr. Thiel wrote a book with David O.

They are platforms that provide valued connections among their participants. The nature of those connections and the value they provide vary widely.Both Google and Facebook \u2013 together approaching $1 trillion in market value \u2014 are in the business of connecting advertisers to consumers, but their platforms and business models are very different.Another trillion-dollar pair, Apple and Microsoft, have followed similarly divergent paths in monetizing their respective platforms: Both own operating systems that connect application developers and users. And \u201cplatform\u201d businesses of various stripes seem to represent a disproportionate share of the market\u2019s hot tech start-ups, like Uber, Airbnb, Pinterest and Snapchat.A surprising number of business books have been published in the last few months that seek to explore the origins and implications of the emergence of the platform paradigm. The great virtue of the best of these, \u201cMatchmakers: The New Economics of Multisided Platforms\u201d (Harvard Business Review) by David S. Evans and Richard Schmalensee, is that it reminds us that there is nothing new about multisided platforms \u2013 which the authors call matchmaker businesses.The \u201cnew economics\u201d mentioned in the subtitle refers to what the authors misleadingly call the \u201cdiscovery\u201d of multisided businesses by fellow economists in 2000. Although the research cited was certainly important in understanding the dynamics of multisided markets, advertising-based media businesses have successfully operated in these environments for literally hundreds of years.An old-world media example quickly makes clear the unusual management challenges of operating multisided-platform businesses. To be successful, newspaper and magazine publishers need to attract both readers and advertisers, who represent the two sides of the platform. In most instances, however, to optimize overall profits, publishers must subsidize one side of the market. Rarely does the price of a subscription cover even the incremental cost of printing and distribution of the publication.This does not reflect a rookie mistake but a nuanced understanding of the tradeoffs between circulation and advertising revenue. If managers ignore the interaction between the different sides of a multisided market in developing pricing strategies, they will inevitably arrive at erroneous conclusions. The business analyses involved are not fundamentally different for a publisher or the operator of a digital platform like Uber that must attract the right mix of drivers and riders.But what has changed in the world to make these models apparently so much more prevalent? \u201cMatchmakers\u201d identifies \u201csix turbocharging technologies\u201d that it claims have \u201cturbocharged the ancient matchmaker model.\u201dSpecifically, the authors argue that the combined impact of improvements in computing power, bandwidth, networking and storage capacity have allowed the establishment of \u201ctwo foundational multisided platforms\u201d that support all the others that have rapidly emerged: Internet service providers (who provide the fixed and mobile connections among platform participants) and operating systems (which provide the common language that allow app developers to achieve mass adoption).History aside, the heart of \u201cMatchmakers\u201d is an entrepreneurial playbook of sorts for \u201cbuilding, igniting and operating matchmakers.\u201d The strongest part of the book is the detailed description of diverse platform business models, both new and old, some of which readers might not have even previously thought of as \u201cmatchmakers.\u201dFor instance, South Florida\u2019s upscale Aventura Mall is really a platform for commerce between retailers and shoppers. To succeed, the developer had to take into account land values, local demographics, nearby alternatives, which retailers and entertainment services to target and what and how to charge them, and the physical design. Similar complexity faced the founders of M-Pesa, a mobile money transfer service in Kenya that in the course of three years counted 42 percent of the adult population as registered users and transformed that economy.The problem with many of the books about the rise of the so-called platform economy is that they are filled with an unbridled optimism about the collective attractiveness of these businesses, particularly in their digital incarnations. Sure, they argue, incumbents will be disrupted, but in their stead will be bigger, stronger competitors in winner-take-all markets.They focus on \u201cnetwork effects,\u201d which can create a virtuous circle \u2013 sometimes called a flywheel effect \u2013 as new users on one side of a platform attract more on another and vice versa. The crucial attribute of network effects businesses is that every new participant increases the value of the network to existing participants.Alex Moazed and Nicholas L. Johnson are the consultants turned authors of \u201cModern Monopolies: What It Takes to Dominate the 21st Century Economy\u201d (St. Martins). Their book promises the same \u201cframeworks and insights we use to help our clients become modern monopolies.\u201d In their telling, the history of \u201cplatform capitalism\u201d appears to have started with eBay, which in part explains the inability of their \u201cframeworks\u201d to deliver on the assurance of market domination.\u201cPlatform Revolution: How Networked Markets Are Transforming the Economy and How to Make Them Work For You\u201d (Norton), another book written by industry consultants \u2014 these mostly with day jobs in academia \u2014 provides an even more expansive vision of the \u201crevolution\u201d wrought by the emergence of network effects as \u201cthe Internet-era source of market power,\u201d which \u201cis likely to strengthen a market\u2019s winner take all tendency.\u201dThe book\u2019s authors \u2014 Geoffrey Parker, Marshall W. Van Alstyne and Sangeet Paul Choudary \u2014 argue that the ascension of platform business models requires a fundamental rethinking of things as diverse as basic business strategy and government regulation. Their wide-ranging vision and predictions are undermined by frequent factual errors. For example, Sony does not own Time Warner movie and television studios, and Netflix does not have strong network effects.Even \u201cMatchmakers,\u201d which offers the most balanced picture of the challenges and opportunities of multisided platforms, plays down the structural fragility faced by all of the \u201cturbocharged\u201d matchmakers described. Mr. Evans and Mr. Schmalensee insist that \u201cnetwork effects power all multisided platforms.\u201d What\u2019s more, according to them, the digital developments recounted \u201chave resulted in a huge increase in the power and reach of these effects.\u201d Neither statement is true.First, plenty of multisided platforms do not have any significant network effects to speak of. A popular TV show attracts both viewers and advertisers, but it is the quality of the programming, not the presence of more advertisers, that keeps the audience coming back. TV and cable broadcasting networks, like most ad-based media businesses, are multisided platforms, but they have negligible network effects. Google, the mightiest exception to the digital fragility rule, is a platform business that does not benefit primarily from network effects but rather from traditional economies of scale.Second, the strength of network effects is often a function of the existence of reinforcing competitive advantages like economies of scale and, notably, customer captivity. The digital economy has undermined both of these barriers to entry by lowering both customer switching costs and the fixed-cost base that drives scale economies.So the Aventura Mall benefits from the long-term leases signed by retailers on the one hand and the fact that local shoppers need to go out of their way to find a comparable experience. Operators of digital malls, by contrast, rarely secure long-term commitments from either advertisers or sellers, and shoppers have multiple alternatives just a click away. And the fixed costs expended to build a traditional mall could easily fund many dozens of digital retail platforms.Even the authors of \u201cModern Monopolies\u201d concede that \u201ca modern monopoly\u2019s dominance\u201d is likely to be short-lived given \u201cthe competitive threat it faces from adjacent competitors and a constant onslaught of new entrants.\u201dAll three books provide useful, and mostly consistent, insights into how to build more resilient and valuable platforms. The diversity of businesses and outcomes described, however, suggest that the differences among platform businesses are far more important than their commonalities. This is at least good news for consumers who will benefit from multiplying innovations that reduce the annoying frictions of everyday life and the consultants who will be kept busy helping managers devise ways to prolong their increasingly tenuous perch as master of a modern monopoly.Jonathan A.

{"Headline": "Tech Titans Raise Their Guard, Pushing Back Against News Media", "Date": "2016-05-27", "News": "Supported bySilicon Valley JournalWith its response, the tech community\u2019s message is clear: Treat us the way we want to be treated or we might retaliate. Even though Silicon Valley professes to be for free speech \u2014 this is where Twitter was invented, after all \u2014 the reaction opens a window into the thinking of the digerati, who are becoming more guarded and elusive even as their products make the world more transparent.Given Mr. Thiel\u2019s \u201cbeliefs and objectives, I can\u2019t fault him for his approach,\u201d Parker Thompson, a partner at the venture capital firm 500 Startups, said in an interview.Mr. Thompson was just one of dozens of techies in Silicon Valley who talked or tweeted their approval of Mr. Thiel and their disapproval, or worse, of Gawker and Valleywag in the last few days.Late Friday, First Look Media, which was founded by Mr. Omidyar, said that in keeping with its mission to protect the First Amendment, it would be helping to organize supporting briefs for Gawker\u2019s appeal.\u201cThe possibility that Gawker may have to post a bond for $50 million or more just to be able to pursue its right to appeal the jury\u2019s verdict raises serious concerns about press freedom,\u201d Lynn Oberlander, general counsel for First Look, said in a statement.\u201cWe welcome the support at the appellate level,\u201d Gawker said in its own statement.In some ways Silicon Valley\u2019s reaction is not surprising. A journalist\u2019s job, at least in theory, is to ask questions and print the truth, which means it is less than loved in citadels of power. But in Silicon Valley, even the media hates the media.For Ken Shotts, who teaches ethics and strategy at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, Mr. Thiel\u2019s secret campaign against Gawker brought to mind General Motors\u2019 pursuit of Ralph Nader 50 years ago. G.M. set private detectives on Mr. Nader to get the dirt on him that would nullify his criticism of its Corvair car. G.M. went beyond the pale, and was punished. The president of G.M. was forced to appear before Congress and apologize for harassing and intimidating the company\u2019s critic.\u201cCompanies face constraints,\u201d said Mr. Shotts. \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing. Individuals are less constrained, and billionaires hardly at all.\u201dFrom this perspective, what Mr. Thiel did was less of an aberration and more of that old Silicon Valley stand-by: a new product launch. It is now out of stealth mode and getting good reviews among potential users.As a result, Mr. Shotts said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see more cases like this.\u201dThe situation is complicated by the fact that these days rich tech companies, their owners or venture capitalists are as much the owners and producers of the media as the subject. With the traditional media in a weakened state, it is a trend that seems to be accelerating.Facebook and Andreesen Horowitz declined to comment.\u201cGawker tried to have it both ways,\u201d Venky Ganesan, managing director of the venture capital firm Menlo Ventures, said in an interview. \u201cThey wanted to be taken seriously as journalists, yet they didn\u2019t follow all the norms.\u201dTwenty-five years ago, tech coverage was the domain of geeks and trade reporters \u2014 people who understood their way around a motherboard, were excited by it and wouldn\u2019t dream of crossing certain boundaries. Now, with tech at its zenith, much of the coverage of the industry is still done by enthusiasts. Combine this with the need to get the power players to come to the media\u2019s conferences and there is a real reluctance to look behind the scenes.The result, she wrote, is \u201ca sense of entitlement in the industry where denizens of Silicon Valley expect the media to actively support them and any negative portrayals are met with real anger and resentment, even when they\u2019re 100 percent accurate.\u201dSam Altman, the president of Y Combinator, tried to chart a middle ground between Gawker and Mr. Thiel in a series of posts on Twitter.Danielle Ivory contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stuck With a Pricey Hotel Reservation? Maybe You Can Sell It", "Date": "2016-05-16", "News": "Supported byItinerariesIn March, Alysa Turner, a publicist from Washington, booked a hotel room through Southwest Airlines\u2019 rewards program. She paid $400 for a one-night stay at the Hilton San Francisco Union Square, but her plans changed after the window for canceling the reservation had closed.As travel reservations become more fragmented and cancellation restrictions and fees become more widespread, travelers like Ms. Turner are pushing back. They are turning to technology and listing nonrefundable hotel reservations on resale sites.Think of them as StubHubs for the hospitality industry.The practice of individual travelers\u2019 reselling what the industry calls \u201cdistressed inventory\u201d is still in its infancy. A room may not sell, let alone break even. And some who buy hotel rooms report erratic customer service.Still, experts say the sites are catching on and have the potential to transform hotel reservations.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not going away,\u201d said Christopher K. Anderson, a faculty member at the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration.Mr. Anderson said that sites like Tingo and tripBAM that automatically rebook reservations at a lower price pose a bigger threat to hotels because they artificially inflate the cancellation rate. \u201cAutomatically canceling and rebooking is scarier to hotels because it has an adverse effect on pricing and profitability,\u201d he said.Instead, Roomer Travel and Cancelon create a secondary market for hotel rooms. Sellers can ask any price for a room, although resale is not guaranteed.\u201cThe average discount is 45 percent,\u201d said Richie Karaburun, a managing director for Roomer Travel, although rooms in cities with high demand like New York, Paris or Rome bring higher prices. At Cancelon, a prospective buyer can offer a lower, acceptable price.When a room sells, Roomer Travel charges sellers a 15 percent fee, Cancelon 10 percent. Both say they coordinate with a hotel to make sure a booking name and credit card guarantee are changed. (Services are free to buyers.)When a room is listed on either site, it also becomes available at online travel sites like Kayak and Trivago. Rooms through Roomer Travel also appear on Skyscanner; those on Cancelon are on TripAdvisor.But there is a downside for consumers. A room becomes indistinguishable from any other hotel offering on those sites, which could sow confusion among buyers.Jon Eichelberger, regional manager for North America at Trivago, said his service was devised to find what rates are available and can be booked, but, he added, \u201cwe can\u2019t tell\u201d where a room is coming from.Shawn Haag, an instructional designer at the University of Minnesota, searched on TripAdvisor for a hotel room in Orlando, Fla., and booked two rooms at the Florida Hotel for $468. He was surprised when the booking confirmation came from Cancelon and not directly from the hotel.\u201cI hadn\u2019t heard of it and was startled and a little nervous,\u201d he said. The site promised a full refund to his credit card, which he received several weeks later after changing his mind. At first, he received only a screen shot of a refund voucher.Alex Boian, an executive at the Outdoor Industry Association in Boulder, Colo., said he had an uneven buying experience with Roomer Travel.Traveling to Washington on business, he wanted to stay within a budget of $300 a night. He was surprised when he was directed on Kayak to Roomer Travel for a Marriott reservation.\u201cI didn\u2019t know it was a resale site,\u201d he said, adding that he thought all rooms on Kayak represented excess capacity. (Kayak said that if a user liked a hotel rate and it was provided by Roomer or Cancelon, Kayak would send the person to that site to complete the booking.)The night before his departure, he checked his Marriott app, saw no record of the reservation and called the hotel. His stay was news to them, as was the $300 rate. Their rate was $500 a night.He tried calling a Roomer Travel customer service number, which he said was disconnected. After complaining on social media, he received a Marriott confirmation number though Roomer Travel.Now, he has sworn off the site for business trips. \u201cI really need certainty,\u201d he said. Roomer Travel said its customer service number was available around the clock.Henry Harteveldt, a travel analyst with Atmosphere Research, said, \u201cIt\u2019s important for the consumer to know what the product is and what it is not.\u201dHe emphasized it was important that all changes are made to the system in the correct way. Otherwise, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s a risk of someone showing up and claiming they have a reservation when they don\u2019t.\u201dFor its part, the hotel industry is cautious.\u201cThe American Hotel and Lodging Association is aware that sites like these exist and is constantly monitoring new entrants like these to the digital marketplace and their impact on customers,\u201d Rosanna Maietta, a spokeswoman for the association, wrote in an email.Six hours before check-in, Ms. Turner, the Washington publicist, received confirmation that her room sold at its full asking price. She doesn\u2019t know the going room rate that night or whether she could have gotten more money. The sale was credited to her PayPal account.\u201cIt worked great for me,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Age of Consignment", "Date": "2016-05-21", "News": "Supported byCultural StudiesAs fashion gets faster, these services are multiplying, flush with venture capital.\u201cIt\u2019s the Age of Consignment,\u201d a friend proclaimed, still giddy from selling off the contents of her basement.Material Wrld operates out of Industry City, a groovy former factory building in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, now colonized by tenants like West Elm\u2019s Makers Studio and the Storefront for Art and Architecture. Its founders, Rie Yano, 34, and Jie Zheng, 33, met at Harvard Business School and left their jobs in fashion to start the company in 2012.Like many fashion resellers, they make you an offer upfront, and send that which they won\u2019t accept to a charity, in their case Housing Works. \u201cWhat we\u2019re encouraging is a lifestyle where if you purchase quality fashion,\u201d Ms. Yano said, \u201cwe can extend its life when you don\u2019t want to wear it anymore.\u201d In late March, Material Wrld received $9 million in financing from an e-commerce company based in Japan.Mr. Ambrose, who wrote a college essay about the characters he met while window shopping, is a resale encyclopedia. Some basics: Women\u2019s pants don\u2019t sell. Nor do men\u2019s dress shirts, because people are very particular about these items. Recognizable brands, like Christian Louboutin shoes with their red soles, do. Shoes and handbags hold their value nicely. The RealReal divides the sale price 40/60; once a seller\u2019s wares reach $10,000, that person receives 70 percent. In the world of luxury consignment, Mr. Ambrose said, that benchmark is not the unicorn you\u2019d imagine.I had realized pretty quickly that my Gazelle sale was a fluke. I owned nothing else of value \u2014 at least, nothing that I wasn\u2019t using \u2014 and if I wanted to participate in the Age of Consignment in a meaningful way, I\u2019d have to do so as an observer. (\u201cGet out of my room, Mom,\u201d my daughter had texted from college after I\u2019d sent her photos of her own left-behind clothing. \u201cDo you really want this?\u201d I\u2019d written. \u201cNeed stuff to sell.\u201d)A few days later, Ms. Cresp mused on the process in an email. She had decided, she said, to pull some Vanessa Bruno items back from the RealReal to give to friends because the prices weren\u2019t as high as she\u2019d hoped and it made more sense, she wrote, to offer those things to people she loved. As Mr. Ambrose had noted, the more well-known brands received the highest prices: A Chanel turtleneck dress, for example, was marked $895. Of the 90 or so items Mr. Ambrose removed, 10 were rejected for sale.\u201cI have really good stuff, but like everyone, I make mistakes, I get carried away,\u201d she said. Nodding to Ms. Kondo, as one must, she added: \u201cWhen you do interrogate your objects, even if they don\u2019t spark joy, they\u2019re telling you something. Why do I buy endless numbers of white raincoats? I always have to give them away because they make me look like a dental hygienist. But it\u2019s a tic I have.\u201dThis is why consignment can still break your heart. Not every object you send away has a happy ending.Decades ago, when a magazine I worked for went out of business, my father very kindly bought me a suit to wear on job interviews. It was double-breasted, by Claude Montana, and God help me it was also taupe. Is taupe, I should say, because I still have it. I wore it once, to an interview with Carrie Donovan, who was the style editor of The New York Times Magazine, and despite its taupeness, she hired me. \u201cPantsuit,\u201d is what my new colleagues called me, and who could blame them? I never wore the thing again, but I saved it \u2014 it was a designer outfit, after all, and cost more than my rent at the time \u2014 carting it through many moves and many closet purges.An earlier version of this article misstated part of the name of a retailer popular with college students. It is Urban Outfitters not Urban Outfitter.Advertisement"}
