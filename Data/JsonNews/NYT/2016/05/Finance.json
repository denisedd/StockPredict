{"Headline": "Bring Hillary and Bernie Together", "Date": "2016-05-12", "News": "Supported byBernie Sanders is not going away. And why should he? The weather is nice, the crowds are enormous and he keeps winning primaries. Hillary Clinton has what appears to be an insurmountable lead in delegates, but hope springs eternal.\u201cIt is a steep hill to climb,\u201d he admits.Actually, probably harder to surmount than Gangkhar Puensum. (Which is the world\u2019s highest unclimbed mountain. I am telling you this to distract you from the subject of delegate counts.)But about Sanders: Democrats, what do you think he should do?A) Convention floor fight. \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d! Jon Snow is alive!C) Why can\u2019t we all just get along?Personally, I think that last one is possible. Although it would probably be a good idea to avoid saying a Clinton nomination could be a \u201cdisaster simply to protect the status quo,\u201d as Sanders\u2019s campaign manager did in an email on Wednesday.In an ideal world the Democrats would nominate a presidential candidate who\u2019s got an inspiring vision of change and the competence to run the country from Day 1. This person is not going to be on the ballot this year. So let Hillary Clinton have the nomination and give Bernie Sanders the party platform.He deserves a role. Sanders has spent the last year speaking about narrowing the gulf between the rich and the bottom 99 percent, fighting climate change and keeping special interests out of government. He\u2019s inspired millions. It\u2019s pretty much always the same speech, but he\u2019s the one who can bring the music.(Question: Will the Republicans have a fight about their platform? Nah \u2014 Donald Trump will let his opponents put in anything they want. Look, the man has convention entertainment to plan. Given the option of choosing the party position on health care or the dance numbers, you know which way he\u2019s going to go.)The Democrats could just make the Sanders speech into a platform, then join hands and march into the future. There actually aren\u2019t a lot of areas of disagreement. Clinton thinks his call for free public college tuition is \u2026 well, let\u2019s not say dumb. Dumb is not going to get you a united convention. Let\u2019s just say too much of a good thing. But she does want free community college tuition. Did you know that? She announced it on the very first official stop of her campaign. Since then not, um, frequently. Feel free to remind her.And you know, if Clinton could actually deliver on those two promises, it would be stupendous. This is an excellent example of the Democratic bottom line: On many, many issues, her platform is what the Sanders platform would look like if it actually got through the congressional wringer.On other matters, the Democrats\u2019 current policy divisions are just about doubting Hillary Clinton\u2019s intentions. Sanders wants to bring back the Glass-Steagall Act, which bars commercial banks from going into the investment banking business. Clinton says she can crack down on Wall Street better with more recent legislation. Sanders followers don\u2019t believe she means it.I say, be impressed that there\u2019s a party full of young voters for whom \u201cGlass-Steagall\u201d is a big applause line. You can\u2019t not want to encourage that. Put Glass-Steagall in the platform. Even if Clinton is right, all you\u2019d have is duplication of effort, and it would be an excellent gesture of solidarity.Finally, there\u2019s the influence of big-money donors on American politics. In theory, Sanders and Clinton are pretty much in the same place. But in practice, he\u2019s built his entire campaign around the concept of throwing out special interest money, while Clinton\u2019s barely provided lip service.\u201cOne of the four pillars of her campaign was going to be democracy issues,\u201d said Fred Wertheimer, president of the reform group Democracy 21. \u201cWell, the pillars haven\u2019t been around too much.\u201dWertheimer had his heart broken by Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, who both promised to make campaign finance a top priority, then didn\u2019t. Hillary Clinton, he thinks, ought to promise something more specific that she could implement right away. \u201cSet up a task force in the White House whose job it is to pursue this reform. Of top staff people,\u201d he suggested.Or a blue-ribbon committee featuring Bernie Sanders. Who would certainly never let her hear the end of it if she failed to deliver. Put that in the platform and smoke it.Advertisement"}

The retrospective will be announced this week by Ms. Hadid\u2019s studio and the foundation.The idea for a Hadid exhibition came up in October when the Fondazione Berengo\u2019s director, Jane Rushton, got in touch with Ms. Hadid on a visit to London. Ms. Hadid subsequently designed sinuous, vase-like sculptures for the Berengo glassmaking studio, which have yet to be produced, said Adriano Berengo, the studio\u2019s founder. Berengo is based in Murano, in the Venetian Lagoon, and has worked with artists including Jake and Dinos Chapman and Joana Vasconcelos.Ms. Hadid intended the exhibition to be a smaller, research-focused show, illustrating the new technologies and computational design methods used by her London-based practice, Zaha Hadid Architects. After her death, her studio decided to turn it into a survey of her career.\u201cWe felt the responsibility to address the fact that, unfortunately, Zaha passed away,\u201d said Manon Janssens, head of exhibitions at Zaha Hadid Architects. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t just have the show as it was.\u201dOther Hadid retrospectives have been held at the Guggenheim Museum in New York, in 2006, and at the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia, in 2015.All of Ms. Hadid\u2019s completed buildings will be represented in some way at the Venice show, through Ms. Hadid\u2019s own paintings, as well as models in paper relief and 3-D printing, line drawings, photographs, and videos.Inside the 16th-century Palazzo Franchetti, the first thing that visitors will see is a forest of undulating towers. The models, created by 3-D printing and presented as an example of the practice\u2019s working methods, were studies for a 2010 competition (entered but not won) for the Central Business District in Beijing.The first room will illustrate Ms. Hadid\u2019s early designs, with paper relief models in the middle and walls covered by her large architectural paintings. Many of these were for projects that were never built, such as the Peak hilltop leisure complex in Hong Kong (1982-83) or the Cardiff Bay Opera House (1994-96).One room will be devoted to her furniture, jewelry and exhibition designs (such as a 2008 mobile art pavilion for Chanel). Another will feature filmed interviews with Ms. Hadid.Three career milestones will be presented in a dedicated room: the Vitra fire station (1990-93) in Weil am Rhein, Germany, Ms. Hadid\u2019s first built project; the Rosenthal Center for Contemporary Art in Cincinnati (1997-2003), which helped Ms. Hadid win the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 2004; and the Maxxi National Museum of 21st-Century Arts in Rome (1998-2009), an illustration of how the practice evolved.Woody Yao, a co-curator of the exhibit with Ms. Janssens and one of Ms. Hadid\u2019s longest-serving architects, recalled accompanying her to the Architecture Biennale in other years.\u201cUsually when we went to Venice, we would walk around with Zaha, and she was an exhibition, basically,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery two steps, you had to stop and talk to people. Everyone was taking pictures with her.\u201dIt will be a very different Biennale this year, Mr. Yao added.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Only Way to Solve Iraq\u2019s Political Crisis", "Date": "2016-05-05", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorThe cause of Iraq\u2019s political paralysis is neither ideological nor sectarian. In fact, most of the main actors in the continuing dispute are Shiite Islamists. The disagreement is instead based on mutual distrust, which is fueled by the incompetence and corruption that have formed the basis of Iraq\u2019s political system since 2003. That dynamic has made it impossible for state institutions to present any viable solutions to the crisis.The only way out of the current stalemate is to inject new blood into the country\u2019s political class.Any new Iraqi government\u2019s first priority should be to organize fresh elections on an entirely different basis from how they have been conducted in the past. There are two simple and necessary changes that should be made immediately. First, members of Iraq\u2019s Parliament are some of the best-paid legislators in the world. This has had the effect of attracting candidates for the wrong reasons. Salaries, benefits and pensions for members of Parliament should be significantly reduced.It might be hard to imagine the enactment of new electoral rules given Iraq\u2019s political situation. But there is a precedent.In 2009, the Parliament was forced to move from a closed to an open electoral list system because of pressure from Iraqi civil society (including religious institutions, think tanks and major media outlets) and from the international community (including the United Nations, the United States and the European Union). Given the current level of popular anger, there\u2019s a strong possibility that similar pressure could be exerted today, giving strength to efforts to reform electoral rules.A number of Iraqi organizations, experts and even some politicians have been calling for these reforms, but more needs to be done to coordinate and prioritize them. Nominally, all of these changes require legislative action, but if the current Parliament refuses to act, the government should proceed unilaterally in the knowledge that it will have the people\u2019s full support. Iraq has been in crisis for years and any insistence on adhering to legal formalities seems misplaced at this point.New elections, organized on the basis of a reformed electoral law, would finally allow the possibility of enacting the genuine reforms that could once and for all end the culture of impunity in Iraq\u2019s political class: reforming the judiciary and purging it of corrupt judges; establishing a new, progressive and independent constitutional court; redefining the role of Iraqi judges to protect the public interest.New elections would also allow for Iraq\u2019s decrepit government accountability organizations to finally be fixed. The disastrous laws governing Iraq\u2019s anti-corruption bodies were drafted by the American-led Coalition Provisional Authority and have been left untouched by the Parliament. But these institutions need independence \u2014 and teeth \u2014 if they are to hold officials to account.Without new blood, these vital reforms have no chance of success. And without a new culture of accountability for government officials, Iraq has no hope.Zaid al-Ali, a visiting lecturer and fellow at Princeton, is the author of \u201cThe Struggle for Iraq\u2019s Future: How Corruption, Incompetence and Sectarianism Have Undermined Democracy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Price for a Green Card: $500,000 Stadium Stake", "Date": "2016-05-16", "News": "Supported byORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 For years, sports teams have tried to defray the multimillion-dollar costs of their new stadiums by asking fans to pay thousands for personal seat licenses that entitle them to buy season tickets.Fl\u00e1vio Augusto da Silva is taking the concept further. In what may be the first deal of its kind, Mr. da Silva, the majority owner of Orlando City of Major League Soccer, is asking investors from Brazil, China and elsewhere to pay $500,000 each for a stake in the stadium he is building near downtown Orlando. In return, the foreign investors receive annual dividends, two season tickets and something even more valuable: a green card that allows them, their spouses and sometimes even their children to live and work in the United States.Mr. da Silva, though, is building a $156 million stadium, not a high-rise building or a shopping mall, and he is marketing to foreigners not because lending is tight, but because lawmakers in Florida would not provide subsidies for the stadium in the Parramore neighborhood of Orlando.\u201cFor us, it was a business decision,\u201d said Mr. da Silva, who expects to raise about half the construction cost through the cash-for-visa program. \u201cThere was already demand from people who want to move to the U.S., have a green card and have a good opportunity to participate in the growth of the club.\u201dEB-5 financing helped pay for infrastructure work connected to Barclays Center in Brooklyn, but not for the arena itself. Developers previously tried to use the EB-5 program to finance stadium-only projects in California, Florida and elsewhere, but they hit roadblocks, including the unpredictable pace of getting EB-5 investors approved for projects that often have to be opened on specific timelines.The Orlando project features a 25,000-seat stadium, scheduled to open for the 2017 seasons of both Orlando City S.C. and the Orlando Pride, the women\u2019s team that Mr. da Silva owns with his partner Phil Rawlins. Originally, the city and county agreed to subsidize the project. But when state lawmakers balked at approving a sales tax rebate, Mr. da Silva turned to the EB-5 program, something Orlando\u2019s mayor, Buddy Dyer, cheered.Brazilians are soccer-mad and some even follow Orlando City, whose games are broadcast in Brazil and who are led by Kak\u00e1, a World Cup winner for Brazil and a former world player of the year.The club said it had already attracted 30 investors, bringing in $15 million, or 10 percent of the project\u2019s cost. Mr. Rawlins, the team\u2019s founder and president, said about $5 million in new commitments is secured each month.\u201cI don\u2019t know why people haven\u2019t taken more advantage of it, because it\u2019s a perfect thing when you\u2019re building a stadium,\u201d Mr. Rawlins said of the visa program. \u201cThe program is really about economic development.\u201dMark Abbott, deputy commissioner of M.L.S., said the league had reviewed the financing proposal and found it \u201cinnovative.\u201d\u201cThe league doesn\u2019t permit this type of financing for clubs,\u201d Mr. Abbott said, \u201cbut for stadium projects, we thought it was appropriate.\u201dIn addition to their stakes in the company that runs the stadium, investors in the project receive two club seats for 10 seasons. (The investors have no control over the team itself, which is part of a separate company.) But Mr. da Silva and others did not dispute that the visas were the real draw.Using the EB-5 program, though, can be complicated because the construction site must be in an area with high unemployment. To qualify, boundaries are sometimes gerrymandered to create an economically challenged (but essentially manufactured) neighborhood.Developers also must spend millions of their own money to start the construction because it can take months and even years for the government to approve each EB-5 visa. Visa applicants must pass a background check and prove that the project is viable and will create at least 10 jobs for each visa issued. The visas can be made permanent after a two-year probationary period.Some financial advisers recommend that foreigners who are considering putting $500,000 into a real estate project choose a hotel, mall or other more certain venture \u2014 anything but a sports stadium, whose main tenant could have unpredictable results.\u201cWhen these guys win games and championships, great, but if they\u2019re not, that cash flow could change,\u201d said Michael Gibson, who helps foreigners invest in EB-5 projects. \u201cWhy invest in that when you can invest in something steadier?\u201dFor now, opponents of the program have been unable to get the votes to overhaul or eliminate it, so other teams may be able to follow the path Orlando City has blazed.In M.L.S. alone, a group led by David Beckham, the former soccer star from England, has been trying to assemble a plan for a stadium in Miami, and the owners of teams in New York, Los Angeles and Washington are in various stages of the same process.Advertisement"}

But its approach, said Julie Samuels, the executive director, will be to work early with city, state and federal officials on issues that affect tech companies, before laws are passed. Some broader issues like taxes, schools and affordable housing also help determine whether people want to work and live in a city.\u201cNew York is in a competition to be where start-ups are going to locate and bigger tech companies are going to grow second and third offices,\u201d Ms. Samuels said.The new organization arrives at a time when the path ahead for the local tech economy is uncertain. New York, it seems, has become fertile ground for start-ups, but has very few breakout winners.Silicon Valley venture firms suffered some of the biggest losses on those New York start-ups.Start-ups are inherently risky. That is why venture capital firms invest in a broad portfolio of companies, so a few winners can make up for the losers.In New York, it is not the setbacks that stand out as much as the scarcity of lucrative paydays \u2014 start-ups sold to the public or to other corporations for $1 billion or more.There have been a few over the years. In 2007, for example, Google paid $3.1 billion for DoubleClick, an online ad-serving service. In 2013, Yahoo bought Tumblr, a microblogging platform, for $1.1 billion. Last year, Etsy, an online marketplace for handmade and vintage goods, went public at a valuation of $1.8 billion, and traded above that for a while but has since retreated.Yet those are exceptions. \u201cBig exits really haven\u2019t happened yet in New York,\u201d said Fred Wilson, co-founder of Union Square Ventures, a New York venture capital firm. \u201cIt\u2019s a valid criticism.\u201dThat should gradually change, he argued, as the New York tech community matures. Mr. Wilson also said that New York entrepreneurs were influenced by the trading culture of Wall Street. They are more inclined, he said, to build a company, sell it, cash in and move to the next one than some Silicon Valley entrepreneurs who dream bigger and view their company as their life\u2019s work.New York ranked second over all, but was way behind by some measures. Compass estimated the value of all Bay Area start-ups \u2014 including sales to companies, public offerings and private valuations \u2014 at $264 billion to $323 billion. The comparable estimate for New York start-ups was $41 billion to $50 billion.Still, the New York tech economy has shown impressive job growth. An analysis by Jason Bram, a researcher at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, concluded that from 2007 to 2015 New York tech employment grew by more than 60 percent, to 126,170 workers. By contrast, tech employment in the Bay Area was more than 370,000 as of 2014, the most recent figure in the Fed analysis.The gap is hardly surprising, given Silicon Valley\u2019s decades-long head start and singular focus. \u201cTechnology innovation and entrepreneurship \u2014 that\u2019s our business in the Valley,\u201d said Steve Blank, an entrepreneur who lectures on technology and innovation at Stanford, Columbia and New York University.In New York, Mr. Blank said, \u201ctech start-ups have been layered on top of the city\u2019s existing industries,\u201d including advertising, media and finance.And tech giants like Facebook, Google and IBM have been aggressively hiring engineering talent for their New York outposts.Nathan Richardson, chief executive of Trade It, a financial technology start-up in New York, has worked in the Bay Area and in New York. Until recently, New York was regarded in Silicon Valley as a place to find business, advertising and web design talent.\u201cBut you didn\u2019t recruit engineers in New York,\u201d Mr. Richardson said. \u201cThat\u2019s changed dramatically.\u201dSprinklr works closely with the New York advertising and marketing community. \u201cWe\u2019re an ideal company to be here,\u201d said Ragy Thomas, its founder and chief executive. His start-up has raised $125 million in venture funding and is valued at $1 billion.So Infor was destined to relocate, and since it had hundreds of developers in the Bay Area, the board assumed the move would be there. \u201cThey thought I was crazy choosing New York, but they went along with it,\u201d recalled Mr. Phillips, once a senior executive at Oracle.New York, he figured, was closer to many of its corporate customers, making in-person meetings more convenient. And because Infor\u2019s software was being overhauled for ease of use, he has hired software developers from New York advertising companies and fashion houses as well as the Parsons School of Design and the Fashion Institute of Technology.\u201cWe\u2019ve picked up some great programmers who understand design,\u201d Mr. Phillips said. \u201cAnd I wanted my engineers to be around people who weren\u2019t all engineers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Political Battles Color Congressional Feud Over Zika Funding", "Date": "2016-05-24", "News": "Supported byCongressional memoWASHINGTON \u2014 The feud on Capitol Hill over responding to the rapidly spreading Zika virus would seem to be largely a fight over how much money is needed to fight the mosquito-borne scourge.But lurking just beneath the surface are issues that have long stirred partisan mistrust, including Republicans\u2019 fears about the use of taxpayer money for abortion and possible increased use of contraception, and Democratic worries about protecting the environment from potentially dangerous pesticides.Public health officials warn that the virus will not stop to check party affiliation \u2014 the mosquitoes that carry it bite Republicans and Democrats alike.\u201cThis is no way to fight an epidemic,\u201d Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday.\u201cThree months is an eternity for control of an outbreak,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThere is a narrow window of opportunity here and it\u2019s closing. Every day that passes makes it harder to stop Zika.\u201dThe ancillary political issues have added an extra layer of complication that could further delay a final agreement on legislation to provide emergency funds to fight the virus, which can cause severe birth defects in infants born to infected mothers.The White House first requested $1.9 billion to fight Zika in February. But only last week, the Senate approved a measure that would provide $1.1 billion in emergency funds, and the House approved legislation that would reallocate $622 million from existing programs, including efforts to combat Ebola.While the House and Senate proposals remain to be reconciled, a new front in the fight emerged Tuesday as the House approved a Republican bill that would strip away environmental regulations on an array of pesticides.Obama administration officials have threatened to veto the bill, which they say is simply a repackaging of legislation first proposed in 2005 to make it seem related to the Zika virus.\u201cRebranding legislation that removes important Clean Water Act protections for public health and water quality is not an appropriate avenue for addressing the serious threat to the nation that the Zika virus poses,\u201d a White House statement said.For their part, House Republicans have accused the administration of putting up political roadblocks.\u201cIn the midst of a Zika threat, the federal government should not be making it harder for people to kill the mosquitoes that could carry it,\u201d Speaker Paul D. Ryan\u2019s office said in a statement. \u201cThis is serious stuff. We\u2019re not talking about annoyances at your summer barbecue. Mosquitoes are the carriers of life-threatening exotic diseases, among which are the Zika and West Nile viruses.\u201dWhy scientists are worried about the growing epidemic and its effects on pregnant women, and how to avoid the infection.Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, had also proposed language easing the regulations on pesticides in an alternative measure on Zika funding, but that proposal was defeated.\u201cWe had a provision in the Cornyn amendment that dealt with these regulatory restrictions on use of certain types of pesticides and programs that are used,\u201d said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, who is also part of the Republican leadership.\u201cWe just think we ought to provide some relief,\u201d Mr. Thune said. \u201cRight now more than ever, the key until we get a vaccine is to try and make sure that people don\u2019t get infected, and the way to do that is to eradicate mosquitoes. I mean, that\u2019s what carries the disease.\u201dCongressional Democrats and administration officials said that exceptions to the regulations already exist for emergency situations like fighting Zika, and they accused Republicans of trying to exploit fears about the virus to repeal regulations they have long opposed.\u201cOver the years, proponents of exempting pesticide spraying from the Clean Water Act have used the crisis of the day as the reason to support their legislation,\u201d Representatives Peter A. DeFazio, Democrat of Oregon, and Grace F. Napolitano, Democrat of California, wrote in a letter urging colleagues to oppose the Republican bill.\u201cFirst, it was the threat of West Nile virus, then it was fire suppression in the West, then it was protecting the nation\u2019s food supply and drought, and now, in 2016, the focus is on preventing Zika,\u201d they wrote.Environmental regulations are hardly the only partisan sidelight in the debate over how to respond to the Zika virus. Because the virus can cause severe birth defects in babies of infected mothers, Republicans have had concerns that taxpayer funds might somehow be used to help provide abortions.As a precaution, Senate Republicans insisted on writing language into their measure on Zika financing that reiterated the Hyde Amendment \u2014 a provision named for the longtime Illinois congressman Henry Hyde that bans the use of government money for abortions.That amendment would automatically apply because the Zika measure was attached to a regular appropriations bill, but Republicans said they wanted to be sure the language was included regardless of the legislative form used.There has also been debate about whether the government should stress contraception or abstinence in public education campaigns about how the Zika virus can be transmitted even more readily by sexual intercourse than by mosquitoes. That question is of potentially heightened concern among conservative Christians not only in the United States, but also in Latin American countries where the virus is already prevalent.Congressional Republicans have not openly criticized any emphasis on the effectiveness and importance of contraception. But unlike the Senate measure, the House bill does not include money for community health programs that might stress such prevention. Instead, the House bill directs its money to mosquito control and vaccine development.Federal health officials have emphasized that they do not believe it is the government\u2019s role to tell women if they should become pregnant, but have noted that even Pope Francis has said that it is acceptable to use contraception to prevent Zika\u2019s spread.Even some Republicans said they worried that these other issues were distractions from the urgent need to appropriate money and fight the Zika virus. And the closer the virus is to their states, the more urgent they sound.\u201cWe can have those side debates if people want to have them, make their points on it,\u201d said Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida. \u201cBut this is a public health crisis and we have got to address it, or people are going to get really sick here.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Shaken, Taliban Begin Effort to Replace Dead Leader, Mullah Mansour", "Date": "2016-05-24", "News": "Supported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 For the second time in less than a year, senior Taliban leaders have convened in the Pakistani city of Quetta to deliberate how to replace a dead supreme leader.Taliban spokesmen and commanders were happy to jump on the phone last summer, first to reject news of Mullah Omar\u2019s death and then to project an image of unity behind Mullah Mansour. This time, there has been mostly silence. Several commanders and participants who could still be reached said the days of heedless cellphone communication in Baluchistan were gone \u2014 another casualty of the American drone strike that some officials said was aided by Mullah Mansour\u2019s repeated use of a small collection of phones.But the options being discussed with no clear successor suggest it will be a turbulent process that will involve the crucial question of who controls the vast finance networks developed by Mullah Mansour over several years, including extensive opium profits.\u201cIf it turns out true that he is dead, we will be sad,\u201d said Qari Fasihuddin, the Taliban shadow governor of Badakhshan Province, emphasizing that Mullah Mansour\u2019s death had still not been confirmed by the Taliban. \u201cBut it is true that Mullah Mansour did not reach leadership with consensus, and this could be a moment for the leadership to solve those problems.\u201dOthers were alarmed by a new sense of vulnerability for the Taliban leadership.\u201cSince we heard the incident with Mullah Mansour, it is really affecting our thoughts and we are feeling frustrated,\u201d said Mullah Shafiullah, a Taliban commander from the Musa Qala district in Helmand Province. \u201cThe Taliban were almost repaired from the serious blow of losing our supreme leader Mullah Omar, and now another big loss. It is becoming risky, and we need to make a stand to protect our leaders.\u201dMullah Abdul Sattar Sirat, a commander in Shahid-Hasas district of Oruzgan Province, was even more pessimistic: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find good leaders who will manage to unite the Taliban.\u201dThe commanders said the core leadership of the Taliban has held several rounds of inconclusive discussions in Quetta since Sunday, including at the home of Mullah Haibatullah, a deputy to Mullah Mansour who was described as having emerged as a guiding voice in the succession.Unlike Mullah Mansour\u2019s quick confirmation, which led many Taliban leaders to see it as rigged and even a coup, commanders said they expect this process to be lengthy, with wider consultations.Several field commanders reached by phone said they had received calls from the leadership in Pakistan asking about their preferred candidates. One commander in northern Afghanistan, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss detailed planning, said three representatives from their front had been called to Pakistan for a gathering scheduled for the end of May.Familiar names were among the figures being discussed for the leadership, including the former Taliban military chief Mullah Qayum Zakir; the founding leader\u2019s son, Mullah Muhammad Yaqoub; and the movement\u2019s current deputy and operational leader, Sirajuddin Haqqani. Another figure described as an outside possibility was Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradur, formerly an influential deputy to Mullah Omar who had a falling out with Pakistani intelligence operatives and is said to remain under house arrest.Commanders said that Mullah Yaqoub was widely seen as a possible unifying candidate, with his bloodline outweighing his relative lack of experience. A recent graduate of religious studies who is believed to be in his mid- or late 20s, Mullah Yaqoub at first revolted against Mullah Mansour\u2019s claim to the leadership last summer. He only recently pledged loyalty, after being named a military commander with authority in 15 Afghan provinces.Mr. Haqqani has been closely identified with this year\u2019s aggressive Taliban offensive in Afghanistan, and has a history of effective operations planning and fund-raising as leader of the Haqqani militant network. But he was only integrated into the Taliban\u2019s core leadership last year, and he may struggle to find supporters among a mostly southern-Afghan band of commanders. He is also seen as close to Pakistan\u2019s military intelligence apparatus, and that may now count against him.\u201cSirajuddin\u2019s expertise in complex military operations, coupled with the finance networks Mansour developed and the support from Pakistan, would make a dangerous mix,\u201d said Rahmatullah Nabil, the former Afghan intelligence chief. \u201cBut he will struggle to gain the support of the southern Taliban.\u201dMullah Zakir and Mullah Baradur were described as having longer shots at the leadership. Mullah Zakir\u2019s network of commanders in the Taliban was undermined \u2014 and in some cases eliminated \u2014 by Mullah Mansour, who saw him as a direct rival to his ascent, Afghan officials say.Mullah Baradur, who continues to enjoy influence among the Taliban because he was a close lieutenant of Mullah Omar, would most likely be hampered by Pakistani military officials who have kept him under house arrest. Some saw the discussion of his rise mostly as another way to lash out at Pakistan.Whoever emerges as the leader will have to win over Mullah Mansour\u2019s money men, who are largely from his Ishaqzai tribe. They are led by Mullah Gul Agha Ishaqzai, who is said to be in charge of gathering taxes for the Taliban, including the income from the lucrative narcotics trade.When Mullah Mansour faced a revolt in his first days as leader, he arranged a meeting with about 40 narcotics smugglers outside Quetta, according to Afghan intelligence reports. Present in the meeting, and one of its supposed organizers, was Mullah Gul Agha. Mullah Mansour was reported to have raised more than $20 million during that meeting, as well as an allotment of pickup trucks that he then dished out to placate angry Taliban commanders.The Ishaqzai contingent in the Taliban is not happy with the two emerging leading candidates \u2014 Mullah Yaqoub and Mr. Haqqani \u2014 and would instead want to see Mullah Gul Agha in the top job, said Mullah Sallam Haqqani, a Taliban commander in Quetta. But Mullah Haqqani said he saw Gul Agha\u2019s chances as slim.As discussions continued, the Taliban leadership also faced another problem: what to do with Mullah Mansour\u2019s body, described in a Pakistani hospital post-mortem as badly charred and missing half his head.Even the location of the body was in question. Taliban commanders and hospital sources said the corpse was received by a nephew of Mullah Mansour soon after it arrived at the civil hospital in Quetta. But Pakistan\u2019s interior minister, Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, said at a news conference Tuesday that the Pakistani authorities wanted to conduct DNA tests for verification.Mujib Mashal reported from Kabul, and Taimoor Shah from Kandahar, Afghanistan. Salman Masood and Ihsanullah Tipu Mehsud contributed reporting from Islamabad, Pakistan, and Zia ur-Rehman from Karachi.Advertisement"}

Hatch of Utah, and the majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, into defending Mr. Trump, giving Democrats a legislative rallying point.But Mr. McConnell and Mr. Hatch, as leaders of the majority, are likely to ignore the bill.\u201cSince the days of Watergate, the American people have had an expectation that nominees to be the leader of the free world not hide their finances and personal tax returns,\u201d Mr. Wyden said in a statement.Current polls show an uphill battle for Donald Trump should he and Hillary Clinton face off in the general election.\u201cTax returns deliver honest answers to key questions from the American public,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you even pay taxes? Do you give to charity? Are you abusing tax loopholes at the expense of middle-class families? Are you keeping your money offshore?

{"Headline": "Senate to Consider 3 Proposals to Finance Fight Against Zika", "Date": "2016-05-12", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate next week will vote on three proposals for financing to combat the mosquito-borne Zika virus, which causes birth defects and which public health officials say will soon pose a major threat in the southern United States.Democrats and Republicans have been deadlocked over a request by the White House for $1.9 billion in emergency financing to combat the virus, with the Obama administration sharply criticizing Republican Congressional leaders for stalling and the lawmakers demanding that the White House better explain how it would use the money.Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, on Thursday initiated procedural steps to take votes on a proposal that would grant the Obama administration\u2019s full $1.9 billion request as well as two other measures that would provide $1.1 billion.The administration first requested the emergency money in February, but was rebuffed by congressional Republican leaders who urged it to redirect $510 million previously allocated to fight Ebola \u2014 a move that was made last month.Public health officials, however, had warned that the reallocated Ebola money was insufficient \u2014 and that some of it was still needed for its original purpose.The full $1.9 billion proposal, favored by Democrats, is expected to fail, but Republicans seem willing to support a $1.1 billion version that would provide the money without corresponding cuts to other government spending \u2014 a compromise negotiated by Senators Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, and Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington.The third version, which would include corresponding cuts to offset the cost of fighting Zika virus, is expected to be opposed fiercely by Democrats. Even if the Senate approves one of the measures, a continuing battle looms in the House, where there is even stronger resistance to government spending by some Republicans.Ms. Murray issued a statement on Thursday applauding the progress toward approving at least some money, while still urging that Congress approve the full $1.9 billion. \u201cI continue to urge my colleagues to support the president\u2019s full request, but I am very encouraged that Democrats and Republicans will be able to come together with a strong step forward to help ensure families across the country are prepared to respond to this emergency,\u201d Ms. Murray said.The Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, however, issued a statement blasting Republicans for their inaction and insisting that $1.1 billion would not be sufficient, calling it a \u201cpaltry Band-Aid.\u201dMr. Reid warned that any delay could result in children in the United States being born with severe brain defects.Mr. McConnell\u2019s move came after Senate Democrats cooperated in adopting the first regular appropriations bill of the year, a $37.5 billion measure for energy and water programs. The proposals that Mr. McConnell has scheduled for votes next week are amendments to the second appropriations bill, for transportation and housing programs, which is now the pending business on the Senate floor.If the Zika financing remains part of that legislation it would not be available for expenditure until the next fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. Democrats and the White House say the money is needed sooner.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is the Era of Great Famines Over?", "Date": "2016-05-08", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed Contributor8 PhotosADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia \u2014 The worst drought in three decades has left almost 20 million Ethiopians \u2014 one-fifth of the population \u2014 desperately short of food. And yet the country\u2019s mortality rate isn\u2019t expected to increase: In other words, Ethiopians aren\u2019t starving to death.I\u2019ve studied famine and humanitarian relief for more than 30 years, and I wasn\u2019t prepared for what I saw during a visit to Ethiopia last month. As I traveled through northern and central provinces, I saw imported wheat being brought to the smallest and most remote villages, thanks to a new Chinese-built railroad and a fleet of newly imported trucks. Water was delivered to places where wells had run dry. Malnourished children were being treated in properly staffed clinics.Compare that to the aftermath of the 1984 drought, which killed at least 600,000 people, caused the economy to shrink by nearly 14 percent and turned the name \u201cEthiopia\u201d into a synonym for shriveled, glazed-eyed children on saline drips.How did Ethiopia go from being the world\u2019s symbol of mass famines to fending off starvation? Thanks partly to some good fortune, but mostly to peace, greater transparency and prudent planning. Ethiopia\u2019s success in averting another disaster is confirmation that famine is elective because, at its core, it is an artifact and a tool of political repression.In 1984, the rains failed in the midst of a civil war, pitting the military regime headed by Mengistu Haile Mariam against rebels in the northern province of Tigray and neighboring Eritrea. When food ran short, Mengistu\u2019s government blocked trade, bombed markets and withheld emergency supplies in rebel-controlled areas.The suffering that ensued elicited a vast outpouring of generosity from the West, brought about in part by the Live Aid concerts. But all that charity was no more than a Band-Aid, as even its instigator, the musician Bob Geldof, observed at the time. That was because war was destroying Ethiopia\u2019s rural economy, and food aid was being redirected from civilians to soldiers and government militias.In 1987, as the famine was receding, a group of researchers and I went to Tigray on a mission for Oxfam to study local food markets. We reached a simple conclusion: When farmers could bring foodstuffs to points of sale \u2014 when the roads were clear of army checkpoints, when markets were held at night to reduce the risk of being bombed \u2014 the local economy worked efficiently enough. With markets in operation, the production of local crops increased, and food prices fell to levels people could afford.Ending famine required ending fighting.The Mengistu regime collapsed in 1991. Under the government of Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, a former guerrilla turned advocate of rapid economic growth, Ethiopia enjoyed internal peace for the first time in a generation. There were localized droughts but no famines \u2014 with one notable exception.In 1999, food shortages in the southeastern part of the country killed 29,000 people. What could have just been a crisis devolved into disaster because the government was at war with Eritrea along its northern border, and foreign donors, appalled that the government would spend its meager resources on fighting, were slow to provide food aid.A major drought in 2002 caused hunger nationwide. But the following year, when I traveled with a team from the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund to stricken areas in Wollo (north), Hararghe (east) and Sidama and Wollaita (south), we didn\u2019t see the telltale canvas tents of emergency distribution centers. A vast relief effort mounted by the government and international agencies was managing to deliver at least some food to many villages, and so people were staying at home.Some people were still going hungry, for sure, and in the worst cases children were starving, but in far smaller numbers than in the past. Our survey of child survival rates also found that outside these pockets of starvation, mortality rates weren\u2019t rising relative to non-drought years.By 2015, when El Ni\u00f1o brought the worst drought in decades, Ethiopia was better prepared than ever. In the intervening decade, the government had begun programs to help families facing food shortages with various forms of food and cash assistance. It had taken measures to mitigate the effects of droughts, rehabilitating water catchments, reforesting and building roads and clinics, especially in the countryside.The government also had money on hand. Ethiopia is a petroleum importer, and the central bank had set aside nearly $1 billion in case oil prices rose, Finance Minister Abdulaziz Mohammed told me. But instead oil prices had plummeted, and within a few months of the drought hitting, the government had spent some $300 million on emergency relief, with more to come.The economy will take a hit. Animals are dying of thirst, and the livelihoods of families that rely on sheep or cattle are being wiped out. The International Monetary Fund forecasts that the G.D.P. growth rate will drop to about 8.5 percent in 2015 and 2016, down from more than 10 percent in 2014. But that\u2019s still 8.5 percent, an impressive figure. And people aren\u2019t dying.Some risks remain. Ethiopia\u2019s early-warning system is designed to detect and respond to drought in farming areas, rather than, say, small cities. Urbanization, dislocation and other economic changes are happening faster than the government\u2019s prevention and relief measures can adapt.But these challenges are manageable, so long as there is the political will to manage them. Grimly certain that droughts will recur \u2014 and when there won\u2019t be an oil contingency fund to tap \u2014 Mr. Mohammed has opened talks with the World Bank to devise a national drought insurance plan. This is a sensible move.It\u2019s also evidence that after countries have passed a certain threshold of prosperity and development, peace, political liberalization and greater government accountability are the best safeguards against famine. There is no record of people dying of famine in a democracy.Nearly 115 million people died of starvation between 1870 and 1980, almost 90 percent of them as a result of imperial conquest, great wars or repression under totalitarian regimes, according to an analysis we conducted at the World Peace Foundation. Since then, with the end of major international conflicts and at least some measure of democratization across much of the world, starvation has receded.So is the era of great famines finally over? Let\u2019s just say it could be. Famine isn\u2019t caused by overpopulation, and as Ethiopia\u2019s experience shows, it\u2019s not a necessary consequence of drought. Politics creates famine, and politics can stop it. Alex de Waal is the executive director of the World Peace Foundation at Tufts University.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Impeachment of Dilma Rousseff Is Debated by Brazil\u2019s Senate After Months of Chaos", "Date": "2016-05-11", "News": "Supported byBRAS\u00cdLIA \u2014 After months of tirades, secret maneuvering and legal appeals, Brazil\u2019s Senate began debating on Wednesday whether to impeach President Dilma Rousseff, suspend her from office and put her on trial.The debate, followed by a vote as late as Thursday morning, is a watershed in the power struggle consuming Brazil, a country that experienced a rare stretch of stability over the last two decades as it strengthened its economy and achieved greater prominence on the world stage.If she is suspended and put on trial, she would become the second of Brazil\u2019s four elected presidents to be removed from office since democracy was re-established in the mid-1980s after a long dictatorship.Dilma Rousseff, Brazil\u2019s president, is facing removal from office. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the proceedings.\u201cPlainly said, this is the worst crisis in our history, with its combination of economic calamity, discredited politics and the violation of the lowest ethical standards,\u201d Boris Fausto, a Brazilian historian, told reporters this month while summing up the country\u2019s grim mood.\u201cTemer is what we\u2019ve got,\u201d Mr. Fausto said. \u201cI hope he\u2019ll be up to the difficult and often highly unpopular tasks ahead of him.\u201dFixing the economy, which may require adopting unpopular austerity measures, is just one of the challenges facing Mr. Temer, 75, a lawyer and career politician who kept a low profile as vice president.But the impasse between Ms. Rousseff and her rivals has kept the government in Bras\u00edlia distracted from these problems, exposing the political establishment to withering scrutiny around the country.Ms. Rousseff, an operative in a guerrilla group in her youth, is accused of using money from public banks to cover deficits, masking budget shortfalls in Brazil\u2019s giant federal bureaucracy. She contends that her predecessors enacted similar policies and that the effort to oust her amounts to a coup.Still, Ms. Rousseff is rare among top politicians in Brazil in that she has not faced accusations of illegally enriching herself. An array of figures in her Workers\u2019 Party are either in jail or under investigation on charges of graft, dealing a blow to the legitimacy of a party that had vowed to end such practices.But fears are growing at the prospect of a government assembled by Mr. Temer. If Ms. Rousseff and the Workers\u2019 Party shift into the opposition, they will most likely claim her ouster was illegal, and Mr. Temer\u2019s top allies remain mired in corruption scandals as well.Several of his top advisers are under investigation, including Romero Juc\u00e1, a senator from Roraima State in the Amazon, and Geddel Vieira Lima, a former executive at one of Brazil\u2019s largest public banks. Mr. Temer has insisted that those inquiries would not prevent him from naming the advisers to his cabinet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brazil Workers\u2019 Party, Leaders \u2018Intoxicated by Power,\u2019 Falls From Grace", "Date": "2016-05-12", "News": "Supported byBRAS\u00cdLIA \u2014 From its earliest days as a scrappy band of Marxists defying Brazil\u2019s military rulers, the Workers\u2019 Party grew to become one of world\u2019s most enduring leftist movements \u2014 an electoral powerhouse that dominated the nation\u2019s politics for more than a decade.\u201cThe Workers\u2019 Party was a party of hope, but its leaders got intoxicated by power, and now that hope has been dashed,\u201d said H\u00e9lio Bicudo, 93, an early member of the party and a former legislator who defected in 2005.Mr. da Silva has yet to be charged with a crime, but federal prosecutors are investigating his role in a scheme that involved funneling money from the national oil company into the Workers\u2019 Party campaign coffers.An array of top allies of Mr. da Silva, including senior members of the party, have been imprisoned or are under investigation for their involvement in the scheme, which distributed billions of dollars in bribes to figures across the political spectrum.Even in a nation inured to systemic corruption, the fall of a party once devoted to transparency and clean government has deepened mistrust of politics.It also threatens to upend some of the accomplishments of the party, a political juggernaut that even critics concede helped ease the crushing poverty and economic disparity that has long plagued this nation of 200 million.\u201cThat the Workers\u2019 Party sullied itself by getting involved in all this corruption, this is a tragedy, maybe the major tragedy of what is happening today,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Murilo de Carvalho, a historian.In recent weeks, more than 130 mayors who won office on the Workers\u2019 Party ticket have switched parties, and nearly 30 deputies in the lower house of Congress, roughly half of its caucus, have suggested they might do the same, according to tallies in the Brazilian news media.Other parties took part in the graft scheme. But emboldened by Ms. Rousseff\u2019s political demise, her opponents in the legislature are working to reverse some of her party\u2019s hallmarks, including stringent environmental rules, protections for indigenous Brazilians in the Amazon and laws criminalizing abusive work conditions on cattle ranches.Jan Rocha, an author of the book \u201cBrazil Under the Workers\u2019 Party,\u201d said such efforts, if successful, could stoke class divisions and provoke a violent backlash from disenfranchised Brazilians who stand to lose the most from a rollback of the party\u2019s policies.\u201cThe Workers\u2019 Party represented an attempt to change the political landscape in Brazil and give a voice to all the millions of Brazilians who never had a voice,\u201d she said. \u201cThey lifted millions of people out of poverty, but Brazil still has an awfully long way to go before becoming an equitable society.\u201dMarked by greed, betrayal and the quest for ever-greater power, the party\u2019s fall from grace has all the elements of a Shakespearean tragedy.Its main protagonist is Mr. da Silva, 70, who worked as a shoeshine boy before landing a job at a screw factory. From there, he rose to the presidency and oversaw an economic boom.Starting in the 1970s, he helped transform a ragtag collection of labor activists, liberal Roman Catholic clergy members and idealistic students into a formidable political movement that stood up to the country\u2019s military leaders.Formed in 1980, the Workers\u2019 Party eschewed strict Marxist dogma and embraced a democratic process for electing its leaders.Mr. da Silva ran for office with the slogan \u201cLand, labor and freedom.\u201dBy the late 1980s, the party\u2019s candidates were winning elections. In 1986, Mr. da Silva was elected to Congress and, two years later, a Workers\u2019 Party candidate won the mayoralty of S\u00e3o Paulo, the country\u2019s largest city. Mr. da Silva then set his sights on the presidency.Universally referred to by the nickname Lula, he was an unlikely political figure whose unpolished syntax and leftist rhetoric rattled the Brazilian elite. But in 1998, after three unsuccessful bids for president, Mr. da Silva changed his strategy. He traded his T-shirts for tailored suits and jettisoned talk of revolutionary change, saying he would honor the $250 billion in foreign debt that was then hobbling the Brazilian economy.His new slogan: \u201cLula, Peace and Love.\u201dFor former party stalwarts like Idelber Avelar, the breaking point came when Mr. da Silva began to dole out patronage posts and form alliances with opposition party bosses who did not share the Workers\u2019 Party\u2019s ideals.\u201cIt represented everything that the party had been fighting against,\u201d said Mr. Avelar, an academic who now lives in the United States. \u201cThere were a number of options, but the early choice was made for the politics of making deals behind closed doors.\u201dApparently unchastened by their brush with scandal, Workers\u2019 Party officials were secretly engaged in a huge kickback scheme with executives at Petrobras, the state-owned energy giant. The arrangement involved skimming off billions of dollars from an oil boom and diverting the money to the Workers\u2019 Party and its coalition partners in Congress.The scandal has shaken the country\u2019s political establishment, with dozens of business executives and party leaders imprisoned or under investigation.Some of Mr. da Silva\u2019s closest aides are among the fallen, but he has insisted he was unaware of the arrangement.\u201cOur greatest achievements were to raise 36 million people out of poverty and elevate 40 million others into the middle class,\u201d Mr. da Silva said in an email this week. \u201cWe remain a party that cares about the poor and about social justice.\u201dUnless he is charged with a crime, many political analysts still expect Mr. da Silva to run for president in two years.\u201cIn Brazilian politics, you can never throw someone under the bus and think they won\u2019t recover,\u201d said Alfred P. Montero, the author of the book \u201cBrazil: Reversal of Fortune\u201d and a professor at Carleton College. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching these guys since the \u201980s, and they always seem to come back.\u201dDilma Rousseff, Brazil\u2019s president, is facing removal from office. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the proceedings.Experts say that despite its current tribulations, the Workers\u2019 Party, with its 500,000 active members, will remain a potent force in Brazilian politics for years to come. The impeachment crisis, some say, may spur a period of introspection that could help reinvigorate the party.\u201cThe Workers\u2019 Party is heading back to the opposition, which perhaps is just what the doctor ordered,\u201d Mr. Montero said.For now, the Workers\u2019 Party faithful are engaged in soul-searching. Did the party abandon its ideals in the heady rush of power? Or were its leaders adapting to a flawed, entrenched system?Lincoln Secco, a professor of contemporary history at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo and an early party member, said Mr. da Silva made a fateful error during his first months in power by not seeking to push through difficult political changes, including an overhaul of a campaign finance system that is heavily reliant on corporate donors.\u201cIf the party doesn\u2019t confront the political system, there is no other way to govern in Brazil than to enter into rotten alliances,\u201d he said. \u201cThey chose the easier way.\u201dDespite the disillusionment, millions of Brazilians still hold great affection for the party, especially those who have benefited from the many social welfare programs put into place during the tenures of Mr. da Silva and Ms. Rousseff. They include a monthly stipend to the nation\u2019s poorest residents and programs that allowed millions of people to attend college for the first time.Milton Nunes Sobrinho, 53, a doorman in S\u00e3o Paulo, credits the party with helping him obtain steady work; buy a used car; and move his family out of a rat-infested shack, thanks to a federally subsidized loan program that produced 2.6 million new homeowners over the past decade.\u201cEverything they promised, they did,\u201d Mr. Sobrinho said. \u201cAll the progress we\u2019ve experienced in our lives is because of them.\u201dAsked about party\u2019s troubles, he shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s all a political game,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd next time, I\u2019ll definitely be voting for the candidate from the Workers\u2019 Party.\u201dAn article on May 13 about the sagging fortunes of the Workers\u2019 Party of Brazil, whose standard-bearer, President Dilma Rousseff, was suspended by the Brazilian Senate, misstated the amount of foreign debt that was hobbling the Brazilian economy in 1998, when Ms. Rousseff\u2019s mentor, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, ran for president. It was $250 billion, not $250 million.Paula Moura contributed reporting from Bras\u00edlia, and Vinod Sreeharsha from Rio de Janeiro.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Selling Bottled Water That\u2019s Better for the Planet", "Date": "2016-04-30", "News": "Supported byOn a recent morning over avocado toast and world-renowned New York City tap water, Grace Jeon expounded on the virtues of public drinking water. Considering that the company she runs makes its money selling bottled water, her enthusiasm might have seemed a little strange. And in fact, she follows a decidedly odd business model.Ms. Jeon held up one of her company\u2019s bright blue opaque bottles, which are made mostly of paper, not plastic. \u201cI would never advocate drinking this over tap,\u201d Ms. Jeon said. But the reality is that more consumers are moving to bottled water as they cut down on drinking sugary beverages, she said. Her company has positioned its bottled water, called Just Water, as the next best thing to tap.Despite serious problems in places like Flint, Mich., and in the schools of Newark, N.J., and other cities, most tap water in the United States is safe to drink, according to environmental groups and the government. But many consumers prefer the convenience of bottled water, and are willing to pay for it.As Ms. Jeon sees it, she is making the best of a bad situation. The paper used for her bottles is sourced from trees that have been certified by the Forest Stewardship Council. The bottles, which are fully recyclable, are made of 53 percent paper; the rest of the bottle is made of plastic and a small amount of aluminum. Last month, Just Water released a new bottle with the top portion made of plant-based plastic derived from sugar cane. All told, she said, her product is less harmful to the environment and creates fewer carbon emissions than energy-intensive plastic.In the process, she is also helping the struggling city of Glens Falls, N.Y., about 20 miles from Saratoga Springs.What the city does have is water \u2014 four reservoirs and over 5,000 acres of watershed property. Just Water has an arrangement with the city to purchase water for at least six times the residential rate. Some of the money from the water purchase goes back to the community to address its aging water infrastructure, which is over 100 years old.Just Water does not obtain its water from that infrastructure; rather, it uses a well on the city\u2019s watershed property. It packages the water in a converted Catholic church that stood empty for years. The company employs 11 local residents.Tetra Pak, a food packaging and processing company, creates the Just Water packaging and ships the containers flat to Glens Falls, where they are shaped and filled.When Just Water first asked the mayor, Jack Diamond, about sourcing and bottling water in his city, he initially thought the offer was too good to be true. When he has been approached by companies in the past, in general, \u201cit\u2019s not so much what they\u2019re going to do for us, but what can we do for them,\u201d he said. \u201cThe roles were reversed with this company.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a completely ridiculous product, but it\u2019s also a wildly popular product,\u201d said Charles Fishman, a journalist and author of \u201cThe Big Thirst: The Secret Life and Turbulent Future of Water.\u201d \u201cThe reason is, and I think this is often overlooked, people aren\u2019t buying water \u2014 they\u2019re buying convenience. And with the branding, to some degree they\u2019re also buying image.\u201dThe reason for bottled water \u201chas nothing to do with the availability of good, clean appealing water in the country. It has to do with how we live,\u201d Mr. Fishman said. \u201cIt has to do with the disappearance of good water fountains \u2014 with the failure, frankly, of water fountain companies to innovate cool, interesting, appealing water fountains.\u201dJust Water went on sale last fall in Whole Foods stores across the country and Cibo Express airport markets. The company recently started selling bottles at Albertsons, Safeway, Kroger, Sprouts Farmers Markets and other stores.The bottles retail for 99 cents for 16.9 fluid ounces. That compares with about $1.50 for a comparable bottle of Fiji water. Ms. Jeon was previously Fiji\u2019s senior vice president for business development.Fiji is positioned as a luxury product, referred to in company news releases as \u201ca natural, artesian water bottled at the source in Viti Levu (Fiji islands)\u201d and \u201cknown for its soft mouth feel and iconic square bottle loved by discerning consumers, well-known celebrities and quality-conscious chefs.\u201dDoes water from different areas taste different? Some consumers swear that it does. Others, like Mr. Fishman, are skeptical: \u201cThere is no distinction, no matter what the people at all these places will tell you.\u201dMs. Jeon said she thought she had left the bottled water industry for good when Drew Fitzgerald, the founder of Just Water, approached her with his idea to make everyday packaged items more environmentally friendly, starting with bottled water. He has an eclectic r\u00e9sum\u00e9. He worked as the creative director for Universal Records, has worked with the Will and Jada Smith Family Foundation and is an adviser to Prime, an organization that helps foundations and wealthy families finance technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. And as it turns out, Mr. Fitzgerald\u2019s hometown is Glens Falls.It\u2019s true that water from upstate New York may not be considered as glamorous as water from Fiji, but New York\u2019s requires less transportation \u2014 another environmental selling point for Just Water.\u201cThere are bigger issues to bottled water than just what the package is made out of,\u201d said Mae Wu, a staff lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council. These include the environmental costs of shipping water, the effects of removing water from communities and water bottle waste.Of course, water bottles can be recycled. \u201cAll bottled water containers are 100 percent recyclable and many bottled water companies are already using recycled plastic in their bottles,\u201d said Chris Hogan, a spokesman for the International Bottled Water Association, in an email. Some are making 100 percent recycled bottles, he added. \u201cAs an industry, we are always looking for ways to strengthen existing programs and help to expand recycling efforts ever further,\u201d he wrote.But although bottles and cartons may be made of recyclable packaging, this does not ensure that the product will be recycled. Recycling rates have risen recently, but in 2013, the most recent year for which data is available, just over 31 percent of plastic jars and water bottles were recycled, according to government data.Just Water isn\u2019t the only company offering an alternative to traditional bottled water. Boxed Water packages its water in a gable-top paper box, much like a milk carton. Fred Water delivers water in hard plastic flasks and encourages drinkers to reuse the bottles. Green Sheep offers consumers water in aluminum bottles, which is more readily recycled than plastic.Like Just Water, many of these companies say they are committed to improving the environment. \u201cWe recognized that although reusable bottles are the best choice from an environmental standpoint, the reality is that people keep buying bottled water,\u201d Nicole Doucet, the co-founder and chief executive of Green Sheep, said in an email. \u201cThere was already a perfect solution out there, but we needed a pragmatic one.\u201dTraditional beverage companies, such as Nestl\u00e9 Waters North America, are offering alternatives, too. In 2007, Nestl\u00e9 introduced its lightweight Eco-Shape bottle, which uses less plastic; a few years later the company began incorporating recycled plastic into its bottles. Nestl\u00e9, which includes brands such as Arrowhead, Deer Park and Poland Springs, made up 23 percent of water bottle sales last year, according to Euromonitor International, a consumer research company.\u201cBeverage trends have changed dramatically over the last 10 to 12 years,\u201d Nelson A. Switzer, Nestl\u00e9 Waters North America\u2019s vice president and chief sustainability officer, wrote in an email. \u201cWater \u2014 bottled and tap \u2014 has become the beverage of choice.\u201dJust Water and its competitors make up a much smaller percentage of the market. \u201cI think that we will continue to see bottled water in more environmentally friendly packaging,\u201d said Virginia Lee, senior beverages analyst at Euromonitor. \u201cHowever, I see this for the next five years as still being very niche.\u201d She cites cost and consumers\u2019 familiarity with traditional bottled water as factors.The alternatives may be able to succeed as the economy improves, she said: \u201cAs people have more money in their pocket it stands that they\u2019d be more willing to pay a little extra for water or something else that claimed to have environmental or other benefits.\u201dBut a better water bottle is still a water bottle, said Ms. Wu of the Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cI recognize that there is a role for bottled water,\u201d especially in emergencies like the one occurring in Flint, she said, but most tap water in the United States is safe.Some consumers have switched to reusable water bottles, many of which have become status symbols, like the stainless steel insulated bottles made by S\u2019well, and the glass bottles in colorful silicon sleeves sold by Bkr.Still, there are no signs that shoppers will be sipping less bottled water anytime soon. Sales have increased steadily over the last decade. The water bottle industry took in $19.8 billion in retail sales last year in the United States, according to Euromonitor.Ms. Jeon claimed she would rather see the tide go in the opposite direction. \u201cIt\u2019s not about getting more people to drink bottled water,\u201d she said. But if you\u2019re going to drink bottled water, she said, \u201cconsider a better option than the current choice.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Best Way to Help a Grandchild With College", "Date": "2016-05-27", "News": "Supported byRetiringA COLLEGE education \u2014 even at a highly rated private institution \u2014 was once regarded as a relatively affordable route to lifelong prosperity, but in recent years it has become a hobbling financial burden for many families.Sandra Schiff, who is retired and lives in Denver, has set up accounts for each of her eight grandchildren. She started funding the plans with her husband, Ronald. After running a successful wholesale plumbing business, they wanted to see their grandchildren graduate from college debt-free. At present, they have two recent graduates and two entering college.\u201cMy husband and I didn\u2019t go to college,\u201d Ms. Schiff said. \u201cBut we heard about this opportunity to fund 529 plans and thought it would be wonderful for our grandchildren.\u201dOne of the best vehicles for multigenerational college funding is a 529 college savings plan. Offered by states and managed by large mutual fund companies, these plans allow investment for future educational expenses, and the proceeds accumulate tax-free. Many states also provide a tax write-off for at least a portion of a contribution.But there are some potholes to avoid for those who hope to maximize the value of their contributions and minimize the total cost for a family of sending a student to college.Grandparents can set up these plans, naming grandchildren as beneficiaries. If the grandchildren decide not to go to college, the money can be kept in the accounts or used for another educational opportunity.Since the children do not control the account \u2014 the owners do \u2014 the assets are not in their names. That means if grandparents need to withdraw the assets for themselves, they can do so, although they must pay a penalty and income taxes if the assets are not used for educational purposes.While 529 plans are the prime vehicles of choice for many grandparents, they can complicate a child\u2019s chances of qualifying for financial aid. The stumbling block comes when students receive money from the 529 plan. That will appear as income in the student\u2019s name, which must be reported on the Fafsa, the form that most colleges require for financial aid when a student applies and every year he or she is in school.To avoid a potential reduction in aid, grandparents could postpone sending 529 proceeds until the last two years of college, suggests Gary E. Carpenter, a Syracuse-based certified public accountant and executive director of the National College Advocacy Group, a nonprofit focused on college financing.\u201cDistributions from grandparents\u2019 529 plans are seen as student income, and could reduce aid by 50 percent,\u201d he said. That means if a grandparent takes $10,000 out of a 529 plan to send to a grandchild, it could cut student aid by $5,000 the following year.\u201cPostponing the distribution until junior year would be a good idea,\u201d Mr. Carpenter said.Another strategy is for grandparents to give money directly to the parents. The reason it is important to avoid putting money in the students\u2019 names in the early years of college is that 20 percent of a student\u2019s assets are \u201cassessed\u201d in the federal formula, compared to only 5.64 percent of parental income and nonretirement assets. The more money that is in a child\u2019s name, the more it pares back the aid package.Although aid calculators provide ballpark estimates, a completed Fafsa provides applicants with the \u201cexpected family contribution,\u201d the bottom line for the family\u2019s total out-of-pocket expenses.The expected family contribution is a number that colleges use after the need for financial aid \u2014 based on the income and assets of the parents and student \u2014 is determined. Some colleges, mostly private ones, also look at home equity. Under the federal aid formula, retirement accounts such as 401(k)\u2019s, I.R.A.s and pensions are generally considered off limits for college funding.Sending money directly to the grandchild could increase the family\u2019s expected contribution. But the situation is much different if the family is unlikely to receive financial aid. Then, 529 proceeds and direct gifts from grandparents are possible options.\u201cGifting may be a better strategy if the family won\u2019t qualify for aid,\u201d notes Fred Amrein, a fee-only financial planner in Wynnewood, Pa., who specializes in college planning. \u201cGrandparents may want to pay college bills outright.\u201d Under federal laws, couples can give up to $28,000 a year before facing gift taxes.\u201cDirect payment to the college for tuition is an allowable exception to the annual limit,\u201d Mr. Amrein added. \u201cThis is only recommended if the family does not qualify for need-based financial aid.\u201dWhile direct giving is often a viable option for wealthy families, it will pay for someone fortunate enough to be in that situation to consider a more sophisticated financial planning strategy. Questions to consider include: Are estate issues a concern? Can securities be given to reap a tax advantage through stock or bond sales?When planning a multigenerational strategy, a fee-only financial planner who understands college aid, estate and tax laws can provide useful advice. Planners can provide a number of strategies that mesh with a person\u2019s estate planning, giving and portfolio objectives. These professionals can also discuss the best time to give.It is also helpful to check with a state\u2019s 529 program first when considering a dedicated account. States have a number of investment options, including prepaid tuition plans for state and private colleges. Collegesavings.org and savingforcollege.com have thorough overviews of what each plan has to offer.No matter which option is chosen for a grandchild, the parents will greatly appreciate the help.\u201cGrandparents have a natural inclination to spoil their grandchildren,\u201d said Young J. Boozer III, state treasurer of Alabama and chairman of the College Savings Plans Network. \u201cWhat better way to spoil them than with college savings? The gift will last much longer than a video game.\u201dContributions to 529 plans can be made in lieu of cash gifts for birthdays, holidays, a confirmation or a bar or bat mitzvah. They can be some of the most meaningful gifts ever, but they should start early to build up savings.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Is Set to Vote on 18 Bills to Address Opioid Addiction", "Date": "2016-05-11", "News": "House Republicans have scheduled votes this week on 18 bills aimed at addressing the scourge of opioid addiction that health experts and policy makers say has taken root across America.  The bills include measures intended to make it easier for doctors to treat patients addicted to opioids, as well as to give law enforcement officers greater authority to interdict drug trafficking. There are also measures that would offer greater protections for veterans and for children affected by the opioid epidemic, and that would require the federal government to conduct studies evaluating the nation\u2019s capacity for treating opioid addiction. Another measure requires a study of good Samaritan laws aimed at shielding from criminal or civil liability health care providers and law enforcement officials who help to treat opioid addicts with \u201coverdose reversal\u201d drugs. The House bills are expected to be approved and then packaged together, at which point they would need to be reconciled with similar legislation adopted in the Senate. Democrats have supported the effort by the Republican majorities in the House and Senate to combat the opioid epidemic, but they have also criticized Republicans for not attaching sufficient money to finance many of the programs called for in the legislation. Democrats have pushed for $600 million in emergency financing to support the anti-opioid provisions. In a memo to reporters, a spokeswoman for the House speaker, Paul D.

{"Headline": "For Gawker, Legal Issues Beyond Hogan", "Date": "2016-05-30", "News": "Supported byGawker Media\u2019s legal battle with Hulk Hogan over the publication of a sex tape has had wide-ranging impact.But Gawker\u2019s legal entanglements do not end with Hulk Hogan.The company has acknowledged facing lawsuits with plaintiffs ranging from an individual who claims he invented email to the website of the British tabloid The Daily Mail. Currently, Gawker Media is fighting five defamation-related lawsuits, according to a person who has been briefed on the company\u2019s legal situation but who spoke on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to discuss legal strategy. That does not include the invasion-of-privacy lawsuit brought by Hogan, whose real name is Terry G. Bollea; the company plans to appeal the verdict in that case.When asked about the lawsuits, Gawker issued a statement criticizing Mr. Thiel\u2019s \u201ctwisted scheme to destroy a news organization\u201d and demanded that he be transparent about which cases he was underwriting.\u201cWill he confirm that he\u2019s behind the other two cases (Ayyadurai and Terrill) that his lawyer, Charles Harder, is publicly handling?\u201d the statement read, referencing the cases of Shiva Ayyadurai, who says he invented email, and Ashley Terrill, a journalist who was the subject of a 2015 Gawker article chronicling her reported quest to gather information on a former Tinder executive. Mr. Harder is representing Mr. Ayyadurai and Ms. Terrill. Mr. Thiel has said that he is supporting other cases against Gawker, though he declined to disclose which ones.Ms. Terrill could not be reached for comment, but Mr. Ayyadurai said in an interview that he was not aware of Mr. Thiel being involved in his lawsuit. \u201cTo the best of my knowledge,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s no other third party involved.\u201dMost libel lawsuits are filed in state court, but because those court cases are not filed in a central location and many records are not available online, it is difficult to generate a reliable tally of lawsuits previously filed against Gawker or to compare them with the number of cases brought against other news organizations. The New York Times is currently facing two libel cases, one of them a pro se case \u2014 in which a plaintiff is self-represented \u2014 which it won but which is now being appealed.\u201cDefamation is a very idiosyncratic claim \u2014 people sue publishers all the time over true articles that bruise their feelings,\u201d Dave Heller, deputy director of the Media Law Resource Center, said in an email. \u201cSo it\u2019s not surprising that a publisher will face defamation suits \u2014 especially one like Gawker that\u2019s going to cover public figures in an irreverent way. So being sued may be a badge of honor \u2014 but if you start losing these cases you have to look in the mirror and ask whether you are failing the basics of journalism.\u201dMr. Heller cautioned that complaints against news organizations were not all necessarily legitimate. Pro se complaints, for example, tend to be nuisance suits that \u201cno lawyer would touch,\u201d he said. One of the defamation-related lawsuits Gawker currently faces is pro se, said the person who has been briefed on the company\u2019s legal situation.Mr. Ayyadurai said he hired Mr. Harder to pursue a lawsuit around the time of the March verdict in Mr. Bollea\u2019s case, calling it a \u201clucky\u201d coincidence that Mr. Harder was available after years of his looking for the right legal team.On May 10, Mr. Ayyadurai sued Gawker Media, Nick Denton, the company\u2019s founder and majority owner, and two Gawker journalists, John Cook and Sam Biddle. The complaint was filed in Massachusetts by another lawyer, though Mr. Harder is the lead on the case. Mr. Ayyadurai is seeking $35 million.\u201cThe First Amendment refers to journalism,\u201d he said, \u201cnot what they do.\u201dGawker has said it stands by its reporting. In an open letter to Mr. Thiel published on Thursday, Mr. Denton asked readers to review Gizmodo\u2019s article on Mr. Ayyadurai and decide for themselves whether the reporting was newsworthy. Other news organizations, including The Los Angeles Times, have cast doubt on Mr. Ayyadurai\u2019s claims.Many who have sued Gawker said that it overstepped the boundaries of privacy, slandered reputations or failed to do adequate reporting before posting articles. Several of the suits have found fault with Gawker\u2019s tendency to link coverage across several websites, opening up the stories for reader discussion and, in some cases, online harassment.Though several suits over the years have been dismissed relatively quickly, Gawker has occasionally faced an uphill battle in court.In 2012, a young North Carolina woman sued Gawker Media and Deep Dive Media for defamation, accusing both of aggregating a local news article speculating about whether she had exposed herself in a high school yearbook photo. (She was not named in the article.) A district judge denied Gawker\u2019s request to dismiss the suit, and both parties later settled in mediation, according to Chris Mauriello, the woman\u2019s lawyer.Stuart Karle, an adjunct professor at Columbia University\u2019s Graduate School of Journalism and the general counsel of North Base Media, a venture capital firm investing in developing-world media, said in an email that the number of lawsuits against Gawker spoke to the impact its articles were having.\u201cBut the other angle, and the especially troubling one given the Thiel reveal, is the fact \u2014 and it does now appear to be a fact \u2014 that even a successful digital publisher can be threatened with ruin by a concerted litigation attack financed by someone (or some group) who wants to destroy it,\u201d he said. \u201cIn that context, this number of defamation actions is far more sinister.\u201dHe added, \u201cThat is of course what lawsuits against the press are almost always about: Not the last story, the one in the lawsuit, but the next story, the one that hasn\u2019t been written or filmed and now can\u2019t be because there isn\u2019t the time or the money to do it.\u201dAndrew Ross Sorkin, whose DealBook column usually appears on this page, is away.Advertisement"}

During the early 1980s, Mr. Linton served as the head of the storied investment banking and securities firm that pioneered\n                                        the use of high yield (or \"junk\") bonds. Robert Linton was born in New York City on May 19, 1925 to Helen and Adolph Lichtenstein, a specialist on the New York Stock Exchange. During his senior year at\n                                        Phillips Exeter Academy, Linton enlisted in the Army, eventually serving in WWII as a navigator and bombardier and achieving the rank of 2nd lieutenant in the Army Air Force.

Linton worked in virtually every department of the firm, forming the company&aposs Corporate Finance and Commodities departments. By 1976, the firm had become Drexel\n                                        Burnham Lambert. Mr. Linton was eventually named to head the firm by founder I.W. Burnham II, and in the early 1980s under his leadership, Drexel grew to become the most profitable firm on Wall Street. When Mr.\n                                        Linton retired, DBL had 10,000 employees in worldwide offices.

{"Headline": "I.R.S. Ruling Is Obstacle to Health Care Networks Promoted by Obama", "Date": "2016-05-29", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A ruling by the Internal Revenue Service creates a significant obstacle to a new type of health care network that the Obama administration has promoted as a way to provide better care at lower cost, industry lawyers and providers say.Health care markets are rapidly changing as independent doctors and hospitals race to form networks, known as accountable care organizations, in which they coordinate care for patients. The doctors and hospitals have financial incentives to keep patients healthy and to control costs, and they can share in the savings if they meet performance goals.The new entities, which now cover more than 28 million people, according to Leavitt Partners, a health care consulting firm, help manage care for Medicare beneficiaries, for people with employer-sponsored insurance and for consumers who buy coverage through online marketplaces under the Affordable Care Act.In its recent ruling, the I.R.S. denied a tax exemption sought by an accountable care organization that coordinates care for people with commercial insurance. The tax agency said the organization did not meet the test for tax-exempt status because it was not operated exclusively for charitable purposes and it provided private benefits to some doctors in its network.The name and location of the organization, formed by a nonprofit health care system, were not disclosed. The ruling does not affect accountable care organizations formed solely to participate in Medicare, but it could affect similar entities serving privately insured patients. Many accountable care organizations coordinate care for both Medicare beneficiaries and privately insured patients.Melinda R. Hatton, senior vice president and general counsel of the American Hospital Association, said the I.R.S. ruling \u201cappears to be a serious obstacle for nonprofit hospitals striving to coordinate care for their communities.\u201dIn a letter asking the tax agency to reconsider its position, Ms. Hatton said, \u201cThe I.R.S. ruling is in conflict with the direction that the Department of Health and Human Services has given to the hospital field.\u201d It is, she said, imperative for the government to make clear that hospitals can participate in accountable care organizations without \u201cincurring the catastrophic loss of their tax-exempt status.\u201dT. J. Sullivan, an expert on the tax treatment of health care providers, said the I.R.S. ruling meant that accountable care organizations \u201cwill face an uphill battle\u201d in trying to qualify for federal income tax exemptions if they do not participate in Medicare.The I.R.S. acknowledged that the organization in question was trying to increase the quality of care, lower costs and improve the health of the community \u2014 the \u201ctriple aim\u201d championed by President Obama.But, it said, the organization has also negotiated agreements with insurers on behalf of doctors \u2014 and that is not a charitable activity, or one that directly benefits the community as a whole.\u201cThe presence of a single substantial nonexempt purpose destroys the exemption, regardless of the number or importance of the exempt purposes,\u201d the agency said.Catherine E. Livingston, a tax lawyer at the firm Jones Day who was the health care counsel at the I.R.S. from 2010 to 2013, said the ruling was out of step with trends sweeping the health care industry.\u201cIn the past,\u201d she said, \u201cinsurers paid for every service and procedure one patient at a time. But now the fundamental thrust of all American health policy, led by the Department of Health and Human Services, is to think about health care on a population-wide, communitywide basis. The I.R.S. has not yet accepted this new paradigm.\u201dThe tax agency said that an accountable care organization participating in Medicare could be tax-exempt because it advances \u201cthe charitable purpose of lessening the burdens of government.\u201dBy contrast, the I.R.S. told the group seeking tax-exempt status, \u201cYou are not established pursuant to a statute, managed by government officials or funded by government grants,\u201d and \u201cthere is no government oversight of your activities similar to that of an A.C.O.\u201d in Medicare. Under the 2010 health care law, the government has recognized more than 400 accountable care organizations for Medicare beneficiaries.The accountable care organization is a relatively new way of managing and financing health care, based on the premise that insurers should not just pay for more and more services provided to people who are sick or injured.\u201cMany health plans see accountable care models as the wave of the future,\u201d said Clare Krusing, a spokeswoman for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group. But, she said, insurers also see a risk that doctors and hospitals, working together in an accountable care organization, will \u201coperate as a provider monopoly and charge far higher rates\u201d than they could if they were doing business independently.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Romney Fund-Raiser Says He Had Met With Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-05-12", "News": "Spencer Zwick, the Republican fund-raiser who is deeply close to the former presidential nominee Mitt Romney and who raises money for the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, has periodically met with Donald J. Trump, including around the time he began his winning streak of nominating contests in February. The meetings are noteworthy at a moment when the Republican Party has been divided between those supporting Mr. Trump and those who are opposing him as the party\u2019s standard-bearer. Mr. Romney has been highly critical of Mr. Trump, and Mr. Ryan, with whom Mr. Trump will meet on Thursday, has said he is not ready to endorse Mr. Trump for the party\u2019s presidential nomination.Mr. Zwick, who is often described as Mr. Romney\u2019s \u201csixth son\u201d and who was a co-founder of the private equity firm Solamere Capital with Mr. Romney\u2019s son Tagg, said in an interview that he had made clear before the primaries began that he was available to meet with anyone interested in discussing the fund-raising process. Mr. Zwick was credited with snatching for Mr. Romney portions of the networks established by Senator John McCain of Arizona and Rudolph W. Giuliani during the 2008 presidential campaign. Mr. Zwick said he had also met with Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio before he suspended his campaign.Mr. Zwick said he could not remember precisely when he last saw Mr. Trump, though he conceded that it might have been after he won the New Hampshire primary, the first victory that Mr. Trump scored and the one that snowballed into wins in South Carolina and Nevada soon after. In early February, right before Mr. Trump won the New Hampshire primary, Mr. Zwick praised Mr. Trump as a brilliant political mind. Less than four weeks later, Mr. Romney gave a speech in Salt Lake City, condemning Mr. Trump\u2019s caustic comments, which he had grown concerned about over many months. Mr. Zwick\u2019s conversations with Mr. Trump\u2019s aides included sit-downs earlier in the process.Mr. Zwick insisted that the more recent meetings were not about gaining proximity to the potential nominee and emphasized that he was trying to spread his fund-raising expertise. \u201cI am committed to Paul Ryan,\u201d he said, adding he has \u201cno plans to work\u201d on the presidential race.

{"Headline": "N.F.L. Concussion Payouts Have Lenders Circling", "Date": "2016-05-09", "News": "Supported byHOUSTON \u2014 The offers seem too good to pass up: Loans worth tens of thousands of dollars with no money down and no time limit for paying it back. The main catch, sometimes buried in the fine print, is the interest rate of 40 percent or higher.\u201cWe take the weight off your shoulders,\u201d reads one pitch, while another urges borrowers to \u201caccelerate your award.\u201dYet the recipients are a very specific and, some worry, vulnerable group: short-of-cash former N.F.L. players with cognitive impairment from years of collisions on the field.This type of lending against a settlement payout is part of a legal \u2014 albeit largely unregulated \u2014 business focused mostly on victims in personal injury cases.But the loans have potentially devastating trap doors, most notably the high interest rates that kick in immediately after money is advanced, and can cut deeply into the sum a player might ultimately receive in a settlement.Some financial watchdogs find it unconscionable that lenders are wooing players who have memory problems and other cognitive ailments that could mean they cannot fully grasp what they are borrowing or the fine print behind the loans.\u201cIt\u2019s predatory, it\u2019s one-sided and it preys on people with brain injuries,\u201d said Richard H. Adler, a lawyer in Seattle who is not affiliated with the players but specializes in representing clients with traumatic brain injuries. \u201cYou\u2019re lending to someone who may not have the full legal capacity to understand what they are signing.\u201dLaCurtis Jones, 43, a linebacker who played parts of two seasons in the N.F.L. in the mid-1990s and two more years in Canada, is typical of the former players interested in a loan.He wants to borrow $100,000 to pay money he owes in child support, to help his family and to start a mentoring program for ex-convicts. His savings were depleted and work has been hard to find after he recently served time in jail because of a domestic dispute conviction. Jones also said he has struggled with depression, memory and anger issues, all of which he believes are related to his having played football.Though Jones is wary of the high interest rates, he is confident he can pay back what he owes with the six-figure settlement he hopes to receive in the settlement.\u201cI don\u2019t have none of my money left from the N.F.L.,\u201d said Jones, who lives in Houston. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get into a lot of debt, but I\u2019m looking for someone to give me some advance money. I don\u2019t need much.\u201dTo secure a loan, Jones has visited several neurologists to get a diagnosis that will assure his potential lender that he has a strong chance of getting a settlement once the deal is completed, something that could take many months. Most players are expected to get far less than millions. A sliding scale reduces the payouts for players who were in the league fewer than five years and players who are older than 45, and the players could spend months trying to get approved, all while the interest on their loans is piling up.Players who fail to qualify for cash settlements, however, do not have to repay what they borrow, a substantial risk for the lenders.\u201cIf the case doesn\u2019t get won, the money doesn\u2019t get paid back,\u201d said Kelly Gilroy, the executive director of the American Legal Finance Association, which represents about 40 lenders. She estimated that about 25 percent of presettlement loans result in a loss to the lender because the settlement did not come through.Lenders take the chance that some loans will not be repaid because they make sizable profits from their other clients. Most presettlement loans are for small amounts, like when a person in a car accident needs $5,000 to pay hospital bills while awaiting an insurance payout. As a rule of thumb, companies lend about 10 percent of what they expect the plaintiff to be awarded.Lenders are raising that threshold to 25 percent or higher for N.F.L. players, not just because they could receive six- and seven-figure settlements, but because the N.F.L. has published a grid detailing the range of potential awards, something normally unavailable or confidential in other cases.Sinai said lenders charged higher interest rates than banks because making nonrecourse loans, as they are known, was riskier. Unlike a traditional loan, the collateral is the settlement itself.\u201cIf we give a guy $100,000 and the N.F.L. doesn\u2019t believe the player has dementia, we\u2019re out of luck,\u201d Sinai said.Representatives of lenders dismiss claims that they take advantage of people who may not understand what they are getting into.Many companies require that a family member or lawyer represent clients with cognitive issues to ensure there is a valid contract. Their representatives add that the severity of a client\u2019s cognitive problems can vary widely. The bottom line, said Jeremy Fink, the chief operating officer of Atlas Legal Funding, is that \u201canyone, anywhere who doesn\u2019t have the mental capacity to do it shouldn\u2019t be doing it.\u201dTo be doubly sure, Sinai requires that his clients also go before a judge and testify that they understand the terms of their agreement. He also helps the players navigate the serpentine paperwork.\u201cHe\u2019s been very transparent in helping us understand and making sure the documentation from the doctors is valid, and communicating with the lawyers,\u201d said Tony George, 40, who played two years in the N.F.L. and is seeking a six-figure loan to pay for his depression and diabetes medicine and to jump-start his mentoring business.\u201cYou have to ask yourself whether it is worth continuing to struggle. Usually, when we get to this type of situation, we\u2019ve waited as long as we could.\u201dSome players with cognitive issues, though, are unsure of what they are borrowing. The wife of one former 45-year-old player with mild dementia said that she had stopped her husband from taking out a loan not just because of the high interest rates, but because it might take months or even years to get a settlement.\u201cIf it looks good and looks pretty, you think it\u2019s O.K.,\u201d said the wife, who asked not to be named because of fears that talking publicly would jeopardize her husband\u2019s pending litigation with the N.F.L. \u201cBut there\u2019s nothing positive about it because you\u2019re going to lose your whole settlement. Players are better off going bankrupt than taking out one of these loans.\u201d Still, for former players who need money now, not later, the loans look like risks worth taking.\u201cI\u2019m just trying to borrow enough so when the settlement comes through I can pay it back,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe sacrificed ourselves so we can make millions of dollars for the owners, but we also sacrificed our health.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "North Korea Linked to Digital Attacks on Global Banks", "Date": "2016-05-26", "News": "Supported bySecurity researchers have tied the recent spate of digital breaches on Asian banks to North Korea, in what they say appears to be the first known case of a nation using digital attacks for financial gain.In three recent attacks on banks, researchers working for the digital security firm Symantec said, the thieves deployed a rare piece of code that had been seen in only two previous cases: the hacking attack at Sony Pictures in December 2014 and attacks on banks and media companies in South Korea in 2013. Government officials in the United States and South Korea have blamed those attacks on North Korea, though they have not provided independent verification.On Thursday, the Symantec researchers said they had uncovered evidence linking an attack at a bank in the Philippines last October with attacks on Tien Phong Bank in Vietnam in December and one in February on the central bank of Bangladesh that resulted in the theft of more than $81 million.\u201cIf you believe North Korea was behind those attacks, then the bank attacks were also the work of North Korea,\u201d said Eric Chien, a security researcher at Symantec, who found that identical code was used across all three attacks.\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen an attack where a nation-state has gone in and stolen money,\u201d Mr. Chien added. \u201cThis is a first.\u201dThe attacks have raised alarms in the global banking industry because the thieves gained access to Swift, a Brussels-based banking consortium that runs what is considered the world\u2019s most secure payment messaging system. Swift\u2019s system is used by 11,000 banks and companies to move money from one country to another \u2014 one reason that it is a tempting target for criminals.Swift has warned publicly that the attacks are part of a broad coordinated assault on banks, though it has not assigned blame. It has also emphasized that it was the banks\u2019 connection points to its network \u2014 and not the core Swift messaging network itself \u2014 that the attackers were able to breach. Also, American bankers have noted that the security lapses all occurred at banks in third-world countries, which may give some comfort to banking customers in the United States.Security researchers and American government officials have tied thousands of attacks to nations in the past. They have linked the United States and Israel to an attack that destroyed Iranian centrifuges, and the Chinese military and contractors to attacks that stole military and trade secrets from thousands of foreign entities.But the latest spate of attacks on banks in Bangladesh and Southeast Asia would be the first time, security researchers say, that a nation has used malicious code to steal purely for financial profit.The idea that Pyongyang had turned to digital theft would not be surprising. North Korea\u2019s economy has been ravaged by sanctions, food shortages and other deprivations. Pyongyang does not publish economic data, but estimates have put North Korea\u2019s gross domestic product between $12 billion and $40 billion, tiny when compared with South Korea\u2019s economic output of more than $1.4 trillion.In the attack at Bangladesh\u2019s central bank in February, the thieves tried to transfer $1 billion in funds from an account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Fed officials became suspicious of the some of requested transfers and released only $81 million to accounts in the Philippines.\u201cIf you presume it\u2019s North Korea, $1 billion is almost 10 percent of their G.D.P.,\u201d Mr. Chien said. \u201cThis is not small change for them.\u201dSymantec researchers said it was possible that the bank in the Philippines containing the North Korean code was also involved in the Bangladesh bank scheme and the attempted breach on the Vietnamese bank. The researchers would not identify the Philippines bank and did not say whether the thieves had been successful in transferring funds. Researchers were able to confirm only that the attackers had managed to breach the bank and install identical code strings on the bank\u2019s computer systems \u2014 the same code that they discovered in Bangladesh, Vietnam and the two previous attacks at Sony in 2014 and South Korea in 2013.Mr. Chien noted that the attackers not only used identical numbers but wrote the code in the same, unusual sequence across all three attacks.Mr. Chien said the evidence pointed to all three attacks being the work of the \u201cLazarus Group,\u201d a name his team gave to the attackers behind the Sony and South Korean attacks.Officials have pointed to North Korea\u2019s threat of \u201cmerciless countermeasures\u201d against Sony if the studio released \u201cThe Interview,\u201d a movie by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg that made fun of North Korea and includes a fictional assassination of its leader. F.B.I. analysts also note critical mistakes North Korean hackers made, such as logging into their attack servers from known North Korean Internet addresses and even logging into both their Facebook account and Sony\u2019s servers from the same computers.In the months since evidence of the attacks involving the Swift network started to emerge, investigators have been looking for commonalities at numerous other potential breaches. It remains unclear whether these breaches are connected to the ones in Bangladesh and Vietnam, but they too have occurred in or around Southeast Asia.There is no evidence to date that the thieves have gone after large American or European banks, though new possible attacks are being reported weekly. Last week, evidence emerged that Banco del Austro, an Ecuadorean bank, was infiltrated by hackers who were also able to sneak onto the Swift network. The thieves transferred several million dollars to accounts around the world, according to a lawsuit the bank filed in federal court in the United States against Wells Fargo, which facilitated one of the transfers.Researchers have yet to unearth any of the code used in the Ecuador attack, but banking analysts say it is probably no coincidence that these attacks are happening in the developing world, where security measures tend not to be as tight as they are in financial hubs like New York and London.Swift has issued numerous warnings in recent weeks urging banks to step up their security protocols. Analysts worry that the breaches could have a chilling effect on global finance; larger banks may become reluctant or even refuse to transact with smaller banks in the developing world unless they can have assurances that their networks have not been compromised by thieves and malware.At a conference on Tuesday in Brussels, Swift\u2019s chief executive, Gottfried Leibbrandt, said the recent attacks could do far more damage than breaches on retailers and telephone companies, which he said suffer largely reputational and legal hits.\u201cBanks that are compromised like this can be put out of business,\u201d Mr. Leibbrandt said.\u201cNorth Korea is hurting for money,\u201d said Herb Lin, the senior research scholar for cyberpolicy and security at Stanford University\u2019s Center for International Security and Cooperation and a fellow at Stanford\u2019s Hoover Institution. \u201cThey\u2019ve been cut out of the financial system because of sanctions. They had been among the best counterfeiters in the world, and only recently have they been stymied in the counterfeiting of superdollars. If it\u2019s true that we\u2019ve cut them off from that, then it\u2019s not at all surprising that they would turn to something else.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Researchers Aim to Put Carbon Dioxide Back to Work", "Date": "2016-05-02", "News": "Supported byBut perhaps the ultimate goal of researchers in this field is to turn the waste product of fuel-burning into new fuel. In theory, if this could be done on a large scale using renewable energy or even sunlight, there would be no net gain of emissions \u2014 the same carbon dioxide molecules would be emitted, captured, made into new fuels and emitted again, over and over.What Dr. Atwater and others have in mind are devices that, if scaled up, could recycle a significant portion of carbon dioxide that is captured from power plants or processes like cement manufacturing, or even directly from the atmosphere.The issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.The center, started in 2010 with a grant from the Department of Energy, devoted its first five years to one aspect of photosynthesis: splitting water into its components, hydrogen and oxygen.Dr. Atwater, Frances A. Houle, a deputy director, and Karl Walczak, a project scientist, showed some of the fruits of that work \u2014 a chip-size sandwich of semiconductor material, catalysts and membranes encased in a clear container with a water-based solution. When the chip was exposed to light, bubbles of gas \u2014 hydrogen on one side, oxygen on the other \u2014 formed, broke off and rose to the top.By their calculations, the chip is about 10 times more efficient than a typical plant, which uses about 1 percent of the sunlight that strikes it.The center is now working on the carbon-dioxide part of the photosynthetic equation. The goal is to integrate the two processes in a device that might look a lot like a solar panel. But rather than generating electricity, it would produce fuel \u2014 perhaps methanol, which could be burned directly or converted to gasoline.Carbon dioxide is much more difficult to split than water, however, involving six steps, each requiring energy and a catalyst. Nature appears to do it effortlessly, but it has had millions of years of evolution to improve the process.Much of the work at the center involves studying catalysis, through theoretical analysis and testing possible combinations of metal oxides to see how well they might work. The testing method is similar to one used for drug discovery, with equipment that can analyze large numbers of very small samples at a time.The goal is to make a device that can make just one product, as in natural photosynthesis, but more efficiently. At the same time, the device has to be able to last for years, as solar panels do. That adds to the engineering and design challenges.The Sunfire process uses electricity, not sunlight, so the electricity would have to come from renewable sources to result in meaningful carbon reductions. Given the amount of electricity is required, a big challenge is producing fuel that could compete in price with conventional fossil fuels, said Christian von Olshausen, Sunfire\u2019s chief technology officer.\u201cOur vision is to design this reactor more as a platform,\u201d said Nicholas Flanders, who founded Opus 12 with Kendra Kuhl and Etosha Cave.\u201cYou can rest assured that the energy and catalysis problems of humanity will not have been resolved five years from now,\u201d he said.But there is growing interest in the work of Dr. Atwater and his fellow researchers, particularly after the recently signed Paris climate treaty that calls for sharp emissions reductions to combat global warming.\u201cWe have some wind at our back that we haven\u2019t had until recently,\u201d he added.Advertisement"}

To produce the newspaper\u2019s design and layout, two news editors, along with several other staffers, would work daily from 6 p.m. to at least midnight, she said.The staff, meanwhile, would race to post articles online as fast as possible during the day \u2014 and oh, by the way, also attend class and find time for their homework.\u201cOur editors and writers are basically putting out two papers a day,\u201d she said.For all that effort, print circulation declined to 3,000 a day from 5,100 in 2011, Ms. Hu said. But the paper edition remains important, she said; the less-frequent publications will focus more on in-depth articles, investigations and long magazine-style articles.Student newspapers operate under a variety of financial arrangements. While some, like The Cornell Daily Sun, are fully independent of the universities they cover, others are fully or partly financed by the colleges.\u201cMost of the time, even if it was driven by finances, it forces innovation, and that\u2019s not a bad thing,\u201d she said, adding that she predicted more schools were likely to cut back or drop print altogether.In case you\u2019re wondering: The Cornell Daily Sun will keep the word \u201cDaily\u201d in its name.\u201cWe\u2019re probably going to be more daily than ever,\u201d Ms. Hu said.Advertisement"}

Trump met privately on Monday with Woody Johnson, the New York Jets owner and a top Republican fund-raiser, as the presumptive nominee looks to secure the support of some of the party\u2019s largest financial backers in order to raise hundreds of millions of dollars for his general election effort.Mr. Trump confirmed the meeting in a brief interview with The Times.\u201cWoody\u2019s a great guy,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWoody will support me. He\u2019s a terrific guy, he\u2019s been a friend of mine a long time.\u201dMr. Johnson supported Jeb Bush during the Republican primary, a decision he made early in 2015, at a time when many people were still uncertain whether Mr. Trump was mounting a serious campaign. An aide to Mr. Johnson declined to comment on the meeting.The move came as Mr. Trump begins to build a fund-raising operation in order to raise roughly $1 billion through a joint fund-raising agreement among his campaign, the Republican National Committee and 11 state parties.Mr. Trump and Mr. Johnson were social friends for years before the 2016 campaign; Mr. Johnson was among the people who approached Mr. Trump about supporting Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential campaign, the New York developer said.But during the lead-up to this year\u2019s New Hampshire primary, Mr. Trump repeatedly pointed to Mr. Johnson as an example of the type of donor whose special interest money he was not interested in.\u201cFirst of all, I actually feel that I could run the same kind of campaign that I ran before,\u201d Mr. Trump said, when asked about the old remarks. He spent comparatively little money in the primaries, which he lent his campaign or raised in smaller contributions, as people like Mr. Bush burned through tens of millions of dollars. \u201cBut we\u2019re raising money for the Republicans, for the R.N.C., for Congress and the Senate.\u201dMr. Trump is set to hold a fund-raiser at the home of his friend Thomas Barrack in California on Wednesday night.

{"Headline": "Donald Trump Soured on a Deal, and Hong Kong Partners Became Litigants", "Date": "2016-05-30", "News": "Supported byDonald J. Trump, who has made reversing America\u2019s trade imbalance a pillar of his campaign, often portrays himself as uniquely capable of wringing concessions out of China through hard-nosed business tactics he has honed over the years.In fact, he says, he has a personal track record to back up his boasts.Mr. Trump does have an investment in the building, an office tower near Rockefeller Center. But court documents and interviews with people involved in the deal tell a very different story of how he ended up with it.It began when a group of Hong Kong billionaires, including one who has been called the Donald Trump of China, helped rescue Mr. Trump from the verge of bankruptcy by investing in one of his properties in Manhattan.For years, the carefully cultivated relationship between Mr. Trump and his Hong Kong partners proved lucrative for both sides, and stands out as perhaps the closest that Mr. Trump has come to international diplomacy.To strike the deal, Mr. Trump had to attend elaborate dinner parties featuring foreign foods he did not want to eat. He delayed the closing because of Chinese spiritual beliefs and hunted around New York for a \u201cfeng shui\u201d master to help with the building d\u00e9cor, instead of indulging his tastes for marble and gold, according to former associates of Mr. Trump who were involved in the deal.But when his Hong Kong partners sold the property without his support, Mr. Trump waged a bitter, long-shot legal battle against them. And far from winning his share of the Bank of America building, according to court documents, he had to settle for it after losing in court. In the end, Mr. Trump\u2019s alliance and eventual rivalry with some of Hong Kong\u2019s richest men proved to be a tale of Mr. Trump at the extremes. It showcased his unflagging confidence in his ability to turn a bad financial situation around. But it also underscored his willingness to destroy a fruitful relationship with aggressive litigation.Their partnership began in 1994, after the collapse of the real estate market left Mr. Trump deeply in debt. He could not afford to make the bank payments on a 77-acre swath of land near Lincoln Center known as Riverside South, let alone to develop the property.Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Lo comes from a wealthy family. He is well known for creating a hip restaurant area in Shanghai called Xintiandi, or \u201cnew heaven on earth,\u201d an upscale brand he has replicated across China. His life has been chronicled by tabloids and society pages, especially his divorce from his first wife and his marriage to a beauty pageant winner, Miss Hong Kong of 1977.Despite their similarities, Mr. Trump hesitated when he received an invitation to travel to Hong Kong to negotiate the deal. He does not like to travel, and he feared that negotiating on the Hong Kong developers\u2019 turf would put him at a disadvantage and make him appear weak, said Abe Wallach, Mr. Trump\u2019s executive vice president of acquisitions and finance at the time.But face-to-face meetings are crucial in Chinese business culture, where personal bonds and political connections, collectively known as guanxi, are relied upon to avoid and resolve business disputes, sometimes more than the legal system. Eventually, Mr. Trump\u2019s aides convinced him that he had to make the trip.In Hong Kong, the golf games, dinner parties and intensive talks featured the awkwardness and cultural miscues that can crop up in any high-stakes international negotiation. Mr. Lo and Mr. Cheng invited Mr. Trump to play golf, but Mr. Trump was appalled when they told him they usually bet more than $1,000 on each hole. They ended up betting $100 per hole, and Mr. Trump wound up losing more than he won, Mr. Lo recalled in an interview this month.\u201cHe\u2019s a good golfer, but we had the local knowledge \u2014 he probably was jet-lagged,\u201d Mr. Lo said.Mr. Lo and Mr. Cheng invited Mr. Trump to dinner at the home of Mr. Cheng\u2019s father, an uncommon honor in Chinese culture. But the evening was a trying experience for Mr. Trump.\u201cHe didn\u2019t like the food, and couldn\u2019t use chopsticks,\u201d recalled Mr. Wallach, who was there. \u201cThe first course was a whole fish, with the head still on. You could see the face of the fish and the teeth, which really looked grotesque. The servant put the fish in front of Donald. Donald said, \u2018The honor belongs to Abe.\u2019 I took my chopsticks and began to pick at it.\u201dMr. Cheng and Mr. Lo also half-jokingly proposed an informal drinking contest, which Mr. Trump, a teetotaler, declined.The Hong Kong partners were wary of Mr. Trump\u2019s well-earned reputation for litigiousness. But for more than a decade, Mr. Trump avoided conflict with them. Indeed, he often deferred to them. Chase Manhattan Bank, which held Mr. Trump\u2019s mortgage, initially scheduled the closing of the deal during China\u2019s Ghost Month, during which some believe the spirits of the dead roam the earth.\u201cThe Chinese told me that we would have to wait until after the fifteenth of September to close the deal,\u201d Mr. Wallach wrote in a chapter of an unpublished book he is writing about his years with Mr. Trump. \u201cTrump went apoplectic.\u201d But he said that Mr. Trump went along.(Mr. Lo said that any delay had been caused by a need to complete paperwork, and that he and his business partners were not superstitious.)The project proved extremely profitable, as the New York real estate market rebounded. In 2005, the Hong Kong partners sold the development for $1.76 billion. Although it was believed to be the largest residential real estate transaction in the city\u2019s history, Mr. Trump was furious, and contends to this day that his partners did not consult him first.\u201cI said: \u2018Why didn\u2019t you come talk to me? Whatever price you got, I could have gotten more money,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump recalled in an interview this month.Mr. Lo said that Mr. Trump had been informed of the decision, and that in any case it would have been very hard to shop such a large property around without Mr. Trump\u2019s becoming aware of it.Instead of accepting his share of the proceeds, Mr. Trump sued his partners for \u201cstaggering breach\u201d of fiduciary duty in a lawsuit that demanded $1 billion in damages. Mr. Lo, who felt that Mr. Trump should have been appreciative of the deal he had received, called the lawsuit \u201ca shock.\u201dAnd when the Hong Kong partners sought to invest the proceeds from the sale in Bank of America buildings in San Francisco and New York, Mr. Trump sought an injunction to scuttle the deal.The judge ruled against him. Instead of receiving the cash he wanted, Mr. Trump had to accept a 30 percent share in the profits from the two Bank of America buildings, tied up in a partnership that is slated to last until 2044. But today, Mr. Trump counts that legal defeat as a victory.\u201cThrough more luck than talent, I ended up much better because the buildings have increased in value,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the end, it was fine.\u201dNonetheless, Mr. Trump\u2019s litigation over Riverside South dragged on for at least four years. He forced his partners to produce more than 166,000 pages of documents in court and accused them of various transgressions, including fraud and tax evasion.During the litigation, Mr. Lo was forced to keep his trips to the United States secret, out of concern that Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers would serve him with court papers that would force him to remain in the United States.Outside court, Mr. Trump\u2019s battle seemed to take the shape of a personal rivalry with Mr. Lo, who had just bankrolled a Chinese reality television show called \u201cWise Man Takes All.\u201d It loosely resembled Mr. Trump\u2019s show \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d although Mr. Lo appeared just once on the show and handed out start-up capital to the winners instead of jobs.Mr. Trump announced that he was going to take a version of \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d to China to compete with Mr. Lo\u2019s show, although Mr. Trump\u2019s show there does not appear to have gotten off the ground. In an interview, Mr. Trump asked a reporter how Mr. Lo\u2019s show had turned out, then answered his question: \u201cLet\u2019s put it this way. It wasn\u2019t \u2018The Apprentice,\u2019 which was a big success.\u201dMr. Lo said his show had met his real goal of promoting entrepreneurship in China.After the lawsuit, the Hong Kong partners moved swiftly to cut all ties to Mr. Trump. Mr. Lo sold his shares in the partnership to the Cheng family, which sold to Vornado Realty Trust, now the owner of a 70 percent interest in the Bank of America buildings.But in the interview, Mr. Trump sounded almost wistful about his former partners, marveling at the money they had made together and at the fact that they no longer spoke. He acknowledged that his former partners might have gotten the best deal possible on Riverside South, after all.\u201cIt\u2019s too bad that this happened,\u201d Mr. Trump told a reporter.\u201cIf you speak to Vincent and Henry, tell them I think they are fantastic people,\u201d he said. \u201cYou let them know that Donald Trump has great respect for them, O.K.?\u201dEight thousand miles away, in his penthouse office in Hong Kong, Mr. Lo laughed when told of Mr. Trump\u2019s comment. He made clear that he had not forgotten being sued for $1 billion.\u201cWell, that\u2019s him,\u201d Mr. Lo said. \u201cTo file a lawsuit is nothing. It\u2019s just like having lunch.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Know-Nothing Tide", "Date": "2016-05-16", "News": "Supported byOn the evidence, ethnocentrism is a pretty basic human instinct. Band together with your own. Keep the outsider down or out. In the 1850s, at another moment of American unease, the Know-Nothings swept Massachusetts and won mayoral elections in Philadelphia and Washington on a nativist platform to \u201cpurify\u201d national politics by stopping the influx of Irish and German Catholics.Papist influence was then the perceived scourge through which the Know-Nothing movement, as the Native American Party (later the American Party) was commonly known, built its following. Today the supposed threat is Muslim and Mexican infiltration. Or so Donald Trump, the de facto Republican presidential candidate, would have us believe in his \u201cAmerica First\u201d program.A know-nothing tide is upon us. Tribal politics, anchored in tribal media, has made knowing nothing a badge of honor. Ignorance, loudly declaimed, is an attribute, especially if allied to celebrity. Facts are dispensable baggage. To display knowledge, the acquisition of which takes time, is tantamount to showing too much respect for the opposition tribe, who know nothing anyway.Any slogan can be reworked, I guess. America First has a long, unhappy history, the America First Committee having pressed the view that the United States should stay out of the war to defeat Fascism in World War II. Its most famous advocate was Charles Lindbergh, the aviator, who undermined the movement when he revealed that he blamed Jews for prodding America toward war. That was in 1941, not a good year for Jews anywhere, particularly in Europe, where, while Lindbergh opined, the annihilation of Jewry had begun.Well, America First is back, tweaked as Trump\u2019s we-won\u2019t-be-suckers-anymore ideology. In his favor, it cannot be said that Trump has a stranglehold on political stupidity. Britain is seriously debating leaving the European Union, the greatest force for peace and stability in Europe since the carnage of the 1940s.One is put in mind of the remark of James L. Petigru, a prominent jurist and politician, upon the secession of South Carolina from the Union in 1860: \u201cSouth Carolina is too small for a republic and too large for an insane asylum.\u201dBritain\u2019s pathologies resemble South Carolina\u2019s.Now where was I? Ah, yes, Trump, naturally. Trump, who has declared \u2014 or perhaps it was only a suggestion \u2014 that \u201cOur moments of greatest strength came when politics ended at water\u2019s edge.\u201d Totally, he said that. Absolutely, he said that. Really, really, he said that. To deny it would be \u201cabsolutely a total lie.\u201dI suppose Trump was thinking of the Normandy landings, or perhaps the Marshall Plan, or Ronald Reagan\u2019s \u201ctear down this wall,\u201d or the freeing of hundreds of millions of people from the totalitarian Soviet imperium, or the opening to China.American isolationism is an oxymoron because America is a universal idea. That does not change however far short of its ideals the nation may fall.On China, Trump has said: \u201cWe can both benefit or we can both go our separate ways.\u201d Go our separate ways! Let\u2019s unpack that. Right now America buys everything China makes, and China buys the American debt incurred for all the spending sprees on stuff from Guangzhou. Just because there may be separate ways into the gutter does not make the gutter any more alluring. Chinese-American symbiosis is an existential issue.As for Egypt, Trump believes America ousted \u201ca friendly regime\u201d (of the former dictator, Hosni Mubarak) \u201cthat had a longstanding peace treaty with Israel.\u201d No, Egypt has a peace treaty with Israel. Mr. Mubarak did not.Speaking of Israel, Trump says, \u201cPresident Obama has not been a friend to Israel.\u201d Right, he has not been a friend to the tune of over $20.5 billion in foreign military financing since 2009. He has not been a friend by providing over $1.3 billion for the Iron Dome defense system alone since 2011. He has not been a friend by, in 2014, opposing 18 resolutions in the United Nations General Assembly that were biased against Israel; by helping to organize in 2015 the first U.N. General Assembly session on anti-Semitism in the history of the body; and by working tirelessly on a two-state peace, not least on the security arrangements for Israel that are among its preconditions. He has not been a friend by turning the other cheek in the face of what Nancy Pelosi once called \u201cthe insult to the intelligence of the United States\u201d from Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.The know-nothings are on the march. But of course they must know something. Millions of people who vote for Trump cannot be wrong. Perhaps their core idea, along with the unchanging appeal of ethnocentrism, is that politics no longer really matter. Celebrity matters.Power centers are elsewhere \u2014 in financial systems, corporations, technology, networks \u2014 that long since dispensed with borders. That being the case, loudmouthed, isolationist trumpery may just be a sideshow, an American exercise in apr\u00e8s-moi-le-d\u00e9luge escapism.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Key G.O.P. Donors Still Deeply Resist Donald Trump\u2019s Candidacy", "Date": "2016-05-21", "News": "Supported byA powerful array of the Republican Party\u2019s largest financial backers remains deeply resistant to Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidential candidacy, forming a wall of opposition that could make it exceedingly difficult for him to meet his goal of raising $1 billion before the November election.Interviews and emails with more than 50 of the Republican Party\u2019s largest donors, or their representatives, revealed a measure of contempt and distrust toward their own party\u2019s nominee that is unheard of in modern presidential politics.More than a dozen of the party\u2019s most reliable individual contributors and wealthy families indicated that they would not give to or raise money for Mr. Trump. This group has contributed a combined $90 million to conservative candidates and causes in the last three federal elections, mainly to \u201csuper PACs\u201d dedicated to electing Republican candidates.Up to this point, Mr. Trump has embraced the hostility of the Republican establishment, goading the party\u2019s angry base with diatribes against wealthy donors who he claimed controlled politicians. And he has succeeded while defying conventions of presidential campaigning, relying on media attention and large rallies to fire up supporters, and funding his operation with a mix of his own money and small-dollar contributions.But that formula will be tested as he presents himself to a far larger audience of voters. Mr. Trump has turned to the task of winning over elites he once attacked, with some initial success. And he has said he hopes to raise $1 billion, an enormous task given that he named a finance chairman and started scheduling fund-raisers only this month.Among the party\u2019s biggest financiers disavowing Mr. Trump are Paul E. Singer, a New York investor who has spent at least $28 million for national Republicans since the 2012 election, and Joe Ricketts, the TD Ameritrade founder who with his wife Marlene has spent nearly $30 million over the same period of time, as well as the hedge fund managers William Oberndorf and Seth Klarman, and the Florida hospital executive Mike Fernandez.\u201cIf it is Trump vs. Clinton,\u201d Mr. Oberndorf said, \u201cI will be voting for Hillary.\u201dThe rejection of Mr. Trump among some of the party\u2019s biggest donors and fund-raisers reflects several strains of hostility to his campaign. Donors cited his fickleness on matters of policy and what they saw as an ad hoc populist platform focused on trade protectionism and immigration. Several mentioned Mr. Trump\u2019s own fortune, suggesting that if he was as wealthy as he claimed, then he should not need their assistance.Among the more than 50 donors contacted, only nine have said unambiguously that they will contribute to Mr. Trump. They include Sheldon G. Adelson, the casino billionaire; the energy executive T. Boone Pickens; Foster Friess, a wealthy mutual fund investor; and Richard H. Roberts, a pharmaceutical executive. Mr. Friess wrote in an email that Mr. Trump deserved credit for inspiring \u201ctruckers, farmers, welders, hospitality workers \u2014 the people who really make our country function.\u201dMany more donors declined to reveal their intentions or did not respond to requests for comment, a remarkable silence about the de facto nominee of their party.Asked how Mr. Trump intended to win over major donors, Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, responded in one sentence. \u201cThere is tremendous support for Mr. Trump,\u201d she said.There is deep concern among Republicans about political divisions and the future of the party, a new Times/CBS News poll shows. We want to hear from the party\u2019s longtime members or those who have just registered as Republicans.Some major donors have not explicitly closed the door on helping Mr. Trump, but have set a high bar for him to earn their support, demanding an almost complete makeover of his candidacy and a repudiation of his own inflammatory statements.\u201cUntil we have a better reason to embrace and support the top of the ticket, and see an agenda that is truly an opportunity agenda, then we have lots of other options in which to invest and spend our time helping,\u201d said Betsy DeVos, a Michigan Republican whose family has given nearly $9.5 million over the last three elections to party causes and candidates.But others simply believe Mr. Trump is unfit to serve in the Oval Office. Michael K. Vlock, a Connecticut investor who has given nearly $5 million to Republicans at the federal level since 2014, said he considered Mr. Trump a dangerous person.\u201cHe\u2019s an ignorant, amoral, dishonest and manipulative, misogynistic, philandering, hyper-litigious, isolationist, protectionist blowhard,\u201d Mr. Vlock said.Mr. Vlock said he might give to Hillary Clinton instead, describing her as \u201cthe devil we know.\u201d\u201cI really believe our republic will survive Hillary,\u201d he said.At a dinner of the Manhattan Institute in New York earlier this month, Bruce Kovner, a New York-based investor who has given $3.1 million to national Republicans in recent years, argued to a collection of influential conservatives that Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton were both unacceptable choices.\u201cWhen I talk to my colleagues and friends in similar positions, they have the same degree of discomfort,\u201d Mr. Kovner said in an interview.Unless Mr. Trump can win over more benefactors, he is likely to become the first Republican presidential nominee in decades to be heavily outspent by his Democratic opponent, and may find it difficult to pay for both the voter-turnout operations and the paid advertising campaigns that are typically required in a general election.Both President Obama and Mitt Romney raised over $1 billion in 2012, and Mrs. Clinton is expected to exceed that figure easily.Charles G. and David H. Koch, the country\u2019s two most prolific conservative donors, are not expected to back Mr. Trump, and their advisers have been scathing in private assessments of Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy and his policy agenda.The Kochs, who command a vast network of conservative donors, have scheduled a conference of their allies in Colorado in late July, where much of their 2016 spending may be determined.Donald J. Trump is set to be the Republican standard-bearer, but when it comes to some of his policies, he is out of sync with many Republican leaders in Congress.Even among the handful of big donors Mr. Trump has won over, doubts persist about both his abilities as a candidate and the political apparatus supporting him.But Mr. Trump still has no sanctioned \u201csuper PAC\u201d able to raise unlimited sums to support his campaign. A gathering next month at Mr. Pickens\u2019s Texas ranch that was to be sponsored by one of the pro-Trump groups, Great America PAC, has been called off because Mr. Pickens was not sure he was hosting Mr. Trump\u2019s preferred super PAC.At a Republican Governors Association donor retreat last week in New Mexico, there was a debate on the sidelines about whether to support Mr. Trump. Mr. Friess argued that the Supreme Court vacancy made it imperative to rally around Mr. Trump. But Mr. Friess acknowledged in an email that enthusiasm for Mr. Trump was limited among his fellow major donors. If some agreed there was \u201cno sensible choice other than to rally around Trump,\u201d Mr. Friess said, many contributors viewed that prospect with \u201cthe same enthusiasm as a root canal.\u201dWalter Buckley, the founder of a Pennsylvania financial management company, said he decided to support Mr. Trump after Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey endorsed him. Predicting that Mr. Trump would shake up Washington, Mr. Buckley, said, \u201cThis political system needs a shaking like it\u2019s probably not had in 100 years.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think anything that anybody\u2019s ever said on the political front has bothered me more than that,\u201d Mr. Buckley said.Agustin Armendariz contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Why do we believe a dress that took one seamstress thousands of hours to embroider is worth more than a dress that took thousands of hours to 3D print? Can you even tell the difference?The implication being that, despite the fact that Apple, maker of the Apple Watch (a.k.a. the poster object for wearables), is a sponsor of the show, the answer is not necessarily a gadget you strap on your body.Rather it may have something to do with what is going on a few miles to the south of the museum, across the East River in a cavernous old industrial building in Sunset Park, Brooklyn.Forget Silicon Valley and Silicon Beach. Welcome to the land of the Silicon Schmatte.Incubator hubs in former factories have begun to dot the river\u2019s edge and the uplands like pearls on a string: Aside from Manufacture NY, there is the Greenpoint Design and Manufacturing Center, a complex of old brick buildings originally built for the textile industry, and New Lab in the Brooklyn Navy Yard (which concentrates on prototyping and structures), to name just a few. Then there is the Brooklyn Army Terminal, just a few blocks down from Manufacture NY\u2019s home, and a million-plus-square-foot center for \u201cadvanced manufacturing\u201d (including biotech), in the words of Maria Torres-Springer, president of the New York Economic Development Corporation, which will manage the space.Thanks to an unexpected collision of circumstances \u2014 a borough with a surfeit of unused industrial spaces; city planning (the realization on the part of the development corporation, among other agencies, \u201cthat there is enormous economic opportunity in encouraging this identity,\u201d according to Scott Cohen, one of the founders of New Lab); the rise of the maker movement, with its emphasis on small businesses thinking in a local and custom way; and the city\u2019s legacy as a fashion capital \u2014 New York, especially Brooklyn, has become \u201cthe natural home of the greater wearables movement,\u201d said Francis Bitonti, a designer who runs a namesake studio and whose primary tools are algorithms and 3D printers.\u201cThe West Coast has a lot of software talent, but not really a strong fashion culture,\u201d said Mr. Bitonti, who has collaborated on dresses for Dita Von Teese and Chromat and shoes for United Nude. \u201cThey take a very engineering-led bottom-line approach to their start-ups.\u201dManufacture NY has a somewhat different approach.Manufacture NY was founded in 2012 by Bob Bland, 33, a redhead with stints at Polo Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger on her r\u00e9sum\u00e9, who was inspired to \u201ccreate the 21st-century garment district\u201d after struggling to run her own label, Brooklyn Royalty, and source production locally. Now the group aims to focus on the points where design intersects with technology, and how together they can alter the supply chain.To this end, the 10-person executive team includes a chief technology officer named Amanda Parkes, a 41-year-old computer scientist and mechanical engineer with long blond hair who talks at warp speed, has a thing for biofabrication, and tends to pepper her sentences with words like \u201cdensity mapping,\u201d \u201cvoxel\u201d and \u201chacking interfaces.\u201d Together, she and Ms. Bland are the sharp point of the wearables spear. They function a bit like \u201cCharlie\u2019s Angels,\u201d if the angels had thrown off the patriarchy and gone out on their own.\u201cWe want to create a whole new genre of company that will have the instincts and design skills of fashion and the back end of research and I.P.,\u201d Ms. Parkes said, pointing out that current fashion start-ups exist in one sphere and tech start-ups in another, and, generally, never the twain do meet.But, Ms. Parkes said, \u201cIf you are making a clothing line, you need research facilities for the hydrophobic nanotechnology that\u2019s going to make it special, and you need to know what it takes to create a private label so you can actually bring it to market.\u201d If you are Dan Steingart, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Princeton and an energy specialist who is researching how to make fabric into a battery, \u201cYou need to know who can actually scale the fabric you make, or who can actually make clothes out of it. Who can design them.\u201dYou need to be in the same ecosystem.Or at least on the same floor \u2014 all 160,000 square feet of it, with washed concrete floors, giant mullioned windows and curving pillars nearing completion. (Manufacture NY is in a temporary home on a lower floor.) There will be space for 30 or 40 companies, a denim lab, digital printing, laser cutting, 3D knitting, weaving, chemistry and biology labs, and a working sample room. At the moment, 15 are in the temporary site, with another 50 or so linked into their network. Not all of them are product-centric. But all of them embody, to varying extents, this new kind of thinking and function somewhat as a circuit unto themselves.Dropel, for example, was co-founded by Simardev Gulati, scion of a textile-factory-owning family in India, who studied international trade and finance at Oxford. He and the co-founder Bradley Feinstein, a former consultant, have patented a nanotechnology process that bonds hydrophobic polymers with natural fibers on the molecular level to make them water- and stain-repellent, a process that can be licensed by clothing brands. Translated it means that a linen or cotton or denim shirt looks and feels exactly like linen or cotton or denim, but if you spill cranberry juice (or soy sauce or wine) on it, the liquid beads right off.Recently they were in the \u201coffice\u201d hanging out near Jae Rhim Lee, an artist and TED fellow, who first became known for her \u201cburial shroud,\u201d an art project she created at M.I.T. that combined biological material (mushrooms) with textiles to help achieve perfect physical decomposition after death. \u201cBut I\u2019m not a designer, so it didn\u2019t look that attractive,\u201d she said.Ms. Parkes introduced Ms. Lee to Daniel Silverstein, a Fashion Institute of Technology graduate who had interned at Carolina Herrera before going out on his own, and who has a space in Manufacture NY denoted by a gold velvet vintage chaise, a silver bowl of apples and two rails of clothing. Mr. Silverstein redesigned the funeral shroud into a neatly tailored funeral suit, and now Ms. Lee plans to sell it for $1,500.Mr. Silverstein, meanwhile, spends most of his time creating sweatshirt-like tops, for his label ZWD (Zero Waste Daniel), that are painstakingly and personally collaged from scrap fabric left on the cutting-room floor at local factories, so that within its basic contours no one garment is the same. His goal is to connect with a company using visual algorithms that allow robots to identify and manipulate the scraps, which would allow him to automate the process and produce at scale (and use up ever more textile ends that would otherwise end up as landfill).\u201cIf you put designers and engineers really close to the manufacturing process, what happens is they realize they do things the way they do because they are working with machines that were made a long time ago,\u201d said Mr. Cohen of New Lab. \u201cSuddenly they say, \u2018Why not just make a new machine?\u2019 And it transforms the process.\u201dIndeed, process is the key word in the language of the new wearables, as it reflects the idea of technology used to improve the creation of an object, as opposed to technology that is the object in itself.Such was the genesis of Thesis Couture, a Manufacture NY start-up shoe line founded by Dolly Singh, the former head of talent at Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX, who in 2013 enlisted a rocket scientist, an orthopedic surgeon, a mechanical engineer, a shoe designer and an Italian shoemaker in her goal of re-engineering the stiletto.\u201cIt essentially hasn\u2019t changed since it was invented in 1950,\u201d said Ms. Singh, who has spent the last two years trying to build a better shoe. Now she says they have done it.The result, which is in prototype and they hope will be available to order next month, is a limited edition of 1,500 pairs, each pair selling for $900. On first view the shoe looks like a black leather high-heeled gladiator sandal very much in the Jimmy Choo/Christian Louboutin/Manolo Blahnik vein, except it is made of ballistic-grade thermal plastic polyurethane, the pieces of which snap together. There are no internal steel shanks, as is traditional. The trademarked system is known as \u201cstructural interlocking architecture\u201d and will make \u201ca four-inch stiletto feel like a wedge,\u201d Ms. Singh said.Thesis Couture\u2019s website already has a list of almost 11,000 interested consumers who are waiting to be notified when the shoe goes live, as well as another 2,100 who have registered to place orders. Ms. Singh plans to do a Series A fund-raising next year, at which point she intends to bring out a 21-piece collection, each style balanced on a towering spike and named after a high-achieving woman: the Sally Ride (a black ankle boot with a curve of gold beads), the Maya Angelou (an open-toe gladiator-style with a contrasting color heel), the Malala Yousafzai (a hot pink sandal with a gold ankle strap) and so on.\u201cThe fact is, technology has been a part of fashion forever,\u201d Mr. Bitonti said. \u201cFashion has always used tools, whether they are sewing machines or knitting needles.\u201dBack at the Met, Mr. Bolton called this \u201csilent technology\u201d \u2014 the tech you can\u2019t see, like the ultrasonic welding used by Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re in a floral dress for Louis Vuitton \u2014 and said that for him, it and the collaboration it represents is the future of fashion.Not to mention Brooklyn.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Kosovo Was Turned Into Fertile Ground for ISIS", "Date": "2016-05-21", "News": "Extremist clerics and secretive associations funded by Saudis and others have transformed a once-tolerant Muslim society into a font of extremism.Supported byPRISTINA, Kosovo \u2014 Every Friday, just yards from a statue of Bill Clinton with arm aloft in a cheery wave, hundreds of young bearded men make a show of kneeling to pray on the sidewalk outside an improvised mosque in a former furniture store.The mosque is one of scores built here with Saudi government money and blamed for spreading Wahhabism \u2014 the conservative ideology dominant in Saudi Arabia \u2014 in the 17 years since an American-led intervention wrested tiny Kosovo from Serbian oppression.Since then \u2014 much of that time under the watch of American officials \u2014 Saudi money and influence have transformed this once-tolerant Muslim society at the hem of Europe into a font of Islamic extremism and a pipeline for jihadists.Kosovo now finds itself, like the rest of Europe, fending off the threat of radical Islam. Over the last two years, the police have identified 314 Kosovars \u2014 including two suicide bombers, 44 women and 28 children \u2014 who have gone abroad to join the Islamic State, the highest number per capita in Europe.They were radicalized and recruited, Kosovo investigators say, by a corps of extremist clerics and secretive associations funded by Saudi Arabia and other conservative Arab gulf states using an obscure, labyrinthine network of donations from charities, private individuals and government ministries.\u201cThey promoted political Islam,\u201d said Fatos Makolli, the director of Kosovo\u2019s counterterrorism police. \u201cThey spent a lot of money to promote it through different programs mainly with young, vulnerable people, and they brought in a lot of Wahhabi and Salafi literature. They brought these people closer to radical political Islam, which resulted in their radicalization.\u201dAfter two years of investigations, the police have charged 67 people, arrested 14 imams and shut down 19 Muslim organizations for acting against the Constitution, inciting hatred and recruiting for terrorism. The most recent sentences, which included a 10-year prison term, were handed down on Friday.It is a stunning turnabout for a land of 1.8 million people that not long ago was among the most pro-American Muslim societies in the world. Americans were welcomed as liberators after leading months of NATO bombing in 1999 that spawned an independent Kosovo.After the war, United Nations officials administered the territory and American forces helped keep the peace. The Saudis arrived, too, bringing millions of euros in aid to a poor and war-ravaged land.But where the Americans saw a chance to create a new democracy, the Saudis saw a new land to spread Wahhabism.\u201cThere is no evidence that any organization gave money directly to people to go to Syria,\u201d Mr. Makolli said. \u201cThe issue is they supported thinkers who promote violence and jihad in the name of protecting Islam.\u201dKosovo now has over 800 mosques, 240 of them built since the war and blamed for helping indoctrinate a new generation in Wahhabism. They are part of what moderate imams and officials here describe as a deliberate, long-term strategy by Saudi Arabia to reshape Islam in its image, not only in Kosovo but around the world.Saudi diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks in 2015 reveal a system of funding for mosques, Islamic centers and Saudi-trained clerics that spans Asia, Africa and Europe. In New Delhi alone, 140 Muslim preachers are listed as on the Saudi Consulate\u2019s payroll.All around Kosovo, families are grappling with the aftermath of years of proselytizing by Saudi-trained preachers. Some daughters refuse to shake hands with or talk to male relatives. Some sons have gone off to jihad. Religious vigilantes have threatened \u2014 or committed \u2014 violence against academics, journalists and politicians.The Balkans, Europe\u2019s historical fault line, have yet to heal from the ethnic wars of the 1990s. But they are now infected with a new intolerance, moderate imams and officials in the region warn.How Kosovo and the very nature of its society was fundamentally recast is a story of a decades-long global ambition by Saudi Arabia to spread its hard-line version of Islam \u2014 heavily funded and systematically applied, including with threats and intimidation by followers.After the war ended in 1999, Idriz Bilalli, the imam of the central mosque in Podujevo, welcomed any help he could get.Podujevo, home to about 90,000 people in northeast Kosovo, was a reasonably prosperous town with high schools and small businesses in an area hugged by farmland and forests. It was known for its strong Muslim tradition even in a land where people long wore their religion lightly.After decades of Communist rule when Kosovo was part of Yugoslavia, men and women mingle freely, schools are coeducational, and girls rarely wear the veil. Still, Serbian paramilitary forces burned down 218 mosques as part of their war against Kosovo\u2019s ethnic Albanians, who are 95 percent Muslim. Mr. Bilalli needed help to rebuild.When two imams in their 30s, Fadil Musliu and Fadil Sogojeva, who were studying for master\u2019s degrees in Saudi Arabia, showed up after the war with money to organize summer religion courses, Mr. Bilalli agreed to help.The imams were just two of some 200 Kosovars who took advantage of scholarships after the war to study Islam in Saudi Arabia. Many, like them, returned with missionary zeal.Soon, under Mr. Musliu\u2019s tutelage, pupils started adopting a rigid manner of prayer, foreign to the moderate Islamic traditions of this part of Europe. Mr. Bilalli recognized the influence, and he grew concerned.\u201cThis is Wahhabism coming into our society,\u201d Mr. Bilalli, 52, said in a recent interview.Mr. Bilalli trained at the University of Medina in Saudi Arabia in the late 1980s, and as a student he had been warned by a Kosovar professor to guard against the cultural differences of Wahhabism. He understood there was a campaign of proselytizing, pushed by the Saudis.\u201cThe first thing the Wahhabis do is to take members of our congregation, who understand Islam in the traditional Kosovo way that we had for generations, and try to draw them away from this understanding,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce they get them away from the traditional congregation, then they start bombarding them with radical thoughts and ideas.\u201d\u201cThe main goal of their activity is to create conflict between people,\u201d he said. \u201cThis first creates division, and then hatred, and then it can come to what happened in Arab countries, where war starts because of these conflicting ideas.\u201dFrom the outset, the newly arriving clerics sought to overtake the Islamic Community of Kosovo, an organization that for generations has been the custodian of the tolerant form of Islam that was practiced in the region, townspeople and officials say.Muslims in Kosovo, which was a part of the Ottoman Empire for 500 years, follow the Hanafi school of Islam, traditionally a liberal version that is accepting of other religions.But all around the country, a new breed of radical preachers was setting up in neighborhood mosques, often newly built with Saudi money.In some cases, centuries-old buildings were bulldozed, including a historic library in Gjakova and several 400-year-old mosques, as well as shrines, graveyards and Dervish monasteries, all considered idolatrous in Wahhabi teaching.From their bases, the Saudi-trained imams propagated Wahhabism\u2019s tenets: the supremacy of Sharia law as well as ideas of violent jihad and takfirism, which authorizes the killing of Muslims considered heretics for not following its interpretation of Islam.The Saudi-sponsored charities often paid salaries and overhead costs, and financed courses in religion, as well as English and computer classes, moderate imams and investigators explained.But the charitable assistance often had conditions attached. Families were given monthly stipends on the condition that they attended sermons in the mosque and that women and girls wore the veil, human rights activists said.\u201cPeople were so needy, there was no one who did not join,\u201d recalled Ajnishahe Halimi, a politician who campaigned to have a radical Albanian imam expelled after families complained of abuse.Within a few years of the war\u2019s end, the older generation of traditional clerics began to encounter aggression from young Wahhabis.Paradoxically, some of the most serious tensions built in Gjilan, an eastern Kosovo town of about 90,000, where up to 7,000 American troops were stationed as part of Kosovo\u2019s United Nations-run peacekeeping force at Camp Bondsteel.\u201cThey came in the name of aid,\u201d one moderate imam in Gjilan, Enver Rexhepi, said of the Arab charities. \u201cBut they came with a background of different intentions, and that\u2019s where the Islamic religion started splitting here.\u201dOne day in 2004, he recalled, he was threatened by one of the most aggressive young Wahhabis, Zekirja Qazimi, a former madrasa student then in his early 20s.Inside his mosque, Mr. Rexhepi had long displayed an Albanian flag. Emblazoned with a double-headed eagle, it was a popular symbol of Kosovo\u2019s liberation struggle.But strict Muslim fundamentalists consider the depiction of any living being as idolatrous. Mr. Qazimi tore the flag down. Mr. Rexhepi put it back.\u201cIt will not go long like this,\u201d Mr. Qazimi told him angrily, Mr. Rexhepi recounted.Within days, Mr. Rexhepi was abducted and savagely beaten by masked men in woods above Gjilan. He later accused Mr. Qazimi of having been behind the attack, but police investigations went nowhere.Ten years later, in 2014, after two young Kosovars blew themselves up in suicide bombings in Iraq and Turkey, investigators began an extensive investigation into the sources of radicalism. Mr. Qazimi was arrested hiding in the same woods. On Friday, a court sentenced him to 10 years in prison after he faced charges of inciting hatred and recruiting for a terrorist organization.Before Mr. Qazimi was arrested, his influence was profound, under what investigators now say was the sway of Egyptian-based extremists and the patronage of Saudi and other gulf Arab sponsors.By the mid-2000s, Saudi money and Saudi-trained clerics were already exerting influence over the Islamic Community of Kosovo. The leadership quietly condoned the drift toward conservatism, critics of the organization say.Mr. Qazimi was appointed first to a village mosque, and then to El-Kuddus mosque on the edge of Gjilan. Few could counter him, not even Mustafa Bajrami, his former teacher, who was elected head of the Islamic Community of Gjilan in 2012.Mr. Bajrami comes from a prominent religious family \u2014 his father was the first chief mufti of Yugoslavia during the Communist period. He holds a doctorate in Islamic studies. Yet he remembers pupils began rebelling against him whenever he spoke against Wahhabism.He soon realized that the students were being taught beliefs that differed from the traditional moderate curriculum by several radical imams in lectures after hours. He banned the use of mosques after official prayer times.Hostility only grew. He would notice a dismissive gesture in the congregation during his sermons, or someone would curse his wife, or mutter \u201capostate\u201d or \u201cinfidel\u201d as he passed.In the village, Mr. Qazimi\u2019s influence eventually became so disruptive that residents demanded his removal after he forbade girls and boys to shake hands. But in Gjilan he continued to draw dozens of young people to his after-hours classes.\u201cThey were moving 100 percent according to lessons they were taking from Zekirja Qazimi,\u201d Mr. Bajrami said in an interview. \u201cOne hundred percent, in an ideological way.\u201dOver time, the Saudi-trained imams expanded their work.By 2004, Mr. Musliu, one of the master\u2019s degree students from Podujevo who studied in Saudi Arabia, had graduated and was imam of a mosque in the capital, Pristina.In Podujevo, he set up a local charitable organization called Devotshmeria, or Devotion, which taught religion classes and offered social programs for women, orphans and the poor. It was funded by Al Waqf al Islami, a Saudi organization that was one of the 19 eventually closed by investigators.Mr. Musliu put a cousin, Jetmir Rrahmani, in charge.\u201cThen I knew something was starting that would not bring any good,\u201d said Mr. Bilalli, the moderate cleric who had started out teaching with him. In 2004, they had a core of 20 Wahhabis.\u201cThat was only the beginning,\u201d Mr. Bilalli said. \u201cThey started multiplying.\u201dMr. Bilalli began a vigorous campaign against the spread of unauthorized mosques and Wahhabi teaching. In 2008, he was elected head of the Islamic Community of Podujevo and instituted religion classes for women, in an effort to undercut Devotshmeria.As he sought to curb the extremists, Mr. Bilalli received death threats, including a note left in the mosque\u2019s alms box. An anonymous telephone caller vowed to make him and his family disappear, he said.\u201cAnyone who opposes them, they see as an enemy,\u201d Mr. Bilalli said.He appealed to the leadership of the Islamic Community of Kosovo. But by then it was heavily influenced by Arab gulf sponsors, he said, and he received little support.When Mr. Bilalli formed a union of fellow moderates, the Islamic Community of Kosovo removed him from his post. His successor, Bekim Jashari, equally concerned by the Saudi influence, nevertheless kept up the fight.\u201cI spent 10 years in Arab countries and specialized in sectarianism within Islam,\u201d Mr. Jashari said. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to stop Arab sectarianism from being introduced to Kosovo.\u201dMr. Jashari had a couple of brief successes. He blocked the Saudi-trained imam Mr. Sogojeva from opening a new mosque, and stopped a payment of 20,000 euros, about $22,400, intended for it from the Saudi charity Al Waqf al Islami.He also began a website, Speak Now, to counter Wahhabi teaching. But he remains so concerned about Wahhabi preachers that he never lets his 19-year-old son attend prayers on his own.The radical imams Mr. Musliu and Mr. Sogojeva still preach in Pristina, where for prayers they draw crowds of young men who glare at foreign reporters.Mr. Sogojeva dresses in a traditional robe and banded cleric\u2019s hat, but his newly built mosque is an incongruous modern multistory building. He admonished his congregation with a rapid-fire list of dos and don\u2019ts in a recent Friday sermon.Neither imam seems to lack funds.In an interview, Mr. Musliu insisted that he was financed by local donations, but confirmed that he had received Saudi funding for his early religion courses.The instruction, he said, is not out of line with Kosovo\u2019s traditions. The increase in religiosity among young people was natural after Kosovo gained its freedom, he said.\u201cThose who are not believers and do not read enough, they feel a bit shocked,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we coordinated with other imams, and everything was in line with Islam.\u201dThe influence of the radical clerics reached its apex with the war in Syria, as they extolled the virtues of jihad and used speeches and radio and television talks shows to urge young people to go there.Mr. Qazimi, who was given the 10-year prison sentence, even organized a summer camp for his young followers.\u201cThe blood of infidels is the best drink for us Muslims,\u201d he said in another recording.Among his recruits, investigators say, were three former civilian employees of American contracting companies at Camp Bondsteel, where American troops are stationed. They included Lavdrim Muhaxheri, an Islamic State leader who was filmed executing a man in Syria with a rocket-propelled grenade.After the suicide bombings, the authorities opened a broad investigation and found that the Saudi charity Al Waqf al Islami had been supporting associations set up by preachers like Mr. Qazimi in almost every regional town.Al Waqf al Islami was established in the Balkans in 1989. Most of its financing came from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait and Bahrain, Kosovo investigators said in recent interviews. Unexplained gaps in its ledgers deepened suspicions that the group was surreptitiously funding clerics who were radicalizing young people, they said.Investigators from Kosovo\u2019s Financial Intelligence Unit found that Al Waqf al Islami, which had an office in central Pristina and a staff of 12, ran through \u20ac10 million from 2000 through 2012. Yet they found little paperwork to explain much of the spending.More than \u20ac1 million went to mosque building. But one and a half times that amount was disbursed in unspecified cash withdrawals, which may have also gone to enriching its staff, the investigators said.Only 7 percent of the budget was shown to have gone to caring for orphans, the charity\u2019s stated mission.By the summer of 2014, the Kosovo police shut down Al Waqf al Islami, along with 12 other Islamic charities, and arrested 40 people.The charity\u2019s head offices, in Saudi Arabia and the Netherlands, have since changed their name to Al Waqf, apparently separating themselves from the Balkans operation.Asked about the accusations in a telephone interview, Nasr el Damanhoury, the director of Al Waqf in the Netherlands, said he had no direct knowledge of his group\u2019s operations in Kosovo or the Balkans.The charity has ceased all work outside the Netherlands since he took over in 2013, he said. His predecessor had returned to Morocco and could not be reached, and Saudi board members would not comment, he said.\u201cOur organization has never supported extremism,\u201d Mr. Damanhoury said. \u201cI have known it since 1989. I joined them three years ago. They have always been a mild group.\u201dWhy the Kosovar authorities \u2014 and American and United Nations overseers \u2014 did not act sooner to forestall the spread of extremism is a question being intensely debated.As early as 2004, the prime minister at the time, Bajram Rexhepi, tried to introduce a law to ban extremist sects. But, he said in a recent interview at his home in northern Kosovo, European officials told him that it would violate freedom of religion.\u201cIt was not in their interest, they did not want to irritate some Islamic countries,\u201d Mr. Rexhepi said. \u201cThey simply did not do anything.\u201dNot everyone was unaware of the dangers, however.At a meeting in 2003, Richard C. Holbrooke, once the United States special envoy to the Balkans, warned Kosovar leaders not to work with the Saudi Joint Relief Committee for Kosovo, an umbrella organization of Saudi charities whose name still appears on many of the mosques built since the war, along with that of the former Saudi interior minister, Prince Naif bin Abdul-Aziz.A year later, it was among several Saudi organizations that were shut down in Kosovo when it came under suspicion as a front for Al Qaeda. Another was Al-Haramain, which in 2004 was designated by the United States Treasury Department as having links to terrorism.Yet even as some organizations were shut down, others kept working. Staff and equipment from Al-Haramain shifted to Al Waqf al Islami, moderate imams familiar with their activities said.In recent years, Saudi Arabia appears to have reduced its aid to Kosovo. Kosovo Central Bank figures show grants from Saudi Arabia averaging \u20ac100,000 a year for the past five years.It is now money from Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates \u2014 which each average approximately \u20ac1 million a year \u2014 that propagates the same hard-line version of Islam. The payments come from foundations or individuals, or sometimes from the Ministry of Zakat (Almsgiving) from the various governments, Kosovo\u2019s investigators say.While Saudi Arabia has made progress in stamping out funding for Al Qaeda, sympathetic donors in the kingdom were still funding other terrorist groups, he said.Today the Islamic Community of Kosovo has been so influenced by the largess of Arab donors that it has seeded prominent positions with radical clerics, its critics say.Ahmet Sadriu, a spokesman for Islamic Community of Kosovo, said the group held to Kosovo\u2019s traditionally tolerant version of Islam. But calls are growing to overhaul an organization now seen as having been corrupted by outside forces and money.Kosovo\u2019s interior minister, Skender Hyseni, said he had recently reprimanded some of the senior religious officials.\u201cI told them they were doing a great disservice to their country,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cKosovo is by definition, by Constitution, a secular society. There has always been historically an unspoken interreligious tolerance among Albanians here, and we want to make sure that we keep it that way.\u201dFor some in Kosovo, it may already be too late.Families have been torn apart. Some of Kosovo\u2019s best and brightest have been caught up in the lure of jihad.Ismet Sakiqi, an official in the prime minister\u2019s office and a veteran of the liberation struggle, was shaken to find his 22-year-old son, Visar, a law student, arrested on his way through Turkey to Syria with his fianc\u00e9e. He now visits his son in the same Kosovo prison where he was detained under Serbian rule.And in the hamlet of Busavate, in the wooded hills of eastern Kosovo, a widower, Shemsi Maliqi, struggles to explain how his family has been divided. One of his sons, Alejhim, 27, has taken his family to join the Islamic State in Syria.It remains unclear how Alejhim became radicalized. He followed his grandfather, training as an imam in Gjilan, and served in the village mosque for six years. Then, two years ago, he asked his father to help him travel to Egypt to study.Mr. Maliqi still clings to the hope that his son is studying in Egypt rather than fighting in Syria. But Kosovo\u2019s counterterrorism police recently put out an international arrest warrant for Alejhim.\u201cBetter that he comes back dead than alive,\u201d Mr. Maliqi, a poor farmer, said. \u201cI sent him to school, not to war. I sold my cow for him.\u201dAlejhim had married a woman from the nearby village of Vrbice who was so conservative that she was veiled up to her eyes and refused to shake hands with her brother-in-law.The wife\u2019s mother angrily refused to be interviewed. Her daughter did what was expected and followed her husband to Syria, she said.Secretly, Alejhim drew three others \u2014 his sister; his best friend, who married his sister; and his wife\u2019s sister \u2014 to follow him to Syria, too. The others have since returned, but remain radical and estranged from the family.Alejhim\u2019s uncle, Fehmi Maliqi, like the rest of the family, is dismayed. \u201cIt\u2019s a catastrophe,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "De Blasio\u2019s Press Secretary Says She Will Quit", "Date": "2016-05-05", "News": "Supported byIn his two and a half years as mayor, Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, has often lamented that his liberal policies have not been clearly conveyed to New Yorkers, pointing to those challenges as an explanation for the criticism that has buffeted his administration. The press office has undergone shifts in personnel and new hirings, including at least two rounds of changes since last May, when Ms. Hinton was brought in \u2014 filling a post that had been empty for three months.Ms. Hinton confirmed her resignation on Thursday afternoon, which she said was motivated, at least in part, by a desire to spend more time with her daughter, a junior in high school.\u201cFor the past year, I have had the privilege of being part of Mayor de Blasio\u2019s efforts to build affordable housing, prevent homelessness, educate pre-K students and support the mentally ill,\u201d she said in a statement to The New York Times. \u201cThe mayor\u2019s commitment and tenacity have turned progressive values into everyday realities for so many New York City families. I am proud to have been part of that effort and look forward to continuing to support the mayor\u2019s future successes.\u201dWhen she was appointed, Mr. de Blasio described Ms. Hinton as a \u201cbattle-tested communications professional\u201d and highlighted their work together at the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development when Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo was President Bill Clinton\u2019s housing secretary. Ms. Hinton is married to Howard Glaser, a former top Cuomo aide.But Ms. Hinton, 57, who early in her career was a reporter in Jackson, Miss., and became communications consultant for Democrats and high-profile officials, never fully assimilated into the core group of mayoral aides and City Hall decision makers. In some cases, she was not informed of important decisions until just before they were to be announced.That early stumble occurred during a moment of feuding between Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Cuomo, who was said to have privately bristled at someone as close to his orbit as Ms. Hinton taking the job with the mayor.Lately, the mayor has appeared to struggle with how to respond to the spate of inquiries, which have centered on whether his fund-raising activities \u2014 aimed at pressing for his liberal agenda or at getting Democrats elected to the State Senate in 2014 \u2014 went beyond the boundaries of the law. Prosecutors are looking both at campaign finance violations and, separately, at whether any favorable municipal action was taken on behalf of contributors.At one point last month, Mr. de Blasio said he would no longer take questions on the investigations. Two days later he decided to address the inquiries again. Since then he has spoken on a number of occasions, repeating that he holds himself and the administration \u201cto the highest ethical standards.\u201dOn Tuesday, Mr. de Blasio changed tack again: For nearly 20 minutes after a news conference on crime statistics and plans for a new police precinct in Queens, he sat alone behind a blue curtain-draped desk and answered questions from reporters who traveled from City Hall to the precinct, near the city\u2019s eastern border.City Hall officials have not named a replacement for Ms. Hinton, whose resignation was not among the series of changes to Mr. de Blasio\u2019s communications staff announced this week, including the hiring of a social media director and a new speechwriter.In a statement on Thursday, Mr. de Blasio praised Ms. Hinton\u2019s work for the administration in helping \u201cus inform New Yorkers about our vision\u201d and said she \u201cwill be missed.\u201d\u201cI thank Karen for her service, and I know she will remain a source of trusted advice for me and our team,\u201d the mayor said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Get Away With Insider Trading", "Date": "2016-05-23", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorThe prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission deserve credit, but it\u2019s a mixed victory: Neither the United States attorney nor the S.E.C. is prosecuting other people who benefited from the stock tips, including Mr. Mickelson. Why not? A serious shortfall in our law has hampered prosecutors and allowed insider traders \u2014 particularly those further down the chain of information \u2014 to dance around the rules.Our insider trading law has become overly complex and burdensome for two reasons. First, neither Congress nor the S.E.C. has ever defined \u201cinsider trading\u201d in a comprehensive way. So our laws are largely made by judges who, bound by precedent, rarely update law to fit new circumstances.Second, our laws seek to balance different goals. The United States (unlike some other nations) does not adopt a simple \u201cparity of information\u201d approach under which one cannot trade on material facts that are not publicly available. United States law also values market efficiency: We want to encourage people to seek new information about companies through legitimate research. So the law basically prohibits trading on nonpublic information only when it has been wrongfully obtained or used.He next turned to journalists, but they would not report on his findings for fear of libel suits. When he told his clients, these investors reacted immediately by dumping their stock so that the company\u2019s share price plummeted. Finally, the press paid attention, and the fraud was revealed.Mr. Dirks was widely regarded as the hero of this story, a private-market equivalent of Woodward and Bernstein. But an embarrassed S.E.C. went after Mr. Dirks for insider trading. When the case reached the Supreme Court, it, too, saw Mr. Dirks as the hero and reshaped the law to give security analysts a protective safe harbor: The \u201ctippee\u201d who is given the inside information is liable only when the \u201ctipper receives a direct or indirect personal benefit from the disclosure\u201d \u2014 in effect, a bribe of some kind.The \u201cpersonal benefit\u201d rule makes ignorance bliss. The sophisticated trader will understand that he is insulated from liability so long as he does not learn that a personal benefit was paid or promised. \u201cDon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d may become the new industry code of behavior. The rule overlooks how the \u201cfavor bank\u201d can work in a cozy industry like finance.The Newman decision is making prosecutions harder. Since he became United States attorney for the Southern District of New York in 2009, Preet Bharara has won more than 80 insider trading convictions in just a few years, but in the wake of Newman, at least 14 of those convictions have been overturned, and that number is likely to rise.Although the S.E.C. has resisted defining insider trading for decades, legislation now seems the best answer. We should eliminate the need to prove a \u201cpersonal benefit\u201d to the tipper, but not overrule the rest of the Dirks case. Thus, a trader who knows (or recklessly disregards) that his information was wrongfully obtained should be liable regardless of the benefit to the tipper. But someone who trades on market gossip or an analyst\u2019s projection should not be liable.If a presidential candidate of either party wants to show that he or she has not been \u201ccaptured\u201d by Wall Street, the best signal would be support for insider trading legislation and a promise to prod Congress to enact it. If Washington can ever agree on anything, Washington can agree on that.John C. Coffee Jr. is a professor at Columbia Law School.Advertisement"}

Mr. Whiteley, an artist, was nervous but not exactly surprised.On March 27, Easter Sunday, he had secretly dropped off his latest project in Central Park: a gravestone bearing the name of Donald J. Trump. The epitaph read \u201cMade America Hate Again.\u201d The stone was quickly removed by the parks department and confiscated by the police.\u201cIt was superintimidating,\u201d he said in a telephone interview on Monday evening, after his nearly hourlong interrogation. But the project was \u201c100 percent worth it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been literally terrified for about a month,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been like nightmare land, it really has, to pull this off.\u201d The arrival of the authorities was, in some way, a relief. \u201cI don\u2019t plan on stopping my guerrilla-style projects,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I do know my limits.\u201dAsked about the incident, a Secret Service spokesman said late Tuesday, \u201cThe Secret Service is aware of this matter and is conducting the appropriate follow-up investigation.\u201d Mr. Whiteley was not charged with a crime. The Trump campaign has also not commented.In a telephone conversation shortly after the gravestone\u2019s discovery, Mr. Whiteley said he was \u201cnot calling for the death of Donald.\u201d He continued, \u201cI\u2019m making an artistic statement,\u201d suggesting that Mr. Trump should rethink his legacy.\u201cI would call them somewhat stunts rather than artwork,\u201d said Tom Eccles, a curator with a background in public art. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunistic moment.\u201d\u201cIf the artist was investigated in a way to send a message to others, that would be chilling,\u201d he said.He added that at a time when much public art in New York is \u201cessentially corporate in some form,\u201d it was refreshing to see an unfiltered take. \u201cEven if I\u2019m not particularly engaged by the artwork, I applaud the effort of the artists,\u201d he said.Both Trump fans and opponents have been angered \u2014 \u201cThey don\u2019t understand why this bus is art,\u201d Ms. Mihelic said \u2014 but the artists have also had positive conversations. \u201cWe\u2019re very hopeful that art in this kind of absurd environment is useful,\u201d Mr. Gleeson said.They also asked him about what books he was reading, whether he owned a gun and whether he attended presidential rallies. \u201cLuckily, I think I passed all the marks that they needed to see,\u201d Mr. Whiteley said. \u201cI did not fit the profile\u201d of an assassin.Mr. Whiteley said that, in using a gravestone, he wanted to send an unmissable message to Mr. Trump. \u201cI thought the only thing that could affect someone who builds buildings and talks real loud and is the bully on the playground is to remind him of his own mortality,\u201d he said.After the police seized the gravestone, Mr. Whiteley said he contacted the fabricators, a family-owned memorial company in Brooklyn, to see if it would make \u201ca second edition.\u201d The company declined.

{"Headline": "With Nomination in Hand, Donald J. Trump Now Seeking a Hand", "Date": "2016-05-05", "News": "Supported byFor 10 months as he ran an insurgent presidential campaign, Donald J. Trump excoriated the Republican Party\u2019s donor class as a group of special interests whose support he did not want or need.That was then.Now Mr. Trump is the presumptive Republican nominee, with a newly-minted national finance chairman, Steve Mnuchin, who worked for Soros Fund Management and Goldman Sachs. And since Mr. Trump seems to have little interest in pouring hundreds of millions of dollars of his own money into a general election battle that will cost at least $1 billion, Mr. Mnuchin will lead efforts to raise that money from others.Mr. Trump is already facing a reluctant donor community, which he often demonized in his speeches, saying he will not be beholden to special interests or their money.\u201cI don\u2019t really see this as a change,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re not looking to raise money from special interest groups and things like that. The majority of the money that\u2019s coming in is going to be in small and medium-sized donations.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t see that being inconsistent\u201d with Mr. Trump\u2019s railing against Wall Street fat cats, Mr. Mnuchin said.Mr. Mnuchin said he had done business deals with Mr. Trump, though he declined to provide details. He said he attended Mr. Trump\u2019s New York primary victory party on April 19 and the next morning, the candidate called and asked if he would consider the post. He spent time traveling to Indiana with Mr. Trump, and they met in Los Angeles.Roger Stone, a close confidante and sometimes-adviser to Mr. Trump, defended the move.\u201cDonald Trump knows Wall Street will pay both sides,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t he take their money to beat Hillary? They are going to find out you can\u2019t co-opt Donald Trump. He\u2019s his own man with his own nationalist views. He can\u2019t be bought. Sure, he\u2019ll take their money, but he won\u2019t change his views on immigration, trade or NATO or his commitment to make hedge fund managers pay their fair share of taxes.\u201dOn Thursday, Mr. Trump got a potentially significant lift in the form of an endorsement from Sheldon G. Adelson, a casino magnate who gave more than $100 million to Republican groups in the 2012 election.Current polls show an uphill battle for Donald Trump should he and Hillary Clinton face off in the general election.For now, however, many donors remain unconvinced.\u201cTrump has been the political equivalent of when you\u2019re dating a guy and he\u2019s giving you all these messages that he\u2019s just not that into you,\u201d said Theresa Kostrzewa, a lobbyist based in North Carolina and a Republican bundler who supported Jeb Bush this cycle. \u201cThat\u2019s really what he\u2019s told Republican donors and fund-raisers up until now \u2014 not only that he\u2019s just not that into you, but that I don\u2019t need you, I don\u2019t want you, and you stink.\u201dMr. Mnuchin said the campaign is working on a joint fund-raising agreement with the Republican National Committee, and noted that some donors have already announced their support, such as the Nascar chief, Brian France, and Andy Beal, a California-based donor. Mr. Mnuchin anticipated that roughly 30 staffers would end up devoted to fund-raising for the campaign and party.But already, many of the party\u2019s major donors are eyeing Mr. Trump warily. Woody Johnson, the heir to the Johnson and Johnson fortune and a former Jeb Bush backer whom Mr. Trump singled out for scorn in February, declined to comment on his plans for the general election.Paul Singer, a major funder of Senate races, \u201cwas \u2018Never Trump\u2019 yesterday and is \u2018Never Trump\u2019 today,\u201d a person briefed on his thinking said on Wednesday.Ms. Kostrzewa added that Mr. Trump would be at a disadvantage because, unlike other candidates who often have a vast donor network for their previous political campaigns, Mr. Trump is practically starting from scratch.Some top Republican donors also wonder if Mr. Trump has the patience to headline fund-raisers, where top-dollar donors often expect the candidate to spend several hours at an event \u2014 posing for photographs, speaking at a dinner, and then lingering after for small talk. At a Republican retreat last year in Boca Raton, Fla., Mr. Trump offered brief remarks at a postdinner reception, but notably did not shake hands and stay after, as many other 2016 hopefuls did.Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s firm purchased OneWest, the remnant of a California-based mortgage lender that collapsed during the financial crisis, and the bank came under scrutiny for its harsh foreclosure practices. One New York State Court judge described OneWest\u2019s behavior as \u201charsh, repugnant, shocking and repulsive.\u201dMr. Mnuchin was vague when asked about whether Mr. Trump would seek to soothe donors\u2019 egos by creating tiers of top bundlers, the way that Mitt Romney and Senator John McCain and President George W. Bush did. He also did not answer whether the campaign plans to explicitly sanction \u201csuper PAC\u201d money.Mr. Mnuchin said that by working with the Republican Party, he expected to raise \u201cin excess of $1 billion,\u201d but added that the finance operation may bear some trademark Trump hallmarks.\u201cLike everything with Donald\u2019s campaign, there will have aspects that\u2019s conventional fund-raising, but there will have aspects that\u2019s not conventional fund-raising,\u201d he said.Kitty Bennett and Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hackers\u2019 $81 Million Sneak Attack on World Banking", "Date": "2016-04-30", "News": "Supported byTens of millions of dollars siphoned from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. A shadowy set of casinos in the Philippines. A large bank in Bangladesh with creaky technology. An unknown \u2014 and perhaps uncatchable \u2014 group of anonymous thieves with sophisticated hacking skills.Swift \u2014 the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication \u2014 is billed as a supersecure system that banks use to authorize payments from one account to another. \u201cThe Rolls-Royce of payments networks,\u201d one financial analyst said.But last week, for the first time since hackers captured $81 million from Bangladesh\u2019s central bank in February, Swift acknowledged that the thieves have tried to carry out similar heists at other banks on its network by sneaking into the beating heart of the global banking system.The admission that the attack was not a one-time event in a developing country but perhaps part of a broader threat has thrust Swift into a spotlight, raising questions about how securely money is being moved around the world. Some financial security experts point out the Swift system is only as safe as its weakest link.The attack also reflects a growing sophistication among digital criminals, who for years have been breaching personal bank accounts and stealing credit card credentials. The thieves in Bangladesh may have spent months lurking inside the central bank\u2019s computers, studying how to steal the necessary credentials to gain access to Swift.In the United States, most banks take special precautions with their Swift computers, building multiple firewalls to isolate the system from the bank\u2019s other networks and keeping the machines physically isolated in a separate locked room.But elsewhere, some banks take far fewer precautions. And security experts who have analyzed the Swift breach said they had concluded that the Bangladesh bank may have been particularly vulnerable to an attack.In some ways, Swift is a testament to how technology has helped all countries \u2014 including poorer ones \u2014 gain access to the financial system. But that broader access has a downside.The central bank in Bangladesh, by some accounts, employed fewer protections against cyberattacks than many other large banks. The bank, for example, used $10 routers and no firewalls, according to news reports.The server software that the Bangladesh bank employed was a Swift product called Alliance Access, which connects banks to the central messaging system. In a sign of how seriously Swift regards the breach of Alliance Access, the group issued a \u201cmandatory software update\u201d last week to help its members identify possible irregularities.Swift\u2019s core is built on technology that has been evolving for decades. What began in 1973 as a relatively small network of 240 banks in Europe and North America is now a sprawling network of 11,000 users that includes both banks and large corporations. At first, Swift could be used to authorize payments across national borders. But it is now also used to transmit messages related to domestic payments, securities settlements and other transactions.Swift\u2019s growth in recent years \u2014 it set a record for messages in March \u2014 reflects the increasingly global and interconnected nature of finance. But it also shows the risk of so many financial instructions running through a single system made up of a patchwork of banks and companies with varying levels of online protection.Each bank on the Swift network is identified by a set of codes. And it was the codes assigned to the Bank of Bangladesh that were recognized \u2014 correctly \u2014 by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York when it transferred $81 million of the Bangladesh bank\u2019s money to the Philippines, not knowing that someone, somewhere, had stolen the credentials of the Bangladesh bank and installed malware to cover his or her tracks.Initially, the thieves requested the transfer of $951 million into a handful of bank accounts in Sri Lanka and the Philippines \u2014 a number that prompted the New York Fed to ask the Bangladesh bank to reconfirm that it indeed wanted to move the money.In the end, the Fed processed only five of the 35 fraudulent payment requests, after it could not reconfirm with officials in Bangladesh.The hackers seemed to time the attack perfectly: When officials from the Fed tried to reach out to Bangladesh, it was a weekend there and no one was working. By the time central bankers in Bangladesh discovered the fraud, it was the weekend in New York and the Fed offices were closed.To conceal the crime, the malware disabled a printer in the Bangladesh bank to prevent officials from reviewing a log of the fraudulent transfers.The money was transferred to accounts in the Philippines and then into the Philippine casino system, which is exempt from many of the country\u2019s anti-money-laundering requirements.The New York Fed has been criticized for letting the $81 million slip out. Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a New York Democrat and member of the Financial Services Committee, has called for an investigation, warning that the breach \u201cthreatens to undermine the confidence that foreign central banks have in the Federal Reserve, and in the safety and soundness of international monetary transactions.\u201dThe New York Fed said in a statement that \u201cthere is no evidence that any Fed systems were compromised\u201d and that the transfer of the money had been \u201cfully authenticated\u201d by Swift.Swift, which prides itself on its secrecy and low public profile, also put out a statement about the attacks. But its executives declined to speak on the record about the episodes, which are still under investigation. The group\u2019s chairman, Yawar Shah, who is a senior executive at Citigroup, also declined to comment.In its statement, Swift emphasized that the hackers had been able to breach only some of the banks that communicate over Swift, not the network itself.\u201cThe commonality in what we have seen is that (internal or external) attackers have successfully compromised banks\u2019 own environments,\u201d Swift said.Even if officials at the Bangladesh bank had employed the highest of security measures, the thieves displayed a level of skill, cunning and determination that may have been able to penetrate a far more secure system.\u201cIf you have an attacker who really wants to get in and knows there is a big prize,\u201d Mr. Nish said, \u201ckeeping them out over the long term is really difficult.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Louis, Gannett\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chairman, said in a statement. Tribune said its board was contemplating the offer.

{"Headline": "\u2018I Will Kill Him\u2019: Afghan Commander Targets Son, a Taliban Fighter", "Date": "2016-05-15", "News": "Supported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 Since he first picked up a gun as a 15-year-old, Abdul Basir has killed a lot of people. Yet the operation on Friday night was different: He was out to kill his son.Around midnight on Friday, Mr. Basir, now in his 40s and the commander of a government militia in the northern Afghan province of Faryab, arrived at a compound in an area called Zyaratgah, part of the restive Qaisar District. He had intelligence that his 22-year-old son, Said Muhammad, a hardened member of the Taliban, was there with several of his fighters.Framed by grand ideologies and elaborate strategies at the top, the perpetual conflict has divided families for a generation. Guerrillas who took up arms against the Soviet occupation became sworn enemies of their Communist relatives. Now, a government commander was hunting down a son who had denounced him as an infidel and forced him from their family\u2019s ancestral village.\u201cI went with full confidence \u2014 I wanted to kill him first,\u201d Mr. Basir said in a telephone interview on Sunday. \u201cIt is up to God, but I think his blood is legitimate for me.\u201dMr. Basir\u2019s men barged into the compound, entering on the second floor, which they found empty. On the first floor, they spotted Mr. Muhammad trying to escape. Mr. Basir aimed his Kalashnikov rifle and opened fire.\u201cHe dropped from the window, and I thought I killed him,\u201d Mr. Basir said.Three Taliban fighters were killed in the operation, but not Mr. Muhammad. He was wounded in the head, Mr. Basir said, but somehow made his way back to the family village, which is now under his control.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me at all to see members of the same family fighting in two fronts,\u201d said Faizullah Jalal, a professor of political science at Kabul University.The case in Faryab, Mr. Jalal said, is a continuation of a phenomenon that reached its peak during the 1980s, with clashes between the Communist government in Kabul and guerrillas who received support from the C.I.A.\u201cThere were many cases where a son was on one side and the father on the other side, and the differences were so deep that they were willing to kill each other if they could,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just one or two or even 100 cases, but thousands.\u201dEven as the leadership on both sides of the conflict has eroded, with the fundamentalist Taliban increasingly acting like a drug cartel and the government drowning in corruption, the ideological pull at the lower levels remains strong. As the leaders prosper, the foot soldiers on both sides continue to die in large numbers, sometimes at the hands of their relatives.Mr. Basir is a product of a war with many chapters but no apparent ending. He was the age of a high school freshman when he joined the ranks of a warlord. The Soviets, their empire on the verge of disintegration, were withdrawing from Afghanistan, and the conflict they were leaving behind would soon turn into a bitter civil war.Mr. Basir has not put down his guns since, not even when militiamen like him were supposedly disarmed during a costly campaign financed by international donors after the American invasion.\u201cI have killed at least 150 Taliban, with my own hands, with my own bullets,\u201d Mr. Basir boasted.But the struggle turned personal when his son became an enemy.About five years ago, Mr. Basir said, he realized that Said had come under the influence of a local cleric who had ties to the Taliban. One day, when Mr. Basir\u2019s militia was operating in a different part of Faryab, his son formally joined the militants. Even worse, he took his father\u2019s cache of about 50,000 Kalashnikov bullets, 42 magazines and one Kalashnikov.Mr. Basir was angry but forgiving. After all, it was his own blood. Local elders mediated, and after much effort Mr. Muhammad returned to his family. To prove that he had given up on the insurgency, he joined the Afghan Army, serving for two and half years in eastern Paktia Province.But Mr. Basir, who has seven other children, questioned whether Mr. Muhammad\u2019s beliefs had changed, and feared that he might betray his comrades, perhaps by surrendering army posts to the militants.Last year, Mr. Muhammad bore out Mr. Basir\u2019s suspicions by returning to the Taliban, and he eventually made his father an outcast.\u201cI told him: \u2018Come, my son., I want to arrange a wife for you, get you married,\u2019\u201d Mr. Basir said. A second son, Abdul Rahman, 20, has also joined the Taliban, but Mr. Basir said Abdul Rahman was not as \u201cbrutal\u201d as Said. (Like many Afghans, the family does not use a common surname.)Mr. Basir said Mr. Muhammad had threatened to \u201ckill me \u2014 he will skin me.\u201dThe decision to try to kill his son was the last resort, Mr. Basir said, after he realized there was no hope of a return.On Friday, the police chief of Qaisar District, Lt. Nizamuddin, received a call from Mr. Basir, asking for reinforcements.\u201cHe told me he had called his son many times to leave the Taliban, but he had refused,\u201d the lieutenant said. \u201cHe wanted to go get him.\u201dAnd Mr. Basir had no plans for an arrest \u2014 he went to Zyaratgah to kill. Now that Mr. Muhammad has survived, the plan will not change.\u201cI will kill him,\u201d Mr. Basir said. \u201cHe is a Talib. I cannot have mercy.\u201dZahra Nader and Jawad Sukhanyar contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Populist Policies Let Brazil\u2019s Tomorrow Slip Away", "Date": "2016-05-03", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneNot too long ago, Brazilians might have been counted as the most optimistic people in the world. From 2008 to 2013, as the United States and Europe grappled with the aftermath of a crisis wrought by blind trust in unfettered finance, Brazil\u2019s income per person grew 12 percent after inflation. Wages soared. The poverty rate plummeted. Even income inequality narrowed.Brazil remained only a high-middle-income country, in the technospeak of the International Monetary Fund. But for the first time in forever, the eternal \u201ccountry of tomorrow,\u201d as Brazilians often ruefully described their nation, saw itself instead as a rampant member of the emerging cohort of BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) \u2014 maybe even closer than China to making the jump into the ranks of the world\u2019s richest nations.And then it didn\u2019t happen.Between 2015 and 2017, the Brazilian economy is expected to shrink 8 percent, in the I.M.F.\u2019s estimation. That is deeper than the contraction of the early 1980s, which began what in Brazil and much of Latin America is still known as the \u201clost decade.\u201dWhat gives?Mistaken hopes inspired by high commodity prices are common in Latin America. With China insatiably buying Brazilian iron and soybeans, it was hard for policy makers not to feel invincible as rock-bottom interest rates in the United States pushed a wave of money into Brazilian bonds.\u201cLula thought he was an economic genius,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 A. Scheinkman, a noted Brazilian economist now at Columbia University, about Brazil\u2019s previous president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who stepped down in January 2011.The commodity boom, however, did not a new economic paradigm make. The hubristic belief that it had led to critical policy mistakes.\u201cThe boom delayed other policies that were costly to implement: judicial reforms, tax reforms, education reforms, labor market reforms, opening up to foreign trade,\u201d said Alejandro Werner, who heads the Western Hemisphere department at the I.M.F.When Dilma Rousseff succeeded Mr. da Silva as president, she doubled down on the populist alternative. Markets are overrated, she concluded. The kind of politically painful but economically beneficial reforms the I.M.F. likes are pointless. Better to develop the economy by the hand of the state.Brazil\u2019s economy has long been notably closed to the world. Its average applied tariff of 10 percent, according to the World Trade Organization, is the highest among the BRICS. But that did not stop the Brazilian government from further increasing subsidies and protection for favored sectors, like the auto industry. The three federal development banks did so much subsidized lending that by last year they accounted for well over half of all lending in Brazil.There is nothing inherently wrong with government action to spur the economy. Yet the Brazilian government did not know when to stop. Often, interventions smacked more of political opportunism than ideological resolve. Increases in the minimum wage \u2014 a critical benchmark used to index wages, pensions and a host of prices \u2014 were extremely popular. So were caps on regulated prices for gasoline and electricity, which kept the inflation rate from rising way past its official target.\u201cIt was a classical mistake of political economy,\u201d said Rubens Ric\u00fapero, a Brazilian economist and diplomat who was minister of finance in the mid-1990s. \u201cThey wanted to stay in power.\u201dMonica de Bolle, a Brazilian economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, dates the populist shift to 2006, when President da Silva was hit with a vote-buying scandal known as \u201cmensal\u00e3o.\u201d\u201cAfter that he became much more populist,\u201d she said. \u201cHe needed support not to be ousted from office.\u201dEven without the scandals and mistakes, Brazil would be facing rocky times. China\u2019s cooling appetite for Brazil\u2019s commodities and the gradual tightening of monetary policy in the United States were bound to slow the economy. But what turned the downturn into a crisis was bad policy making. When the foreign outlook dimmed, Brazil\u2019s economy was strangled by fast-rising public debt fed by billions in loans gone bad to former national champions.Revelations of rampant corruption were hardly surprising, given the cozy relationship between corporate Brazil and a government dispensing contracts, subsidies, preferred loans and other protections.What is the rest of the world to learn from Brazil\u2019s troubles?\u201cLula walked back slowly to the old closed economic model,\u201d said Arm\u00ednio Fraga, who headed the central bank in the 1990s, during Brazil\u2019s fairly brief flirtation with opening up its economy. \u201cIt worked while commodities and financial conditions were doing well but became unsustainable when that was over.\u201dBrazil was not alone. Until the 1980s, governments all over Latin America flirted with similar policies of state control. More recently, Venezuela and Argentina spent much of the last 10 years increasing the government\u2019s hold on the economy.One important lesson is that the choices faced by governments in Latin America and developing nations around the world do not necessarily pit free markets against policies to combat poverty and foster social inclusion. Brazil\u2019s anti-poverty strategy started in the 1990s, well before its turn toward state control. And most of Brazil\u2019s enormous subsidies over the last few years went to large corporations, not the poor.\u201cBusinessmen all supported the interventions with the exchange rate and interest rates, the subsidized credit and the interventions in prices of electricity and gasoline,\u201d said Marcos Lisboa, who heads Insper, an educational and research institute in S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cThey didn\u2019t support opening the country to trade.\u201dNor do Brazil\u2019s misfortunes amount to a wholesale indictment of the Latin American left. Mr. Ric\u00fapero, the former finance minister, notes that Bolivia and Ecuador, run by left-leaning governments, exhibited more cautious economic management and avoided Brazil\u2019s fate.\u201cNot every government with a social inclination will necessarily do the same as Brazil,\u201d he said.Brazil\u2019s downfall offers a more complicated lesson: Development is hard. And if Brazil\u2019s rise and fall offer lessons about government\u2019s inherent limitations, the Great American Meltdown of 2008 similarly offers a cautionary tale about allowing markets to run wild.But there are other common-sense recommendations to come out of such experiences: Invest in human capital, manage commodity bonanzas with caution, recognize that openness to foreign competition is necessary to develop.As President Obama might put it, don\u2019t do stupid stuff. Easy, feel-good recipes \u2014 especially those found wanting in the past \u2014 will probably fail if you try them again. That goes for the United States, too. America\u2019s very own populist, Donald Trump \u2014 offering walls and tariff barriers to his aggrieved supporters \u2014 could learn something from the Brazilian experience. He probably won\u2019t.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Inverted Jenny, Object of Intrigue in Stamp World, Re-emerges After 61 Years", "Date": "2016-05-22", "News": "Supported byGrace NotesThe question is, will a certain Inverted Jenny be cleared for landing at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan in the next few days?This has nothing to do with air traffic controllers or glide paths. This has to do with a 24-cent postage stamp, one of the most famous ever printed, famous because it was a mistake. The experts say it was No. 76 on a sheet of 100 with upside-down biplanes \u2014 the instantly recognizable Inverted Jennies \u2014 that slipped past inspectors at a printing plant in Washington in 1918, to the chagrin of postal officials and the delight of stamp collectors ever since.But legal turbulence may stall the arrival of No. 76.There is a reward at stake \u2014 actually, two rewards. In 2014, the library offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to the recovery of No. 76, which was missing at the time, and $10,000 for another missing Jenny. At the same time, a prominent stamp dealer, Donald Sundman of Camden, N.Y., offered rewards of $50,000 for each of the two stamps.Jenny No. 76 had been missing for 61 years. It disappeared at a stamp show in Norfolk, Va., in 1955.Who took off with her four Jennies remains a mystery. \u201cThat\u2019s why you have armed guards that walk the floor of stamp shows these days,\u201d Mr. English said. The Federal Bureau of Investigation investigated but never made any arrests.Eventually \u2014 no one knows exactly when \u2014 the block of Jennies was separated into four single stamps. One surfaced in 1958 in the hands of a Chicago-area stamp dealer. The F.B.I. decided not to prosecute him. That stamp made its way to the research library in the 1970s because Mrs. McCoy had given up her ownership rights and signed an agreement that said any Jennies that turned up should go to the library. A second stolen Jenny from her block appeared in 1982, two years after she died.The story the man told Mr. Eveleth \u2014 and, later, Mr. English \u2014 was that his grandfather had died a couple of years ago, leaving him some stamps. \u201cHe did not know the collection he inherited included a stamp that was of some value,\u201d Mr. English said. \u201cI think he got curious, looking to dispose of it, and started looking through the pile, did some research online and realized it might be worth some money.\u201dIn \u201cimpeccable condition,\u201d he said, Inverted Jennies \u201ccan go for a lot.\u201d The estimates for No. 58 range from $525,000 to $1.6 million.Mr. English said the man had maintained that he did not know how his grandfather had acquired the stamp. The only document that came with it was a curious letter from a long-gone Manhattan stamp dealer that Mr. English described as the stamp world\u2019s equivalent of a pawnshop.The letter, from October 1965, outlined a buyback agreement. The stamp dealer, S. H. Engel & Company, paid the collector who had brought it in $9,500. Engel gave the collector the right to repurchase it, for $11,500, within a year. Mr. English\u2019s assumption is that the collector did not come back with the extra $2,000 to reclaim it, and that the dealer sold it to another customer. Who that was, no one knows.\u201cWe\u2019re skeptical,\u201d Mr. Lyons recalled of their reaction, \u201cbut 10 or 15 minutes later, we look at each other and say, \u2018It\u2019s genuine.\u2019\u201d He said they called the F.B.I. An agency spokesman did not return a call seeking comment.Mr. Lyons and Mr. Kaufman determined that the stamp had been altered \u2014 the perforations on the left side and on the top were recut.They also began figuring out which of the 100 stamps it was, checking the position of the plane in the oval frame, the position of the frame itself and the position of the perforations. Robert G. Rose, the chairman of the foundation, said there were even subtle variations of alignment and ink from plane to plane and frame to frame. They concluded it was No. 76.So far, the man who brought the stamp to Spink has not been paid anything. Mr. English said last week that he expected to present an agreement to his board this week. If approved, the deal would allow the library to take ownership of the stamp during the stamp show, and it would clear the way for the man to receive a payment. (The United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan would also have to have a hand in such an agreement to resolve the question of whether the stamp is stolen property, but a spokeswoman for the office declined to discuss the case.)Mr. Sundman said he would not mind paying for No. 76. But what about the fourth McCoy stamp, the one that has not been heard from since it disappeared?Mr. Sundman said he got a call about it last year from a man he had never met.\u201cHe said, \u2018I know who has the stamps and who took them,\u2019\u201d Mr. Sundman recalled. \u201cHe had this theory it was the spouse of somebody who worked for the A.P.S. in the \u201950s\u201d \u2014 the philatelic society \u2014 \u201cand he said, \u2018They\u2019re not going to give it up.\u2019\u201dMr. Sundman said he asked how the caller knew that. \u201cHe said: \u2018I\u2019m a psychic. These things just come to me.\u2019 That was pretty much it. Other than the psychic, I have nothing on the fourth stamp.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "I.M.F. Takes Firmer Stand Favoring Relief for Greek Debt", "Date": "2016-05-17", "News": "Supported byBRUSSELS \u2014 The International Monetary Fund is increasing demands for Greek debt relief, setting up another potential standoff with creditors over the country\u2019s bailout, and threatening to create more political and economic uncertainty at an already tumultuous time for Europe.This I.M.F.\u2019s position opens the next act in the long-running Greek debt crisis, casting the fund against Germany and many of the other eurozone creditors.The fund is playing the role of the financial police, adamant that Greece will never return to growth if its debt burden is not sustainable. And Germany is the political pragmatist, leaning on Greece to stick with its austerity commitments lest it set a bad precedent for future bailouts and provoke unrest at home.The tenor of the debate, while echoing the recent rhetoric, has changed in this latest run. The I.M.F. is now taking a firmer stand ahead of a meeting of eurozone finance ministers next week, by outlining specific demands on the cost and the timing of the debt payments, according to three people who spoke on condition of anonymity.Whether they represent the fund\u2019s absolute position or a starting point for negotiations, the demands leave Germany in a difficult spot.If Germany gives too much, Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s government will face pressure from the political far right for forcing taxpayers to bear an even bigger burden of Greece\u2019s past profligacy. If it gives too little, the government might not receive the support of the I.M.F. for the bailout, which many German lawmakers have made a condition of further support for Greece. Those lawmakers see the I.M.F. as a guarantor of fiscal rigor.Unless the two sides find common ground \u2014 or agree to further delay the I.M.F.\u2019s participation in the latest bailout \u2014 the situation could soon come to a head. Greece needs the next disbursement of bailout money to make billions of dollars of debt payments through July. And the stakes are even higher now, as the region grapples with a renewed wave of terrorism, a migrant crisis and the uncertainty created by a vote in Britain over whether to leave the European Union.The I.M.F. publicly sounded the alarms on Greece\u2019s debt load last summer, as creditors developed a plan for the bailout of 86 billion euros ($97 billion), the country\u2019s third lifeline since the crisis began seven years ago. Without debt relief, the fund said, it would not participate in the latest rescue. To the fund, Greece\u2019s debt, about 300 billion euros ($340 billion), is simply unsustainable.As the economic and political challenges intensify, the I.M.F. is staking out more specific turf.The restructuring plan will be a tough sell. There is a sense among the eurozone creditors that the I.M.F. is being overly pessimistic about Greece\u2019s outlook, to help drum up support for debt relief. While European officials have been playing up signs that Greece is bottoming out, the I.M.F. has been more skeptical about the country\u2019s potential to raise revenue, shore up its budget and overhaul its economy.European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.There is a wide gap on the economic picture. Europeans estimate that Greece will hit a primary surplus \u2014 a budget in the black, before debt repayments \u2014 of 3.5 percent by 2018. The fund figures it would be closer to 1.5 percent at that point.\u201cThere is a very strong belief in Europe that the I.M.F. is essentially cooking the numbers by being overly pessimistic about political and economic developments in Greece in order to strong-arm Northern Europe into providing more generous debt relief,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, the Europe director for the Eurasia Group.Germany, and the rest of Europe, cannot afford to let Greece\u2019s economic crisis implode right now. As one of the main entry points for asylum seekers, Greece is an important piece of Europe\u2019s efforts to manage the influx of migrants, so the country\u2019s stability is especially crucial.Tens of thousands of migrants have become stranded in Greece, their plans to travel farther north blocked by border shutdowns throughout the Balkans. That already has forced Athens to ask for emergency financing and supplies, including tents, blankets, sleeping bags and ambulances. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has frequently asserted that Greece is struggling with the burden of the migration crisis at the same time that it is putting austerity measures in place.Publicly, Germany has stayed away from linking the bailout to the migrant crisis even as Ms. Merkel\u2019s leadership has come under threat from a surge in popularity for the Alternative for Germany, a right-wing populist party that has opposed her open-door refugee policies.Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Germany\u2019s finance minister, has said he sees \u201cno argument\u201d for acceding to the I.M.F.\u2019s demands.But privately, Germany and the European creditors appear to be open to negotiation, given the current environment. When eurozone finance ministers discussed the bailout terms last week, they formally debated, for the first time, ways to ease Greece\u2019s giant debt burden.While they have ruled out cutting the value of Greece\u2019s debt, more palatable measures like lower interest rates and longer repayment periods are on the table. In that way, they don\u2019t look that far apart from the I.M.F., even if they don\u2019t agree on the specifics and differ sharply on Greece\u2019s outlook.Eurozone officials are also trying to provide confidence to the I.M.F. that Greece won\u2019t go fiscally off course. Last week, the finance ministers agreed to a mechanism that is supposed to kick into effect with additional austerity measures if Greece doesn\u2019t meet its fiscal targets from now until 2018.Greek lawmakers are expected to vote on Sunday on that mechanism, along with another set of austerity measures. They are widely expected to pass.But, as ever in the seemingly unending crisis in Greece, much is likely to be left unresolved.\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is another muddling through by the creditors, and that means the I.M.F.\u2019s future role in the program and the related question of debt relief aren\u2019t going to be settled any time soon \u2014 and certainly not by next week,\u201d said Carsten Nickel, the deputy director of research at Teneo Intelligence, a political risk consulting firm.Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about the International Monetary Fund\u2019s push for debt relief for Greece misstated the dollar equivalent of 300 billion euros, the nation\u2019s current debt. It is $340 billion, not $340 million.Niki Kitsantonis contributed reporting from Athens.Advertisement"}

Dan Gagnier, whose clients include hedge funds and industrial companies, has also started his own firm.  Ren\u00c3\u00a9e Soto is expected to continue consulting for Valeant, the pharmaceuticals company. Other less senior employees have quit to join Mr. Gasthalter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new company. Under the proposed agreement, Golden Gate would value Sard Verbinnen at about $150 million. Golden Gate has agreed to invest up to $50 million more. The investment would allow the company to expand, potentially opening new offices in Washington, Hong Kong and Houston. The move would affect asset managers, hedge funds and insurance companies that do business regularly with banks through contracts known as qualified financial contracts.  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "Once upon a time, there was a city where people looked at each other or their surroundings instead of their cellphones. Where they spoke to one another, rather than making some clever online comment. Back then, in the 1970s, Manhattan was still rough, and not just on the edges, but through and through, it seemed. And so it was a time when street photographers could roam the streets and find inspiration all around, engaging with their subjects to capture moments of subtlety, beauty and serendipity. This was the New York that Carrie Boretz discovered when she started working in 1975 as a photo intern at The Village Voice.  There was enough to be found on the street that she did not have to make a living doing still lifes or fashion. She wanted real life.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI just wanted to be on the street and shoot normal people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI saw things clearly. Things just bombarded my vision. It was so easy, it often didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem like work, to be honest.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHer images through the decades show a photographer engaged with the city, finding unexpected moments, often with a sly sense of humor. Many of them also have something that can only be called heart, evoking in the viewer a feeling that connects them to what is happening in these carefully composed frames.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI never shoot with my eye,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Boretz said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my heart that leads. I feel too much, that heart on the sleeve thing. I tried to be an intellectual person, but that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fly.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMs. Boretz was born and raised on Long Island, surrounded by images from the Farm Security Administration. Her father, Alvin, was a television writer and playwright who was friends with the F.S.A. photographer Russell Lee. She still recalls how her parents would sit down with her and go through Library of Congress prints by the great F.S.A. photographers.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was mesmerized by images from the 1940s,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt seemed natural to want to be one, I was always comfortable with a camera. I was shy, too, and this was a way to get out there.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Lee proved to be an early supporter, after she wrote to him asking for advice. About to graduate from Washington University in St. Louis, where she had worked for the student paper, she wondered if she should do something that would be of direct benefit to people, like becoming a doctor.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wanted him to write back and say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Do what your heart tells you,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u200a\u00e2\u0080\u009d she recalled. \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u200a  \u00e2\u0080\u0098That photography could affect people in a more indirect way, and that being a photojournalist was just as important.\u2019 And he did just that.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWith that encouragement, she set off for New York, working under Fred McDarrah at The Voice. After a few months, she was on her own, landing assignments for magazines and newspapers. At the same time, she also knew that she wanted a family. That meant she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to go off to war zones or spend days on end wandering city streets. She recalled being aghast early in her career when she heard a famous female photographer talk about sacrificing having children in order to pursue her career. Ms. Boretz knew that was not for her.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wanted this normal life,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to be out all night. Compared to other photographers I knew, it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t everything to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn that regard, the 1990s were good to her. While she was raising her two daughters, she could drop them off at school and still have a good four hours to do day pictures for The New York Times (where her husband, Ed Keating, was a staff photographer at the time).\u00e2\u0080\u009cThose were the best years of my career,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI had a real reverence for the people I shot. I was never harsh as a shooter. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d go to neighborhoods I had no business being in and try to blend. Then I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d go back, and back and back. I was given an opportunity to shoot a slice of New York every day.\u00e2\u0080\u009dShe switched to photo editing after a while, working at a magazine until 2013. The year before, when her father died, something told her she should start scanning her negatives, which led to her decision to publish \u00e2\u0080\u009cStreet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That process helped her reconnect with the rush of being a street photographer.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are really touching,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why I became a photographer. Of course we all think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to change the world. I just wanted to touch someone with one image.\u00e2\u0080\u009dShe sounds happy, with no regrets.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI chose to have it all, and I think I really did,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy kids are fabulous.

{"Headline": "Do Sanders Supporters Favor His Policies?", "Date": "2016-05-23", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsBut wishing does not make it so. Decades of social-scientific evidence show that voting behavior is primarily a product of inherited partisan loyalties, social identities and symbolic attachments. Over time, engaged citizens may construct policy preferences and ideologies that rationalize their choices, but those issues are seldom fundamental.The most powerful social identities and symbolic attachments in this year\u2019s Democratic race have favored Mrs. Clinton, not Mr. Sanders. She has been a leading figure in the Democratic Party for decades, a role model for many women and a longtime ally of African-Americans and other minority groups. For many primary voters, that history constitutes a powerful bond, and their loyalties are propelling Mrs. Clinton to the nomination despite her limitations as a candidate.Mr. Sanders, on the other hand, is a sort of anti-Clinton \u2014 a political maverick from lily-white Vermont whose main claim to fame has been his insistence on calling himself an independent, a socialist, anything but a Democrat. That history has made him a convenient vessel for antipathy to Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic establishment and some of the party\u2019s key constituencies. But it is a mistake to assume that voters who support Mr. Sanders because he is not Mrs. Clinton necessarily favor his left-leaning policy views.Mr. Sanders did just nine points better, on average, among liberals than he did among moderates. By comparison, he did 11 points worse among women than among men, 18 points worse among nonwhites than among whites and 28 points worse among those who identified as Democrats than among independents.It is very hard to point to differences between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders\u2019s proposed policies that could plausibly account for such substantial cleavages. They are reflections of social identities, symbolic commitments and partisan loyalties.However, they were less likely than Mrs. Clinton\u2019s supporters to favor concrete policies that Mr. Sanders has offered as remedies for these ills, including a higher minimum wage, increasing government spending on health care and an expansion of government services financed by higher taxes. It is quite a stretch to view these people as the vanguard of a new, social-democratic-trending Democratic Party.Mr. Sanders has drawn enthusiastic support from young people, a common pattern for outsider candidates. But here, too, the impression of ideological commitment is mostly illusory. While young Democrats in the January survey were more likely than those over age 35 to call themselves liberals, their ideological self-designations seem to have been much more lightly held, varying significantly when they were reinterviewed.Moreover, warm views of Mr. Sanders increased the liberalism of young Democrats by as much as 1.5 points on the seven-point ideological scale. For many of them, liberal ideology seems to have been a short-term byproduct of enthusiasm for Mr. Sanders rather than a stable political conviction.Perhaps for that reason, the generational difference in ideology seems not to have translated into more liberal positions on concrete policy issues \u2014 even on the specific issues championed by Mr. Sanders. For example, young Democrats were less likely than older Democrats to support increased government funding of health care, substantially less likely to favor a higher minimum wage and less likely to support expanding government services. Their distinctive liberalism is mostly a matter of adopting campaign labels, not policy preferences.Abraham Lincoln promised Americans \u201cgovernment of the people, by the people, for the people,\u201d a notable departure from the republican system set up by the architects of the Constitution. In the 150 years since Lincoln, the ideal of government \u201cby the people\u201d has reshaped Americans\u2019 democratic aspirations and their political practices \u2014 for example, in the Progressive Era introductions of direct primary elections and referendums and initiatives. It has also altered the way journalists and analysts see and describe electoral politics.But that ideal makes sense, descriptively and normatively, only if citizens understand politics in terms of issues and ideologies and use their votes to convey clear policy signals that then determine the course of public policy. Americans\u2019 commitment to the folk theory of democracy may make them wish that elections worked that way. But in the case of Bernie Sanders, as so often, belief in the folk theory is an act of faith, not realism.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Long Dominated by Center, Austria Splinters to Left and Right", "Date": "2016-05-15", "News": "Supported byMemo From AustriaVIENNA \u2014 In Austria, at the very heart of Europe, the center is not holding.Should the far-right candidate, Norbert Hofer of the Freedom Party, win the presidency, he would be the first right-wing populist to become a head of state in 21st-century Europe.The forces that vaulted Mr. Hofer into the spotlight are evident across much of the Continent, where many traditional parties in the center are embattled and voters are signaling increased discontent with politics as usual. Austria could be a test case for how far voters will go to demand change as immigration joins with diminished economic security and resentment of entrenched elites to create a combustible political mix.In France, Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Front is polling far ahead of the governing Socialists, and President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s approval ratings have slumped as low as 13 percent a year before he faces another election.But the disruption has been especially pronounced in Austria, the crossroads of a troubled Continent. Despite having dominated politics since 1945, or perhaps because of that dominance, the two major centrist parties could not muster even a quarter of the popular vote between them in the first round of the presidential contest.Mr. Hofer won 35 percent. Behind him was the former Green Party leader, Alexander Van der Bellen, with 21 percent. There has not been any polling for the runoff, but all indications are that the race will be tight.The tone of the political debate has added to the fears of many Austrians about the migrants who entered the country last year as hundreds of thousands of people fled Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and other nations for the security and prosperity of Europe. The new arrivals, many of them Muslim, are regularly portrayed in tabloids, and by Mr. Hofer and his party, as freeloaders bringing crime, rape and even murder to this country of 8.4 million people.\u201cWe are in a situation where people don\u2019t understand the world anymore, because it is changing so fast,\u201d said Georg Hoffmann-Ostenhof, a columnist for the liberal weekly magazine Profil. \u201cAnd then came the migrants, and people were told that the politicians had lost control of the borders. That just heightened the overall sense that control was gone.\u201dHans Rauscher, a centrist columnist for the daily newspaper Der Standard, noted that even though most refugees who arrived last year went on to Germany and Scandinavia, \u201cwhat people saw in images was people just coming, coming, coming \u2014 and the influx didn\u2019t stop.\u201dMr. Faymann initially backed Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany on her policy of keeping borders open to refugees. He reversed himself over the winter, siding with his coalition partner, the center-right People\u2019s Party, in shutting Austria\u2019s borders and persuading states along the Balkan refugee trail from Greece to do the same.So far, neither party in the centrist governing coalition has formally urged followers to back Mr. van der Bellen, an economist, against Mr. Hofer.Just how much influence a far-right president might exert in Austria is hotly debated. The office has been seen as largely ceremonial. But powers laid out in the 1929 Constitution, still in effect, enable the president to dismiss a government or refuse to swear in a controversial leader.Mr. Hofer and the Freedom Party have campaigned on what their posters call \u201ca new understanding of the office.\u201d Mr. Hofer has said he would give the government six months to a year to fix what he sees as Austria\u2019s woes \u2014 migrants, crime, rising unemployment \u2014 and then dismiss it if necessary.\u201cWe all missed this point in the Constitution,\u201d because since 1945 it had not been used, said Mr. Rauscher, the columnist for Der Standard. He voiced a widespread apprehension that any attempt by Mr. Hofer to sway the government could drive Austria in the illiberal direction seen in neighboring Hungary, Poland and Slovakia \u2014 all once linked with Austria in the Hapsburg Empire.Mr. Hofer is appealing to voters with a brand of 19th-century Teutonic nationalism, saying Germans and Austrians should draw on it to fight the Islamic State. He also rails against the division of Tyrol, one of Austria\u2019s states, from the northern Italian region known as South Tyrol. He told a Tyrolean rally last year that the border \u201cwas unjust, is unjust and will remain so\u201d as long as it stands.Mr. Hofer, 45 and little noticed until now, leaves the most strident public statements to his party leader, Heinz-Christian Strache, cultivating an everyman image and emphasizing at rallies that he and his second wife, a professional caregiver, \u201care one of you.\u201d\u201cMr. Van der Bellen wants to be president of Austria, while I want to be president for Austria,\u201d Mr. Hofer proclaimed during a 90-minute TV duel on May 8.Mr. Van der Bellen, 72, was markedly tougher in that debate than in earlier ones; Mr. Hofer accused him of being frisky after drinking too much Viennese coffee. But Mr. Van der Bellen\u2019s supporters say he needs to show even more desire to win.Mr. Van der Bellen has said he would never swear in a government led by Mr. Strache, even though polls consistently show the Freedom Party finishing first, with about one-third of the votes, if parliamentary elections were held now.The possibility that Mr. Hofer and the Freedom Party might expand their already substantial sway in Austria lent an air of urgency last week to a meeting of hundreds of leading business and political figures at a chic dinner club by Vienna\u2019s famed opera house.These people were rallying around Mr. Van der Bellen, who is running as an independent but is partly financed by the Green Party, even if it meant crossing ideological divides.A leading conservative, Josef Pr\u00f6ll, a former finance minister and the scion of a powerful family, was among those declaring he would back Mr. Van der Bellen.Mr. Van der Bellen has repeatedly emphasized that one in two jobs in Austria depends on trade, tourism or other contacts outside the country, and that Austria cannot afford to turn its back on Europe or the world.With unemployment hovering around 10 percent \u2014 up from 7.6 percent in 2013, when the last parliamentary elections were held \u2014 business executives especially fear isolationism.Others note a deeper crisis, particularly for Europe\u2019s center-left and the welfare state that it built after 1945, which redistributed wealth in a way that fostered security.\u201cSocial democracy was always driven by ideas,\u201d said Wolfgang Petritsch, a veteran diplomat and onetime chief aide to Austria\u2019s best-known chancellor, the Social Democrat Bruno Kreisky. \u201cBut the ideas have gone missing.\u201dThe Memo From Austria article on May 16, about the rejection of the long-dominant centrist government in the first round of Austria\u2019s presidential election, misstated the increase in the unemployment rate from 2013 to 2016. It was 7.6 percent in 2013 and around 10 percent in May, according to national statistics; it was not \u201calmost double.\u201d A reader pointed out the error shortly after publication, but editors failed to follow through with a correction.Advertisement"}

Mr. Clooney, playing the Jim Cramerish host of a loud, slick investment-advice broadcast (also called \u201cMoney Monster\u201d), is doing his most fully Clooneyesque work in a while. His brand is in full effect: the silver hair, the gravelly voice, the arrogant strut camouflaging a core of basic decency.Mr. Clooney\u2019s character, Lee Gates, is the kind of charming, egotistic broadcast peacock who requires a tough, honest, outwardly-cynical-but-secretly-idealistic, behind-the-scenes superego. That would be Ms. Roberts\u2019s Patty Fenn. The two stars are rarely onscreen together \u2014 circumstances conspire to keep Lee on set, under the lights, while Patty sits in the semidarkness of the control room whispering instructions into his earpiece \u2014 but their interaction is the electrical circuit that powers everything else.That everything else is a hostage drama wrapped around an ostensibly complicated global caper. Most of the action takes place in the \u201cMoney Monster\u201d studio, but the claustrophobia \u2014 or the lingering threat of staginess \u2014 is relieved by visits to the sleek corporate suites of Ibis Clear Capital, a company whose stock, repeatedly plugged by Lee on the air, has recently taken a tumble. The camera also pops over to Seoul, Reykjavik and Johannesburg for a beat or two to remind us just how big this story is.The local, human dimension \u2014 the reminder of how small the story is \u2014 arrives in the person of Kyle Budwell (Jack O\u2019Connell), who interrupts Lee\u2019s program with a gun, an explosive-packed vest and a serious grudge. Encouraged by Lee, he gambled his modest nest egg on Ibis and lost it all. Now he wants answers, not only from the television host who steered him wrong but also from the company\u2019s chief executive (Dominic West). The big boss, however, is suspiciously AWOL, and the only Ibis executive willing to talk is the company\u2019s top flack (Caitriona Balfe).I mentioned movie stars. Mr. O\u2019Connell certainly has the potential to become one \u2014 the intensity, the emotional commitment, the ability to magnetize attention when projecting regular-guyness \u2014 even if his attempt at an outer-borough Noo Yawk accent grates on the ears. What\u2019s equally striking about \u201cMoney Monster\u201d is the presence, in supporting roles, of excellent actors best known for their small-screen work. One of the film\u2019s incidental pleasures is the game of cable-drama trainspotting it invites. Fans of \u201cOutlander\u201d will be happy to see Ms. Balfe. Mr. West will stir up memories of \u201cThe Wire\u201d and \u201cThe Affair.\u201d And look! There\u2019s Giancarlo Esposito (\u201cBreaking Bad\u201d), Chris Bauer (also \u201cThe Wire\u201d), John Ventimiglia (\u201cThe Sopranos\u201d).It\u2019s impossible for a single movie to give such performers enough to do, but Ms. Foster makes room for each one to have a moment or two for the highlight reel. (It\u2019s also worth mentioning Dennis Boutsikaris, Condola Rashad, Christopher Denham and Lenny Venito.) The quality of the acting both enhances the credibility of the narrative and exposes some of its weak points. You may raise an eyebrow at just how quickly Kyle\u2019s potential victims rally to his side. This seems less like Stockholm syndrome than wish fulfillment.The movie wants to make sure we understand that this guy may have a gun and a bomb, but he also has a point. A literal-minded reading of \u201cMoney Monster\u201d might see it as an argument for the efficacy of terrorism. Kyle\u2019s methods may be extreme, but they work, kind of. They are also symbolic, of course, and part of a long and rich tradition of agitated agitprop movie fantasy. He\u2019s as mad as hell, and he\u2019s not gonna take it anymore. The rest of us will, and in the mean time we\u2019ll have some fun watching him blow his stack.\u201cMoney Monster\u201d is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

{"Headline": "Grass-Roots Anticorruption Drive Puts Heat on Mexican Lawmakers", "Date": "2016-05-28", "News": "Supported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 Corruption is so woven into daily life in Mexico that it has been enshrined in a common saying: \u201cEl que no transa, no avanza\u201d \u2014 he who doesn\u2019t cheat doesn\u2019t get ahead.Payoffs and bribes are the price of doing business, an invisible line in the budget that usually goes unchecked.But a package of anticorruption measures being weighed by the national legislature could become a turning point in the country\u2019s relationship with corruption.At the center is an ambitious initiative to impose public disclosure rules for all public servants, at all levels of government. Called \u201c3 de 3\u201d \u2014 or \u201c3 out of 3\u201d \u2014 the initiative would require government officials to reveal their assets and potential conflicts of interest, as well as prove that they are paying taxes.If passed, the initiative, which would also compel close relatives of public officials to reveal their assets, would be among the farthest-reaching public disclosure measures in the world, its authors say.\u201cMexico has to aim for the best,\u201d said Eduardo Boh\u00f3rquez, one of the principal authors and the executive director of Transparencia Mexicana, a watchdog group.That package, however, hangs in the balance.The legislature ended its regular session at the end of April without taking up the measures for a vote. Lawmakers, with June 5 governor elections in mind, declined to call a special session to debate the matter before a legislated deadline of May 28. Instead, they put off the session until mid-June.But a public outcry in recent days compelled legislators to reschedule the debate for Monday.The \u201c3 out of 3\u201d initiative is the result of a remarkable grass-roots effort. In 2014, a change in Mexican law allowed citizens to propose legislation with the support of at least 120,000 validated signatures. Before that, only the president and members of Congress could generate legislation.The measure, pushed by a group of community organizations, amassed more than 630,000 signatures.It has also received the support of influential business associations, leaving some analysts to speculate that spiraling bribes may have cut too deeply into profits.\u201cThis is clearly a historic event in terms of civil society mobilization,\u201d said Viridiana R\u00edos, a research fellow at the Wilson Center in Washington and a columnist for Exc\u00e9lsior, a newspaper in Mexico.The increasing focus on corruption in Mexico reflects, in part, a shift in the way social scientists and government officials are thinking about the best way to address the country\u2019s troubles, particularly violence. For years, the government\u2019s main strategy for combating violence was to attack drug trafficking groups.But in recent years, corruption, and the impunity that allows it, have increasingly been regarded as the fundamental causes of violence and the nation\u2019s other ills.\u201cThe worst problems and challenges faced by Mexico are directly caused or aggravated by corruption,\u201d said Juan E. Pardinas, the managing director of the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness, a research group that has helped to lead the citizen push for the initiative.\u201cHow can you solve the problem of violence and organized crime if you don\u2019t solve the problem of corruption?\u201d he added. \u201cCorruption is weakening the capacity of the state to address the challenges of the country.\u201dAccording to the research by the institute, nearly all corruption crimes go unpunished, and those found guilty are not high-level officials. Of 444 cases forwarded to the nation\u2019s attorney general\u2019s office by federal auditors between 1998 and 2012, charges were filed in only seven.\u201cYou cannot sustain a political system where people have enough information to know the extent of corruption but the state institutions are totally incapable of prosecuting it,\u201d Mr. Pardinas said.In May 2015, amid an investigation into conflict-of-interest allegations involving President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s wife and his finance minister, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto signed into law legislation establishing a national anticorruption system.It included the creation of an independent corruption prosecutor, a special court to oversee corruption issues and a framework for coordinating scores of government offices that are currently charged with fighting corruption.The 2015 legislation set a deadline of this May 28 for the passage of secondary laws that would enable the anticorruption system. The main political parties have been negotiating the terms of these secondary laws, including \u201c3 out of 3.\u201dOne of the most contentious subjects of discussion has been defining whether the asset disclosures should be made public. Many lawmakers are concerned that revealing their personal wealth could make them and their relatives targets for criminals, so they are pushing for a bill that would require them to disclose their assets only to the government.Still, the public clamor for legislators to pass a robust set of anticorruption laws has been energetic. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mexico, in editorials published through its news service, has weighed in forcefully in favor of the measures while criticizing \u201cthe paralysis in the first three years\u201d of the Pe\u00f1a Nieto administration.\u201cThree years lost in the labyrinths of words, discussions and stonewalling,\u201d one editorial lamented.In the meantime, some politicians have volunteered to divulge their secrets even before a disclosure law is passed.Already, more than 560 public servants \u2014 of potentially tens of thousands \u2014 have signed on to the disclosure initiative, revealing their assets and potential conflicts of interests. They include about 13 percent of Mexico\u2019s Senate and 21 percent of its Chamber of Deputies, as well as 12 governors and one member of Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s cabinet.Among them is Zo\u00e9 Robledo Aburto, an opposition senator representing the state of Chiapas and a fervent proponent of the disclosure initiative.\u201cThe politicians have little credibility. There\u2019s little confidence in government institutions,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIn this moment of crisis, we should be sending an audacious message that can reconfigure and re-establish our relationship with the citizenry.\u201cWe have to demonstrate that we\u2019re in politics for the right reasons, not to enrich ourselves or to get us business,\u201d Mr. Robledo continued. \u201cPresenting the citizens with a bouquet of flowers isn\u2019t going to make things better.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Cash and stock awards, the main components of pay packages, fell last year. Among the companies in the Equilar 200, the biggest pay package, worth $94.6 million, went to Dara Khosrowshahi of Expedia. That meant that for the first time since 2012 no company in the rankings awarded its chief more than $100 million.All of which raises a tantalizing prospect: Has executive pay finally peaked? Have the C.E.O.s and the compensation committees that set their pay discovered something approaching modesty?Some experts say that is the case. \u201cWe\u2019re hearing a great deal more concern from compensation committee chairs about absolute pay,\u201d said Kenneth Daly, chief executive of the National Association of Corporate Directors, a trade group for board members. \u201cThey seem to have a lot more steel in their backs.\u201dMaybe. What is certain is that last year\u2019s weak stock market pulled down the value of executive pay packages. After posting fairly consistent gains for years, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average each fell slightly in 2015. Because the average compensation package was 69 percent stock, lower share prices meant less pay for C.E.O.s.But the relation between pay and performance remains tenuous at best. Some executives\u2019 pay fell, despite gains in the price of shares of their companies. And several C.E.O.s reaped huge windfalls, even while presiding over precipitous declines in total shareholder return.Take Philippe Dauman, the embattled chief of the media conglomerate Viacom. Mr. Dauman was awarded $54.1 million last year, a 22 percent raise from 2014. Over the year, Viacom shares plunged 43 percent.Or consider Stephen A. Wynn, the Las Vegas casino magnate. Using the Equilar criteria, he made $20.7 million as C.E.O. of Wynn Resorts last year, down 19 percent from 2014. That may seem like an appropriate haircut in a difficult year, but his shareholders fared even worse. Shares of Wynn Resorts plunged 54 percent, wiping out half the company\u2019s value. Total shareholder return, which includes dividends, was down almost as much, at 51 percent.Such flagrant disparities \u2014 chief executives are paid tens of millions of dollars for running troubled companies \u2014 rile critics.\u201cMoral outrage is the right term,\u201d said Heather Slavkin Corzo, director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.\u2019s investment office. \u201cThe rules of our economy have been written to allow the rich and powerful to keep getting richer and more powerful, while the rest of us are fighting for the scraps. It\u2019s reprehensible.\u201dPresidential candidates are talking about high C.E.O. pay in equally charged terms. For Democrats and Republicans alike, stagnant wages and income inequality have emerged as reliable rallying cries. The sentiments that fueled the Occupy Wall Street movement and were given academic heft through the work of the French economist Thomas Piketty have become talking points for Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.\u201cThe inequality movement has created a whole backlash against C.E.O. pay,\u201d said Alan Johnson, managing director of Johnson Associates, a compensation consulting firm.Weighing in on Verizon\u2019s labor dispute, Senator Sanders, an avowed socialist, took a shot at the company\u2019s chief executive, Lowell McAdam, who made $18.3 million last year.\u201cWhen the C.E.O. of a company makes almost $20 million a year but then tries to outsource jobs, reduce wages and cut health benefits \u2014 that\u2019s the kind of corporate greed we need to get rid of in America,\u201d Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign wrote in an email to supporters recently. \u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly what Verizon is doing right now.\u201dStarting her campaign last year, Mrs. Clinton contrasted working Americans with chief executives. \u201cFamilies have fought their way back from tough economic times,\u201d she wrote in a campaign email. \u201cBut it\u2019s not enough \u2014 not when the average C.E.O. makes about 300 times what the average worker makes.\u201dNo less than Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee and a wealthy businessman himself, suggested that executive pay was, in some instances, excessive. \u201cYou see these guys making these enormous amounts of money,\u201d Mr. Trump said on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d last year. \u201cIt\u2019s a total and complete joke.\u201dThe presidential contenders are responding to a sense of outrage among many working-class men and women.\u201cIn the wealthiest country in the history of the world, it should be a no-brainer that someone who works full time should be able to support their family and send their children to school,\u201d Ms. Slavkin Corzo said. \u201cThis type of wealth inequality has dangerous ramifications for our economy over all. It\u2019s immoral.\u201dThat sentiment resonates beyond the picket lines. Even Mr. Johnson, who is paid to advise companies on pay, said things had gotten out of hand. \u201cI wish all C.E.O.s were paid less money,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they\u2019re paid too much from a moral standpoint, but it is a competitive market.\u201dHere are 200 of the highest-paid chief executives in American business.Several factors account for big paydays at the highest reaches of corporate America, among them the ease with which companies can give away stock, and chummy board members who reward their friends.But another driver of high pay is the practice of benchmarking a chief executive\u2019s compensation against that of others in a so-called peer group.\u201cCompanies are accustomed to benchmarking against other companies in their industries,\u201d said Andrew Goldstein, leader of the North American executive compensation practice at Willis Towers Watson, a consultancy. \u201cYou tend to get these clusters of compensation in these industry groups.\u201d And companies are prone to benchmark themselves against larger companies and set pay at the high end of any range.At First Data, a payments processor with a market value of about $11 billion that went public last year, the chief executive, Frank J. Bisignano, was awarded $51.6 million in 2015, some of it tied to long-term performance. The board benchmarked his pay against 21 other companies it determined made up First Data\u2019s peer group.But those companies tended to be much larger than First Data, with average market values of about $37 billion. The peer group included Visa ($188 billion market cap), MasterCard ($104 billion market cap) and Accenture ($77 billion market cap).Yet despite First Data\u2019s relatively small size, Mr. Bisignano, who joined the company in 2013 after working at JPMorgan Chase, was awarded more than any chief of the companies in his peer group. The closest was Kenneth Chenault of American Express, who made $21.7 million, less than half of Mr. Bisignano\u2019s package. First Data declined to comment.\u201cNobody wants to be in the bottom half,\u201d Mr. Daly said. \u201cSo over time, the average compensation in any group goes up.\u201dFirst Data may be an outlier in the payments industry. In other sectors of the economy, however, specifically media and technology, enormous pay packages have become the norm.In 2014, the four chief executives reporting to the media mogul John Malone were awarded a combined $358 million. Last year, those four men \u2014 David M. Zaslav, Michael T. Fries, Gregory B. Maffei and Thomas M. Rutledge \u2014 were still awarded $103.4 million.Other media and technology chiefs picked up the slack. Sumner M. Redstone has routinely bestowed great riches upon his lieutenants, Mr. Dauman of Viacom, and Leslie Moonves, chief executive of CBS. Last year was no exception.Mr. Moonves was the second-highest-paid executive on the Equilar list, with a package worth $56.4 million. Mr. Dauman was right behind him, with a $54.1 million package that included a contract extension. They received this compensation although CBS shares fell 16 percent last year, and Viacom\u2019s share performance was dismal.It\u2019s not clear how much longer Mr. Redstone\u2019s largess will endure. He is ailing, has publicly split with Mr. Dauman, and the futures of CBS and Viacom are the subject of enormous speculation.\u201cEvery year they get paid more than they should due to that unusual governance situation,\u201d said Steven N. Kaplan, a professor of finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, referring to Mr. Moonves and Mr. Dauman. \u201cThose guys may be going down once Sumner is gone.\u201dShould the pay of Mr. Dauman and Mr. Moonves fall in the coming years, plenty of other media chiefs will still reap big rewards. Robert A. Iger of Walt Disney was awarded $43.5 million last year, Jeffrey L. Bewkes of Time Warner received $31.5 million, James E. Meyer of Sirius XM made $29.2 million, and Brian L. Roberts of Comcast took in $27.5 million.Technology company chiefs also did well. Marissa A. Mayer of Yahoo was awarded $36 million. Marc Benioff, founder and chief executive of Salesforce, received a $33.4 million package. And Mr. Khosrowshahi of Expedia, the lucky high earner of 2015 according to Equilar, had compensation of $94.6 million. (Mr. Khosrowshahi is a director of The New York Times Company.) His package, reflecting a new five-and-a-half-year contract, was almost exclusively stock that vests over time, so much of its value is closely linked to Expedia\u2019s share price.Defenders of executive pay cite factors like those as evidence that seemingly astronomical rewards really don\u2019t add up to that much money. In a statement, Sarah Gavin, an Expedia spokeswoman, said Mr. Khosrowshahi \u201chas been a transformational C.E.O. for Expedia,\u201d adding that much of his compensation was structured to give him \u201can additional incentive to create long-term shareholder value.\u201dAll told, tech and media C.E.O.s made up 17 of the highest-paid 30 spots on Equilar\u2019s list last year.According to Bureau of Labor Statistics data compiled by the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the average worker in the United States who doesn\u2019t have management responsibility earns $36,875 a year. By that measure, the average chief executive on the Equilar list makes roughly 523 times the average worker salary.It\u2019s not a perfect comparison. Executive pay includes stock grants, often with multiyear payouts and performance targets, while low-paid workers rarely receive stock, let alone long-term incentive packages. Nonetheless, the discrepancy is stark. A bank teller at Wells Fargo making that average wage would have to work more than half a millennium, until 2539, to earn what that company\u2019s chief executive, Mr. Stumpf, who made the average among chiefs on the Equilar list, earned last year.Incomplete as such ratios may be, chief executives will have to get used to them. Starting in 2018, companies will be required to disclose the ratio of their C.E.O.s\u2019 pay to the median compensation of their employees. The Securities and Exchange Commission will allow companies significant leeway when interpreting their own data, which could keep ratios down.In the interim, data from other sources offers a hint of what to expect. PayScale, a company that makes enterprise software, has surveyed more than 80,000 workers about their pay. Using that data, it is possible to roughly approximate ratios of the sort that the S.E.C. will soon require.The biggest gap between C.E.O. and worker pay was at Expedia, where Mr. Khosrowshahi made 993 times the median pay of his employees, as reported to PayScale. That is not so surprising given Mr. Khosrowshahi\u2019s enormous multiyear contract. But it held true even with Expedia\u2019s high median salary of $95,300.Perhaps more glaring was the discrepancy between the Walmart chief executive, C. Douglas McMillon, who made $19.4 million, nearly the average among the Equilar 200, and his workers, who reported a median salary of just $24,600. Mr. McMillon thus made 789 times the income of his median employee, using PayScale and Equilar data.Walmart said it had raised wages for more than 1.2 million employees in February. Mr. McMillon himself started as an hourly worker at Walmart and the company said that most of his compensation was based on company performance.\u201cIt\u2019s an eye-popping number,\u201d said Ms. Slavkin Corzo. \u201cThat means the typical worker would have to work for hundreds of years to make what a C.E.O. makes in one year.\u201dEye-popping as such numbers may be, compensation specialists don\u2019t expect the S.E.C.\u2019s ratio rule to change these disparities very much. But Mr. Johnson said it might embarrass retailers like Walmart. \u201cIt will throw another log on the fire, but I don\u2019t think it will have a huge impact,\u201d he said.Being the chief executive of a big publicly traded company isn\u2019t the only way to get paid these days.Masimo, a small medical device company with a market value of just $2.4 billion and annual sales of about $630 million, saw fit to award its chief executive, Joe Kiani, $119.2 million in cash and stock. Palo Alto Networks, an enterprise technology company with just under $1 billion in sales, awarded its chief executive, Mark D. McLaughlin, $66.6 million. And Paul J. Taubman, an investment banker who recently took his firm, PJT Partners, public, received a package composed almost entirely of stock worth $75.5 million. Because their companies didn\u2019t have $1 billion in sales, they were not included in the Equilar 200.A business leader does not even have to be a C.E.O. to make a fortune. Lowly chief financial officers, chief operating officers and division heads are also hauling in staggering pay packages.When Google reorganized last yearto become Alphabet, it placed Sundar Pichai in charge of its search business. For taking control of the subsidiary, called Google, he was awarded stock and cash worth $100.6 million.Alphabet\u2019s chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, who was recruited from Morgan Stanley, was awarded $31.1 million. And Patrick Pichette, the company\u2019s departing chief financial officer, received a golden parachute worth $56.6 million.Among companies that gave lavish packages to chief executives, other senior executives were also richly rewarded. At Viacom, Thomas E. Dooley, the chief operating officer, was awarded $29.4 million. At Comcast, Michael J. Cavanagh, the chief financial officer, received $40.6 million.And at First Data, where Mr. Bisignano received the sixth-highest total compensation among chief executives last year, his deputies fared well, too.Daniel Charron, executive vice president of global business solutions, was awarded $24.8 million, while the total for Guy Chiarello, the company\u2019s president, was $20.6 million.\u201cThese are very high numbers. Some people think it\u2019s too much,\u201d Mr. Kaplan said. \u201cBut if you look at what people are making in the market \u2014 technology and globalization have played into this \u2014 these are market rates.\u201dThree other hedge fund managers \u2014 Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates, David Tepper of Appaloosa Management and Israel Englander of Millennium Management \u2014 each made more than $1 billion. Another three men made $500 million or more.The figures for hedge fund managers, compiled by Institutional Investor\u2019s Alpha magazine, take into account the money they have invested in their funds as well as the fees they charge.Together, the top 25 best-paid hedge fund managers took in a combined $13 billion last year.On a case-by-case basis, large executive pay packages are easy to understand. Big companies employ thousands of people and generate billions in sales. Competition for top executive talent is intense, especially in today\u2019s global marketplace. From that perspective, Mr. Kaplan said: \u201cIn this day and age, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re particularly overpaid.\u201dAnd chief executive pay declined in 2015, according to the Equilar 200, which included companies with $1 billion in revenue, not $1 billion in market capitalization, as was the case last year. Cash compensation fell to $6 million on average, compared with $6.9 million in 2014, while stock and option awards slumped to $13.3 million, down from $15.7 million in 2014. Some executives with large stock holdings felt a twinge when their company\u2019s share price fell.But it is too soon to call this decline a trend. In 2012, after years of steady increases, average pay dipped 10 percent. What followed were two years of strong gains, until last year. And for all the talk about measures designed to incentivize long-term performance, many chief executives took home enormous cash bonuses, which do little to promote foresight. Mr. Moonves got $23.7 million in cash, while Mr. Dauman received $18.3 million.What is more, when executive compensation is compared with worker salaries, today\u2019s pay packages seem gargantuan.Seen in this light, the compensation committees that set C.E.O. pay are orchestrating a large-scale transfer of wealth to a few hundred individuals \u2014 most of them men, most of them white.Previous efforts to rein in executive pay haven\u2019t yielded many results. So-called \u201csay on pay measures,\u201d which let investors voice their opinions on executive pay, have had little effect. The S.E.C.\u2019s pay ratio rule may make some companies look bad, yet many analysts predict executive pay will continue the trajectory it has followed for decades, climbing ever higher.\u201cThe amount of power that we\u2019ve allowed to be concentrated in the hands of C.E.O.s is worrisome,\u201d Ms. Slavkin Corzo said. \u201cThere is nobody out there that has the power to put their thumb on the scale on the other direction. There are lots of ways you can tweak around the edges, but at the end of the day if you want change, it\u2019s about changing the power structures in corporate America.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Atlantic Archipelago\u2019s Main Export: Music", "Date": "2016-05-04", "News": "Supported byPRAIA, Cape Verde \u2014 Some countries have oil, diamonds or cocoa beans. Cape Verde, a tiny archipelago about 385 miles off the west coast of Senegal, has music, and it is betting on that resource to help bolster its fragile economy.\u201cIt\u2019s essential to see people perform live before you book them, and there is nothing better than experiencing a music culture where it\u2019s actually from,\u201d said Paula Abreu, the director of programming for SummerStage, an annual New York City music festival. \u201cYou immediately know if an artist has what it takes to entertain a public of thousands.\u201dMs. Abreu booked the musicians Mayra Andrade, Dino D\u2019Santiago and the Ces\u00e1ria \u00c9vora Orchestra for last year\u2019s SummerStage after seeing them at the Atlantic expo.The model for many Cape Verdean artists is the international star Ces\u00e1ria \u00c9vora, who put Cape Verde on the map of the music world with her renditions of mornas, the islands\u2019 ballads of love and longing.\u201cHere, from the rural areas to the breezy beach towns, everyone sings and has a beautiful voice,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Da Silva, who developed the Kriol festival and is the producer of the Atlantic Music Expo. \u201cWhat matters is who works hard enough to be discovered.\u201dMr. Da Silva, a music producer who helped to relaunch the career of Ms. \u00c9vora in the 1980s, worked with the Cape Verde Ministry of Culture to create the Atlantic Music Expo, now in its fourth year. This year, the government spent about $227,000 to finance the expo, which also had corporate sponsors.Together, the two events attract thousands of fans and music professionals each year and pump more than $1 million into the islands\u2019 economy each year, officials said.That is no small amount in Cape Verde, which became independent from Portugal in 1975. The youth unemployment rate is 36 percent, according to the national statistics office, and it is one of the few countries that has more diaspora citizens than locals: a population of about 500,000 on the islands but more than 700,000 abroad.\u201cWhen we became independent, all we had was people,\u201d said Abra\u00e3o Vicente, the newly appointed culture minister and an artist and poet himself.\u201cToday, all we export is music, maybe because it was always the easiest art,\u201d added Mr. Vicente, whose wife is a prominent Cape Verdean singer who uses the name Lura. \u201cYou don\u2019t need any material to sing.\u201dMr. Vincente said one of his goals was to attract tourist dollars by staging musical events like the Atlantic expo across the islands. To finance these, Mr. Vicente plans to collaborate with international producers by offering space for their own festivals.\u201cBut of course,\u201d he said, \u201cCape Verdeans should be the ones involved, for those who don\u2019t have a stage to find one.\u201dLast year\u2019s breakout star was Elida Almeida. Scouted by programmers from France, the United States and Africa at the music expo, the 23-year-old from a mountainous village on the main island of Santiago has since toured the United States, Canada and is now performing in major African cities.Ms. Almeida\u2019s song \u201cNta Konsigui\u201d has been used as the soundtrack for a Portuguese telenovela and her videos have received almost two million views on YouTube.\u201cI feel privileged to have gone so far in so little time,\u201d Ms. Almeida said in a Skype interview from Cotonou, Benin, where she was performing. \u201cMy objective is now to take Cape Verdean music as far as possible.\u201dEmpty of human life before their discovery by the Portuguese during the 15th century, the Cape Verdean islands were an early center for the shipment of slaves from the West African coast to the Americas.\u201cWe are positioned in the middle of the Atlantic, right between the African continent and the Americas, so we were at the cross point, both culturally and physically,\u201d said Charles Akibod\u00e9, a historian who was instrumental in getting Cidade Velha, one of the first settlements for transcontinental slavery, designated as a Unesco World Heritage Site.For Helio Batalha, a 27-year-old hip-hop artist who performed at the music expo, that blending of cultures and history has led to a form of identity crisis for young Cape Verdeans. \u201cWe are told we are African, but we don\u2019t know much about the continent,\u201d Mr. Batalha said, sitting outside his uncle\u2019s tiny storefront in Ponta d\u2019Agua, one of the poorest neighborhoods in Praia.He said the music expo had allowed him to meet producers and programmers, but nothing is booked for now. \u201cThere is a fantasy that after A.M.E., you get handed a plane ticket,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s wait and see.\u201dNot every Cape Verdean thinks the festivals are a worthy investment.\u201cThere are problems that could be solved with those amounts of money,\u201d said Mirto Cesar, a 40-year-old unemployed electrician in Praia with two children. \u201cThere is real misery here, drugs, crimes, hunger. Misery music can\u2019t solve.\u201dNonetheless, Mr. Cesar said he would still take his children to hear afternoon performances on the town\u2019s main square.\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, it is part of their culture,\u201d he said.At 4 a.m. on the Saturday of the Kriol festival, Praia was still resonating with music. The crowd had moved to a seaside stage overlooking the Kebra Kanela beach. Up to play was a Cape Verde jazz veteran, Teofilo Chantre, known for having been a composer and musician with Cesaria Evora many years ago. He had never played so late, he admitted, and for this concert he had decided to ask musicians from the younger generation to accompany him.On stage, Mr. Chantre\u2019s languid, nostalgic voice seemed ignited by a different energy. Afterward, he seemed pleased with the collaboration, conceding he probably now had more to learn from the young players than they could from him.\u201cMusic matters so much because we were always isolated here,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s what reconnected us, it put us on the map.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lack of Capital to Lead Law Firms to Seek Help, Survey Finds", "Date": "2016-05-03", "News": "Supported byFor law firms, a lack of capital, largely because of the cash flow of a typical partnership structure, is a major competitive obstacle, according to a survey of firms and in-house lawyers released Tuesday.More than nine out of 10 clients, or 94 percent, reported increased pressure on legal budgets, staffing and spending, up from 80 percent in 2014 and 73 percent in 2013. Litigation finance makes money available for upgrades like improving technology or data security, or taking on big cost-intensive cases.According to the survey, which had responses from 60 large law firms, 28 percent of lawyers in private practice have used litigation financing since 2013.Nearly three times as many, or 75 percent, of outside counsel predicted that litigation financing would grow in the next five years, the survey said. In January, Burford announced it was committing $100 million in financing for a group of cases at a large, unnamed law firm. In December, the firm announced an agreement to provide $45 million in litigation financing to a major telecommunications company with a portfolio of pending litigation. At the company, which declined to be named, legal fees and expenses had eaten into operating revenue.Last year, Burford, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, committed $30 million to the Hausfeld law firm to expand its presence in Germany, including opening an office in Berlin.Burford is not the only firm in the sector. Gerchen Keller Capital LLC, a Chicago-based litigation lender, has $1.4 billion in assets. Burford recently added capital, bringing its investment total to $1 billion. Others include Bentham IMF, which has funded more than a half-dozen litigation portfolios. The field is likely to grow as pressure from costs incurred by litigation continues.\u201cFinance is increasingly used by firms and clients as an innovative and flexible means of accessing capital that can be invested back into the business,\u201d said Christopher P. Bogart, Burford\u2019s chief executive and a former general counsel at Time Warner.Burford, which was co-founded by Mr. Bogart in 2009, reported revenues last year of $103 million, up from $82 million in 2014. Its pretax profit rose to $67 million last year, from $57 million in 2014.Mr. Bogart, who is also a former associateat the law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore, said Burford\u2019s clients often do not want to be identified.\u201cNo one likes to talk about litigation,\u201d he said, even though litigation \u201chas moved from aggravating and immaterial to being a very significant matter\u201d for many companies. Burford has more than $600 million invested in litigation, though only 13 percent of its financing arrangements support single lawsuits, he said.Financing helps firms be more flexible in responding to client demands for alternatives to the traditional hourly billing model as well as to curb litigation costs. Typically law firm partners are reluctant to invest long-term because their pay is tied to current profitability, not to future payouts. Financing litigation allows firms to absorb costs in the short term and compete by offering clients alternative fee arrangements.An article on Wednesday about the growth of outside financing for law firms misstated the amount of capital held by Burford Capital, a litigation lender. It recently added capital, bringing its investment total to $1 billion. It does not have roughly half that of Gerchen Keller Capital\u2019s $1.4 billion in assets. The article also misstated the position of Christopher P. Bogart, the chief executive of Burford, when he was at the law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore. He was an associate, not a partner.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "They Tilt Right, but Top C.E.O.s Don\u2019t Give to Trump", "Date": "2016-05-27", "News": "Supported byThe C-suite leans right.That may not be so surprising, given the Republicans\u2019 reputation as the party of business. But none of the people on this year\u2019s highest-paid list contributed to the campaign of Donald J. Trump, a fellow businessman and the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.Their unwillingness to support Mr. Trump, at least so far, is a further indication that the party\u2019s new standard-bearer is struggling to connect with some of its most influential constituents.Ms. Wexner gave $1.5 million to groups that supported Ohio governor John Kasich\u2019s bid for the Republican presidential nomination. In doing so, she was supporting the hometown candidate: L Brands, the parent company of Victoria\u2019s Secret, is based in Columbus, Ohio. Mr. Wexner gave $500,000 to a group supporting the campaign of Jeb Bush and nearly $100,000 to national Republican committees.The second-most-prolific political donors among the top-paid chieftains were Robert J. Hugin, the recently retired chief executive of the drug company Celgene, and his wife, Kathleen. Mr. Hugin gave $250,000 to a \u201csuper PAC\u201d supporting New Jersey governor Chris Christie\u2019s unsuccessful bid for the Republican presidential nomination and nearly $200,000 to national Republican committees.Most of the other biggest political donors \u2014 including Stephen A. Wynn of Wynn Resorts and his wife, Andrea; John B. Hess of the Hess Corporation and his wife, Susan; Rupert Murdoch of 21st Century Fox; and Meg Whitman of Hewlett Packard Enterprise also supported Republicans by a wide margin.Salesforce.com\u2019s leader, Marc Benioff, was the top donor to Democrats among the high earners. Along with his wife, Lynne, he contributed $173,400, most of that to national Democratic committees.But even among the big donors supporting Democrats, few of the chief executives supported Hillary Clinton, who is closing in on the Democratic nomination for president, and none contributed to her rival, Bernie Sanders.Mrs. Clinton received just $56,000 in contributions from the top-paid chiefs in the country. Her super PAC, Priorities USA Action, received no contributions from the group, not even from Mr. Benioff, who has publicly said he supports Mrs. Clinton.Here are 200 of the highest-paid chief executives in American business.Among the other candidates drawing support from the C.E.O.-class were Rob Portman, Republican senator from Ohio; Kelly Ayotte, Republican senator from New Hampshire; and Chuck Schumer, Democratic senator from New York.Chief executives of public companies are not always big political contributors. They must balance the risk of appearing partisan with the interests of their companies. And many of the best-compensated chief executives have much of their net worth tied up in stock, which can complicate the impulse to write big checks to favored candidates.Nonetheless, the Center for Responsive Politics analysis reveals a clear willingness among some of the country\u2019s richest business leaders to exert their influence on democracy, and a clear propensity to support Republicans.Like many of the Republican party\u2019s top donors, however, the best-paid C.E.O.s in the country remain wary of throwing their support behind Mr. Trump, even as the Republican National Committee scrambles to shore up big money for his candidacy.Ms. Whitman gave more than $200,000 to groups that supported the failed bid by Mr. Christie to become the Republican presidential nominee. After Mr. Christie threw his support behind Mr. Trump, Ms. Whitman criticized him and assailed Mr. Trump.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Election Years Are Steeped in Markets\u2019 Least Favorite Thing: Uncertainty", "Date": "2016-05-16", "News": "Supported byDealBookMergers and acquisitions activity is down. Initial public offerings are practically dead. Companies are cutting spending. The stock market is increasingly volatile. Gross domestic product is stalling.What explains it all?Perhaps Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.A growing body of research shows that during presidential election years \u2014 particularly ones like this when there is such uncertainty about the nation\u2019s future \u2014 industry becomes almost paralyzed. A look at the last several dozen election cycles shows that during the final year of a presidential term, big corporate investments are routinely postponed, and big deals are put on the back burner.The research is even more persuasive on the final year of an eight-year presidential term, when a new candidate inevitably will become president.The trend is already playing out that way this year: Verizon is slimming its capital spending; so are Dupont and Union Pacific. McDonald\u2019s and Delta Air Lines are in standstill mode, and Exxon Mobil is cutting back drastically. (Admittedly, the energy complex has its own issues, with the price of oil remaining at low levels.)Of course, there are many factors in play beyond the election, from the possibility of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates to the potential \u201cBrexit\u201d \u2014 Britain seceding from the European Union \u2014 to a slowdown in China and emerging markets.But the circus that is the United States presidential election may be playing an even bigger role, consciously or subconsciously, than most executives may want to admit.If history is any guide, from now till Nov. 8, the stock market is likely to trend down, putting a psychological damper on deal-making and initial public offerings. According to research by Stephen Suttmeier, a technical analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has fallen an average of 2.8 percent since 1928 during election years like this one, in which the incumbent \u2014 in this case, President Obama \u2014 is not seeking re-election. The final year of an incumbent\u2019s eight-year term is the only year that averaged negative returns, Mr. Suttmeier\u2019s research said.It is a favorite epithet of C.E.O.s: \u201cuncertainty.\u201d The word is routinely used as a catchall for why things aren\u2019t going as well as they should. Sometimes the uncertainty is economic, but these days it is mostly political.Mr. Julio, together with his co-author, Youngsuk Yook of the Federal Reserve, examined not just elections in the United States but in 48 other countries from 1980 to 2005. They found a clear pattern: \u201cDuring election years, firms reduce investment expenditures by an average of 4.8 percent relative to nonelection years,\u201d their study said.Strikingly, Mr. Suttmeier\u2019s finding that the final year of an incumbent\u2019s eight-year term was the only year that averaged negative returns in the United States may have an explanation, albeit one that involves a bit of conspiracy theorizing. \u201cThere has been much debate over whether incumbents manipulate fiscal and monetary policy instruments to influence the level of economic activity prior to an election in order to maximize the probability of re-election,\u201d Mr. Julio said in his own study.Critics of the Democratic Party have suggested that Janet L. Yellen, chairwoman of the Federal Reserve and an Obama appointee, will be hard pressed to raise interest rates significantly in an election year, out of fear that such a move might slow the economy and give the Republicans a stronger position.Particularly pronounced is the flight from deals that could have antitrust implications or potential tax consequences. Tax inversion deals, for example, in which companies move their headquarters outside the United States to enjoy lower tax rates, have fallen out of favor in part because a change in leadership could lead to changes in the way such deals are treated in the future; both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump have talked about their ambitions for corporate tax reform. And deals in the defense industry and others that rely on government contracts are also likely to slow, analysts said.The big question \u2014 bigger than what the rest of the year will look like \u2014 is whether the economy will pick up once the issue of the next president is decided. All the data says it should \u2014 indeed, much of the economic activity may just be delayed. But in an increasingly polarized country, the pain of electoral strife could linger on Wall Street far longer than anyone would wish.Because of an editing error, the DealBook column on Tuesday, about stock market uncertainties in a presidential election year, misstated the date of the 2016 presidential election.

{"Headline": "MetLife Suit Raises Questions of Extent of Corporate Liability", "Date": "2016-05-30", "News": "Supported byWhen Christine Ramirez signed over that first check in April 2008, she had no idea that the decision would eventually upend her life.A broker offered a tempting deal. If she invested in a real estate fund called the Diversified Lending Group, which was managed by someone named Bruce Friedman, she would be eligible for a \u201cguaranteed\u201d return of 12 percent. She could use the proceeds to pay the premium on a new MetLife life insurance policy.Ms. Ramirez chose not to buy the insurance policy, but she did invest in Mr. Friedman\u2019s fund, a total of $279,769 including her personal savings, a retirement account and proceeds from a line of credit on her home in Simi Valley, Calif.D.L.G. came crashing down months later, when the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Mr. Friedman, accusing him of misappropriating millions of dollars in investor funds. According to court documents, he operated a Ponzi scheme that defrauded hundreds of investors, including a sitting congressman, of more than $200 million. The money was gone.\u201cI think I cried every day for a year,\u201d said Ms. Ramirez, 75. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t do my homework. I was told it was approved by MetLife and that it was guaranteed.\u201dNow, Ms. Ramirez and some others who lost their money are suing MetLife, claiming that the insurer ignored or failed to notice signs that agents and brokers were peddling Mr. Friedman\u2019s financing program to retirees and others. Litigation has been winding its way through the courts for years, and MetLife is fighting back.But last month, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge cleared Ms. Ramirez\u2019s case to move to trial in July. Her lawyers represent 98 people in seven cases, and hers is the first of this group to move forward. She is being given preference because she is battling late-stage breast cancer.MetLife has settled some cases with its own customers who were duped by the D.L.G. offer, but the current batch of lawsuits involves people who did not buy its insurance. Ms. Ramirez was never a customer of MetLife. Instead, these people only put their money in the D.L.G. investment that was pitched to them by sales people, some who were affiliated with MetLife and some who were independent contractors approved to sell its products. As such, the legal fight raises questions about how far a large company\u2019s liability should extend.\u201cBig companies, like MetLife, are run by people, and when they fall below the standard of care or engage in improper conduct, our clients, who are also real people, get hurt \u2013 and that\u2019s what happened here,\u201d said Richard E. Donahoo, founder of Donahoo & Associates, one of the lawyers representing Ms. Ramirez.MetLife has argued in court documents that it \u201chad no relationship with D.L.G.\u201d and that it \u201cdid not sell, or materially assist in the sale\u201d of the D.L.G. financing program. Neither was it legally obligated to supervise the broker who made the sale to Ms. Ramirez, MetLife said, because he was a contractor and licensed through another, unaffiliated broker-dealer, even though he was authorized to sell MetLife insurance products. The company has added that it did not \u201ctake or receive anything from\u201d Ms. Ramirez, and so it is not liable for any damages. A MetLife spokesman, Christopher Stern, said the company does not comment on continuing litigation.Tony Russon, at the time a managing partner at a MetLife insurance subsidiary and a registered principal for a related broker-dealer, introduced Mr. Friedman and his fund to the agents in about 2004, the lawsuit says. The agents were also given D.L.G. \u201cwelcome packets\u201d to use in making sales that discussed the \u201cguaranteed\u201d returns promised to Ms. Ramirez and others. Mr. Russon is named in the lawsuit, along with MetLife and the subsidiaries.It turns out, according to the lawsuit and related filings, that Mr. Friedman owed Mr. Russon about $750,000 from an unrelated side deal and had an agreement to send half of his future income to Mr. Russon until that debt was paid off, all of this unknown to MetLife. Mr. Friedman also bought millions of dollars of life insurance in several policies from MetLife, with the commissions going to Mr. Russon, according to legal documents.In 2006, a senior fraud investigator at MetLife raised questions with executives about the D.L.G. program. MetLife has said in court documents regarding that 2006 investigation that its underwriting department declined a policy application that disclosed that its premiums would be paid with returns on D.L.G. promissory notes, emphasizing that MetLife did not permit such programs. Mr. Russon was fired in May 2009, soon after Mr. Friedman\u2019s fraud collapsed.A lawyer for Mr. Russon said Ms. Ramirez had never met Mr. Russon, and that she did not buy any insurance products through him or his agency, nor did she buy into D.L.G. through his office. \u201cWe intend on defending Mr. Russon\u2019s interests vigorously at trial,\u201d the lawyer said.Mr. Friedman used a significant portion of the investor money to support an \u201cextravagant lifestyle,\u201d including expensive vacations, jewelry and a $6.5 million home in Malibu, the government said. He also pledged millions of dollars to charity, including the Dodgers Dream Foundation.\u201cThis case is about aiding and abetting,\u201d Mr. Donahoo said. \u201cMr. Friedman, who was a felon, likely could never have obtained the millions from the hundreds of people that he cheated without the legitimacy that a company like MetLife provided.\u201dFew at the time knew that he had been convicted decades earlier of stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from an employer. He was eventually charged in the D.L.G. matter. But Mr. Friedman fled the country as the investigation progressed, and he died in a French prison in March 2012 while awaiting extradition. His victims received a fraction of every dollar they had invested. MetLife paid $10 million of life insurance from his policies to the receiver who was tasked with recovering money.The court battle comes as policy makers in Washington decide whether large financial institutions are \u201ctoo big to manage\u201d \u2013 an outgrowth of the fight over \u201ctoo big to fail,\u201d the idea that a large financial institution can damage the whole economy in times of distress.MetLife, the largest American life insurer, fought the government\u2019s labeling of it as a systemically important financial institution, which would have subjected it to extra regulation. A Federal District Court judge in Washington ruled in favor of the insurer in March, allowing it to shed that label. But concerns remain about whether the country\u2019s biggest financial institutions have adequate controls to manage the host of assets and employees, including outside contractors.\u201c\u2018Too big to manage\u2019 is really the next frontier of regulatory challenges in the financial industry,\u201d said Robert J. Jackson Jr., a professor of law at Columbia University. \u201cEven the best senior managers will tell you that running an organization of this size and scope well, and keeping an eye on all of his employees, is an enormous challenge that we\u2019re not yet prepared for.\u201dA number of large financial institutions, including MetLife, have already shed significant assets. In January, MetLife announced its intention to spin off its American retail life insurance business, which would include the subsidiaries involved in Ms. Ramirez\u2019s lawsuit. The sale will reduce the company\u2019s total assets by more than 25 percent.Without a safety net, Ms. Ramirez said, she had to rethink her entire plan for retirement \u2013 trips to New York to see family and a vacation to Europe. She now rents out a room in her two-bedroom home to help make ends meet. \u201cI had to give up my privacy, along with losing all of my savings,\u201d Ms. Ramirez said.Paul Walker, 71, another reported victim of the scheme who is part of the pending litigation and will serve as a witness in her case, said he was ready to go to court to tell his story.\u201cWhen you lose all your money, that\u2019s like your blood and sweat and tears,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m mad as hell.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Supreme Court Could Weigh In on Redskins Trademark Case", "Date": "2016-05-02", "News": "Supported bySidebarIts decisions often seem to have no rhyme or reason. It has registered vulgar sexual references, and has taken a flexible approach to ethnic slurs. While it has rejected trademarks for \u201cHeeb,\u201d \u201cDago,\u201d \u201cInjun\u201d and \u201cSquaw,\u201d saying they were disparaging, in other cases it has registered trademarks for the exact same terms.But apparently we do, at least where trademarks are concerned.The government, however, says that the trademark law does not bar any speech \u2014 the Slants are free to continue to use their name. What the law does, the Justice Department said in urging the Supreme Court to hear the case, is merely offer \u201cfederal benefits on terms that encourage private activity\u201d in line with legislative policy.But the government, in its Supreme Court brief in the Slants case, Lee v. Tam, No. 15-1293, did not seem ready to adopt millions of trademarks as its own speech. Rather, it said it could confer its benefits based on whether it approved of the speaker\u2019s message.The Slants, as it happens, say they do not intend to disparage anyone. They say they seek to adopt and reform a disparaging term about Asians, much as some gay people have embraced the term \u201cqueer.\u201dThe Redskins, too, say they mean no offense. For a long time, the trademark office agreed, registering Redskins trademarks in 1967, 1974, 1978 and 1990. In 2014, though, it reversed course and canceled six registrations, saying they disparaged Native Americans.Last week, though, the team filed an unusual petition in the Supreme Court. If the justices agree to hear the Slants case, the petition said, they should hear the Redskins case, too, even though the Fourth Circuit has not yet ruled.Native American groups have marshaled substantial evidence that \u201credskins\u201d is widely understood to be a deeply wounding slur. They add, probably correctly, that a ruling for the team would allow federal trademark protection for the most vile racist terms.In most of the world, where laws against hate speech are commonplace, the trademark cases would be easy ones. Should the Supreme Court decide to weigh in, it would again have to assess how robust the American commitment to free speech is.An earlier version of a picture credit with this article misidentified the photographer who took the picture of the band Slants.

{"Headline": "Is There Too Much Democracy in America or Too Little?", "Date": "2016-05-14", "News": "Supported byOpinionDOES the rise of Donald J. Trump mean there is too much democracy in America? This is one way to explain the surprising success of Mr. Trump and Senator Bernie Sanders this year, which resembles the flourishing of anti-system candidates in Europe.In the United States, though, and in Europe, too, the problem is not an excess of democracy, but a democratic deficit that has provoked a demagogic backlash.The need for candidates to raise large sums of money to run for office effectively screens out Republicans and Democrats whose views differ from those of the donor class, even if those views are popular with conservative or progressive voters. The only candidates able to break through the donor-class stranglehold on the political system tend to be those who do not need to raise money that way because they are movement icons like Bernie Sanders, self-financed billionaires like Ross Perot or Michael Bloomberg or celebrities like Arnold Schwarzenegger or Jesse Ventura. Donald Trump is two out of three.A 2016 Presidential Election Panel Survey by the RAND Corporation revealed that the single factor that best predicted voter support for Donald Trump among likely Republican voters was not income, education, race, gender or attitudes toward Muslim or illegal immigration, but agreement with the statement \u201cpeople like me don\u2019t have any say.\u201d What if these and other voters who feel powerless really are?Over the last few generations, for good reasons as well as bad, the number of policy outcomes that voters can actually influence through the ballot box has steadily declined. The Supreme Court has successively removed civil rights, reproductive rights and gay rights from the whims of tyrannical local or national majorities by constitutionalizing them, notwithstanding attempts by conservative legislatures to resist. Beginning with the New Deal, the economic safety net, once limited to state and local governments, has been largely nationalized. About a third of state spending today consists of federal grants-in-aid, including Medicaid and funding for education, transportation and community development. These grants-in-aid often come with strings attached, turning state and local governments into franchises of the federal government for some purposes, except on rare occasions when states rebel, as many states have done in the case of Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion.Within the federal government itself, much of what was once done by congressional legislation is now done by judicial decrees, agency rules or presidential executive orders. In many cases, Congress has abdicated its constitutional responsibilities, preferring to criticize rather than legislate. It is easier, for example, for members of Congress to attack executive orders on immigration than to reform immigration law.Another way to thwart majority rule is to transfer rule-making about domestic safety, privacy, health and the environment from national legislatures to unelected bodies like the secretive transnational committees that negotiate trade deals. Some of the deals also expose nations to lawsuits by corporations or individual investors who claim to be adversely affected by domestic laws or policies. You don\u2019t have to be a protectionist to believe that the delegation of national rule-making authority to unelected officials influenced by corporate representatives and nongovernmental organization staffers sacrifices too much popular sovereignty for what many would consider minor economic gains.As a result of all of these trends, the power of electoral majorities really has ebbed away to a great extent. When people keep putting money into a vending machine that does nothing, or gives them the opposite of what they ordered, some of them will kick the vending machine or turn it over.Voter apathy and disenchantment is a political problem that can be solved only by political reforms that give nonelite voters more actual power to affect policy outcomes \u2014 not by a new tax credit here or a wage subsidy there.BASIC civil rights should not depend on majorities at any level of government. And social insurance programs are most efficient and fair when they are uniform and national, like Social Security and Medicare, unlike Medicaid and unemployment insurance, which vary among states because they are funded both by federal and state governments. But in many other areas of public policy, majorities should be allowed to prevail.The higher the level of government that makes a decision, the less influence ordinary citizens will have. Corporate lobbies or well-funded NGOs that lose battles at the local level can try to persuade state legislatures or members of Congress to reverse the results. In contrast, working-class Americans on the losing end of a local ordinance are unlikely to prevail in the state capital or Washington. Convincing alienated American citizens that their votes count must begin with empowering the city and county governments in which they have the greatest influence.In some states, this might mean loosening strict constitutional or statutory limits on the tax and expenditure authority of local governments, like California\u2019s 1978 ballot initiative Prop 13, which restricted the autonomy of local governments when it came to property taxes. When such limits prevent municipal governments from raising adequate revenues, they may be forced to resort to regressive and more burdensome revenue collection methods like user fees and sales taxes.Cities and counties should also have more freedom to experiment, without being constrained by interest groups working through state legislatures. For example, in many states private Internet service providers have used their clout in state capitals to prohibit or obstruct municipal broadband systems.For its part, Congress can share power as well as money with local voters by putting fewer constraints on the revenues it shares with state and local governments for purposes like education, health and infrastructure.At the level of local government, electoral reforms like ranked choice (instant runoff) voting, which transfers the second-choices of voters who backed losing candidates when there wasn\u2019t a clear winner, can give all voters more influence than standard winner-take-all rules. A number of cities, including San Francisco and Oakland in California and Takoma Park, Md., have adopted ranked choice voting in recent years.In an earlier era of white supremacy and Protestant Christian hegemony, the United States was what the Washington Post columnist Fareed Zakaria and others call an \u201cilliberal democracy,\u201d characterized by majoritarian tyranny. But the solution is not the other extreme of technocratic rule by purportedly enlightened elites, described by the Harvard political theorist Yascha Mounk as \u201cundemocratic liberalism.\u201dMajorities need to be constrained when it comes to essential rights. But removing too many decisions from local to remote governments and from legislators answerable to voters to unelected judges, executive officials and treaty negotiators, is likely to create a democratic deficit that provokes a backlash against the system.If we want to avert the sense of powerlessness among voters that fuels demagogy, the answer is not less democracy in America, but more.Michael Lind is a founder of New America and the author, most recently, of \u201cLand of Promise: An Economic History of the United States.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Online School Enriches Affiliated Companies if Not Its Students", "Date": "2016-05-18", "News": "Supported byCOLUMBUS, Ohio \u2014 The Electronic Classroom of Tomorrow, an online charter school based here, graduated 2,371 students last spring. At the commencement ceremony, a student speaker triumphantly told her classmates that the group was \u201cthe single-largest graduating high school class in the nation.\u201dWhat she did not say was this: Despite the huge number of graduates \u2014 this year, the school is on track to graduate 2,300 \u2014 more students drop out of the Electronic Classroom or fail to finish high school within four years than at any other school in the country, according to federal data. For every 100 students who graduate on time, 80 do not.These schools take on students with unorthodox needs \u2014 like serious medical problems or experiences with bullying \u2014 that traditional districts may find difficult to meet. But with no physical classrooms and high pupil-to-teacher ratios, they cannot provide support in person.With 17,000 pupils, most in high school, the Electronic Classroom is the largest online school in the state. Students and teachers work from home on computers, communicating by email or on the school\u2019s web platform at distances that can be hundreds of miles apart.But while some students may not have found success at the school, the Electronic Classroom has richly rewarded private companies affiliated with its founder, William Lager, a software executive.When students enroll in the Electronic Classroom or in other online charters, a proportion of the state money allotted for each pupil is redirected from traditional school districts to the cyberschools. At the Electronic Classroom, which Mr. Lager founded in 2000, the money has been used to help enrich for-profit companies that he leads. Those companies provide school services, including instructional materials and public relations.Critics say the companies associated with Mr. Lager have not delivered much value. \u201cI don\u2019t begrudge people making money if they really can build a better mousetrap,\u201d said Stephen Dyer, a former Ohio state legislator and the education policy fellow at Innovation Ohio, a Columbus think tank that is sharply critical of online charter schools.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that Mr. Lager has not done a service over all to kids, and certainly not appreciably better than even the most struggling school districts in the state,\u201d Mr. Dyer added. \u201cBut he\u2019s becoming incredibly wealthy doing a very mediocre job for kids.\u201dMr. Lager declined requests for an interview. In an emailed statement on Tuesday, he did not respond to questions about his affiliated companies but said the Electronic Classroom\u2019s graduation rate did not accurately measure the school\u2019s performance.In the statement, he said many students arrived at the school already off-track and have trouble making up the course credits in time to graduate.\u201cHolding a school accountable for such students is like charging a relief pitcher with a loss when they enter a game three runs behind and wiping out the record of the starting pitcher,\u201d his statement said.The statement added that the school \u201cshould be judged based on an accountability system that successfully controls for the academic effects of demographic factors such as poverty, special needs and mobility.\u201dIn an interview, Rick Teeters, the superintendent of the Electronic Classroom, said many of the students were older than was typical for their grade, while others faced serious life challenges, including pregnancy or poverty.Mr. Lager is correct in noting that the student body at the Electronic Classroom is highly mobile; last year more than half the school\u2019s students enrolled for less than the full school year. And of those who dropped out of high school, half were forced to withdraw after being reported truant.Also, according to state data, 19 percent of the students have disabilities, higher than the state average.But the proportion of students who come from low-income families \u2014 just under 72 percent \u2014 is lower than in Cleveland, Columbus and Dayton. Close to three-quarters of the school\u2019s students are white.In a self-published book in 2002, \u201cThe Kids That ECOT Taught,\u201d Mr. Lager wrote that \u201cthe dropout rate is the most critical issue facing our public education system but it is only the first of many problems that can be solved by e-learning.\u201dThrough the Electronic Classroom, he wrote, he planned to make public education more efficient and effective.He added, \u201cNo business could suffer results that any school in Columbus Public delivers and not be driven out of business.\u201d\u201cWhen you take on a difficult student, you\u2019re basically saying, \u2018We feel that our model can help this child be successful,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cAnd if you can\u2019t help them be successful, at some point you have to say your model isn\u2019t working, and if your model is not working, perhaps public dollars shouldn\u2019t be going to pay for it.\u201dSome of those public dollars are being paid to IQ Innovations and Altair Learning Management, companies associated with Mr. Lager. Altair has had a contract with the school since 2000, a school spokesman, Neil Clark, said. According to federal filings, it received $4.2 million in 2014. Mr. Lager is the company\u2019s chief executive.Mr. Clark said Altair provided \u201ca variety of services,\u201d including a program of instruction, strategic planning, public relations, financial reporting and budgeting.Mr. Clark said IQ Innovations had provided the school with grading software and digital curriculum materials since 2008.He said that neither Altair nor IQ Innovations was required to go through a competitive bidding process.At the school\u2019s headquarters, in a former mall set at the back of a parking lot here, attendance clerks sit in a windowless room, tracking how often students log in to the network. Those who do not log in for 30 days are reported as truant.Guidance counselors carry caseloads of up to 500 students each, and the schoolwide pupil-teacher ratio is 30 to one.For some students, the Electronic Classroom can provide a release valve from the pressures or frustrations of a traditional school. Several students assembled by the school to talk to a reporter said they had experienced bullying or boredom before enrolling.\u201cWithout the bullying, I was able to focus,\u201d said Sydney DeBerry, 20, who left a private school to enroll in the Electronic Classroom, which she graduated from in 2014. \u201cThat was a big distraction, not only to my work but to my individuality.\u201dStudents who made it to graduation said self-motivation was crucial. \u201cContrary to popular opinion, you cannot just log on once a week and get by and still pass your classes,\u201d said Dianna Norwood, 19, who graduated last year and is now a student at Ohio State University.But other students complained that the school could make it difficult to succeed.Alliyah Graham, 19, said she had sought out the Electronic Classroom during her junior year because she felt isolated as one of a few African-American girls at a mostly white public school in a Cincinnati suburb.It took three weeks for the Electronic Classroom to enter her in its system, she said. Then it assigned her to classes she had already passed at her previous school. When she ran into technical problems, she said, \u201cI really just had to wing it.\u201dMs. Graham, who hopes to pursue a career in medicine, has also been disappointed by the quality of assignments. She showed a reporter a digital work sheet for a senior English class, in which students were asked to read a passage and then fill in boxes, circles and trapezoids, noting the \u201cmain idea,\u201d a \u201cpicture/drawing,\u201d or \u201cquestions you have.\u201d\u201cI feel like I did this kind of work in middle school,\u201d Ms. Graham said.When she turns in assignments, she said, feedback from teachers is minimal. \u201cGood job!\u201d they write. \u201cKeep going!\u201dShe hopes to graduate this spring.Her cousin, Makyla Woods, 19, moved to Cincinnati from Georgia last year, as a senior, to live with her father. Since Ms. Graham was already enrolled in the Electronic Classroom, Ms. Woods decided to give it a try.But she soon moved out from her father\u2019s apartment, took a job at McDonald\u2019s and stopped doing assignments. \u201cI just got lazy doing work on the computer,\u201d she said.Kitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Abrupt End to The Tampa Tribune After a Blow Delivered by Its Rival", "Date": "2016-05-20", "News": "Supported byTAMPA, Fla. \u2014 A pair of 18-wheel rigs waited outside the former printing plant of The Tampa Tribune on a recent afternoon. Workers were busy dismantling machinery and hauling it away, preparing for the building\u2019s demolition. Nearby, in what had been the newsroom, file folders, reporters\u2019 notebooks and other detritus lay scattered on the floor, evidence of a hasty retreat.The Tribune, whose motto was \u201cLife. Printed Daily,\u201d was abruptly shut down on May 3 after having covered this city and its environs for 123 years. The reasons for its demise were familiar: precipitous drops in advertising, the rush of readers to the web, the fallout of the economic recession. But this particular case felt a little more personal \u2014 and left the journalists who found themselves suddenly out of work with the sense that they had been betrayed.It was The Tribune\u2019s main competitor, The Tampa Bay Times, based 25 miles away in St. Petersburg and owned by the nonprofit Poynter Institute, that dealt the knockout punch by purchasing The Tribune and then immediately shutting it down.\u201cPeople feel like fools, they feel like dupes and they feel deceived,\u201d said Michelle Bearden, a 20-year veteran of The Tribune who was laid off in 2014 and keeps in close touch with former colleagues. \u201cRevolution had already inked the deal with The Tampa Bay Times to sell the paper. There was never any intention to find a new home and continue The Tribune as a competitive entity. There was no commitment to this community, no intention to try to make this newspaper profitable again, no interest in preserving a historical tradition.\u201dAbout 265 people lost their jobs. The Times took control of its rival\u2019s lists of advertisers and subscribers.\u201cIt was quick, it was clinical,\u201d said Joe Henderson, 64, who started at The Tribune in 1974 as a sportswriter and covered 20 World Series championships, several Super Bowls and the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. \u201cI got two months\u2019 salary. I\u2019m fortunate that I\u2019m not in bad shape, but I\u2019m concerned for some of my colleagues. Everybody gave their heart and soul into that paper. I wish it had ended better.\u201dDuring a farewell party at a riverfront restaurant, scores of former Tribune employees wistfully toasted their shared history and rifled through boxes of paraphernalia bearing the newspaper\u2019s name \u2014 T-shirts, beach chairs, mugs, key rings. It was all that remained of their former employer.Over the years, The Tribune \u2014 which was awarded a Pulitzer Prize in 1966 for local investigative reporting \u2014 had won the enduring affection of many of its readers, even as it struggled to assert itself in a protracted circulation war.\u201cThe Tribune was more gritty, The Times more refined,\u201d said Howard Troxler, a former columnist, editor and reporter who spent nine years at The Tribune and 20 years at The Times before retiring in 2011. \u201cThe Tribune was kind of like the poor stepchild.\u201dOccasionally, Mr. Troxler said, \u201cwe broke a huge story over The Times\u2019s head and of course it was always especially sweet.\u201d He said that The Tribune \u2014 whose editorial positions tended to lean right, the opposite of The Times \u2014 sometimes stirred up its more conservative readers with investigations into Tampa\u2019s Hispanic power structure, particularly its judges, prosecutors and legislators.\u201cYet The Tribune knew and loved Tampa, and loved its culture,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of the writers knew it well and wrote a lot of great stories about it.\u201dMarjorie Knapp, a retired grade-school teacher in Pinellas County who was a Tribune reader for about 40 years, said she stopped about three years ago. \u201cLocal writers were let go,\u201d she said. \u201cMore and more news seemed to be wire-service filler. Political stances became more conservative.\u201dThe paper across the bay, founded in 1884 as The West Hillsborough Times and later known as The St. Petersburg Times, changed its name to The Tampa Bay Times in 2012 to telegraph its intention of being the sole provider of printed news in an area of 2.7 million people that includes Clearwater. The Clearwater Sun closed in 1989 after publishing for 75 years.Managers at The Times insisted that buying The Tribune and closing it was the only way forward in a challenging and uncertain market. Both newspapers had made deep staff reductions in recent years and had raised cash by selling their headquarters.Despite being Florida\u2019s highest-circulation newspaper and the winner of 12 Pulitzer Prizes \u2014 two of them this year \u2014 The Times has had a rough patch. It took out a $28 million loan in 2013, and borrowed another $13.3 million just before purchasing The Tribune.\u201cIt\u2019s very hard for a metro area of this size to sustain two newspapers,\u201d Paul C. Tash, chairman and chief executive of The Times, said in an interview. \u201cThe competition between the two newspapers was putting us both in peril.\u201dWhile he regretted that staff members at The Tribune had been left unemployed, Mr. Tash said, \u201cbad things have to happen for good things to happen.\u201d He rejected the notion that his paper had been \u201cavaricious,\u201d and noted that The Times had offered jobs to some Tribune employees, including about 10 writers, a dozen or so of its advertising sales representatives, and others in finance, technology and The Tribune\u2019s three affiliated publications.Given the suddenness of the closing, The Tribune\u2019s staff had no chance to put together a farewell issue, a tradition for newspapers that are closing, typically full of historical references and fond moments. Still, there had been a general sense for some time that The Tribune\u2019s time might be limited.\u201cWe\u2019ve been under threat for years now,\u201d said Ken Koehn, a 25-year veteran of The Tribune who had been its managing editor since 2012. \u201cThey were pretty open about it,\u201d he added, referring to the Times management\u2019s desire to see The Tribune gone.Mr. Koehn recalled that about four years ago, The Times had lowered its annual subscription price to $26 in The Tribune\u2019s core circulation area. \u201cIt used to be 10 times that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it caused our circulation people to react to it, and then no one was making any money.\u201dPointing to The Times\u2019s assumption of millions of dollars in debt, as well as the sale of its headquarters in St. Petersburg and other properties nearby, Mr. Koehn said The Times had paid a heavy price to be the only paper in the area.\u201cThey look at it as though they won in the end, but they really drove both papers to the brink of destruction,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you ask me who won the newspaper war, I\u2019d say no one did. We both lost.\u201dA picture caption with an article on Saturday about the closing of The Tampa Tribune misspelled, in some editions, the given name of a Tribune features reporter. She is Cloe Cabrera, not Cole. The article also misstated the founding date of The Tampa Bay Times, which closed The Tribune after buying it. It was founded in 1884 as The West Hillsborough Times, not in 1898 as The St. Petersburg Times, a name by which it was also known before changing its name to The Tampa Bay Times in 2012.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump, in Switch, Turns to Republican Party for Fund-Raising Help", "Date": "2016-05-09", "News": "Supported byDonald J. Trump took steps to appropriate much of the Republican National Committee\u2019s financial and political infrastructure for his presidential campaign on Monday, amid signs that he and the party would lag dangerously behind the Democrats in raising money for the general election.Mr. Trump, who by the end of March had spent around $40 million of his fortune on the primaries, has said that he may need as much as $1.5 billion for the fall campaign, but that he will seek to raise it from donors rather than continue to self-finance.But Mr. Trump has no fund-raising apparatus to resort to, no network of prolific bundlers to call upon, and little known experience with the type of marathon, one-on-one serial salesmanship and solicitousness that raising so much money is likely to require \u2014 even if individuals can contribute up to the current limit of $334,000 at a time to the party. And he has to do it all in six months, with a deeply divided party that is still absorbing the fact that Mr. Trump is its standard-bearer.\u201cNo one should underestimate how hard it would be for any nominee to raise hundreds of millions of dollars in a very short period of time,\u201d said Mike DuHaime, who was the top strategist for the presidential campaign of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey.While Mr. Trump\u2019s continued feud with the Republican establishment was likely to cheer his supporters, his intense need for money to run his general election campaign suggests the degree to which he will rely heavily on the party\u2019s existing infrastructure.Underscoring the urgency with which Mr. Trump and Republicans will need to increase their fund-raising, some of the party\u2019s allies who spent enormous sums in the 2012 election now appear likely to stay on the sidelines in the presidential race \u2014 including the vast Koch brothers network, which had pledged to spend nearly $900 million in 2016.Mark Holden, chairman of the Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, one of the Koch network\u2019s main umbrella groups, signaled that it would require a significant change in tactics by Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, for his group to open the spigot.\u201cIf during the general election cycle, a candidate were able to garner support from the public with a positive message in support of the issues we care about, and did not engage in personal attacks and mudslinging, we would consider potentially getting involved,\u201d Mr. Holden said. \u201cThat hasn\u2019t happened yet, and there is no indication that this will happen given the current tone and tenor of the various campaigns.\u201dCurrent polls show an uphill battle for Donald Trump should he and Hillary Clinton face off in the general election.The Karl Rove-led group American Crossroads is also in a wait-and-see crouch, with officials saying they have no immediate plans to buttress the Republican nominee. Both it and the Kochs\u2019 network are now expected to focus more on aiding Republicans\u2019 efforts to retain their majority in the Senate.Republican Party officials have pressed Mr. Trump to sign a joint fund-raising agreement, which would allow him to raise money for the national committee and for his own campaign simultaneously. That, in turn, would also give Mr. Trump a defensible answer for why, after months of railing against Wall Street executives and special interests, he recently turned to a former Goldman Sachs executive, Steven Mnuchin, to corral large checks for his campaign.Both Mr. Trump\u2019s aides and party officials were caught by surprise by the abrupt end of the primary contest last week, when Mr. Trump carried Indiana, prompting Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio to withdraw from the race. But the two sides have hurried to wrap up a joint fund-raising agreement, and one is close to being signed, according to people close to the national committee who were not authorized to speak publicly.\u201cAs soon as there\u2019s unity, it\u2019s going to be very easy to do,\u201d Mr. Trump said in an interview Monday, adding that he still planned to write checks for his campaign. \u201cI think we\u2019ll raise $1 billion,\u201d he said.Under a joint fund-raising agreement, Mr. Trump and the party would most likely be able to raise even more than the current individual limit. But such efforts are difficult and take time: While the limits were lower in 2012, Mitt Romney raised less than $500 million under such an agreement that year, using a donor network that had taken years to develop.In one sign of progress for Mr. Trump, Stanley Hubbard, a billionaire broadcasting executive who had donated money to efforts to thwart him, fell in line behind him. \u201cAll my other candidates withdrew, one by one,\u201d Mr. Hubbard said in an interview. \u201cHe was the last man standing.\u201dBut other donors remain staunchly opposed. Paul Singer, the billionaire financier who had backed Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, made clear at a gala Monday night for the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank, that he could not support Mr. Trump and was dismayed by the likely choices in the general election.In a three-and-a-half-hour meeting on Monday at Republican headquarters in Washington, party officials detailed for Mr. Trump\u2019s top aides the range of fund-raising operations and the other political assets at his campaign\u2019s disposal. These include the party\u2019s trove of data on voters nationwide, the hundreds of organizers it has working across the country and the dozens of employees in the party\u2019s communications shop.Mr. Trump chose not to assemble those kinds of extensive operations during the primary season, when he prided himself on winning contests on a shoestring and ran a skeletal operation compared with many of his rivals. So he may have to lean on the Republican National Committee in a way that few nominees have in recent years.In the lengthy meeting, Trump aides and party officials tried to forge a path forward in tandem, with Republican officials delivering the less-than-subtle message that Mr. Trump\u2019s aides were in little position to try a takeover of the group, according to a person briefed on the discussions.Lawmakers have grappled with whether or not to support the presumptive nominee.\u201cWe can both learn a lot from each other because we both have the same objective \u2014 to defeat the Democrats in November,\u201d Corey Lewandowski, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, said after the meeting.Mr. Trump has few aides of his own to take control of the party, which had just $16 million in cash on hand at the end of March. And Speaker Paul D. Ryan\u2019s declaration last week that he was \u201cnot ready\u201d to support Mr. Trump has given cover to some donors who, speaking privately, said they were already dreading the prospect of becoming involved.The Trump campaign plans to try to take firm control over the party\u2019s convention, with two senior advisers to Mr. Trump, Paul Manafort and Barry Bennett, expected to head to Cleveland on Thursday, according to two people close to the Trump campaign.Even as his aides met privately with party officials, Mr. Trump continued to suggest in public that Republicans should embrace him, saying in a CNN interview Monday that the party, \u201cbecause of me, has received more votes than at any time in its history.\u201dWith a meeting set for Thursday with Mr. Ryan, Mr. Trump did not endorse a suggestion by a well-known supporter, Sarah Palin, that Mr. Ryan should be hit with a primary challenge for saying he could not yet endorse Mr. Trump.\u201cI have nothing to do with that,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cSarah is very much a free agent.\u201dMr. Trump is also set to meet with the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who has given him a lukewarm endorsement, on Thursday.Mr. Ryan, meanwhile, was asked about Mr. Trump\u2019s refusal to rule out removing him as chairman of the convention, and he responded with a bit of brinkmanship, offering to step aside if Mr. Trump wanted him to.There were other signs Monday that party unity could prove to be a hard sell.A potential complication to Mr. Trump\u2019s convention planning surfaced, providing the first indication that Mr. Cruz would not simply hand his delegates over: Mr. Cruz\u2019s supporters emailed pro-Cruz convention delegates on Sunday to urge them to attend the convention and take control of two key committees.Many Christian conservatives who supported Mr. Cruz and other candidates harbor deep suspicions about the beliefs of Mr. Trump, a former Democrat who not long ago supported abortion rights, and how compatible they are with long-held conservative stances on social issues espoused in the official Republican Party platform.At the same time, Mr. Trump appeared to lose one potential vice-presidential prospect when Mr. Rubio, the former rival whom he called \u201cLittle Marco,\u201d said he had no interest in joining the ticket. Mr. Rubio said his reservations about Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201ccampaign and concerns with many of his policies remain unchanged.\u201dJonathan Martin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New President of Brazil, Michel Temer, Signals More Conservative Shift", "Date": "2016-05-12", "News": "Supported by\u201cHe\u2019ll be able to sweep away the ideology of pathological leftists,\u201d Mr. Malafaia added of a conservative lawmaker whom Mr. Temer chose as education minister.For more than a decade, Brazil has been an anchor of leftist politics in the region, less strident than the governments in countries like Venezuela and Cuba, but openly supportive of them and committed to its own platform of reducing inequality.But parts of Latin America are now drifting away from the left after elections in neighboring countries like Argentina and Paraguay. Mr. Temer seems to be embracing a more conservative disposition for his government as well, with the country\u2019s business establishment pressuring him to privatize state-controlled companies and cut public spending.To many of Mr. Temer\u2019s critics, the shift is perhaps most evident in the role of women in his and Ms. Rousseff\u2019s administrations.The contrasts could not be more glaring. Ms. Rousseff, 68, was a former operative in an urban guerrilla group. She was tortured during the military dictatorship and eventually rose to lead the board of the national oil company before becoming Brazil\u2019s first female president.Until recently, relatively few Brazilians had even heard of Mr. Temer. When they did, it often involved references to his wife, Marcela Temer, 32, a former beauty pageant contestant who is 43 years younger than he is. They met when she was just 18.The magazine did not mention the tattoo on the nape of Ms. Temer\u2019s neck featuring her husband\u2019s name, but the message was clear: Mr. Temer, a law professor and career politician, embodies a more conservative approach than Ms. Rousseff in the corridors of power and in his own home.Then there is the issue of race. After a long stretch in which Brazil pressed ahead with affirmative action policies, Mr. Temer\u2019s critics point out the lack of Afro-Brazilians in his cabinet, especially when nearly 51 percent of Brazilians define themselves as black or mixed race, according to the 2010 census.In a speech to the nation on Thursday, Mr. Temer said he would seek to soothe tensions in Brazil, a nation polarized by the impeachment trial of Ms. Rousseff. She is accused of manipulating the federal budget to hide yawning deficits, a budgetary sleight of hand that her critics say helped her get re-elected in 2014.\u201cIt\u2019s urgent to seek the unity of Brazil,\u201d Mr. Temer said during a ceremony introducing his ministers. \u201cWe urgently need a government of national salvation.\u201dThe new president\u2019s supporters point out that he considered a couple of women for cabinet-level posts, including Renata Abreu, 34, a lawmaker, to oversee human rights policies.But that effort, along with other test balloons, did not prosper. First, it became widely known that Ms. Abreu had voted in favor of legislation to make it difficult for women who are raped to get abortions. Then Mr. Temer opted to fold the human rights post into the Ministry of Justice, making it a second-tier appointment.Mr. Temer\u2019s offer of the science ministry to Marcos Pereira, an evangelical pastor who does not believe in evolution, also fizzled. He named Mr. Pereira trade minister instead. Then, to the dismay of leaders in Brazil\u2019s scientific community, Mr. Temer merged the ministries of science and communications.Like many of Brazil\u2019s political leaders, Mr. Temer has legal problems of his own. He was recently found guilty of violating campaign finance limits, a conviction that could make him ineligible to run for office for eight years, leaving a cloud of scandal that has raised concerns about his capacity to govern with a strong mandate.\u201cTemer faces the fundamental problem of legitimacy,\u201d said Michael Shifter, the president of Inter-American Dialogue, a policy group in Washington. \u201cHe did not become president as a result of a popular vote, but rather because of a controversial impeachment process.\u201dBut some argue, in Mr. Temer\u2019s favor, that his cabinet includes officials who held important posts when Ms. Rousseff\u2019s leftist Workers\u2019 Party was in control. Henrique Meirelles, a banker who is the new finance minister, served as central bank president for eight years during the government of Ms. Rousseff\u2019s predecessor and mentor, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, from 2003 through 2010.During that time, Brazil\u2019s government gained the respect of investors as incomes soared during a commodities boom. Prominent figures in Brazil\u2019s financial markets hope that Mr. Meirelles can rebuild that credibility.The rancor around the ouster of Ms. Rousseff, who will go on trial in the Senate, was evident Thursday on the streets of Bras\u00edlia, the capital. Dozens of women chained themselves to barriers surrounding the presidential palace, shouting slogans in support of Ms. Rousseff and expressing alarm about Mr. Temer\u2019s top advisers.Maria Herm\u00ednia Tavares de Almeida, a political scientist at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, said that the last time a Brazilian cabinet did not have any women was in the early 1980s, during the military dictatorship that ruled from 1964 to 1985.Until Mr. Temer\u2019s rise to power on Thursday, she said, \u201call the democratic governments have had women.\u201dVinod Sreeharsha contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro, and Paula Moura from Bras\u00edlia.videovideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Boon for Soil, and for the Environment", "Date": "2016-05-17", "News": "Supported bySpecial Report: Food for TomorrowLONDON \u2014 When Gabe Brown and his wife bought their farm near Bismarck, North Dakota, from her parents in 1991, testing found the soil badly depleted, its carbon down to just a quarter of levels once considered natural in the area. Today the Brown farm and ranch is home to a diverse and thriving mix of plants and animals. And carbon, the building block of the rich humus that gives soil its density and nutrients, has more than tripled. That is a boon not just for the farm\u2019s productivity and its bottom line, but also for the global climate.Agriculture is often cast as an environmental villain, its pesticides tainting water, its hunger for land driving deforestation. Worldwide, it is responsible for nearly a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions.Now, though, a growing number of experts, environmentalists and farmers themselves see their fields as a powerful weapon in the fight to slow climate change, their very soil a potentially vast repository for the carbon that is warming the atmosphere. Critically for an industry that must produce an ever-larger bounty to feed a growing global population, restoring lost carbon to the soil also increases its ability to support crops and withstand drought.\u201cEveryone talks about sustainable,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cWhy do we want to sustain a degraded resource? We need to be regenerative, we need to take that carbon out of the atmosphere and put it back into the cycle, where it belongs.\u201dSince people began farming, the world\u2019s cultivated soils have lost 50 percent to 70 percent of their natural carbon, said Rattan Lal, a professor of soil science at the Ohio State University. That number is even higher in parts of south Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean, he added.Globally, those depleted soils could reabsorb 80 billion to 100 billion metric tons of carbon, reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide by 38 to 50 parts per million, Mr. Lal said. That does not include the carbon that could be simultaneously sequestered into vegetation, but the numbers are significant on their own, equaling up to 40 percent of the increase in concentrations since pre-industrial times. Last year, atmospheric carbon dioxide for the first time hit a monthly average of 400 parts per million, a symbolic threshold but one that many experts say could indicate that warming will soon spiral beyond control. When carbon escapes from soil, it combines with oxygen to form carbon dioxide. Sometimes the loss is gradual, the result of plowing that leaves upturned layers of earth exposed to the elements, or of failure to replant or cover fields after harvest.Sometimes it happens more suddenly. The thick prairie sod of America\u2019s Great Plains was a rich carbon store until settlers tore it up for farms, leaving hundreds of millions of tons of topsoil to be blown away in the Dust Bowl years. The destruction of millions of acres of carbon-rich Indonesian peatlands for palm oil plantations is helping to drive climate change today.Low carbon levels leave the ground nutrient-poor, requiring ever-greater amounts of fertilizer to support crops. They also make for thin soil that is vulnerable to erosion and less able to retain water, so yields suffer quickly in times of drought.To bring levels back up, a set of techniques known as carbon farming, or regenerative farming, encourage and complement the process by which plants draw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, break it down and sequester carbon into soil. They include refraining from tilling, or turning, the soil; mixing crops together rather than growing large fields of just one type; planting trees and shrubs near or among crops; and leaving stalks and other cuttings on fields to decay.Mr. Brown keeps his fields planted for as much of the year as possible to minimize nutrient loss. When he mixes clover and oats in the same field, the clover fixes nitrogen into the soil. After the oats are harvested, livestock graze the clover and leave their manure behind.Such strategies have allowed him to stop using synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, reducing costs. And the rich soil not only yields higher volumes, but the crops are more nutritionally dense than those grown on depleted land, he says.\u201cEconomically, it\u2019s much, much, much more profitable,\u201d he said.Mr. Brown\u2019s approach is very different from the techniques of industrial-scale farming that have taken hold in the United States and other wealthy countries, where single crops stretch over many acres, and fertilizers and pesticides are used heavily.Things are worse in poorer nations, where farmers\u2019 desperation often means they are unable to care for the soil, Mr. Lal said. He recalled seeing a Mexican sharecropper carting corn straw away from the fields to sell: \u201cI said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you leave it on the land? The land will be better next year.\u2019 And he said, \u2018This land will not be mine next year, and I need money now.\u201d\u2019There is some momentum behind a shift. The French government, which helped broker last year\u2019s landmark Paris Agreement on climate change, is pushing an effort to increase soil carbon stocks by 0.4 percent annually, which it says would halt the rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.Mr. Lal called the target unrealistic, but said achieving just a quarter of that sequestration would be meaningful. In a generation, he said, agriculture could become carbon neutral, removing all the emissions it creates, for example through the energy used by farm equipment.Worldwide, 5 percent to 10 percent of growers are using regenerative, climate-friendly techniques, said Louis Bockel, a policy officer at the United Nations\u2019 Food and Agriculture Organization. That number is likely to increase, he said, as multinational institutions and wealthy nations start incorporating carbon sequestration incentives into existing aid to farmers in poor countries.\u201cMore and more additional funding will be available\u201d to encourage such efforts, Mr. Bockel added. \u201cWe are moving quite quickly on this.\u201dFarmers need financing to help them adopt new techniques, though generally only through a two-to-three-year transition period, said Eric Toensmeier, author of \u201cThe Carbon Farming Solution.\u201d That money could come through a higher price charged for foods whose cultivation encourages sequestration, via a carbon tax or through trading systems in which polluters buy credits to offset their emissions, he said. Programs known as payment for environmental services, in which governments or others pay farmers for stewardship of land, are another potential avenue.With that kind of support, the industry could be ready to do things differently, said Ceris Jones, a climate change adviser at the National Farmers Union in Britain.\u201cPeople say that farmers are pretty conservative, but actually practice can change quite quickly,\u201d she said.Another obstacle is the lack of an agreed-upon system for measuring carbon sequestration in soil, which will be required as the basis for any payments, Mr. Toensmeier said.Technically, though, many elements of carbon farming are ready to be put into practice quickly, he said. Something as simple as planting trees around fields drastically increases the amount of carbon fixed into soil, Mr. Toensmeier said.\u201cI would love to see a huge, major transformation of agriculture in the industrialized world, but if we started with just adding trees to the system we have, it\u2019s a huge gain,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can sort of meet farmers where they are\u201d It\u2019s not just crops. The earth beneath the world\u2019s grasslands, from America\u2019s Great Plains to the Tibetan Steppe and the Sahel of Africa, holds about a fifth of all soil carbon stocks, the Food and Agriculture Organization estimates. In many places that soil is badly depleted.\u201cThis land is waiting to be filled up again with carbon if we could manage it sustainably,\u201d said Courtney White, author of the book \u201cGrass, Soil, Hope.\u201dThat means moving livestock frequently so each patch of land is grazed just once a year, mimicking the patterns of the native bison that once roamed the American West, he said. The combination of stimulation during animals\u2019 brief presence and long periods of rest encourages plants to lay down more carbon, Mr. White said. With policies that encourage change, Mr. Toensmeier said, agriculture could benefit the climate rather than harming it. \u201cThere do seem to be a remarkable number of win-win opportunities, which is great news,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t hear a lot of great news about climate change.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Senate Votes to Advance Emergency Funding to Fight Zika Virus", "Date": "2016-05-17", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate voted on Tuesday to advance $1.1 billion in emergency financing to combat the mosquito-borne Zika virus \u2014 less than the $1.9 billion requested by the White House, and setting up a confrontation with House Republicans who have put forward a plan with just $622 million reallocated from other programs.The action in the Senate was a sign that even in a bitterly contentious election year, compromise is still possible, at least in that chamber. A proposal to grant the full White House request failed, as did a proposal that would have appropriated the money, but with offsetting spending cuts.The vote on the compromise plan was 68 to 29, with 22 Republicans joining Democrats in favor and no Democrats opposed.A number of Senate Republicans, particularly from Southern states that face the most immediate threat from Zika virus, spoke out forcefully for government action, putting added pressure on House Republicans who have accused the Obama administration of using the threat of Zika to demand a \u201cslush fund\u201d from Congress.But Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, said he had recently spent four hours at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention looking at models of how the virus could spread.\u201cIf anybody in the audience or in this room doesn\u2019t think this is an emergency, you should have been with Senator Collins and I two weeks ago at the C.D.C. in Atlanta,\u201d Mr. Isakson said, referring to Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. \u201cThere have already been one million cases in the Caribbean and Central America and South America, 500 cases in the United States of America, and it\u2019s going to grow.\u201d\u201cThis is a lot of money, but it is only a pittance compared to what it would cost if the epidemic got out of control and we didn\u2019t stop it and we didn\u2019t defeat it,\u201d he continued.On Monday, however, House Republicans put forward legislation that would require the Obama administration to reallocate $622 million from existing health programs to fight Zika, which causes severe birth defects.In announcing their proposal, House Republicans said in a statement that they were supporting \u201ccritical activities that must begin immediately, such as vaccine development and mosquito control.\u201dThe White House condemned their refusal to consider the Zika virus a health emergency that warrants new spending without corresponding cuts.\u201cIt is woefully insufficient given the significant risk that is posed by Zika,\u201d the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, said. He added, \u201cThe House of Representatives is three months late and more than a billion short of doing what\u2019s necessary to protect the American people.\u201dDr. Thomas R. Frieden, the C.D.C. director, was similarly incensed. \u201cThis is no way to fight an epidemic,\u201d he said in a telephone interview.A Senate amendment, advanced on Tuesday, proposed $1.1 billion in emergency financing for Zika preparedness and response. The legislation was negotiated by Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, and Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington.\u201cWe\u2019re scraping together dollars to try to move as quickly as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re borrowing money from other programs. We\u2019re writing short-term contracts. We can\u2019t make long-term commitments to families to follow their kids. We can\u2019t do long-term studies on how to stop the mosquito. We want to put together a whole package on how to kill inside, outside, how to kill larvae, how to do what works best. And it\u2019s not possible under the House version.\u201dWhile the political arguments have focused on the broad numbers, federal health officials have been parsing the fine print of the legislation to get a sense of the real-life implications of each proposal.Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is in charge of overseeing efforts to develop a vaccine, and other Zika research, said his policy decisions would hinge on the amount of money approved.The measure advanced by the Senate on Tuesday would allocate $200 million to the National Institutes of Health, an amount that Dr. Fauci described as \u201cnot catastrophic.\u201d\u201cEven in my worst-case scenario, I will be able to do most of my vaccine stuff,\u201d he said.In the House, the Republican legislation highlighted a core philosophical dispute that has frequently paralyzed Washington in recent years: a refusal by some hard-line conservative Republicans to support any new federal spending, even as President Obama and his fellow Democrats insist that the government\u2019s involvement must grow to meet expanding needs.Democrats on Tuesday denounced the refusal to support new government spending even in emergency situations.Scientists increasingly believe that the Zika virus may cause birth defects in infants. Here\u2019s why.\u201cOur friends on the other side of the aisle need to wake up,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, shouted at a news conference. \u201cWe have new crises. It takes some money to fix them. Whether it\u2019s Zika, the crisis in Flint or opioids, we have to invest some dollars in the fights if we\u2019re going to solve the problems. They\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re in the past. They\u2019re just saying: \u2018Cut \u2014 cut everything. Don\u2019t spend.\u2019 Even when there\u2019s a national emergency.\u201dThe House initiative \u2014 announced by Representative Harold Rogers, Republican of Kentucky and chairman of the Appropriations Committee \u2014 would require the administration to redirect $622.1 million from other federal health programs. Much of it would come from money that was approved to fight the Ebola virus and that health officials say is still needed for that purpose.The White House, which first requested the $1.9 billion in February, has already redirected more than $500 million that had been set aside to counter Ebola, and the office of Paul D. Ryan, the speaker, said that as a result, the Republican legislation would provide a total of $1.2 billion to fight Zika.The compromise measure that ultimately won enough support to advance was brokered by Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, in negotiations with Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington.Mr. Blunt said the negotiators had scrutinized the White House request and rejected parts of it.\u201cIt really does look carefully at what the administration proposed and eliminate the things that aren\u2019t part of an emergency response to Zika,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have trimmed this package back to what really addresses the emergency at this time.\u201dMr. Blunt noted that the Senate measure would finance the battle against Zika virus through Sept. 30, 2017, compared with the House measure, which was designed to run only until Sept. 30 of this year.Dr. Johnny Rull\u00e1n, a former territorial health secretary for Puerto Rico and now an adviser to the governor for the Zika epidemic, said federal money was urgently needed to combat the virus on many fronts, including public education campaigns stressing that Zika can be transmitted by sex \u2014 potentially an even bigger risk than from mosquitoes.Donald G.

Gwin, a co-managing partner of the executive recruitment company\u2019s global C.E.O. and board practice.That compares with increases in directorships for women and African-Americans, but a decline in the number of Asians and Asian-Americans picked to fill board positions.Women made up 29.8 percent of the new directors named last year, up slightly from 29.2 percent in 2014, according to the board monitor, which tracks proxy filings, news releases and other corporate disclosures about board membership.Even as the percentage of new women directors has been rising each year, from 18 percent in 2009, the board monitor said it had revised downward a projection that women would reach parity with men in the number of new directors by 2024. It now predicts that women will make up 50 percent of new directors by 2026.African-Americans made modest strides, accounting last year for 9.3 percent of new directors, up from 8.3 percent in 2014. The percentage of African-Americans, who in 2014 made up 12.4 percent of the population in the United States, rose from 5.3 percent of new directors in 2009 to 10.3 percent in 2013, but it has since declined.Asians and Asian-Americans also lost some ground, accounting for only 4.8 percent of board seats filled in 2015, according to the report. That was down from 5.3 percent in 2014. Generally, their appointments have stayed steady in recent years, closely paralleling the share of Asians in the population, which was 5.3 percent in 2014.For minorities, the biggest obstacle to gaining entry to the boardroom is lack of operating or financial experience, Ms. Gwin said. Last year, 73.2 percent of newly appointed directors were current chief executives or chief financial officers, the report found. In addition, board seats do not turn over quickly. Last year, for example, only 8.5 percent of board seats changed hands.And their replacements are not young. The average age of the new directors was 58, the same as the year before. Some attribute this to an innately conservative business culture; others point to networks of white men who connect through college, work and social activities and who feel more comfortable with people who look like them.The absence of Hispanic board members appears to come, in large part, from the shortage of Hispanic chief executives, said Cid D. Wilson, president and chief executive of the Hispanic Association on Corporate Responsibility.Only nine Hispanics currently serve as chief executives of Fortune 500 companies, he noted, including Carlos Rodriguez, chief executive of ADP, and Oscar Munoz, chief executive of United Airlines.\u201cThis leads to a shortage of Hispanic candidates being considered for board seats,\u201d Mr. Wilson said.The United States has the second-largest Spanish-speaking population in the world, second only to Mexico, he noted.\u201cCompanies need to do more to recruit Latinos into the boardroom if they are to compete successfully for the growing Latino consumers and future talent,\u201d said Mr. Wilson, whose association hosts programs to help board prospects gain skills and experience to increase their chances of being considered for openings.Over all, choosing board candidates who are sitting or retired chief executives \u201cslows the advancement of diversity in the boardroom,\u201d Ms. Gwin said, \u201cbecause the pool of current and former C.E.O.s is not sufficiently diverse.\u201dShe added, \u201cExperienced general managers, finance executives and functional leaders also can make significant contributions in the boardroom.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Dark Money Is Bad Business", "Date": "2016-05-10", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsBoston \u2014 IT\u2019S only May, but this presidential election is on track to be one of the most expensive ever. So far two-thirds of political advertising dollars have largely come from anonymous corporate donations, funneled through what have been referred to as \u201cdark money\u201d nonprofit groups that freely engage in electoral and legislative politics, but don\u2019t have to disclose their donors, expenditures or even their members.One of the most promising strategies to stem the tide of corporate dark money is a proposed rule at the Securities and Exchange Commission that would require public companies to report the amounts and recipients of their political spending. The rule has received a groundswell of support from a bipartisan group of former S.E.C. commissioners, state treasurers and law professors, and has generated more than one million public comments.Defenders of the status quo argue the companies are simply exercising their right to free speech; critics contend that such speech, when anonymous, does immense harm to the democratic process.But as lawyers who specialize in investor rights, we see another critical, nonpartisan reason to support the rule: When it comes to political spending, companies are often not as informed as one might think \u2014 especially when it comes to dark money.By mandating disclosure, the rule would allow investors to serve as a potential check on risky political donations, and help investors determine whether a company\u2019s political spending habits make its shares a good investment in the first place.In theory, a company gives money to influence politics in its favor. But there are countless examples where dark-money spending has undermined their business interests. In fact, giving to dark-money groups may be the riskiest kind of political spending, because companies often have no idea who else is giving, and whether their interests are in competition.For example, in 2010 Target, a company that supports gay rights and has openly gay employees, donated $150,000 to a Minnesota organization called MN Forward, which advocates pro-business tax and economic development policies. But MN Forward ran TV ads supporting a candidate for governor who sought a state constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. When news about the donation came to light, the company faced an employee backlash and a boycott from consumers that ultimately resulted in a personal apology from Gregg Steinhafel, Target\u2019s chief executive, and the formation of a committee to review the company\u2019s political spending.That same year, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a trade association whose members include major manufacturers of contraceptive products such as Merck and Johnson & Johnson, gave a total of $4.8 million to two nonprofits, the American Action Network and the American Future Fund, because they promoted limited government. Both organizations, however, used the money to help elect lawmakers who voted to eliminate funding for access to contraceptives through programs like Title X and Planned Parenthood.A number of corporations had also placed their business interests at risk as members of the American Legislative Exchange Council, until they resigned in 2014. For instance, while Google was devoting significant resources toward developing green energy technologies, its ALEC membership dues were helping campaigns seeking to gut renewable energy standards.Why aren\u2019t companies more careful? One major reason is that the very nature of dark-money giving means that investors have virtually no information about it, and therefore cannot hold companies accountable for their mistakes.Political spending is considered an ordinary business expense under corporate law, which means that companies have no obligation to disclose it to shareholders (and rarely do so voluntarily). It is therefore impossible for investors to track dark-money spending, at best learning about it long after the fact from watchdog groups and investigative journalists.The rule wouldn\u2019t restrict the companies\u2019 right to give money, and there may be instances where political spending is a smart move. For example, a company may reasonably believe that giving to an organization that opposes some of its products is worthwhile because the organization successfully lobbies for lower corporate tax rates.Beyond the risk to business interests, investors should have a right to know whether their money is going toward politicians, legislation or causes that they support or oppose, as union members already have. More and more investors are choosing to make decisions on that basis: Between 2012 and 2014, socially responsible investing in the United States increased by 76 percent, from $3.74 trillion to $6.75 trillion.The S.E.C. has yet to officially endorse a political-spending rule. However, this week, the commission will be required to finally state its position on the rule in response to a lawsuit in the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. We believe that, in addition to the integrity of our democracy, transparent political spending is essential to good corporate governance and sound investment.An Op-Ed article on May 10 about the regulation of \u201cdark money\u201d in political campaigns misstated the nature of two-thirds of anonymous, third-party spending during this election cycle. It is political advertising spending, not overall spending.Kathleen M. Donovan-Maher and Steven L. Groopman are attorneys with the law firm Berman DeValerio.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Drones Pique the Interest of Entrepreneurs", "Date": "2016-05-25", "News": "Supported byOver the last few years, drones have gone from being a contentious military tool for airstrikes to a far more mundane magnet for aerial hobbyists.But as drones move into the mainstream, entrepreneurs are finding ways to harness the technology as the core of their business ideas.Ryan Jenson showed its business potential in a demonstration for his new venture, HoneyComb. His idea was to use drones to scout fields for irrigation and pest problems. If not caught early, such problems can cost farmers thousands of dollars an acre.Nevertheless, farmers were left scratching their heads. Mr. Jenson said they asked him: \u201cWhy do we need those? And if we do, how can we afford them?\u201dHe and his two co-founders at HoneyComb built a rough prototype. On a sunny day in August 2013, they gathered 50 growers at Gold Dust Farms, a 9,000-acre farm in southern Oregon that specializes in potatoes.As the drone soared in the sky above, the growers watched a screen nearby that showed a view from the drone\u2019s video camera of the fields below. Once the drone returned, they saw photographs it had taken on its trip.\u201cA big light bulb lit up,\u201d said Mr. Jenson, 30, who had an interest in aerospace and engineering at a young age. He took college classes at age 14 and began working for NASA at 18. \u201cWhen they realized, \u2018You\u2019re telling me I can see every square inch of my farm whenever I want?\u2019 They were sold.\u201dOne recent convert to HoneyComb\u2019s AgDrone found an irrigation leak, saving him nearly $100,000 in crop loss. Another grower was able to detect the onset of blight in his potatoes early enough to apply the needed fungicide in time to save the crop.The company, based in Wilsonville, Ore., now has 16 employees and has raised $2 million in financing.HoneyComb is part of a new wave of commercial drone start-ups. Often described as \u201cdrone services,\u201d these companies are one-stop shops, providing both the drones to collect the data and the software to analyze it afterward.\u201cFrom catastrophe response to news-gathering to construction-site monitoring, commercial drones represent one of the fastest-growing sectors in technology,\u201d said Lisa Ellman, a partner and Washington-based co-chairwoman of the unmanned aircraft systems practice at the law firm Hogan Lovells.While the opportunity looms large, starting a new business centered on drones (or unmanned aircraft systems, as they are officially known) has its challenges, not least of which are laws that seem to be a moving target. Many of these start-ups are small, and venture financing has been hard to secure.\u201cThe regulations have made it very difficult for many small businesses to pull themselves up from the bootstraps,\u201d says Jeffrey J. Antonelli, a Chicago lawyer whose legal practice focuses on drones.Most have gone to larger companies. Companies in photography, film and real estate have received the largest share of these permits.The biggest hurdle, most small businesses say, is that once they have the drone permit, they still need someone with a manned vehicle license \u2014 like an airplane or helicopter pilot \u2014 to fly it.One significant potential change would be to drop the requirement for a manned vehicle license. Instead, drone pilot certification would resemble getting a driver\u2019s license at the department of motor vehicles, a process that could be completed in weeks rather than months.Identified Technologies recently brought on two employees who used to work with commercial airlines, with the aim of helping clients get the F.A.A. exemption, find pilots, get drone insurance and complete paperwork.\u201cPeople don\u2019t realize how much has to be done before and after a flight to remain compliant,\u201d said the company\u2019s founder, Dick Zhang. \u201cWe take care of everything so clients don\u2019t have to.\u201dAs the final barriers to entry come down, many anticipate a flood of new businesses. \u201cWhen cellphones were first invented, we didn\u2019t envision all the ways we would use them,\u201d said Ms. Ellman of Hogan Lovells. \u201cDrones are very similar.\u201dMost important, hobbyists could help public perception of the industry\u2019s potential, said Mr. Jenson of HoneyComb.\u201cPeople don\u2019t yet automatically think of drones as commercial tools,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re getting closer.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why a B-Minus Economy May Be Causing a Turbulent Election", "Date": "2016-05-24", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceThe boring economy seems to be making this presidential race even more exciting. And uncertain.The economy has reliably been one of the most important factors influencing a presidential election. A strong economy helps to keep the party in power in power. A weak economy tends to cause voters to want to change the residents of the White House.But right now, the economy could be best described as moderately, perhaps deceptively, successful.Growth is lukewarm, but it has been consistent enough to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs. Wages have not risen by much, and the uneven recovery has left segments of the population behind. But the overall unemployment rate is down to 5 percent. That\u2019s unusual for a presidential election season \u2014 it has been at 5 percent or lower in only three of the 14 contests that have taken place since 1960.The quiet strength of the economy appears to be affecting the campaign. It\u2019s far easier for candidates to make economic policy messages resonate when the economy is roaring: the elections of 1996 (Dole vs. Clinton) and 2004 (Bush vs. Kerry). Or when the economy is in the doldrums: 1992 (Bush vs. Clinton). Or when it\u2019s facing threats: (high inflation for Reagan vs. Carter in 1980 and a global financial meltdown for McCain vs. Obama in 2008). But when it\u2019s middling?Indeed, the lack of stark economic problems may have allowed Mr. Trump to push unconventional policies. If the economy were repeating the plunge of 2008, fewer voters might be prepared to support a candidate whose policies would disrupt world trade and whose tax cuts would almost certainly lead to a far bigger budget deficit. And the advances in the economy make it harder for Mr. Sanders to further tap discontent over issues like income inequality.The B-minus economy will also pose a challenge to whomever wins the White House in November.Still, if the economy holds, campaign analysts will be scraping around for precedents.George H.W. Bush won in 1988 against Michael Dukakis by promising to take the country on much the same course as President Reagan did. But while the economy has achieved steady gains under President Obama, Mrs. Clinton might not gain a big advantage by portraying herself as his economic standard-bearer. The economy just hasn\u2019t been growing fast enough. Economists expect the economy to grow at around 2 percent this year. In the second half of 1988, it grew at nearly double that rate.The only years since 1960 when the economy was growing at more than 2 percent and unemployment was at 5 percent or lower at the time of the election are 1964 (Goldwater vs. Johnson), 1968 (Nixon vs. Humphrey) and 2000 (Bush vs. Gore). But the contests of 1964 (the perception that Barry Goldwater was extreme) and 1968 (Vietnam and social disruption) were heavily influenced by noneconomic factors. The 2000 election, which occurred as a big speculative bubble in the stock market and the technology sector was deflating, also lacks strong parallels to today.Jobs and economic growth will always matter to voters. Whipsaw boom-bust economic cycles of the postwar years played a part in deciding who was president, and the American business cycle hasn\u2019t suddenly gone away. But nowadays there are no big wars to finance, just a few long, grinding commitments; inflation is under control; and the recent overhaul of the financial sector appears to have promoted steady credit growth without creating widespread losses. We may be in an era when politicians cannot make much hay out of the economy.If Mrs. Clinton becomes the Democratic nominee and wins in November, it could show that a cautious candidate can do well in a composed economy. True, the lack of drama in the economy may also be helping Mr. Trump run a wrecking-ball campaign by stirring up other issues. But think about it: If there is one force that can derail him, or restrain him, it\u2019s the threat that the economy won\u2019t tolerate his more unconventional policies.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Biggest Hedge Fund Set to Get $22 Million From Connecticut", "Date": "2016-05-27", "News": "Supported byThe world\u2019s biggest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, is poised to receive $22 million in financial aid from Connecticut in an effort to keep it from moving its headquarters out of the state.The financial commitment to Bridgewater, the $150 billion fund founded by the billionaire Ray Dalio, is occurring as Connecticut is fighting to keep companies from leaving the state after a tax increase last year. In January, General Electric announced it would move its Fairfield, Conn., headquarters to Boston after 41 years.Bridgewater is popular with public pension funds and sovereign wealth funds and has grown rapidly in recent years. Its success in bringing in new investors has helped to enrich its top executives, as have years of big gains.However, while many of its funds made profits for its investors last year, Bridgewater\u2019s All Weather fund, which is popular among pension funds, lost 7 percent.Mr. Dalio, 66, has topped the list of top-paid hedge fund chiefs for years, making $1.4 billion in 2015 alone, according to Institutional Investor\u2019s Alpha magazine. That year, two other top Bridgewater executives, Robert Prince and Greg Jensen, each brought home $250 million.Across the industry, investors are voicing frustration over disappointing hedge fund performance and the high fees managers earn. On average, investors pay 2 percent of total assets under management and 20 percent of any gains.A spokesman for Bridgewater did not return calls seeking comment.Connecticut\u2019s decision to finance Bridgewater\u2019s expansion in the state is part of Gov.

{"Headline": "\u2018Brexit\u2019 Could Spell More Austerity for Britain, Study Warns", "Date": "2016-05-25", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s campaign to keep Britain in the European Union was bolstered on Wednesday by a report from one of the country\u2019s most authoritative economic research bodies, which concluded that a withdrawal from the bloc would lead to up to two more years of public spending cuts or tax increases.Voters in Britain are to decide in a referendum on June 23 whether to remain in the 28-nation European Union. The economic risks of a departure have been highlighted repeatedly by those who want to remain, while supporters of a withdrawal have focused increasingly on issues such as the need to curtail immigration and regain national sovereignty.The verdict of the Institute for Fiscal Studies is significant because the body has a track record of contradicting government claims on the economy, and its intervention provoked an angry response from campaigners for an exit, who sought to question the institute\u2019s independence on the issue.The report joins a chorus of analysis that has warned of the economic risks of leaving the bloc, including from the International Monetary Fund; from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development; and from the Bank of England, Britain\u2019s central bank.In its report, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said that a British departure would have a negative impact on public finances worth 20 billion pounds to 40 billion pounds, or $29 billion to $58 billion, in 2019\u201320, more than enough to wipe out the government\u2019s plans to create a surplus.\u201cDealing with the public finance effect would require at least an additional one or two years of \u2018austerity\u2019 \u2014 spending cuts or tax rises \u2014 at the same rate as we have experienced recently to get the public finances back to balance (should that remain the government\u2019s priority),\u201d the institute said.The study dealt another blow to the campaign to leave the European Union. Supporters of the push have claimed that a withdrawal would benefit Britain by \u00a3350 million a week, through the cancellation of its financial contribution to the bloc.But the institute\u2019s report pointed out that this figure excluded money sent back to London under a rebate plan, and that it was also based on Britain\u2019s gross contribution and did not take account of European Union spending in Britain, for example to support farmers.If both of those factors were accounted for, the institute said, Britain would gain around \u00a38 billion a year \u2014 or about \u00a3150 million a week \u2014 from quitting, less than half the sum claimed by campaigners for a withdrawal. Such a figure would be easily outweighed by the negative impact on the economy, the report concluded.\u201cIf leaving the E.U. were to reduce national income by just 0.6 percent, that would be enough to outweigh the positive effect on the public finances,\u201d the document said.Britain will hold a referendum on Thursday on whether to leave the European Union, a decision nicknamed \u201cBrexit.\u201dSupporters of an exit, however, criticized the study. Vote Leave, the campaign that is pushing for a British withdrawal, said that the authors of a particular study on which the institute had based many of its assumptions had been proved \u201cwrong time and again.\u201d The campaign also said that the institute was \u201cnot a neutral organization\u201d because it received European Research Council funding. \u201cIt would face an \u00a3800,000 deficit\u201d if Britain votes to leave, the group said in a statement.Douglas Carswell, a lawmaker who supports leaving the bloc, wrote on Twitter that the institute had a \u201cclose symbiotic relationship\u201d with George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, who is campaigning to remain in the European Union. John Redwood, who backs a withdrawal and is a former Conservative minister, told the BBC that the institute was part of the \u201ccozy establishment\u201d consensus determined to prevent a British exit.Responding to the claims, Paul Johnson, director of the institute, said that \u201cfor the last 30 years, the I.F.S. has really built its reputation on the independence and integrity of our work, and actually there is no sum of money from anywhere in the world which would influence what we said.\u201dAs the referendum campaign has progressed, those campaigning for a withdrawal have struggled to describe what kind of economic relationship they would want Britain to have with the European Union after a separation.Access to the bloc\u2019s single market of around 500 million people generally entails making some financial contribution and accepting the free movement of workers across national boundaries.That idea is anathema to many campaigners seeking to leave the bloc, who argue that Britain can only control immigration if it can prevent free movement of people.Those campaigners will hope to gain more traction on Thursday, when new statistics on migration are expected, highlighting an issue that has become increasingly central to their case.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Says Its Strikes Are Hitting More Significant ISIS Targets", "Date": "2016-05-25", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Nearly two years into the American-led air war against the Islamic State, military officials say they have corrected the poor intelligence collection and clumsy process for identifying targets that initially plagued the campaign, and are now hitting targets like oil rigs and secret cash coffers that finance the terrorist group\u2019s war machine.The destruction in recent months of these targets, deep behind enemy lines \u2014 which commanders previously avoided for fear of causing civilian casualties \u2014 has seriously damaged the Islamic State\u2019s ability to pay its fighters, govern and attract new recruits, military officials say.\u201cWe\u2019re hitting them where it hurts a lot more than we were in the past,\u201d Lt. Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., the air war commander, said in one of two recent telephone interviews from his headquarters in Qatar. \u201cEvery bomb now has a greater impact.\u201dTo speed up the approval of targets, the Pentagon shifted the authority for most strikes that posed a risk to civilians to commanders in the field from the military\u2019s Central Command in Tampa, Fla., which oversees operations in the Middle East.But critics say that the new process has increased the possibility of civilian casualties, a charge the military disputes.Since taking charge last June, General Brown, an F-16 pilot and former commandant of the Air Force\u2019s weapons school, has overhauled targeting practices, lobbied spy agencies in Washington for more help and insisted on higher-impact missions. A bomb that used to hit insignificant targets, like isolated Islamic State checkpoints or empty trenches, could now destroy millions of dollars in cash or shut down oil wells.General Brown and other officials acknowledged the scope of the problems in the operation\u2019s first year, which was also hampered by inexperienced planners, staffing shortages and internal rivalries. Those disclosures, filling in more details than were previously known, help explain why it took the Pentagon so long to focus on revenue-related targets like the oil fields and cash warehouses.The Pentagon estimates that the coalition\u2019s land and air operations have reclaimed 45 percent of the territory the Islamic State seized in Iraq in 2014, and 20 percent in Syria. The group\u2019s oil production has fallen about 30 percent (over 400 oil tanker trucks have been destroyed), with revenue from oil sales down as much as 50 percent, the Pentagon says.The Islamic State has slashed fighters\u2019 salaries in Raqqa, the group\u2019s de facto headquarters in Syria, by up to 50 percent, American intelligence analysts say.The biggest shift in the past year, however, has been in the remaining 10 percent of targets: mostly fixed sites behind the front lines that specialists are taking much more time to analyze. General Brown insisted on increasing the quality of these so-called deliberate targets, which include headquarters, barracks and storage facilities, to ensure that the strikes would have a deeper strategic effect on the Islamic State.In the past year, the United States has increased the number of spy planes and other surveillance aircraft over Iraq and Syria, as well as the number of targeting specialists assigned to the mission. Hundreds more Special Operations forces are now on the ground in the two countries, sending back valuable information, as are thousands of Iraqi troops and Syrian militia members whom the Americans and their allies are training and advising.\u201cWe do have a much better sense now for what this enemy looks like, how this enemy operates and how they\u2019re structured,\u201d said Col. Steve Warren, the military\u2019s chief spokesman in Baghdad.Airstrikes increased 22 percent the month after the targeting changes took effect in the fall, and they have generally remained at higher levels, damaging the Islamic State\u2019s military forces, its leadership, its financial network, its attractiveness to foreign fighters and its ability to move forces on the battlefield.\u201cISIL is suffering financially,\u201d Daniel L. Glaser, a top Treasury official, said this month. \u201cThat said, they still have a considerable amount of money.\u201dAfter more than a decade of focusing on support for ground troops fighting insurgents, the Air Force had to relearn the art of analyzing which fixed sites, if destroyed, would have the most significant effect on the enemy, General Brown said. They include the Islamic State\u2019s oil facilities, bulk cash stockpiles and factories for manufacturing roadside bombs.Scott F. Murray, a retired Air Force colonel and veteran of air campaigns in Iraq, Afghanistan and Kosovo, who oversaw deliberate target development from Shaw Air Force Base in South Carolina, said his team had prepared many valid financial and oil-related targets in early 2015. But senior commanders refused to approve them, fearing civilian casualties.That reluctance disappeared under General Brown, who is scheduled to brief reporters in Washington on Thursday about the air campaign\u2019s progress.Using a combination of satellite imagery, electronic intercepts and informers\u2019 tips, analysts have tracked Islamic State operatives storing huge amounts of cash in bank vaults, private residences and other hiding places. The coalition has conducted 21 strikes on cash storage and distribution sites since October, destroying what the Central Command said was hundreds of millions of dollars.Before, the targeting process was poorly synchronized and inefficient. Information was stored in various spreadsheets and distributed via secure communications. Now, the military is developing an online, interactive database, including digital maps, that anyone in the intelligence agencies can use to see what targets are being worked and who is working them.\u201cThe problem before was that everyone was running hard, but not necessarily in the same direction,\u201d Lt. Col. Jeff Sgarlata, deputy chief of the air command\u2019s intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance division, said in a telephone interview from Qatar. \u201cWe\u2019re now operating more efficiently and more effectively.\u201dBut the campaign has detractors, including the human rights groups concerned about civilian casualties, which the military says it takes great care to avoid.The Central Command has reviewed 25 allegations of civilian casualties in the bombing campaign that it deemed credible, and it acknowledged that airstrikes had killed 41 civilians and injured 28 others, according to a spokesman, Cmdr. Kyle Raines.Civilian groups put that figure much higher. Over 415 civilians have been killed in coalition airstrikes in Syria alone, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a group in Britain that tracks the conflict through a network of contacts in Syria.Other critics say the air campaign has not attacked the Islamic State aggressively enough.\u201cThe administration continues a misleading narrative regarding their level of effort against the Islamic State,\u201d said David A. Deptula, a retired three-star Air Force general who planned the American air campaigns in Afghanistan in 2001 and in the Persian Gulf in 1991.\u201cYes, they are accomplishing a symbolic level of effort,\u201d said General Deptula, who is now dean of the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies in Arlington, Va. \u201cHowever, that level of effort is anemic when considered relative to previous operations.\u201dThe United States has averaged about 14.5 strikes a day in Iraq and Syria since the air campaign started in August 2014, though that figure has gradually risen (there were about 17 American strikes a day in April). The United States conducts about 75 percent of all strikes. About two-thirds are in Iraq and one-third in Syria, reflecting the priority of protecting Iraqi troops in combat.In contrast, the NATO air war in Libya in 2011 involved about 50 strikes a day in its first two months. The 2001 campaign in Afghanistan averaged 85 daily strikes, and the campaign in Iraq in 2003 averaged about 800, according to the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments.American military officials said that because targeting was more precise now than in past campaigns and more care was given to assessing the quality of each target, fewer flights were needed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Van Gogh Museum Wants to Share Its Expertise, for a Price", "Date": "2016-05-04", "News": "Supported byMuseums around the world have long sought creative ways to bring in money outside of ticket sales, but the Van Gogh\u2019s program, announced last month, is unusual in that its target group includes private clients, experts in museum finance and administration said.Under the program, museum employees will provide advice and support in areas such as collection conservation and preservation, installation of climate control systems, museum management, and the development of educational programs.A museum with a public mission that is working on behalf of private clients could raise questions about curatorial independence, some experts said. Ms. Desmarais said that ethical concerns might arise if, for example, the Van Gogh Museum was offering collectors advice about acquiring artworks from the auction market, because the perception could arise that the museum might eventually want to acquire the work for itself or receive it as a donation.The Van Gogh Museum said that so far it had no plans to do so.Adriaan D\u00f6nszelmann, the managing director of the Van Gogh Museum, who initiated the program, said he did not think ethical issues would be a problem, but he did acknowledge that there could be time-management issues for staff members.\u201cWe\u2019ve made sure that it\u2019s O.K. for our current staff to spend 5 to 10 percent of their time on professional services, for people who want to be part of this adventure,\u201d Mr. D\u00f6nszelmann said. If the program is successful, he added, the museum might hire additional specialists to serve clients.Mr. D\u00f6nszelmann said he expected the venture, which was announced on April 7, to generate up to 5 percent of the museum\u2019s annual operating budget, currently \u20ac45 million. He said there were no contracted clients as of Monday, but that the museum was in negotiations with several interested parties.Compared with other Dutch museums, the Van Gogh receives a relatively small proportion of its income in the form of subsidies, slightly less than 20 percent, or \u20ac7 million a year. Though the museum has lost a small amount of state funding, a 2012 tax on profits from commercial enterprises like gift shops has cost the museum \u20ac500,000 annually, officials said.\u201cWe are quite dependent upon people visiting the museum, and 85 percent of those visitors come from other countries,\u201d Mr. D\u00f6nszelmann said. \u201cIn this time of potential terrorism and natural disasters, this flow of tourism to Amsterdam is vulnerable.\u201dHe declined to discuss fees except to say that they would be arranged on a sliding scale, with museums or other public institutions paying lower rates than corporate clients. He also said that services could be provided in exchange for museum sponsorship.In a telephone interview, Mr. Stein said the Van Gogh Museum was known for its expertise in business development, among other areas.\u201cThe hesitancy or concern is that those kinds of efforts could detract from the overall mission of the organization,\u201d he cautioned. But he added that a program like the one the Van Gogh has started could expand networks of donors and sponsors aside from any immediate financial benefits.The Van Gogh Museum started a pilot project two years ago to test the viability of the program, Mr. D\u00f6nszelmann said. It found a number of clients through a partnership with Deloitte Luxembourg, the financial management consultancy,which remains involved in the new program.For example, Van Gogh Museum managers offered professional advice to Arcis, a fine art storage and collection care company in Manhattan that is planning to open in 2017, on security, climate control and operational systems.Dos Elshout, a doctoral student in cultural studies at the University of Amsterdam who recently completed a thesis on new business-minded approaches at Dutch museums, said this was part of a trend in European museums to look at new sources of revenue as government subsidies for arts institutions have been reduced or have become less predictable.\u201cMuseums exchange services, knowledge, tips and so on all the time, and of course it was always in a collegial way,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, because of the financial cuts of a few years ago, they have to ask money for services.\u201dIn the United States, the Guggenheim Museum has long been a pioneer in revenue-generating activities, using income from satellite museums in Bilbao, Spain, and Abu Dhabi to supplement traditional fund-raising.Mr. Stein of the American Alliance of Museums said many institutions were engaged in what he called \u201centrepreneurial revenue diversification,\u201d including staging traveling exhibitions, developing software and opening satellite stores.\u201cThis is a little bit of where cultural organizations are going,\u201d he said. \u201cMost museums had been in the philanthropy-and-ticket business for a long time and are recognizing that some balance of that with earned revenue sources is a healthy position to be in.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Missing a major payment on such debt would not only set off a wave of creditor lawsuits, but it could also cast a shadow over America\u2019s $3.7 trillion municipal bond market, for decades an essential source of financing for public works.\u201cThis was a painful decision,\u201d the governor said in a televised speech on Sunday, in which he struck a nationalistic tone and said he had to invoke his emergency powers under Puerto Rican law because help from Washington was not forthcoming.\u201cWe would have preferred to have had a legal framework to restructure our debts in an orderly manner,\u201d he said.Federal law bars Puerto Rico from restructuring under Chapter 9, the part of the bankruptcy code that insolvent cities and other local governments can use. Lawmakers in the House of Representatives, under the direction of Speaker Paul D. Ryan, have been trying to draft a special law to give Puerto Rico legal powers to abrogate debt, something normally available only in bankruptcy.But the bill is contentious and important provisions are still being negotiated.The governor said the process was too slow. In his speech he blamed unnamed \u201copponents of the people of Puerto Rico,\u201d who, he said, \u201chave unleashed a brutal campaign of racial discrimination and lies against us,\u201d convincing some members of Congress that Puerto Rico needed austerity rather than debt relief.\u201cPuerto Rico needs Speaker Paul Ryan to exercise his leadership and honor his word,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait longer. We need this restructuring mechanism now.\u201dThe governor also expressed skepticism about a core principle of the rescue legislation: that to get extraordinary powers to reduce debt, Puerto Rico must first come under federal oversight. Mr. Garc\u00eda Padilla said he would welcome oversight that assisted the island\u2019s elected government, but would strongly oppose any federal oversight board that could overrule the government on matters like taxation, or on which creditors ought to be paid first.\u201cIt could become a public embarrassment for the United States to admit, before the international community, that while it fights for democracy in foreign lands, it denies democracy it in its own backyard,\u201d he warned.The $422 million payment due on Monday was owed by the island\u2019s powerful Government Development Bank, which for decades has raised money for various branches of government and performed other critical tasks. Its creditors include many local credit unions on the island, which late last week agreed in effect to roll their debt forward for another year.But other creditors appeared late Sunday to be holding out for cash. Until the moratorium was invoked the Government Development Bank had until the close of business Monday to pay, because the due date, May 1, fell on a Sunday.Early in April, a group of hedge funds sued the bank, arguing that it was insolvent and was using its scarce resources to \u201cprop up\u201d other parts of the government. The hedge funds asked the federal court in San Juan to freeze the bank\u2019s assets, other than those paid out to support the basic safety and well-being of the island\u2019s residents.A few days later, Puerto Rico\u2019s legislature gave the governor the power to do much the same thing: to halt debt payments, to save cash for essential public services.\u201cWhat we will never do is put the lives and safety of our people in danger,\u201d said Mr. Garc\u00eda Padilla in his televised speech. \u201cThey are, and will continue to be, our priority.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It\u2019s not that I dislike what\u2019s offered. Given the choice of breakfast food or lunch food, I\u2019d almost always choose eggs or waffles. It\u2019s just that I\u2019m not hungry at 7:30 a.m., when I leave for work.In fact, I\u2019m rarely hungry until about lunchtime. So, other than a morning cup of coffee, I don\u2019t eat much before noon. This habit has forced me to be subjected to more lectures on how I\u2019m hurting myself, my diet, my work and my health than almost any other. Only a fool would skip the most important meal of the day, right?As with many other nutritional pieces of advice, our belief in the power of breakfast is based on misinterpreted research and biased studies.However, they also found major flaws in the reporting of findings. People were consistently biased in interpreting their results in favor of a relationship between skipping breakfast and obesity. They improperly used causal language to describe their results. They misleadingly cited others\u2019 results. And they also improperly used causal language in citing others\u2019 results. People believe, and want you to believe, that skipping breakfast is bad.It\u2019s not hard to imagine that children who are hungry will do better if they are nourished. This isn\u2019t the same, though, as testing whether children who are already well nourished and don\u2019t want breakfast should be forced to eat it.The bottom line is that the evidence for the importance of breakfast is something of a mess. If you\u2019re hungry, eat it. But don\u2019t feel bad if you\u2019d rather skip it, and don\u2019t listen to those who lecture you. Breakfast has no mystical powers.An earlier version of this article misstated the result of a study by the Quaker Oats Center of Excellence. It showed that a no-breakfast group had higher cholesterol levels, not that those eating oatmeal or frosted cornflakes had lower cholesterol levels or lower weight.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Albany to Prison: Ex-Lawmakers on Life Behind Bars", "Date": "2016-04-30", "News": "Supported byDown the hall came Inmate No. 78764-053, a fist of a man diminished by the loss of the $2,500 suit and the $800 shoes he had just been forced to exchange for a jumpsuit, following a guard to his cell.First night in federal prison, and he was already headed to solitary confinement, his case too notorious for him to mingle safely with the others. He remembers the cell being clammy and dark. It made him think of Rikers Island, where his father had been held after being arrested when Pedro was 11. But this was a few grades higher: the Metropolitan Detention Center, in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, a windowless cage looming over New York Bay.From the next cell came a voice, pricking him out of his numbness:\u201cHey, Espada! Hang in there. You\u2019re the senator, right?\u201d the voice said. \u201cMy mother voted for you.\u201dThere are a lot of \u201csenators\u201d in America\u2019s federal prisons these days. In May, three more corrupt New York State lawmakers are expected to join the jumpsuited ranks, three more cautionary tales from a State Legislature with no apparent shortage of them.Like many of those convicted before them, Mr. Silver, Mr. Skelos and Mr. Sampson have asked for minimal or no prison time. Prosecutors, sentencing guidelines and recent history suggest they should not expect any leniency.If interviews with four former lawmakers \u2014 two currently incarcerated and two who have been released \u2014 are a guide, the three men are in for a prolonged humbling. Their former colleagues tell of spiritual awakenings, physical survival and mental toughening. But what figures largest in these personal narratives \u2014 what they say has sustained them throughout \u2014 is the belief that they were wrongly prosecuted.Contrition? What for?Outside, their names are synonymous with scandal. Inside, they command a measure of respect.With the expected arrivals of Mr. Skelos, Mr. Silver and Mr. Sampson, there will be at least nine former members of the New York State Legislature in the federal prison system. Nine more were released over the last few years. One, facing terminal cancer, is under house arrest. Another died in prison.Then came the kiss-off, bile tempered with a laugh.\u201cYou can tell all the other crooks I say hey!\u201dMr. Espada prefers a new honorific: prison abolitionist.He had seen, he said, how prison devastates lives and families instead of rehabilitating inmates. He had seen prisoners released, only to return within months, unable to cope in a society that no longer wanted much to do with them.In the years since, there have been 16 months of no daylight and no fresh air, and before that nearly a year of not seeing his family. And before that, a 10-week stint in solitary confinement after he stepped over the property line at the Federal Correctional Institution in Schuylkill, Pa., one of three prisons where he has spent the past three years. All in all, a thorough humiliation.\u201cI know that I was too consumed with the search for personal power,\u201d he said. \u201cI know that I was too consumed with materialistic things.\u201d He gestured at his khaki jumpsuit, his shiny white sneakers. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t miss any of that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m used to living on $300 a month.\u201d\u201cThis is our new existence,\u201d Mr. Espada said. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking about how to fit in.\u201dAt Fort Dix, his third stop, he said he learned how the other inmates made prison hooch out of sugar and candy distilled in the bathroom, each six-ounce bottle going for $40, and where they bought cellphones and drugs. Once back at the detention center in Brooklyn, he learned to get his protein from canned tuna, eggs and peanut butter bought at the commissary, and to relish microwave meals of commissary mackerel, chicken, pork sausage and rice. Once a professional brawler, he learned to avoid confrontation. (There have been a few close calls, even so.)He learned to sleep through the noise of 100 other men snoring and going to the bathroom and working out and watching television, so he can wake up at 4:30 a.m. to lift weights. To survive solitary confinement by running in place until he was exhausted. To love God, about whom he had not thought all that much for many years. To keep busy with Bible study and a biweekly book club. To cherish every visit with his wife, who has visited him each weekend, even though touching is restricted and they have had to sit side by side, knees facing forward, rationing their two kisses and hugs.He learned about small satisfactions, like when eight of the students in the G.E.D. class he teaches every afternoon recently passed their test. They call him \u201cProfessor.\u201dProfessor Espada takes pride in teaching nearly illiterate men to read, in counseling younger inmates, and in helping others work through their cases in the library.Senator Espada sits here unchastened, boasting of the \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d he once led \u2014 same as Bernie Sanders, he said. Senator Espada is the one planning to tear down a bad system from the inside out. The one insisting he was framed.If they have one thing in common, these Albany alumni, it is this: They refuse to be expunged from the rolls of the innocent.It is a recurring theme.\u201cI don\u2019t have that thing where I\u2019m a criminal, so I\u2019m smiling,\u201d said Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez, who spent much of a four-hour interview at his Bronx apartment outlining, in baroque detail, all the ways he said he had been railroaded by prosecutors, the judge and even his own lawyer. (Before he left prison, he said, his fellow inmates told him, \u201cYou\u2019re safer here with the homies. The billionaires will put out a contract on you. They don\u2019t like you, \u2019cause you tell it like it is.\u201d)\u201cI did not steal money from Soundview or from anybody,\u201d said Mr. Espada, referring to the health care network he ran. He had not received a fair trial, he said; he would have continued to contest the charges had he not run out of resources and the will to subject his family to what he described as further pain.\u201cMaybe I didn\u2019t spend the money right, but I didn\u2019t steal the money,\u201d said Ms. Huntley, who suggested that she had been the victim of a conspiracy orchestrated by old enemies in Albany. Besides, she added, as if this would mitigate things, the actions in question had occurred before she entered the Senate.In a more reflective moment, Ms. Huntley said she could not bring herself to move on.\u201cSome people say, let it go,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to let stuff go. I don\u2019t want to die being known as, what\u2019s the word all the newspapers used? \u2018Disgraced senator.\u2019\u201dShe said she wanted to be treated \u201cjust as a person. Just use my name. I\u2019m not saying you\u2019ve got to make me sound like I\u2019m great. You all call me disgraced, but in my mind, I\u2019m not disgraced.\u201d\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say they were crooks. Everybody does all that,\u201d Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez said of Mr. Skelos and Mr. Silver. \u201cIt\u2019s, \u2018I help you, you help me.\u2019 So what is that? Politics.\u201dHe smiled.\u201cI can\u2019t endorse anything now,\u201d he said.A day begins at Federal Correctional Institution in Loretto. A former monastery on a hilltop, it would resemble a high school campus were it not for the rings of concertina wire that surround it.Mr. Boyland is awake at 6:30 to meditate before going to work on the facilities team. (Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez, too, was initially assigned a job assisting a plumber, but, by his own account, was deemed more of a burden than a help.) Mr. Boyland runs around the track. He lifts weights. Without the constant nag of his cellphone, without the late, indulgent Albany dinners, he is, he said, the healthiest and most focused he has ever been.To other inmates, he introduces himself as Will. But he lives with men from New York, even some familiar with his old district. There is a Boyland Street in Brownsville, named for his uncle, who once held the same Assembly seat.\u201cYou the same guy?\u201d the inmates ask.Amid the chaos of this year\u2019s presidential campaign, Mr. Boyland said, he is in demand as a political analyst. \u201cAll. The. Time,\u201d he said, flashing a smile.He passes the rest of the day with religious services, Bible study, work on his legal appeal and reading. He is taking classes in Spanish (because of the Spanish-speaking constituents in his old district), small-business skills (just in case) and crocheting (hats, mostly).He has almost finished James Redfield\u2019s \u201cThe Celestine Prophecy,\u201d which he described as a science-fiction novel about the spiritual journey of a wrongly imprisoned man. He said he could relate.From afar, he tries to raise his 13-year-old son, who is back in Brooklyn. He was the hardest thing to leave behind.Albany, he does not miss. It was serving his constituents, he said, that he loved.\u201cI wasn\u2019t used to being on this side of the table,\u201d he said, indicating the round visitors\u2019 room table where he sat across from a reporter. \u201cI was the one visiting to bring help. I\u2019m usually on that side of the table.\u201dThey watch the evening news and read the New York City papers, eavesdropping on a world that has tried to delete them from its memory.Even so, what lies beyond the prison walls has begun to seem abstract \u2014 fuzzy around the edges.When Mr. Espada was in solitary confinement at Schuylkill, he was allowed one hour a day to go outside, shackled and cuffed. He always went, no matter the weather.\u201cAn opportunity to experience daylight, sunlight, rain hitting your head \u2014 it\u2019s as basic as that,\u201d he said, his voice softening. \u201cI said to myself, I would never complain about the elements again, because I loved it when the rain hit my head, when it was cold.\u201dThen the man who was once the third-most powerful in New York State gathered himself, pivoting back to the pitch. He was the better for surviving this, he said. Not that it was about him; it was about those far less fortunate than him, who would carry this scarlet letter the rest of their lives. He had promised them he would fight for them, for reform, and he would.He would never give up. There was a reason they still called him the Senator.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Kansas Parents Worry Schools Are Slipping Amid Budget Battles", "Date": "2016-05-31", "News": "Supported byPRAIRIE VILLAGE, Kan. \u2014 Dinah Sykes, a parent of two boys in a suburb of Kansas City, started noticing changes to her children\u2019s public schools a few years ago. Class sizes were growing. The school library had stopped buying books.So she used her position as the president of the parent-teacher association to start a new tradition: Instead of bringing cupcakes to class for their birthdays, students were asked to bring a book to donate to the school library.Ms. Sykes is a Republican who once voted for the governor from her party, Sam Brownback. But now, she said, she is so concerned that public schools are endangered by the state\u2019s budget crisis that she is running for a seat in the State Senate, challenging the incumbent senator in the Republican primary in August.\u201cWe\u2019re getting a bad reputation: that our state doesn\u2019t care about public education,\u201d Ms. Sykes said. \u201cWe live in Kansas because of the great quality of life, the great schools, the great amenities. I want my boys to have the opportunity to have the same.\u201dThe struggle over school funding in Kansas reached a new crisis point when the State Supreme Court on Friday ruled that the Republican-dominated Legislature had not abided by its constitutional mandate to finance public schools equitably, especially poorer districts with less property wealth. The court, in an effort to force legislative action, reiterated a deadline that gave the state until June 30 to fix the problem or face a school shutdown.The ruling exacerbated tensions over budgets enacted by Mr. Brownback and the Legislature that education officials say have led school districts to eliminate programs, lay off staff members or even shorten the school week.Officials worry that the state\u2019s budget, which included cuts by Mr. Brownback to higher education and many state agencies, may not be able to absorb further reductions to find the level of additional funding the court is looking for \u2014 estimated at $40 million or more.Of even greater concern to many parents is a sense, they say, that the state leadership does not support the very concept of public education.As in other states, the effect of reduced funding varies from one district to another. In poorer districts like Kansas City and Wichita, students are crammed into deteriorating buildings with bloated class sizes. One district in southeast Kansas, facing a budget shortfall, recently pared its school week to four days.But even in wealthier districts, like the one here, parents are watching the tighter budgets \u2014 and the disappearing contingency funds \u2014 with alarm.The issue has increased pressure on Mr. Brownback, who had already come under fire for Kansas\u2019 budget woes and cuts to state programs after enacting the largest tax cuts in state history in 2012 and 2013.In 2015, facing large projected shortfalls, Mr. Brownback cut K-12 funding by 1.5 percent. He and the Legislature then changed the funding formula from a per-pupil distribution, which gave extra money to schools educating difficult-to-teach students, to a system of fixed block grants. But he kept a promise to protect schools from further cuts in the 2016 budget and reduced funds for many state agencies and higher education, including community colleges and technical schools.Mr. Brownback and his legislative allies say that the schools already have plenty of money and that districts could spend more prudently or dip deeper into their reserves.\u201cSince taking office, Governor Brownback has increased state funding to schools every year, investing more than $4 billion \u2014 approximately half of the state\u2019s budget \u2014 in K-12 funding,\u201d said Eileen Hawley, a spokeswoman for Mr. Brownback. \u201cAt the same time, he has returned more local control to those closest to the classroom \u2014 teachers and parents \u2014 so they have more direct control over how funds are spent to benefit students.\u201dDistrict officials say, however, that the funding has not kept pace with a rise in fixed costs. The Shawnee Mission School District, for instance, faces an increase of $1 million in a year for bus services. Other expenses, even for school supplies, have grown in many districts, frustrating officials who say they need more help from the state to cover costs.Under Mr. Brownback, who took office in 2011, state aid per pupil dropped to $3,800 from $4,400, according to the Kansas branch of the National Education Association. That reduction has come even as enrollment and the cost of health insurance have increased for many districts, said Mark Tallman of the Kansas Association of School Boards.\u201cSince the Great Recession, when you adjust for inflation, total school funding in Kansas has been basically flat,\u201d he said.What happens next is not clear. Schools in Kansas are generally finished for this academic year and Wednesday was set to be the Legislature\u2019s last day, though it could return for a special session. Conservative lawmakers have denounced activist judges and Mr. Brownback has accused the court of \u201cpolitical brinksmanship.\u201d But the governor had hinted that he might cut funding to Medicaid and higher education if the Supreme Court ordered the state to allocate more money for schools.The continuing turmoil has turned many previously content parents into activists demanding that Mr. Brownback reverse course on his large tax cuts in order to free up money for public schools.\u201cThe overall sentiment here is, \u2018We need different representation in Topeka that will stand up to the governor,\u2019\u201d said Cindy Neely, a registered Republican and guidance counselor who said her school district was \u201cconstantly\u201d looking for places to trim its budget. \u201cIt feels like, in Kansas, the last two to three years have just been constant stress and constant worry.\u201dLeEtta Felter, a Republican and a school board member in Olathe, a large suburb of Kansas City, said her district\u2019s budget was struggling to cover rising costs and expanding enrollment. The district has begun to tap into its reserves and has been told by elected officials not to expect any increase in funding next year, she said.\u201cThey\u2019re in an all-out panic,\u201d Ms. Felter said of lawmakers in Topeka. \u201cThey love to use the term \u2018buckets of money\u2019 that the districts are hoarding. Any responsible entity has a rainy-day fund, except for the State of Kansas.\u201dIn Kansas City, school officials say they have been shortchanged by tens of millions of dollars over the past five years because the Legislature has not taken into account their needs when financing poorer districts like theirs. Ninety percent of the students in the Kansas City school district qualify for free or reduced-price lunch, and 40 percent are nonnative English speakers.Cynthia Lane, the superintendent of schools in the Kansas City district, said preparations were underway in case schools are shut down, as the Supreme Court has threatened. Schools are usually busy during the summer months, with administrators and members of staff preparing for the upcoming academic year, she said. The first day of school is scheduled for Aug. 15.\u201cIf we can\u2019t pay bills, how do we keep our utilities on, how do we keep our security system on?\u201d she said. \u201cFolks are really frustrated and embarrassed that Kansas is the butt of jokes across the nation. He continues to say things are fine, when they are not fine.\u201dThe Wichita School Board voted on May 18 to eliminate more than 100 jobs and to close an alternative high school, as part of efforts to trim about $18 million from the district\u2019s budget.Some school principals say they are resigned to making do with what money they have. At Welborn Elementary School in Kansas City, classes are held in two aging buildings and students dash back and forth during the day. Teachers keep a watchful eye on them as they cross an active parking lot between the buildings.\u201cI don\u2019t need much,\u201d said Jennifer Malone, the principal, one recent afternoon. \u201cI just want a building.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "20 Years Later, Welfare Overhaul Resonates for Families and Candidates", "Date": "2016-05-01", "News": "Supported byRetro ReportIn a sense, this is a \u201cBack to the Future\u201d presidential campaign, with candidates revisiting a specific time in the past to explain \u2014 and often lament \u2014 where the country is today. That period is often the 1990s, during Bill Clinton\u2019s White House watch. It was when stricter anti-crime measures and looser financial regulations came into being, policies now attacked almost daily by contenders offering voters their visions and revisions.One \u201cBack to the Future\u201d issue from the \u201990s has received relatively scant attention, but the next president may have a hard time avoiding it, for it affects millions of Americans. It involves the welfare system, overhauled in 1996 by a Republican Congress and a Democratic president, Mr. Clinton, who had pledged to \u201cend welfare as we know it.\u201d He made good on that promise. Welfare as we knew it went away.In 1996, the political stars aligned to undo a welfare structure created in 1935 as part of the New Deal. Under that system, known in its final incarnation as Aid to Families With Dependent Children, government cash was an entitlement that the poor could claim, with no limits on the amount of available money or on how long payments would continue. But in the anti-welfare backlash that eventually developed, \u201centitlement\u201d became a dirty word, certainly among conservative Republicans but also among many centrist Democrats. Americans on welfare, hardly a powerful political force, found themselves routinely characterized as loafers and cheats.The 1996 law signed by President Clinton threw out that New Deal remnant and replaced it with Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF. The new program created work rules and time limits. Poor people could still receive government cash, but for no more than two consecutive years and for no more than a total of five years. Instead of receiving an unrestricted dollar flow from Washington, states were now given block grants, fixed sums totaling $16.5 billion a year. The states had plenty of leeway on how to spend the money. They could also tighten the five-year limit; some chose to let the clock run out on the poor after only a couple of years.For a while, the Jeremiahs seemed to be losing the argument. Welfare rolls shrank, and then shrank some more. Having once approached 14 million, the number of people benefiting from TANF\u2019s federal money and related state funds shriveled year by year, hovering around four million in 2015. In the first few years of TANF, hundreds of thousands of welfare mothers found jobs. Poverty rates declined. So did hunger among children. One year after signing the 1996 legislation, Mr. Clinton confidently told an audience that \u201cit\u2019s fair to say the debate is over \u2014 we now know that welfare reform works.\u201dBut did it?Things went swimmingly at first, principally because the American economy was humming in the late \u201990s. The long haul told a different story. An economic slump at the start of the 21st century cost many of those newly employed mothers their jobs. Times got much rougher in the severe recession of 2007 and 2008. The safety net that TANF was supposed to provide began to look highly porous.National poverty rates remain stubbornly high, staying in recent years at 15 percent. While initially effective in getting people off welfare, the system proved far less nimble at making them financially sound. Even when they found jobs, the wages tended to nudge them barely above the poverty line. And, all too often, they had a hard time staying employed when the economy soured. The poorest are usually ill prepared to flourish in a world where the technology and service industries are increasingly dominant.Those federal block grants did not bring salvation, either. For starters, the annual total, $16.5 billion, has remained frozen for 20 years, meaning they are worth one-third less than they were in 1996. States may use the money as they wish, even if it means straying far from the original intent. Instead of becoming cash subsidies to destitute families or underwriting job-training programs, the grants are commonly used to finance college scholarships or child care arrangements \u2014 or simply to plug holes in state budgets.For Arizona officials, the temptation to divert federal dollars to purposes other than welfare proved \u201cjust too great,\u201d said Jodi Liggett, a vice president of Planned Parenthood Arizona and a former senior policy adviser in the governor\u2019s office. \u201cThere is this big, fat bag of money with TANF written on the outside of it,\u201d Ms. Liggett told Retro Report.Clarence H. Carter, a former director of Arizona\u2019s Department of Economic Security, defended the diversion of funds. \u201cThey were used to support another important function of the safety net, and that\u2019s strengthening families,\u201d said Mr. Carter, who resigned last year amid controversy over how his agency had handled child abuse cases. \u201cSo the moneys were not hijacked.\u201dNationwide, the Census Bureau counts 46.7 million Americans as living in poverty, which for a family of three (typically a mother and two children) means annual earnings of less than $20,160. About 20 million people live in deep poverty, with earnings below $10,000 a year for a family of three. In 2014, the last year with full census figures, the poverty rate among children \u2014 people under 18 \u2014 was 21 percent.Plainly, government cash payments are not what they used to be. In 1996 they went to 68 percent of families with children that qualified as impoverished, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group in Washington. Now they go to 23 percent. In some states, the figure is minuscule: 8 percent in Arizona, 5 percent in Texas, 4 percent in Louisiana.Now some conservative lawmakers want to give control over food stamps to the states, just as was done with welfare. This time, they probably cannot count on an ally in Mr. Clinton, who acknowledges that ending welfare as we knew it was hardly synonymous with ending poverty as we knew it.\u201cIt did far more good than harm,\u201d Mr. Clinton said of the 1996 law in a speech two years ago. \u201cBut now, given the changed climate and the aftermath of the crash, the poorest welfare families, about 15 percent of the total, are worse off. And we should do something for them. And we ought to \u2014 all of us who supported it should \u2014 admit that.\u201dWhat that something might be is a \u201cBack to the Future\u201d issue for the next president and Congress to work out.For the latest national news, follow <a href=\u201dhttps://twitter.com/NYTNational\u201d>@nytnational </a> on Twitter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Universal Basic Income Is a Poor Tool to Fight Poverty", "Date": "2016-05-31", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneWhy doesn\u2019t the government just give everybody money?Figure out a reasonable amount \u2014 the official poverty line amounts to about $25,000 for a family of four; a full-time job at $15 an hour would provide about $30,000 a year \u2014 and hand every adult a monthly check. The minimum-wage worker stretching to make it to payday, the single mother balancing child care and a job \u2014 everybody would get the same thing.Poverty would be over, at a stroke.Being universal \u2014 that is, for the homeless and the masters of the universe alike \u2014 the program would be free of the cumbersome assessments required to determine eligibility. It would also escape the stigma typically attached to programs for the poor.In the United States, the idea has the support of thinkers on the left like Andrew Stern, former president of the Service Employees International Union. Some thinkers on the right, too, have managed to overcome their general distaste for government welfare to support the idea. This month, Charles Murray of the American Enterprise Institute will publish an updated version of his plan to replace welfare as we know it with a dollop of $10,000 in after-tax income for every American above the age of 21.Where would that money come from? It amounts to nearly all the tax revenue collected by the federal government. Nothing in the history of this country suggests Americans are ready to add that kind of burden to their current taxes. Cut it by half to $5,000? That wouldn\u2019t even clear the poverty line. And it would still cost as much as the entire federal budget except for Social Security, Medicare, defense and interest payments.As Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary and onetime top economic adviser to President Obama, told me, paying a $5,000 universal basic income to the 250 million nonpoor Americans would cost about $1.25 trillion a year. \u201cIt would be hard to finance that in a way that wouldn\u2019t burden the programs that help the poor,\u201d he said.The popularity of the universal basic income stems from a fanciful diagnosis born in Silicon Valley of the challenges faced by the working class across industrialized nations: one that sees declining employment rates and stagnant wages and concludes that robots are about to take over all the jobs in the world.That might lie in our future \u2014 I will devote my next column to discussion of such a universe. But it\u2019s certainly not our present. Men at their prime working ages, 25 to 54, have been falling out of the labor force since the 1960s. Still, today more than eight out of every 10 Americans in their prime are working.Work, as Lawrence Katz of Harvard once pointed out, is not just what people do for a living. It is a source of status. It organizes people\u2019s lives. It offers an opportunity for progress. None of this can be replaced by a check.A universal basic income has many undesirable features, starting with its non-negligible disincentive to work. Almost a quarter of American households make less than $25,000. It would be hardly surprising if a $10,000 check each for mom and dad sapped their desire to work.To libertarians this will sound more like a feature than a flaw, but replacing everything in the safety net with a check would limit the scope of government assistance in damaging ways. Say we know the choice of neighborhood makes a difference to the development of poor children. Housing vouchers might lead them to move into a better one. A monthly check would probably not.And those who think a universal benefit would be more politically resilient than a means-tested one might stop to ponder the unceasing chatter about trimming Social Security.It is undoubtedly true that the American safety net needs fixing. Fifty million Americans live in poverty. Sixteen million live on the equivalent of $8.60 a day. Providing more income security for the struggling working class would not only produce a more equitable society, it would also increase spending and improve economic growth.In this world, though, where work remains an important social, psychological and economic anchor, there are better tools to help than giving every American a monthly check.How about subsidized employment? The government could subsidize jobs as varied as school repairs and fixing potholes. \u201cThis would provide employment while doing things that improve productivity and improve people\u2019s lives,\u201d Mr. Greenstein said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Pick for Fund-Raiser Is Rife With Contradictions", "Date": "2016-05-09", "News": "Supported byDealBookWall Street has been agog since last Thursday, when Donald Trump announced that Steven Mnuchin \u2014 who made his fortune at Goldman Sachs, worked for a firm funded by George Soros, and donated to Hillary Clinton \u2014 would be responsible for helping him raise $1 billion for Republicans and his own campaign.For if Mr. Trump is an unconventional political candidate, his appointment of Mr. Mnuchin as his national finance chairman is the epitome of just how unconventional this election has become. Despite what Mr. Mnuchin said was a personal friendship of 15 years, Mr. Trump has attacked both Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s investment company \u2014 suing it in 2008 over a building deal \u2014 as well as Goldman Sachs, the Democratic Party and other institutions Mr. Mnuchin has supported.In a telephone interview Monday, Mr. Mnuchin emphasized the friendship part of the equation. \u201cI was there at the beginning when he decided to run for president, and I\u2019ve been a supporter and quiet adviser behind the scenes to him,\u201d he explained. The day after Mr. Trump won the New York primary, Mr. Trump called Mr. Mnuchin and offered him the job. \u201cI told him on the spot I would,\u201d he said.Mr. Mnuchin was the chairman of OneWest and sold it to CIT Group in 2015. Along the way, OneWest was involved in a string of lawsuits over questionable foreclosures, and settled several cases for millions of dollars.Meanwhile, Mr. Mnuchin made his name in Hollywood: He teamed up with Brett Ratner, the producer and director, and James Packer, the financier \u2014 together, better known as the \u201cRatPac\u201d \u2014 to produce movies like \u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d and \u201cMad Max: Fury Road.\u201d He briefly was co-chairman of the movie company Relativity Media, but \u2014 happily for him \u2014 he left before it went bankrupt.Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s new job with Mr. Trump is filled with seeming contradictions. Mr. Trump spent much of his campaign attacking Goldman Sachs, using the bank to malign Ted Cruz\u2019s wife, Heidi, who is an investment manager there, and Mrs. Clinton, who famously received rich honorariums for giving speeches there. \u201cI know the guys at Goldman Sachs,\u201d Mr. Trump said during one debate, poking at Mr. Cruz. \u201cThey have total, total control over him. Just like they have total control over Hillary Clinton,\u201d he declared.Mr. Mnuchin supported Mr. Romney in 2012; Mr. Romney has denounced Mr. Trump.Both Mr. Mnuchin and his new boss have backed Mrs. Clinton\u2019s Democratic political aspirations in the past, though both now swear fealty to the other team.\u201cI\u2019m not a traditional fund-raiser \u2014 I think that was part of the appeal I had for Donald,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin told me on Monday. \u201cI have given to Democrats in the past. I\u2019ve always believed in supporting the best candidate at the time.\u201dWhat about Mr. Trump\u2019s broadsides against his former employer? Mr. Mnuchin emphasized that it was \u201cquite a while ago\u201d that he worked for Goldman, working there for 17 years but leaving in 2002. More recently, he said, \u201cI\u2019ve been focused on the West Coast economy and being a banker and lending in these markets.\u201dNo doubt his connections will work to the benefit of the Republican Party, even during an election cycle when all the remaining candidates seem to be trying to sling mud at so-called fat cats. Not so Mr. Mnuchin.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t in any way say I distanced myself from Wall Street,\u201d he said. \u201cI have very good friends on Wall Street.\u201dThe job could be considered high-risk for someone who hasn\u2019t lived in the glare of the public eye \u2014 and for someone backing as controversial a figure as Mr. Trump. With the exception of a handful of financiers like Carl Icahn, few big names on Wall Street have yet endorsed Mr. Trump.Indeed, many of the nation\u2019s largest banks \u2014 including Goldman Sachs \u2014 haven\u2019t done business with Mr. Trump in years. Among the lenders on Mr. Trump\u2019s disclosure form, only Merrill Lynch, among the country\u2019s largest lenders, is listed for a loan made in 1993 and 1994. Since then, smaller banks or foreign institutions like UBS and Deutsche Bank are listed as his biggest lenders. According to former Goldman Sachs executives, the firm doesn\u2019t solicit business from Mr. Trump and has declined at least one project; a spokesman for the firm declined to comment.Mr. Mnuchin said, \u201cI don\u2019t think it is true\u201d that Goldman refuses to work with Mr. Trump. He added: \u201cThere is a long, long list of some of the largest banks in the country that have done business with him. He has had no problem finding people who want to lend to his businesses.\u201dOne of the lenders that have extended credit to Mr. Trump is Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s Dune Capital. Dune was among a syndicate of lenders led by Deutsche Bank for the construction of his Trump International Hotel & Tower, a 92-story skyscraper in Chicago. Mr. Trump sued the lenders, including Dune, in 2008 to extend the terms of the loan on the basis of \u201cunprecedented financial crisis in the credit markets.\u201d The suit was later settled.Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s firm was also involved in investing in Trump Waikiki in Hawaii. \u201cI haven\u2019t really commented on what business we\u2019ve done together,\u201d he said. \u201cI would describe it as more of a personal relationship than a professional relationship.\u201dDespite Mr. Trump\u2019s changing rhetoric, Mr. Mnuchin is bullish: \u201cEven on Wall Street, notwithstanding certain comments he\u2019s made and things like that, I\u2019ve gotten hundreds of calls from people who want to support him.\u201dBecause of an editing error, the DealBook column on Tuesday, about the background of Steven Mnuchin, Donald J. Trump\u2019s national finance chairman, misstated the ownership of the bankrupt movie company Relativity Media. Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s movie company, Dune Entertainment, and RatPac Entertainment, the company of James Packer and Brett Ratner, were investors in Warner Bros. movies, and Mr. Mnuchin was briefly co-chairman of Relativity. Neither Mr. Ratner, Mr. Packer nor RatPac had any relationship with Relativity.Advertisement"}

The government said the move would extend presidential powers, though it was vague on specifics.For months, Venezuela has been convulsed by an economic crisis caused by low oil prices, a lack of savings and a drought. Lines for food have become ubiquitous, as have water shortages and blackouts. The government is working just two days a week in an effort to save electricity.The United States fears that Venezuela could face a major eruption of street violence in the coming months, according to senior American intelligence officials who spoke on condition of anonymity in discussing the government\u2019s latest intelligence assessment.While Mr. Maduro has so far held off a recall vote against him, the American officials said that they believed his grip on power was weakening by the day, and that he could be removed from power, either in a palace coup by members of his party or by the Venezuelan military.While the military\u2019s high command appears unlikely to act against the government right now, these officials said, its midlevel officers are more restive. One American official said intelligence officials were worried about some kind of change, but were not aware of any active plots.Venezuela is facing a default on its debt in the fourth quarter of this year. The government is trying to keep financing its loans to avoid having creditors seize its foreign assets. But that, as well as the steeply falling price of oil \u2014 the country\u2019s largest export \u2014 has caused imports to plummet, leading to shortages of food and medicine.The officials acknowledged that the United States had limited influence in Venezuela, where the government has blamed American meddling for the instability.Follow Nicholas Casey on Twitter @caseysjournal.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "An Ayn Rand Acolyte Selling Students a Self-Made Dream", "Date": "2016-05-07", "News": "Supported byPARK CITY, Utah \u2014 \u201cI want to be first on Success,\u201d said Carl Barney, standing up from the breakfast table after a final sip of tea at Deer Valley, a luxury resort with a view of Utah\u2019s mountainous rooftop.Mr. Barney, who had arrived in the dining room wearing his custom-made orange ski boots, was referring to the trail named Success, with its early-morning blanket of freshly groomed, untouched snow.He could just as easily have been referring to himself.\u201cShe taught me how to live,\u201d Mr. Barney said.He credits Rand\u2019s brand of antigovernment libertarianism, hard-nosed rationality and unapologetic self-interest with helping him realize his own American dream \u2014 an achievement he sells to the students at his schools. But his inspiring story is not without contradictions.Mr. Barney, who opposes government-backed loans and grants on principle, has made his fortune in a business that is almost wholly dependent on them. His students borrow heavily to pay for their studies in hope of replicating Mr. Barney\u2019s up-by-the-bootstraps success, but often find themselves dropping out and burdened with loans. And while he invokes a rigorous Rand-inspired ethical code of fair dealing, he is in an industry with a history pockmarked by fraud and abuse.Mr. Barney sees it differently. He is proud of the role of for-profit education in catering to students often ignored or left behind by traditional colleges and universities. A few rogue employees and school operators, he says, have been used as a cudgel by critics ideologically opposed to the education business.\u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s some bad guys out there,\u201d he said, after returning from a morning of skiing. \u201cBut a lot of them? No.\u201dIn his view, there has been a \u201cdeliberately designed campaign to cripple, crush and close these schools,\u201d spearheaded by people who \u201creally think profit-making is wrong.\u201dFederal efforts to prevent abuses through increased monitoring and regulation, Mr. Barney argues, are only burdening schools with onerous requirements that further increase student costs.Mr. Barney\u2019s business and beliefs place him at the center of a pressing national debate. More than ever, a college degree has become a ticket to the middle class. But there is a divide over how to best help students with the fewest skills and resources.The clash is not just over policy options, but ideas. Ayn Rand, who died in 1982, has long been a flash point for conflicting concepts of America and its promise.Versions of this debate are playing out on the presidential campaign trail \u2014 in clashes over income inequality, government regulation and college affordability.In Mr. Barney\u2019s view, both parties are leading the country in the wrong direction. \u201cPolitics is not going to solve the problem,\u201d he said, settling into the third-floor lounge of his Alpine-styled boutique hotel.If rationality, hard work and self-interest are fundamental Randian values, so is the pursuit of happiness. And that is what led Mr. Barney to rise early that day \u2014 only to have to wait at the front of the ski lift line. Standing there, he mentions to the lift operator his intent to be first down the run.\u201cYou look like you\u2019re first in a lot of things,\u201d the lift operator replies.Soon enough, Mr. Barney is gliding down the mountain, listening on his earbuds to a favorite Broadway tune, \u201cOne Day More,\u201d from \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables,\u201d with its call to the masses to man the barricades.\u201cThe greatest tragedy in all schools today is the \u2018D.D.D.\u2019\u201d \u2014 a dropout who is in debt and doesn\u2019t get a degree, Mr. Barney said over an artistically arranged dessert plate. The term is one of the many expressions that his staff refers to as \u201cCarl Barneyisms,\u201d the abbreviations, aphorisms, quotations and guidelines that pepper the boss\u2019s daily conversation and fill employee binders.For years, Mr. Barney worked six-and-a-half-day weeks sending notes to colleagues and friends at all hours about newly discovered enthusiasms \u2014 videos, books, middle-of-the-night brainstorms or even gadgets, like the MagicJack, the as-seen-on-TV device to connect a phone to a computer for inexpensive calls.\u201cIf he finds something that he really likes, he\u2019ll send it to 10 of his friends,\u201d said John Allison, the former chief of the bank BB&T and a longtime friend who once received a Keurig coffee maker from him.Many of his work ideas are cataloged in \u201cP.D.s\u201d (procedure directives), \u201cD.L.s\u201d (data letters), \u201cI.L.s,\u201d (information letters) and \u201cM.M.s\u201d (management memos). \u201cM.M. 302,\u201d for example, is titled \u201cStudent Satisfaction and Success \u2014 S.S.S.\u201d and offers the antidote to what he calls the \u201cdreaded D.D.D.\u201d\u201cIf something worked, we then systematized it,\u201d Mr. Barney said.\u201cP.D. 154 R\u201d lays out a two-year training program for employees who want to advance to associate directors. Among other things, they will be expected to read Rand\u2019s manifesto, the 1,200-page novel \u201cAtlas Shrugged,\u201d which depicts a rotted-out America where creative geniuses stage a nationwide strike against corrupt \u201cmoochers and looters.\u201dRand made her way to the United States after escaping the Soviet Union\u2019s terrors in the 1920s, an experience that left her with a deep-rooted distrust of government. She extolled laissez-faire capitalism, ruthless ambition and individualism in her novels, including \u201cThe Fountainhead,\u201d and a philosophy known as objectivism.Mr. Barney discovered Rand in midlife. He grew up with five siblings in postwar London.His father was a serial entrepreneur, opening a nightclub, a motel and a gas station. \u201cHe was good at creating things. He wasn\u2019t good at carrying through,\u201d Mr. Barney said.Rationing of food, gas and clothing made deprivation a fact of daily life. The abundance portrayed in American movies offered an alluring contrast.As a teenager, he traveled to Australia, where he sold encyclopedias door to door and picked grapes (\u201cI was good at it\u201d). He toured India, and later ended up in California \u2014 dabbling briefly, he admits with some embarrassment, in Scientology \u2014 seeking meaning here and there while engaging in the great American tradition of self-improvement.By the 1970s, he participated in another American tradition: making money in real estate. Then a minor business transaction came along that became a seminal moment. After legally terminating a lease, he offered some extra compensation for the inconvenience.The leaseholder was offended and said, \u201cI don\u2019t want anything that isn\u2019t earned or deserved,\u201d Mr. Barney recalls. She was describing Rand\u2019s \u201ctrader principle,\u201d which holds that two people engaging in a trade shouldn\u2019t take any more, or less, from each other than is deserved.Mr. Barney was bewildered.Her explanation? \u201cYou need to read \u2018Atlas Shrugged.\u2019\u201dHe began teaching himself about Rand and objectivism. Attending her final public appearance in 1981 in New Orleans, he heard speaker after speaker declare, \u201cShe changed my life.\u201dIt was testimony Mr. Barney would ultimately echo. \u201cThis is what Rand taught me \u2014 identify that values that are important to you and practice the virtues to achieve that,\u201d he said. It infused him with \u201ca central purpose.\u201dThat led him to pursue a business in education. So when a friend told him about the existence of for-profit colleges, he was struck. \u201cWow,\u201d he said he thought, \u201cyou could actually buy a college? That\u2019s what I want to do.\u201dIn time, he ended up buying and establishing several colleges including CollegeAmerica, Stevens-Henager and California College. He developed an online division, Independence University.The money came from Mr. Barney himself in the form of loans and tax-deductible donations. Today, the colleges are no longer considered for-profit entities, and the center supports programs at brand-name universities like Tufts, Clemson and Duke.Mr. Barney has stepped back from day-to-day oversight, but nothing changed in the way the colleges are operated. \u201cWe woke up the next day with the exact same management team,\u201d said Eric Juhlin, who continued as chief executive.Todd Zywicki, executive director of George Mason Law and Economics Center and a longtime trustee at the Center for Excellence in Higher Education, called the notion \u201cinsulting,\u201d saying \u201cit totally misrepresents what we were doing.\u201dMr. Barney similarly dismisses the accusations: \u201cI could be a billionaire today if I hadn\u2019t converted to nonprofit.\u201dThe Salt Lake City branch of Stevens-Henager College occupies a modern, four-story building off Highway 15, about a 45-minute drive from Deer Valley. At night it bustles with students arriving for class after clocking out of their day jobs.All are looking to better their lives, saying they\u2019re spending from about $30,000 for an associate degree to about $70,000 for an M.B.A., and are taking on thousands of dollars in debt to make it happen.Almost everyone who applies is accepted. As Mr. Barney acknowledged, getting some of these students \u2014 those with the poorest preparation or juggling work, family and school \u2014 to graduate is difficult. \u201cWe don\u2019t select the best. We take who comes there and do the best we can,\u201d he said.Of the approximately two dozen students interviewed at random during a recent visit, nearly all praised the school\u2019s instruction. They particularly liked that the path to a degree was clearly mapped \u2014 no electives, no course catalog to decipher \u2014 and that class work was structured around short, four-week modules.Thomas Hillier, 46, said he and his daughter ended up enrolling at the same time. She graduated with an associate degree in medical specialties and has a good job, while he is finishing his bachelor\u2019s in network security. Cynthia Turgeon, 42, who is majoring in accounting forensics, said, \u201cIt has the best reputation in the Valley.\u201dShe and other middle-aged classmates said they had seen several dropouts, particularly younger students, whom they described as often lacking focus and commitment \u2014 just as they themselves used to. \u201cThis is my third time back in school,\u201d Ms. Turgeon said. \u201cIt\u2019s just clicking now.\u201dThere were dissenters. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand what I got myself into,\u201d Felicia Robbins, 21, said during a break in her medical specialties class. She had heard about the school on radio ads. \u201cThey\u2019re very enticing,\u201d she said.Ms. Robbins said she didn\u2019t realize that the course was largely self-taught, with an instructor providing guidance. \u201cI thought it was going to be like college.\u201dOnly after dropping out, she said, did she discover other colleges would not accept her credits. Rather than throw out her investment, she returned. \u201cI feel like you\u2019re stuck,\u201d she said.Linda Carter, the former dean of the Cheyenne campus in Wyoming, for example, resigned in 2012, saying she was pressured to misrepresent information to school accreditation panels and was disturbed about what she called misleading advertising.When a dispute arose over whether she qualified for unemployment benefits, the Division of Appeals of the Wyoming Department of Workforce Services held a hearing. It concluded that Ms. Carter had \u201cproved, by a preponderance of the evidence, the employer\u2019s customary working conditions involved deceit on the part of the employer.\u201dThe colleges are fighting the suits, characterizing them as without merit.Mr. Barney recalled his reaction to some of the accusations. \u201cThey are all horrific. If anybody was reading those you\u2019d say, \u2018Those were really bad guys.\u2019\u201d He said that when he investigated, however, he concluded that all the complaints were unjustified. \u201cWe\u2019re not perfect,\u201d he said, \u201cbut when we find something that\u2019s wrong, we fix it.\u201dWhat Mr. Barney said he refused to accept was guilt that was not deserved. In the Rand worldview, that would be \u201cunearned guilt\u201d and akin to a sin. A rich man should not feel guilt for hard-earned wealth, he said; a pregnant woman should not feel guilt for having an abortion.So when it comes to the \u201cD.D.D.s\u201d \u2014 the dropouts and debtors \u2014 Mr. Barney said, \u201cI\u2019m really sad about that, but I\u2019m not guilty. We do everything to help them graduate.\u201d He compared his Denver school\u2019s on-time graduation rate of 34 percent with the local community college\u2019s of 10 percent.As for the complaint brought by the Colorado\u2019s attorney general\u2019s office, Mr. Barney said it was \u201cinvented for political purposes\u201d and designed \u201cto force us into a settlement of millions of dollars.\u201dAt the same time, Mr. Barney said, students sometimes did not pay attention to the requirements and costs even when they were explained.In Mr. Barney\u2019s view, the campaign against for-profit colleges is motivated by resentment against their outsize profits. He traces this animosity to the 2008 financial crisis and recession.The bad economy turned out to be good for his business. Stranded without jobs, people flocked to enroll in college. Yet the budgets of many state-run schools were slashed as the economy contracted.People turned to for-profit schools. \u201cThe phones were ringing off the hook,\u201d Mr. Barney said. \u201cAlong with the students came a lot of money. There is no question it was massive.\u201dNot only does Mr. Barney understand the indignation about profiting off public funds, in one sense, he shares it. \u201cI don\u2019t think taxpayers should pay for our students,\u201d he said. He says he believes that government should get out of student loans and grants altogether and leave the financing to the schools, potential employers and banks.It is a view that is echoed in \u201cAtlas Shrugged.\u201d In the novel, the legendary railroad titan Nathaniel Taggart is said to have tossed a government official down three flights of stairs merely for asking if Mr. Taggart would like a government loan.To some critics, the for-profit college business represents the exploitative side of Randian philosophy, in which vulnerable students\u2019 ambitions are manipulated for personal gain.The problem is not just a few bad apples, said A. J. Angulo, a history professor and the author of \u201cDiploma Mills: How For-Profit Colleges Stiffed Students, Taxpayers and the American Dream.\u201d Mr. Angulo says, \u201cWe\u2019re really talking about a few good apples.\u201dThat was the conclusion of a 2012 Senate investigation, the latest in a series of congressional and independent inquiries into for-profit schools\u2019 advertising, job placement and graduation rates, and recruitment strategies that date to the 1980s.To Mr. Angulo, the problem is systemic. \u201cThere is a fundamental conflict of interest, and it\u2019s created by the profit motive,\u201d he said. It leads to cost-cutting, and \u201cthe thing that gets shortchanged systematically is instruction.\u201dSuch hostility to the profit motive is precisely what sets off Mr. Barney\u2019s alarm bells. He argues that for-profit schools offer an alternative to failing, overcrowded community colleges and an educational lifeline to working adults.Free enterprise is what has propelled the United States to prosperity, Mr. Barney said, sitting in a club chair in the lounge at Deer Valley, after a day on ski trails with names like Tycoon, Lucky Star and of course, Success. \u201cYes, there are things to criticize,\u201d he said.But there were \u201ctwo great philosophical experiments of our age,\u201d he said \u2014 the Soviet Union, and America. \u201cSince the founding of this country, when the king was told to buzz off,\u201d he said, laughing, \u201cit\u2019s been a wonderful ride in America, hasn\u2019t it?\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Sanders also said he was supporting Tim Canova, a law professor who has begun an insurgent campaign against Ms. Wasserman Schultz for her South Florida congressional seat. They will face off in a primary this summer.\u201cWell, clearly, I favor her opponent,\u201d Mr. Sanders told Mr. Tapper. \u201cHis views are much closer to mine.\u201dFor months, Mr. Sanders has accused the party of favoring Hillary Clinton, often calling her the \u201canointed candidate.\u201dHe has criticized the party for a debate schedule that his campaign says favors Mrs. Clinton; an arrangement under which Mrs. Clinton raises money for the party; and the appointment of Clinton supporters as leaders of important convention committees.This week, Ms. Wasserman Schultz pushed back against the Sanders campaign in an interview with CNN. \u201cWe\u2019ve had the same rules in place that elected Barack Obama,\u201d she told the network. \u201cThese rules were adopted for state parties all across the country in 2014.\u201dIn a statement on Saturday, she said that \u201ceven though Senator Sanders has endorsed my opponent, I remain, as I have been from the beginning, neutral in the presidential Democratic primary.\u201dAs president, Mr. Sanders would have the ability to appoint the committee chair, though it is not likely he will get that chance, as Mrs. Clinton is close to clinching the nomination. Nevertheless, he can try to draw a little blood from Ms. Wasserman Schultz with his endorsement of her primary opponent, Mr. Canova, the underdog in the race.Mr. Canova, a Nova Southeastern University law professor, has echoed Mr. Sanders\u2019s messages about the need to combat economic inequalities and reform campaign finance. He has also mirrored, on a small scale, Mr. Sanders\u2019s fund-raising model by raising more than $1 million through small donations that have averaged about $19 each.\u201cI\u2019m so proud to know that Bernie Sanders favors our progressive campaign,\u201d Mr. Canova said in a statement on Saturday. \u201cLike Senator Sanders, I\u2019m running a campaign that\u2019s truly backed by the people, not big corporations \u2014 one that stands up to Wall Street interests instead of cozying up to them.\u201dMr. Sanders spent Saturday campaigning across the Western states.At a rally in Vado, N.M., he offered a series of familiar attacks against Mrs. Clinton, criticizing her use of \u201csuper PACs,\u201d her stances on trade agreements and her support of fracking. He also talked about the need to improve the poverty and high school graduation rates in the state.Mr. Sanders then went to California, where he planned to hold an evening rally in National City and where he visited International Friendship Park, an area on the United States border with Mexico. There, he walked along two large walls separating the countries with an immigration activist and Maria Puga, a woman whose husband was killed by border patrol agents as he attempted a crossing from Mexico. Mr. Sanders vowed that if elected, he will push for comprehensive immigration reform.He called a proposal by the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald J.

They have been effective, winning over a rare combination of military hawks, conservative Republicans and a collection of liberal Democrats in Congress. More important, they secured a commitment late last month for $415 million in additional aid to support the Kurds\u2019 pesh merga militia force.\u201cThey are willing to fight,\u201d said Representative Gerald E. Connolly, Democrat of Virginia, who is a member of the Kurdish-American Congressional Caucus, which the lobbying team helped set up in the House. \u201cThey are the only group that has had consistent battlefield success.\u201dKurdish officials say they will continue to press for additional money for ammunition, armored vehicles and protective gear against chemical weapons, requests that lawmakers say they are looking for ways to accommodate.Here is a live-action tally of the Kurdistan Regional Government's lobbying push, charting meetings from one week via the KRG Twitter account.Kurdistan is not entitled to have an official embassy in Washington; its small but well-connected team instead operates out of an embassy-like townhouse a few blocks from the White House that displays flags from both Iraq and Kurdistan.\u201cWe have to punch above our weight,\u201d said Bayan Sami Abdul Rahman, the head of the Washington-based delegation, who like Mr. Talabani was educated in Britain, and speaks with a British accent. \u201cWe have no choice.\u201dThe Kurdish lobbying team in Washington mobilized last summer. A series of private meetings were set up with lawmakers including Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, as the lobbyists and the Kurdish delegation attempted to line up votes for a Senate proposal to provide direct military support to the Kurds, bypassing Baghdad.\u201cIt is easy for the Kurds to make the case as more people in the United States now recognize who the Kurds are and what they are doing,\u201d said David M. Tafuri, a former State Department official who helps lead the Dentons team lobbying for Kurdistan. \u201cSo it is easier for them to get an audience in Washington.\u201dThe Washington-based team of Kurds, led by Ms. Abdul Rahman and an employee assigned to focus on lobbying, Remziya Suleyman, have their own personal stories of hardship.Already, the Kurds have started to receive some behind-the-scenes support from political consultants who work on Israel\u2019s behalf in Washington and who see the Kurds \u2014 a minority group that like the Jews have at times been targeted for persecution by Arabs in the Middle East \u2014 as an unusual but potentially important ally.It is a delicate relationship, Ms. Abdul Rahman agreed, because the Kurds cannot appear to be too closely aligned with Israel without causing tensions with neighbors like Iran.Just last month, two House lawmakers \u2014 Representatives Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Republican of Florida, and Brad Sherman, Democrat of California \u2014 both known as strong supporters of Israel, introduced their own resolution, asking the State Department to send military assistance to the Kurds.\u201cMy priorities?\u201d Mr. Franks said. \u201cAssisting our allies, the Kurds, in their fight against ISIS.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Via Attracts Financing, Despite Silicon Valley\u2019s Nervousness About Ride Sharing", "Date": "2016-05-05", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The start-up Via, a ride-sharing service that pools commuters, faced some headwinds as it sought new financing recently.Its primary competitors include two of Silicon Valley\u2019s best-financed companies, Uber and Lyft. And it went looking for new financing at a time when venture capitalists have begun to tighten their purse strings amid concern that many of the start-ups that they have backed may not survive.Yet Via appears to have done well: The company was to announce Thursday that it had closed on $70 million in a new round of financing, with an additional $30 million expected to close in the next several weeks.The latest round was led by Pitango Growth, an investment firm based in Israel, and included C4 Ventures, Hearst Ventures and the investment firm of the billionaire Roman Abramovich, who may be better known as the owner of the London soccer team Chelsea.About 70 percent of the new round came from new investors, according to Isaac Hillel, a managing general partner of Pitango Growth.The new money will help the four-year-old company expand on what it says is a quest to change mass transportation, including expansion within existing markets, like New York City and Chicago, and entering new cities, like Boston and Washington.Via\u2019s main focus isn\u2019t on getting one or two passengers from one point to another so much as on smart car-pooling \u2014 figuring out the most efficient way to get up to six passengers headed in the same direction to their destinations.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to build a mass-transit system,\u201d Daniel Ramot, the start-up\u2019s co-founder, said in an interview. \u201cVia is the only system designed from the ground up to allow for a fully dynamic public transportation system.\u201dThe result is that customers sharing S.U.V.s, are picked up close to their current locations and ideally dropped off close to their preferred destinations. That means passengers may pay less than what they would for an Uber or Lyft ride: Riders pay $5 plus tax in Manhattan south of 110th Street from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays, or about $6 plus tax from 9 p.m. to midnight on weekdays. In the neighborhoods of Chicago where Via operates, the service costs about $4 plus tax for about the same hours, except during rush hour.\u201cThere are so many empty cars going around,\u201d Mr. Hillel said in an interview. \u201cI really think it\u2019s the future of solving congestion.\u201dVia isn\u2019t the only start-up offering this kind of car-pooling service. Both Uber and Lyft provide similar offerings, which both companies have been promoting heavily in recent months. Uber has said that its UberPool provides 100,000 rides a week in New York. Lyft has estimated that about 30 percent of its overall rides come from its similar Line service, with that percentage rising to more than half in New York and San Francisco.But Via says it has held its own. The company claims to have provided more than four million rides to date and has performed 125,000 rides a week in Manhattan. It says that its membership has quadrupled over the past 12 months, to 250,000 customers.The company plans to push out from Manhattan into other boroughs, as well as expand its service to weekend travel.Mr. Ramot said that his company had faced little difficulty, raising money from existing and new investors at what he called a \u201csubstantial\u201d rise in valuation and without onerous special terms. He declined to be more specific.\u201cWe did see more of a focus and questions around, \u2018Is this a sustainable business model?\u2019 \u201d he said.While Via doesn\u2019t yet make money, Mr. Ramot argued that the two sides of its business \u2014 operating the service directly in dense cities and licensing its technology in other cases \u2014 represented a sustainable model and a good way to expand.\u201cWe\u2019ll continue to grow the platform very rapidly and move a step closer towards our goal of changing how mass transit and public transit work,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

During his senior year at\n                                        Phillips Exeter Academy, Linton enlisted in the Army, eventually serving in WWII as a navigator and bombardier and achieving the rank of 2nd lieutenant in the Army Air Force. In 1946, Mr. Linton joined Burnham &\n                                        Co., a small investment bank as the eighth employee, starting as a runner delivering stock certificates around Wall Street.

Linton worked in virtually every department of the firm, forming the company&aposs Corporate Finance and Commodities departments. By 1976, the firm had become Drexel\n                                        Burnham Lambert. Mr. Linton was eventually named to head the firm by founder I.W. Burnham II, and in the early 1980s under his leadership, Drexel grew to become the most profitable firm on Wall Street. When Mr.\n                                        Linton retired, DBL had 10,000 employees in worldwide offices.

{"Headline": "Women\u2019s Rising Influence in Politics, Tinted Green", "Date": "2016-05-07", "News": "Supported byWomen are bankrolling political campaigns this year more than ever, driven by their rising rank in the workplace, boosts in women\u2019s wealth, and networks set up to gather their donations and bolster their influence.In an election year when women could be a decisive force, the transformation is occurring at every level of political giving and in both parties, from grass-roots supporters sending in a few hundred dollars to the rarefied ranks of ultrawealthy donors who fund \u201csuper PACs.\u201dAnd she has counted on them to fuel her huge fund-raising operation, which already relies more on women than had any presidential candidate before her.Close to half of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s \u201cbundlers\u201d \u2014 the volunteer fund-raisers who solicit checks from friends and business associates \u2014 are women, compared with about a third of President Obama\u2019s 2012 bundlers. Nearly 60 percent of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s reported contributions, totaling $70 million, have come from women, according to Crowdpac, the most of any presidential candidate by far. (The tally does not include contributions too small to be itemized in election commission reports.)In interviews, female donors in both parties described cascading cultural and economic changes that were driving their participation in political giving, long among the most exclusive men\u2019s clubs in American culture. More women are founding their own companies or rising to lead family businesses, or have already sold or retired from them, a common springboard to the upper reaches of political fund-raising. Within marriages, they said, women now had more authority to steer family decisions about political giving.\u201cI was always interested in politics and policy,\u201d Ms. Rodgers said. \u201cBut only in the last 15 years have I been able to do it as a donor.\u201dThe rise of women in business is providing not just the discretionary income required for large contributions, but the kind of personal networks that power presidential and congressional fund-raising.\u201cThe fund-raisers I went to in the late 1990s, it was mostly men writing the checks,\u201d said Amy Rao, the chief executive of a Silicon Valley data-management firm and a prominent Democratic donor. \u201cNow it\u2019s mostly women. And a lot of these women are younger. They work full time. They are writing their own checks.\u201d\u201cIn a very short period of time, the landscape has changed for women,\u201d said Christine Toretti, a longtime Republican donor in Pennsylvania, who headed her family\u2019s oil-drilling company and has given more than $400,000 to candidates since retiring in 2010.Ms. Toretti, Mrs. Rao and other prominent bundlers in both parties said their networks of potential donors, almost exclusively men until just a few years ago, were now composed mostly of other women. And more of them had earned their wealth on their own, in contrast to times when women were more likely to wield their spouses\u2019 wealth or inherited money.But while women are making more contributions than ever, they still significantly trail men in the magnitude of their giving, with about two-thirds of all the money raised by federal candidates in 2016 coming from men, according to Crowdpac data. Most of the largest overall contributors in the country are men, many of them in fields like energy and finance, where women are still exceedingly rare in corporate boardrooms and executive suites.Theresa Kostrzewa, a lobbyist in North Carolina who has donated close to $300,000 for Republicans in recent years, described arriving at a gathering for top Mitt Romney fund-raisers in the summer of 2012 at the Deer Valley resort in Utah. The young woman who escorted her to her room, Ms. Kostrzewa recalled, asked her what she did on Mr. Romney\u2019s staff.\u201cThere\u2019s an expectation even among women that other women are not donors,\u201d Ms. Kostrzewa said. \u201cWe\u2019re still that much of an anomaly.\u201dLess visible than the economic inequality that hampers giving by women are the cultural barriers that remain. Some research, for example, suggests that women are more comfortable giving to causes than to candidates, whether out of a sense that politics is grubby or because nonprofit groups will have more impact on the issues they care about.Even when women assume senior posts at their companies, they are more reluctant to ask their colleagues for contributions to candidates.

To Mr. Ziulkoski, the public dressing down was the kind of rupture that symbolized \u201cthe beginning of the end for her administration.\u201dBut many political analysts say Ms. Rousseff\u2019s slow-motion downfall can also be tied to an autocratic persona and a go-it-alone work style that has driven away scores of political allies, former staff members and cabinet ministers, many of whom have endured searing episodes of public humiliation.\u201cShe\u2019s alienated so many politicians and squandered the good will of so many people, in part because of her terrible political skills but also because of her arrogance,\u201d said Edson Sardinha, the editor of Congresso em Foco, a magazine that focuses on government corruption. \u201cIn her hour of need, very few people are willing to run to her defense.\u201dMs. Rousseff, who has been politically battered by the scandal, said she was the victim of a naked power grab and sexist assumptions of how a woman should lead. She also said she was a convenient scapegoat for something she cannot control: the global plunge in commodity prices that has sent the economy into a tailspin.In more than five years in office, Ms. Rousseff has largely refused to meet with members of Congress, both opponents and allies, eroding the majority support she once enjoyed in the lower house. The aggrieved include Eduardo Suplicy, a former senator and beloved figure in Ms. Rousseff\u2019s Workers\u2019 Party, who said she had turned down multiple requests for a meeting.\u201cIn politics, either you talk or you die,\u201d said Alfredo Nascimento, a former transportation minister. In April, he voted for her impeachment.\u201cI can\u2019t support a president who is incapable of governing,\u201d he said.In Bras\u00edlia, the capital, most everyone can recount stories about Ms. Rousseff\u2019s intolerance for dissent and her short fuse. The anecdotes include the time she smashed an office computer in anger, her refusal to meet with indigenous leaders or gay rights activists and the castigation of aides for the smallest of infractions.She is also finding little sympathy from the Brazilian news media, which has long viewed her as cold and condescending \u2014 a marked contrast to the charismatic, backslapping approach of Mr. da Silva.Some agree that Ms. Rousseff is being judged by a double standard that has unfairly tarnished powerful women around the world. Would she be considered so obstinate and uncooperative if she were a man? Or would she simply be called a strong, decisive leader?\u201cThe president is enduring all the stereotypes and prejudices of Brazil\u2019s highly patriarchal and oligarchic society,\u201d said Rosana Schwartz, a historian and sociologist at Mackenzie Presbyterian University in S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cI\u2019ve even heard people say, \u2018We will never again vote for a woman.\u2019 \u201dBut Antonia Melo, a former Workers\u2019 Party member, said Ms. Rousseff\u2019s gruff manner had alienated many of the party faithful. Ms. Melo described a meeting, when Ms. Rousseff was minister of energy, during which activists hoped to make their case against a contentious dam project in the Amazon.Ms. Melo said she had barely finished her first sentence when Ms. Rousseff cut her off, pounded on the table and vowed to press forward with the dam\u2019s construction. Then she turned around and left the room.\u201cWe stood there looking at each other in silence, perplexed,\u201d Ms. Melo said. \u201cWe felt so disrespected and discarded.\u201dThe episode was stinging given the origin of the Workers\u2019 Party and Ms. Rousseff\u2019s pedigree as a champion of the disenfranchised. The party\u2019s founders were Marxist guerrillas who rose to power through a coalition of trade unionists, landless farmers, indigenous activists and leftist intellectuals who helped pave the way for the re-establishment of democracy in 1985.But that coalition is in tatters. Ms. Rousseff is battling accusations that she hid the depths of Brazil\u2019s economic troubles to enhance her re-election prospects. Many bedrock supporters are disillusioned by widespread corruption in the national oil company, Petrobras, and by what many describe as Ms. Rousseff\u2019s about-face, after her re-election in 2014, on several campaign promises to preserve generous government spending.Dilma Rousseff, Brazil\u2019s president, is facing removal from office. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the proceedings.In recent weeks, at least 135 mayors aligned with the Workers\u2019 Party have changed their party affiliations \u2014 about a fifth of the nation\u2019s mayors who had been elected on the party\u2019s ticket. Among them are Jo\u00e3o Paulo Ribeiro, 31, the mayor of a small city, who said he had grown weary of the attacks by residents and even friends who questioned his association with Ms. Rousseff\u2019s party.\u201cI have to listen to the people,\u201d said Mr. Ribeiro, who changed parties last month, hoping to improve his chances for re-election in October.It is not as if the political figures lining up to oust Ms. Rousseff are viewed as saviors. Many of them are battling serious accusations of corruption, and they were in positions of great power as the country\u2019s once-enviable economy ran aground.Rising unemployment and the broad unrest over Brazil\u2019s economy only added to the strains between Ms. Rousseff and Congress. Had the economy been ascendant \u2014 as it was in 2005 when her predecessor, Mr. da Silva, became embroiled in a vote-buying scandal \u2014 she might have emerged unscathed.The end of Brazil\u2019s bonanza complicated the patronage used to navigate the fractious legislature, in which more than two dozen parties fight for government funding.\u201cWe have a political system based on extracting money from the economy and transferring it to political parties to finance elections,\u201d said Rubens Ric\u00fapero, who served as minister of finance in the mid-1990s.Many Brazilian economists and policy makers contend that the economic crisis was largely a product of Ms. Rousseff\u2019s own making. She increased the government\u2019s footprint in the economy, spending large amounts on favored industries and corporations to build up national champions.\u201cBrazil insisted in carrying out an industrial policy devoid of logic,\u201d said Arminio Fraga, a former governor of the Central Bank of Brazil. \u201cWhen the government offers companies all sorts of advantages, through protection, subsidies and contracts, it creates enormous space for this sort of thing.\u201dFriends and associates say Ms. Rousseff\u2019s worldview and personality were partly shaped by the three years she was imprisoned by the military, a trauma that included torture like beatings and shocks with an electric baton.An economist and career bureaucrat, Ms. Rousseff, 68, had not held elected office until Mr. da Silva, who was barred under the Constitution from seeking a third consecutive term, picked her to run for president on the Workers\u2019 Party ticket. Mr. da Silva has said he was impressed by her grasp of complex data and her no-nonsense managerial style.Idelber Avelar, an early member of the Workers\u2019 Party, said Mr. da Silva also viewed Ms. Rousseff as a compliant soldier who would continue his policies and keep the economy humming until he could run again.\u201cClearly, he thought Dilma was somebody he could easily control, a technocrat who would run the machine, which is pretty ironic given that she\u2019s proven to be a disastrous administrator,\u201d said Mr. Avelar, who now teaches at Tulane University in New Orleans. \u201cThe root of all her problems is a profound aversion to politics.\u201dAt least 86 cabinet ministers have come and gone since she took office, and only three remain from her first term. Many were forced to resign after being accused of corruption.Ms. Rousseff has not been accused of graft, though many people question her innocence, given her role as chairwoman of the national oil company at a time when the epic kickback scheme was being hatched.In an interview, Ms. Rousseff brushed off suggestions that her disdain for retail politics and the horse trading required to pass legislation had contributed to her woes. She defended her decision to ignore members of Congress.\u201cThere were certain types of blackmail negotiations I would not engage in,\u201d she said.For a time, the Brazilian public viewed her steely resolve positively. During her first year in office, Ms. Rousseff\u2019s popularity stood at 77 percent, among the highest percentages in recent history. These days, that figure is in the single digits.Many Brazilians still admire Ms. Rousseff\u2019s ethics. But after two years of economic turmoil, her televised speeches prompt a cacophony on the streets, as thousands bang on pots and pans to drown out her voice.Few give Ms. Rousseff credit for big achievements, including a landmark freedom of information law and measures that gave federal police and prosecutors new tools to tackle corruption.In some ways, analysts said, Ms. Rousseff has become a victim of those laws, which paved the way for the investigations that have claimed scores of the political and business elite, exposing the depths of Brazil\u2019s political rot.\u201cThis is one of the greatest paradoxes of her fall, because she put in place the machinery that ensnared the politicians who mattered the most,\u201d said Gregory Michener, a professor at Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Get\u00falio Vargas, a research institute in Rio de Janeiro. \u201cDilma did a lot for good government, and I think she ultimately wanted good government, but in the end she wasn\u2019t a good politician because in Brazil\u2019s rent-seeking party system, she was unwilling to give her allies their fill.\u201dPaula Moura contributed reporting from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, and Eduardo Porter from New York.Advertisement"}

Buyer Beware", "Date": "2016-05-27", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe king\u2019s endorsement increases the chances that an I.P.O. will occur, though the scale of the offering remains unclear. It could be relatively small and restricted to Saudi investors, thus avoiding the need for the heightened transparency normally associated with I.P.O.s. Conversely, despite the lack of transparency, a larger offering could be in the cards, promoted in part by bankers and consultants who stand to reap a fortune in fees on the transaction.Either way, an Aramco I.P.O. raises questions, and what investors don\u2019t know about the company \u2014 the accuracy of its claimed oil and gas reserves, for instance \u2014 is only one of them. An investment in Aramco would also be an investment in a kingdom that systematically represses women, and hence, in human and social capital. None of the many officials named to new posts in the decrees were women.Though ostensibly aimed at modernization, neither the development plan nor the decrees propose changes in the kingdom\u2019s basic political arrangements, in which religious fundamentalists uphold the legitimacy of the royal family in exchange for freedom to foster and spread extremist ideology. There is also no explanation of how even a big infusion of cash would build new industries from nothing and transform Saudi Arabia\u2019s estimated 20 million subjects into self-supporting employers and employees.Saudi Arabia desperately needs to modernize, and even talking about that need is a step forward.

{"Headline": "Dozens of Women Vanish on Canada\u2019s Highway of Tears, and Most Cases Are Unsolved", "Date": "2016-05-24", "News": "Supported bySMITHERS, British Columbia \u2014 Less than a year after her 15-year-old cousin vanished, Delphine Nikal, 16, was last seen hitchhiking from this isolated northern Canadian town on a spring morning in 1990.Dozens of Canadian women and girls, most of them indigenous, have disappeared or been murdered near Highway 16, a remote ribbon of asphalt that bisects British Columbia and snakes past thick forests, logging towns and impoverished Indian reserves on its way to the Pacific Ocean. So many women and girls have vanished or turned up dead along one stretch of the road that residents call it the Highway of Tears.A special unit formed by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police officially linked 18 such cases from 1969 to 2006 to this part of the highway and two connecting arteries. More women have vanished since then, and community activists and relatives of the missing say they believe the total is closer to 50. Almost all the cases remain unsolved.In December, after years of refusal by his conservative predecessor, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a long-awaited national inquiry into the disappearances and murders of indigenous women.The inquiry, set to cost 40 million Canadian dollars ($31 million), is part of Mr. Trudeau\u2019s promise of a \u201ctotal renewal\u201d of Canada\u2019s relationship with its indigenous citizens, and it comes at a critical time.Aboriginal women and girls make up about 4 percent of the total female population of Canada but 16 percent of all female homicides, according to government statistics.\u201cWhat\u2019s clear is the uneven application of justice,\u201d Ms. Bennett said.One reason to doubt the estimate by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, she said, is that the police often immediately deemed the women\u2019s deaths to be suicides, drug overdoses or accidents, over the protests of relatives who suspected foul play. \u201cThere was no investigation,\u201d she said, citing one recent case. \u201cThe file folder\u2019s empty.\u201dMs. Radek, a co-founder of Tears4Justice, an advocacy organization, said, \u201cWhen it comes to the missing, racism runs deep.\u201dThe federal government has allocated 8.4 billion Canadian dollars ($6.4 billion) over five years to aid indigenous communities, which have disproportionately high levels of poverty, incarceration, alcoholism and substance abuse, and often lack basic necessities like safe drinking water.Covering 450 miles between the city of Prince George and the Pacific port of Prince Rupert, the Highway of Tears is both a microcosm of Canada\u2019s painful indigenous legacy and a serious test for Mr. Trudeau as he tries to repair the country\u2019s relationship with aboriginal people.On a recent journey along Highway 16, scenes of stunning wilderness were flecked by indigenous communities reeling from economic decay and the anguished memories of missing and murdered women.A few miles outside Prince George, the highway plunges into thick forests veined with logging roads and the occasional \u201cmoose crossing\u201d sign. \u201cGirls Don\u2019t Hitchhike on the Highway of Tears,\u201d reads a large yellow billboard alongside the road farther north. \u201cKiller on the Loose!\u201dThe provincial government announced plans in December to improve safety along Highway 16, including funds for traffic cameras and vehicles for indigenous communities. But little has changed on the road, which lacks lighting or any public transportation other than infrequent Greyhound bus service that does not reach remote communities.The perils do not stop desperate people from thumbing rides in a region where public transportation is practically nonexistent. Just outside the village of Burns Lake, Drucella Joseph, 25, an unemployed aboriginal woman, eagerly climbed into the back of a passing car along with her boyfriend, Corey Coombes. \u201cFriends will drive me when I really need a ride, but other than that, we just hitchhike,\u201d she told the driver. The couple gets by on his disability payments and on donated food from food banks. Neither has a cellphone. When hitchhiking, Mr. Coombes says he protects himself by carrying a club or a screwdriver.Anguished family members said they received little help from the authorities, a sharp contrast to the cases of missing white women. After Ms. Chipman vanished in 2005, her aunt, Ms. Radek, said the police objected to the family putting up its own missing posters. \u201cThey knew we were searching day and night, and they did nothing to help us,\u201d she said. The next day, she said, a white woman disappeared near Vancouver \u201cand the police were out in the streets putting up posters.\u201dAfter her daughter Ramona disappeared in 1994, the police refused to act, said Matilda Wilson, a member of the Gitxsan First Nation. \u201cThey gave us all these different excuses that she might be back tomorrow or next week,\u201d Ms. Wilson said. \u201cThere was no hurry or alarm about it, so we started looking ourselves.\u201dDespite multiple searches, Ms. Wilson, a single mother of six who is now 65, said there was no sign of Ramona until she had been gone for seven months, when Ms. Wilson received an anonymous phone call telling her that the girl\u2019s body was near the airport. Police officers searched the area but found nothing, she said. In April 1995, two men riding all-terrain vehicles by the airport discovered Ramona\u2019s remains buried under some trees. Plastic flowers and a glass cross now decorate her grave in a Smithers cemetery, a few blocks from Ms. Wilson\u2019s tidy trailer-park home.Angry with the police for failing to find the teenager or to alert people to the history of missing women near Highway 16, Ms. Wilson and her family organized a memorial walk in June 1995 that has become an annual event, garnering attention from the news media and inspiring activism from families of other missing women.\u201cWe want closure, and we\u2019re not going to give up,\u201d Ms. Wilson said as she swept leaves from her daughter\u2019s gravestone.One recent afternoon, three young aboriginal sisters and their female cousin were walking across the Moricetown Indian Reserve, which abuts the highway. Asked about the Highway of Tears, one of the women, Rochelle Joseph, an unemployed 21-year-old, said the sisters never hitchhiked because they grew up hearing about the victims, including their cousin, Ms. Chipman.Still, the menace of the highway haunts their lives.\u201cThe stories made us cautious,\u201d Ms. Joseph said quietly, voicing their fear of a serial killer lurking behind the steering wheel of any strange car. \u201cHe\u2019s probably still out there.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Peter Thiel, Tech Billionaire, Reveals Secret War With Gawker", "Date": "2016-05-25", "News": "Supported byA billionaire Silicon Valley entrepreneur was outed as being gay by a media organization. His friends suffered at the hands of the same gossip site. Nearly a decade later, the entrepreneur secretly financed a lawsuit to try to put the media company out of business.What the jury \u2014 and the public \u2014 did not know was that Mr. Bollea had a secret benefactor paying about $10 million for the lawsuit: Peter Thiel, a co-founder of PayPal and one of the earliest investors in Facebook.\u201cIt\u2019s less about revenge and more about specific deterrence,\u201d he said on Wednesday in his first interview since his identity was revealed. \u201cI saw Gawker pioneer a unique and incredibly damaging way of getting attention by bullying people even when there was no connection with the public interest.\u201dMr. Thiel said that Gawker published articles that were \u201cvery painful and paralyzing for people who were targeted.\u201d He said, \u201cI thought it was worth fighting back.\u201dMr. Thiel added: \u201cI can defend myself. Most of the people they attack are not people in my category. They usually attack less prominent, far less wealthy people that simply can\u2019t defend themselves.\u201d He said that \u201ceven someone like Terry Bollea who is a millionaire and famous and a successful person didn\u2019t quite have the resources to do this alone.\u201dMr. Thiel said that he had decided several years ago to set his plan in motion. \u201cI didn\u2019t really want to do anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought it would do more harm to me than good. One of my friends convinced me that if I didn\u2019t do something, nobody would.\u201dHe continued, \u201cIt\u2019s not like it is some sort of speaking truth to power or something going on here. The way I\u2019ve thought about this is that Gawker has been a singularly terrible bully. In a way, if I didn\u2019t think Gawker was unique, I wouldn\u2019t have done any of this. If the entire media was more or less like this, this would be like trying to boil the ocean.\u201d Mr. Thiel said he had not targeted any other media companies.But the revelation this week that Mr. Thiel was covertly backing Mr. Bollea\u2019s case as well as others has raised a series of new questions about the First Amendment as well as about the role of big money in the court system \u2014 specifically the emerging field of litigation finance, in which third parties like hedge funds and investment firms pay for other people\u2019s lawsuits.Roy D. Simon, a professor emeritus of legal ethics at Hofstra University School of Law, suggested that the practice has helped \u201clevel the playing field\u201d by providing resources for people to mount cases against big institutions that would be impossible otherwise.But he said there was a risk when a lawsuit was funded by a single person with a potential agenda. \u201cI am troubled by Thiel,\u201d Professor Simon said. \u201cI guess that one guy is much more likely to have an agenda driven by revenge or personal dislike or wanting to prove a point.\u201dBut other legal experts said that the mere fact of Mr. Thiel\u2019s involvement did not change the case. And while there is no legal requirement that underwriters like Mr. Thiel reveal their involvement to the opposing side or the jury, it is considered fair game for lawyers to ask questions about financial backing \u2014 something that Gawker Media did on Wednesday in court as part of its efforts to overturn the Hogan judgment.\u201cIf you really do have concerns about the merits of this case, finding out who bankrolled it doesn\u2019t really help you at all,\u201d said Mary Anne Franks, a professor at the University of Miami School of Law. Absent any indication that there is something unlawful about how the funding took place, she said, \u201cyou would still need to show that there\u2019s something substantively wrong with the ruling.\u201dIn a statement, Nick Denton, the founder of Gawker Media, who was also personally named in the Hogan suit, said: \u201cJust because Peter Thiel is a Silicon Valley billionaire, his opinion does not trump our millions of readers who know us for routinely driving big news stories including Hillary Clinton\u2019s secret email account, Bill Cosby\u2019s history with women, the mayor of Toronto as a crack smoker, Tom Cruise\u2019s role within Scientology, the N.F.L. cover-up of domestic abuse by players and just this month the hidden power of Facebook to determine the news you see.\u201dMr. Thiel is known as a brilliant entrepreneur. Born in West Germany and raised in California, he became a chess prodigy, an academic star and a promising lawyer before settling down in the Bay Area to found companies.He achieved demigod status among Silicon Valley business leaders, thanks largely to his role at PayPal, where he became the de facto don of the early employee group known as the PayPal mafia. That group went on to become power players at such Silicon Valley institutions as Tesla, YouTube, LinkedIn and Yelp.Mr. Thiel is also known for his lucrative investment in Facebook, where he is a board member, and his three venture firms, Founders Fund, Mithril and Valar. (His defunct hedge fund, Clarium Capital, has been long forgotten.) He also co-founded the secretive data-crunching start-up Palantir and bankrolled Breakout Labs, which only funds what Mr. Thiel calls \u201chard tech\u201d start-ups that tackle things like new energy, transportation and biotech companies. \u201cWe wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters,\u201d is the Founders Fund tag line.But unlike most Silicon Valley billionaires, Mr. Thiel openly supports a wide array of eccentric philanthropic and social efforts aimed at radically altering life as we know it. His Thiel fellowship gives high school and college-age students money to drop out of school and start companies. He has donated to organizations that seek to extend the human life span, such as the Methuselah Foundation. And he co-founded the Seasteading Institute, which aims to create cities that float at sea, beyond the reach of governments and their laws.A libertarian, Mr. Thiel is a pledged delegate for Donald J. Trump for the 2016 Republican National Convention.He said that he hired a legal team several years ago to look for cases that he could help financially support. \u201cWithout going into all the details, we would get in touch with the plaintiffs who otherwise would have accepted a pittance for a settlement, and they were obviously quite happy to have this sort of support,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a way very similar to how a plaintiff\u2019s lawyer on contingency would do it.\u201d Mr. Thiel declined to disclose what other cases he had supported but there are at least two current cases against Gawker.Without revealing an exact figure, he said that estimates of $10 million in expenses so far were \u201croughly in the ballpark.\u201d He added: \u201cI would underscore that I don\u2019t expect to make any money from this. This is not a business venture.\u201dHe would not say whether he had compensated any of the people, including Mr. Bollea, which could raise questions in an appeal. He insisted \u201cthere was no gray area\u201d in what he had done.Mr. Thiel was not the only boldface name in Silicon Valley who was outed as gay by Gawker Media \u2014 Timothy D. Cook, the chief executive of Apple, is another example.Owen Thomas, the former editor of Valleywag who wrote the article about Mr. Thiel, offered his side of the story in a telephone interview on Wednesday. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said before, I did not \u2018out\u2019 Peter Thiel,\u201d said Mr. Thomas, now business editor at The San Francisco Chronicle. \u201cI did discuss his sexuality, but it was known to a wide circle who felt that it was not fit for discussion beyond that circle. I thought that attitude was retrograde and homophobic, and that informed my reporting. I believe that he was out and not in the closet.\u201dMr. Thiel said he considered his financial backing of the cases against Gawker to be \u201cone of my greater philanthropic things that I\u2019ve done. I think of it in those terms.\u201dHe refused to divulge exactly what other cases he has funded but said, \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say this is not the only one.\u201dSpeculation that a secret benefactor was backing Mr. Bollea\u2019s case was whispered during the trial but largely dismissed as a conspiracy theory. It gained currency in large part as a result of an unusual decision Mr. Bollea\u2019s legal team made: It purposely excluded a claim that would have allowed Gawker\u2019s insurance company to help pay for its defense as well as damages. The move struck observers as odd because most plaintiffs seeking damages usually hope to settle the case by leveraging the deep pockets of an insurer.Mr. Thiel said, \u201cI figured it would eventually come out,\u201d adding that he was happy his role might spur a conversation about it being \u201cextremely hard for the most common victims to get justice.\u201dHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s not for me to decide what happens to Gawker.

The challenge to bring down costs, under this system or single-payer, is large.Yet we have seen what the free market has done over the last 70 years, and it has not been a success in terms of cost control. Indeed, health care costs are going to get significantly worse if we continue our present system, a combination of private and government payment.Only a single-payer system has any chance to control costs yet guarantee that all citizens will have health care coverage. To stand pat with free-market fervor or to go backward, such as eliminating the Affordable Care Act, will deprive many of medical care while still driving up costs.In the long run, the present system will cost far more than a single-payer option, and the sooner we proceed in that direction the better. GREGORY L. SHEEHYMiddleton, Wis.The writer is a retired internist.To the Editor:It\u2019s time to debunk the myth that a single-payer system must eliminate the health insurance industry. That industry works with self-insured employers not as an insurer but as an administrator, making sure that the self-insured employer lowers health care costs through provider contracts, benefit plan design and insights that identify patients requiring proactive steps to reduce long-term medical costs.The industry has been very successful in enabling self-insured organizations to reduce and contain costs.The federal government could become a single payer (for one national risk pool or 50 state pools) administered through the private-sector insurance companies acting as benefit administrators, just as they do for self-insured employers.The government would require common forms and do all contracting with providers (eliminating a lot of administrative complexity). The private-sector companies would compete on \u201cgetting the most from your benefit spending,\u201d just as they do with self-insured employers.As long as we hold on to the myth that health care reform eliminates an industry, there will be no reform.MARY KAY PLANTESLa Jolla, Calif.The writer is an economist and business strategist with board, management and consulting experience in the health care industry.To the Editor:Our health care costs more because our administrative costs, a result of a financing system that relies on for-profit insurance companies, are so high. Some of those costs are borne by physicians, who must pay for complex billing systems, denial management, preauthorization requirements, collections management and bad debt, as well as devoting patient time to discussing insurance coverage rather than medical issues.If we substantially decrease those costs to physicians, as a single-payer system would do, we could decrease insurance payments to physicians and still give all of them a raise. No economic miracle involved; just a matter of the people who do the work, rather than a wasteful middleman, taking home the money.ANNE SCHEETZChicagoThe writer is a retired internist.To the Editor:If a single-payer system is put in place, beware: Not only will some hospitals go out of business and doctors default on their mortgages, but far worse is in store. We all as patients will suffer grave consequences.It takes a long time to school and train a competent doctor, at a very high economic cost. Most of the well-trained, middle-age doctors are still in practice, so the absence of well-trained physicians has not been seen or felt by the general public yet.But we doctors ourselves shudder to think \u201cwho will take care of us when we get sick?\u201d Are we prepared for the real answer?

{"Headline": "Gawker Founder Suspects a Common Financer Behind Lawsuits", "Date": "2016-05-23", "News": "Supported byDealBookAt first, Nick Denton, the founder of Gawker Media, thought it an unlikely conspiracy theory.Now, he\u2019s starting to believe it himself.Mr. Denton has begun to question whether Mr. Harder has a benefactor, perhaps one of the many subjects of Gawker\u2019s skewering coverage.\u201cMy own personal hunch is that it\u2019s linked to Silicon Valley, but that\u2019s nothing really more than a hunch,\u201d Mr. Denton told me. \u201cIf you\u2019re a billionaire and you don\u2019t like the coverage of you, and you don\u2019t particularly want to embroil yourself any further in a public scandal, it\u2019s a pretty smart, rational thing to fund other legal cases.\u201dMr. Denton\u2019s view is based on the huge expenses of legal cases and settlements, the fact that Mr. Hogan\u2019s financial health has been erratic \u2014 and on the rich history of lawsuits in which lawyers make money only if they win the case. There is an entire industry that exists to provide lines of credit to lawyers working on contingency. There is also a small netherworld of investors who back certain lawsuits.\u201cThe answer may be entirely innocent,\u201d Mr. Denton said, musing on the question of whether Mr. Harder was paid by someone other than Mr. Hogan, \u201cbut I think in order for people to understand what\u2019s going on here, what the stakes are, I think it\u2019s important that it be out in public, or at least that he\u2019d be asked the question in public.\u201dBased on my conversation with Mr. Denton as well some independent lawyers who first raised questions about the financing of Mr. Hogan\u2019s suit, I approached Mr. Harder and asked him the question directly. In an email, he said, \u201cI do not discuss the finances of my clients, including any financial arrangements they have with my firm. This applies to all clients.\u201dStepping aside from this case, it\u2019s clear that some lawsuits have been funded for reasons beyond strict economics. Kenneth G. Langone, the co-founder of Home Depot and former director of the New York Stock Exchange, helped fund Maurice R. Greenberg\u2019s lawsuit against the United States government over the bankruptcy of the American International Group, which was viewed as being as much as about money as about principle.And Max Mosley, the former head of Formula One who successfully brought a series of suits against News of the World for publishing pictures of him involved in an orgy, later funded a number of lawsuits against the same tabloid by people who said its journalists had hacked their phones.As for the lawsuits against Gawker Media, \u201cthe evidence has built up over time that there are questions that are unanswered here,\u201d Mr. Denton said. \u201cThe data point that really got us thinking was the move that they made on insurance, which seemed designed to prevent insurance paying for our defense.\u201dMr. Denton is referring to a decision by Mr. Hogan\u2019s legal team to abruptly drop one of the claims \u2014 for \u201cnegligent infliction of emotional distress\u201d \u2014 from its case. That claim had a particularly special meaning: It was the one claim that required Gawker\u2019s insurance company to pay for its defense as well as potential payouts in the case of a settlement. (That provision of Gawker\u2019s insurance policy became public after the insurance company, Nautilus, sued Gawker to try to limit payment for defense.)Several legal experts said that it was particularly unusual for a plaintiff using a lawyer being paid on a contingency basis not only to turn down settlement offers (several sizable settlements were proffered by Gawker) but also to pursue a strategy that prevented an insurance company from being able to contribute to a settlement.\u201cIt\u2019s a very unusual thing to do, because the insurance company would have deeper pockets than Gawker,\u201d said Larry Geneen, a risk management consultant who has long dealt with lawsuits involving insurance companies. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a situation where the plaintiff intentionally took out the claim involving the insurance company.\u201dAnd given that Mr. Hogan has had financial ups and downs, the cost of the hundreds of motions his lawyers made is significant, and the chances the award is significantly reduced based on previous cases he lost making the same claims in federal court, it\u2019s hard to completely understand the motivations at play.Additionally, Mr. Harder has brought two new cases against Gawker that seem puzzling. One is a defamation case on behalf of Shiva Ayyadurai, who claimed to have invented email. Gawker had written an article challenging his argument, similar to an article from The Washington Post and others on the same topic.\u201cIn L.A. and New York power centers, people are pretty used to an independent and critical press,\u201d Mr. Denton said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we write that much about Hollywood\u2019s celebrities that isn\u2019t written in TMZ or in other celebrity news sites.\u201dBut some subcultures aren\u2019t used to the glare, Mr. Denton added. \u201cSilicon Valley coverage with coverage on Valleywag, and the coverage on Gawker and Gizmodo \u2014 I think that has been a change for them.\u201dGawker has made a virtual industry of skewering the industry. The company got into a public battle with Steve Jobs over the publication of pictures of a prototype iPhone that was found at a bar. It has also poked at the private lives of virtually every member of Silicon Valley\u2019s royalty and outed many. (I\u2019ll spare them being name-checked here because it will invariably send readers scurrying to Google to search the names.)Admittedly, it is a bit hard to defend Gawker Media. I often disagree with Gawker\u2019s news judgment, and it has routinely published items over the years that crossed the line of good taste. I\u2019ve been on the other side of Gawker\u2019s critical pen, and it is not fun. Even so, I believe in a free press, and that means freedom of speech for Gawker\u2019s brand of journalism.Mr. Denton does too, but he also would like to see more transparency on the financial side. As for the Hulk Hogan lawsuit, \u201cit\u2019s a big case that involves the balance of power between public figures and the press,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s in the public\u2019s interest and the media interest for the motives of people on both sides to be out there.\u201dIt would be great to know the answer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Save Puerto Rico", "Date": "2016-05-31", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe success of the bill will depend largely on who is named to the seven-member oversight board. Under the legislation, President Obama would technically appoint all the members, but he would have to pick four people from lists provided by the Republican leaders in the House and the Senate; one pick each goes to Mr. Obama and the two Democratic leaders. If Republicans don\u2019t expand the list beyond their usual ideologues, the board could end up turning to old policies that have proved to be unworkable. Deep spending cuts will not heal Puerto Rico. Lawmakers will have more success if they pick people who have experience solving financial crises and who understand Puerto Rico\u2019s particular problems.The legislation has other problems. One provision would exempt Puerto Rico from the Department of Labor\u2019s recent decision to make more managerial workers eligible for overtime pay. Another would allow the island\u2019s governor to temporarily set a minimum wage for workers younger than 25 that is less than the federal wage floor of $7.25 an hour. The good news is that it is hard to imagine that a governor would take advantage of this measure since it would only encourage more young people to move to the states, where they are assured a higher wage.Advertisement"}

(The incentive comes as the credits roll at the end of the movie.) The cross-platform marketing strategy is part of Rovio\u2019s efforts to reinvigorate its Angry Birds brand and transform the company into a global media powerhouse.The original Angry Birds game, which was released in 2009 and became a time-consuming yet irresistible distraction, is the top paid mobile app of all time. But sales have flagged and the company has struggled, despite efforts to diversify into consumer products and reduce its reliance on mobile games.Rovio, a privately held company based in Finland, reported an annual loss in 2015 of 13 million euros, or about $15 million.The movie was developed as part of the company\u2019s desire to evolve beyond apps, said Tuomo Korpinen, president of the company\u2019s Rovio Animation unit and formerly of DreamWorks Animation. \u201cThe idea was that this was needed to compete with the best out there, the Disneys, the Pixars, the DreamWorks.\u201dRovio had already moved into producing animated shorts, which were released in its games and later on ToonsTV, the company\u2019s mobile platform for distributing original series and third-party content. But executives wanted to further expand the Angry Birds franchise.\u201cWe started diving into what makes a brand,\u201d said Mikael Hed, executive chairman of Rovio Animation. \u201cWe noticed that big brands in entertainment are connected to storytelling.\u201dSo Rovio took a risk, deciding to develop and finance a feature-length film, which reportedly cost $80 million to make. The movie \u201cis a natural evolution of wanting to tell the story of our characters,\u201d said Mr. Korpinen, who goes by Tommy.The feathered friends will be given limbs and voices for the first time, a strategic decision that Rovio waited until the movie to introduce. \u201cWe wanted to keep it a clean slate, no limitations in terms of their dialogue and tone of their voice,\u201d Mr. Hed said. \u201cWe had total freedom for creating our characters within the movie.\u201dTo market the film, Rovio played to its core strength as a digital developer. In addition to the extra content offered to moviegoers, Rovio is offering content through its licensing partners, like H&M, Hasbro, Lego and McDonald\u2019s. Packaged products include \u201cBirdCodes\u201d that can be scanned with a smartphone to unlock bonus material such as power-ups for Angry Birds Action, mini-games and augmented reality experiences.\u201cBecause our core, or DNA, is that we are a digital company, we were able to execute these types of programs,\u201d Mr. Korpinen said.Advertisement"}

At least, in these uncertain times, people were still buying high-end contemporary art \u2014 just as they did the previous night at Christie\u2019s, where the Japanese Internet billionaire Yusaku Maezawa splashed out $81.3 million on five trophy works, including a $57.3 million Basquiat. On Wednesday night, he bought two pieces for an additional total of $16.6 million.At one point, after selling a white Lucio Fontana piece for $2.6 million, there was an audible whoop in the room. \u201cI\u2019m happy for you, as well,\u201d the auctioneer, Oliver Barker, said.At times there was repeated back-and-forth between two bidders as the price inched up in relatively small increments, as it did for a G\u00fcnther F\u00f6rg abstract. \u201cYou\u2019re really making me work for it,\u201d Mr. Barker said. (It finally went for $670,000).The Sotheby\u2019s result was doubly reassuring, given the auction house\u2019s bumpy year. Even as it acquired Art Agency, Partners, a New York art advisory company, in January, more than a dozen senior specialists have left.At 44 lots, last night\u2019s sale was noticeably smaller than the 63-lot auction Sotheby\u2019s held last May in a more bullish market. As at Christie\u2019s, no work was valued at more than $40 million, reflecting reluctance among collectors to test demand with their most valuable pieces.\u201cThere\u2019s still money out there,\u201d the London-based dealer Offer Waterman said. \u201cThe election is a big factor. People are waiting. But passionate collectors are still buying.\u201dArt auctions can be unpredictable. See how you match up in this interactive quiz.Here are some of the night\u2019s main talking points.Mr. Ghenie\u2019s 2012 painting \u201cSelf-Portrait as Vincent van Gogh\u201d gave a flying start to the sale with six bidders and a price of $2.6 million with fees, against a low estimate of $200,000. It went to the free-spending Mr. Maezawa, who also bought Christopher Wool\u2019s \u201cChameleon\u201d painting for $14 million.\u201cIt\u2019s about perfection,\u201d Gr\u00e9goire Billault, Sotheby\u2019s head of contemporary art, said of the piece. \u201cOne of those dreams we\u2019re all chasing each season.\u201dWith a low estimate of $22 million, the diptych sold for $35 million to a telephone bidder; the underbidder was the London-based dealer Gladwell & Patterson.\u201cThe \u2018blackboards\u2019 are among his most desirable works,\u201d the New York dealer Christophe Van de Weghe said. \u201cThe references to school and education appeal to collectors.\u201dOn Wednesday night, Sotheby\u2019s put an estimate of $40 million on the 1968 abstract \u201cUntitled (New York City),\u201d notable for its looping calligraphy in pale blue, rather than the usual white. The canvas was bought for $36.7 million by a single bidder on the phone with Patti Wong, chairwoman of Sotheby\u2019s Asia.\u201cAbove $20 million, the air is thin,\u201d Mr. Billault said, adding that it was hard to have the fourth major \u201cblackboard\u201d painting to come up for auction recently. \u201cBut nearly $37 million I don\u2019t think is a real disappointment.\u201dHowever, Twombly\u2019s crimson 2004 abstract \u201cUntitled (Bacchus 1st Version V)\u201d was among five works on the night that carried Sotheby\u2019s-financed guarantees. With an estimate of $20 million, this confirmed a night of lowered expectations, selling for $15.4 million to the London art advisers de Pury.An earlier version of this article misstated the surname of a New York-based art dealer.

{"Headline": "One Top Taxpayer Moved, and New Jersey Shuddered", "Date": "2016-04-30", "News": "Supported byInside WealthOur top-heavy economy has come to this: One man can move out of New Jersey and put the entire state budget at risk. Other states are facing similar situations as a greater share of income \u2014 and tax revenue \u2014 becomes concentrated in the hands of a few.Last month, during a routine review of New Jersey\u2019s finances, one could sense the alarm. The state\u2019s wealthiest resident had reportedly \u201cshifted his personal and business domicile to another state,\u201d Frank W. Haines III, New Jersey\u2019s legislative budget and finance officer, told a State Senate committee. If the news were true, New Jersey would lose so much in tax revenue that \u201cwe may be facing an unusual degree of income tax forecast risk,\u201d Mr. Haines said.The New Jersey resident (unnamed by Mr. Haines) is the hedge-fund billionaire David Tepper. In December, Mr. Tepper declared himself a resident of Florida after living for over 20 years in New Jersey. He later moved the official headquarters of his hedge fund, Appaloosa Management, to Miami.New Jersey won\u2019t say exactly how much Mr. Tepper paid in taxes. But according to Institutional Investor\u2019s Alpha, he earned more than $6 billion from 2012 to 2015. Tax experts say his move to Florida could cost New Jersey \u2014 which has a top tax rate of 8.97 percent \u2014 hundreds of millions of dollars in lost payments.Mr. Tepper, 58, declined to comment on his move. He does have family \u2014 his mother and sister \u2014 who live in Florida. But several New Jersey lawmakers cited his relocation as proof that the state\u2019s tax rates, up from 6.37 percent in 1996, are chasing away the rich. Florida has no personal income tax.\u201cIf you\u2019re making hundreds of millions of dollars and you\u2019re paying close to 10 percent to the state of New Jersey, you do the math,\u201d said Jon Bramnick, the Republican leader in the New Jersey Assembly. \u201cYou can save millions a year by moving to Florida. How can you blame him?\u201dBeyond the debate on taxing the rich, Mr. Tepper\u2019s move is a case study in how tax collections are affected when income becomes very highly concentrated. With the top tenth of 1 percent of the population reaping the largest income gains, states with the highest tax rates on the rich are growing increasingly dependent on a smaller group of superearners for tax revenue.In New York, California, Connecticut, Maryland and New Jersey, the top 1 percent pay a third or more of total income taxes. Now a handful of billionaires or even a single individual like Mr. Tepper can have a noticeable impact on state revenues and budgets.California had to account for a \u201cFacebook effect\u201d in 2012 and 2013 after that company\u2019s 2012 initial public offering of stock. The offering generated more than $1 billion in revenue \u2014 much of that from the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, and a small group of company shareholders. Washington, D.C., had an unexpected $50 million gain in its 2012 fiscal year \u2014 which helped create a budget surplus \u2014 after the death of a local billionaire increased its estate tax receipts.Some academic research shows that high taxes are chasing the rich to lower-tax states, and anecdotes of tax-fleeing billionaires abound. But other studies say there is little evidence showing that the rich move solely for tax purposes. Millionaires and billionaires who move from the high-tax states in the Northeast to Florida, for instance, may be drawn by the sunshine, lifestyle and retirement culture, in addition to lower taxes.While some high earners may be moving for tax reasons, New Jersey, New York, California and other states are replacing rich people faster than they are losing them. New Jersey had 237,000 millionaires in 2015, compared with 207,200 in 2006, according to Phoenix Marketing International, a research firm. New York added 69,500 millionaires from 2006 to 2015, to 437,900, while California added over 100,000 millionaires, to 772,600.The best solution to the mega-taxpayer dilemma, some tax experts say, is for states to do a better job of tracking and forecasting the incomes of their top earners. Since the rich are the most mobile and are able to manage their investments just as easily in Miami as in Manhattan, states are devising new ways to monitor their top taxpayers and keep them from leaving.\u201cIn a time of rising inequality, I\u2019m not sure the right answer is lowering taxes or making them less progressive,\u201d said Kim S. Rueben, senior fellow of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute. \u201cIt\u2019s more about keeping an eye on people, seeing where they are and enforcing the tax rules.\u201dConnecticut, home to several hedge fund billionaires, now tracks the quarterly estimated payments of 100 of its top earners. Kevin B. Sullivan, commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Revenue Services, said about five or six of the highest earners could have a \u201cmeasurable impact on the revenue stream.\u201dMr. Sullivan said that when one of the state\u2019s rich hedge fund executives planned to move his family and company to a lower-tax state, state officials met with him and persuaded him to leave some of his work force in Connecticut.\u201cWe knew we were going to lose him,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said. \u201cBut we wanted to keep some of the higher-paying jobs.\u201d He said the state worked out a deal to keep the jobs in exchange for an agreement about the owner\u2019s regular visits to family and friends in Connecticut. (Homeowners who spend more than 183 days in the state are considered residents for tax purposes.) He said the state was holding discussions with other top earners in hopes of keeping them.\u201cI\u2019m not saying we\u2019re sending fruit baskets and get-well cards,\u201d said Mr. Sullivan, a former Democratic legislator. \u201cBut we\u2019re trying to send a more welcoming message to the high earners as a group.\u201dNew York is now more closely monitoring wealthy taxpayers who have homes in New York but claim Florida as their tax residence. And New Jersey is collecting data on all of the taxpayers who make more than $1 million to forecast their tax payments more accurately.In California, 5,745 taxpayers earning $5 million or more generated more than $10 billion of income taxes in 2013, or about 19 percent of the state\u2019s total, according to state officials.\u201cAny state that depends on income taxes is going to get sick whenever one of these guys gets a cold,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said.Hence New Jersey\u2019s concern over Mr. Tepper\u2019s departure. Whatever the reasons for his move, he is leaving for Florida at an especially opportune time for tax savings. Many hedge fund managers have for years used a tax loophole that allowed them to defer taxes on fees they earned through the use of offshore funds. A 2008 federal tax rule, however, requires them to declare those fees by the end of 2017 and pay any necessary federal, state and local taxes.For some hedge fund managers, the amounts declared will probably be in the billions of dollars, accountants say. A spokesman for Mr. Tepper declined to comment on his overseas income. By moving to Florida, Mr. Tepper could avoid paying state income taxes on any such funds.\u201cIf he\u2019s bringing money back, you\u2019re talking about a big possible gain,\u201d Mr. Bramnick said. \u201cSo it\u2019s a good time to move to Florida.\u201dMr. Tepper regularly topped state wealth rankings as New Jersey\u2019s richest resident. He also has homes in Miami Beach and the Hamptons. In 2012 and 2013, he also topped Alpha\u2019s list of the highest-earning hedge fund managers, with estimated earnings of $2.2 billion in 2012 and $3.5 billion in 2013. His earnings fell to $400 million in 2014.Mr. Tepper never publicly announced his move to Florida. But it became public on April 5, when Mr. Haines, citing a Bloomberg report, mentioned Mr. Tepper\u2019s move in his remarks to the State Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee. In discussing the move, Mr. Haines said, \u201cEven a 1 percent forecasting error in the income tax estimate is worth $140 million.\u201dMr. Tepper\u2019s payments may have even been higher. If Mr. Tepper earned $3.5 billion in 2013, his state tax bill could have been over $300 million, according to New Jersey accountants. Granted, his actual payments were probably far lower because of deferred income, charitable deductions and other accounting treatments. Yet Mr. Haines\u2019s comments are believed to be the first time a state official has warned of a budget risk because of one resident\u2019s relocation.\u201cWe\u2019ve had states mention risks from high-income groups, but never from a single taxpayer,\u201d Ms. Rueben of the Tax Policy Center said.ROBERT FRANK is CNBC wealth editor and the author of \u201cRichistan.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "California Looms as Delegate Prize, and as One More Democratic Battlefield", "Date": "2016-05-24", "News": "Supported byCOMMERCE, Calif. \u2014 With two weeks before California\u2019s delegate-rich primary, Hillary Clinton stopped here on Tuesday and went on the attack against a rival. Just not the one she is currently running against.Mrs. Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont each courted voters in California, which has more delegates to divvy up than any other state, but their appearances showed how differently they are approaching the coming contest. Both have harshly criticized Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, but while Mrs. Clinton has made him her main focus, Mr. Sanders\u2019s hopes are centered on an upset victory in the primary.California, the nation\u2019s most populous state, would be a prize for Mr. Sanders, who is hoping for a marquee victory that he could showcase heading into the party\u2019s summer convention in Philadelphia. But however lustrous a victory might be, it would be largely symbolic given Mrs. Clinton\u2019s nearly insurmountable delegate lead, and she is spending her time building a case against Mr. Trump.At a rally in Los Angeles County, Mrs. Clinton continued to try out different attacks against the billionaire businessman, touching on subjects including his business acumen, his foreign policy views and even his reality-show catchphrase.\u201cYou can\u2019t say to the senator from some state, \u2018You\u2019re fired,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the way the government works.\u201d\u201cHe actually said he was hoping for the crash that caused hard-working families in California and across America to lose their homes, all because he thought he could take advantage of it to make some money for himself,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said.In a coordinated effort around the country, numerous elected officials who support Mrs. Clinton criticized Mr. Trump along the same lines, spreading that line of attack in battleground states.In a statement, Mr. Trump said he had \u201cmade a lot of money in down markets.\u201d\u201cFrankly, this is the kind of thinking our country needs, understanding how to get a good result out of a very bad and sad situation,\u201d he said. \u201cPoliticians have no idea how to do this \u2014 they don\u2019t have a clue.\u201dSpeaking at the rally, the mayor of Los Angeles, Eric Garcetti, showed the fine line that Mrs. Clinton and her allies are trying to walk while Mr. Sanders remains in the race.They do not want to alienate the senator\u2019s many supporters, and to that end, Mr. Garcetti told the crowd, \u201cI love all my Democrats \u2014 I love Bernie Sanders, I love the people who are supporting him.\u201dPolling averages have shown Mrs. Clinton with a consistent lead in the Democratic primary in California. Her lack of interest in further tangling with Mr. Sanders was apparent on Monday, when her campaign said it had declined an invitation from Fox News to participate in a debate before the state\u2019s primary.Undeterred, Mr. Sanders is camping out in California, vowing to hold rallies up and down the state and aiming to speak in front of 200,000 people. If Mrs. Clinton longs to put the primary battle behind her, he has been unrelenting.The senator asked on Tuesday for a recanvassing of the results from Kentucky, which voted last week. Mrs. Clinton prevailed there by about 1,900 votes, according to unofficial results, though she won only one more delegate than Mr. Sanders.\u201cWhat choice do Californians have in this election?\u201d Mr. Sanders asks in the ad. \u201cThe biggest one of all. You have the power to choose a new direction for the Democratic Party.\u201dAt a morning rally in Anaheim near Disneyland, Mr. Sanders repeated his support for a ballot initiative that would legalize marijuana in California.He also took aim at Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump and Disney, while railing against the campaign finance system and economic inequality.\u201cI\u2019m probably the only politician to come to Anaheim and say this,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cDisney pays its workers wages that are so low, that many of them are forced to live in motels because they can\u2019t afford a decent place to live. Meanwhile, Disney made a record-breaking profit of nearly $3 billion last quarter.\u201dMr. Sanders also cast California as pivotal to his campaign and said a win here could lead him to the presidency.\u201cIf we win in California, we are going to go marching into the Democratic convention with a lot of momentum,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cAnd if we go marching into the Democratic convention with a lot of momentum, we are going to march out with the Democratic nomination. And if we march out with the Democratic nomination, Donald Trump is toast.\u201dThomas Kaplan reported from Commerce, and Yamiche Alcindor from Anaheim, Calif.Advertisement"}

The police initially said Mr. Alleyne was 25.The police said that witnesses and Mr. Alleyne\u2019s own statements helped to identify him as one of several gunmen who had engaged in \u201cmutual combat\u201d with multiple firearms on Sept. 7, 2015, with one of the bullets striking and killing the Cuomo administration aide, Carey W. Gabay, according to a criminal complaint. Mr. Alleyne was arrested early on Thursday at the 71st Precinct station in Brooklyn and charged with murder, criminal possession of a firearm and reckless endangerment.Mr. Gabay\u2019s death resonated far beyond New York, with many seeing it as the senseless killing of a man whose life embodied a time-honored version of the American success story: a son of immigrants who grew up in public housing, earned an Ivy League education and dedicated himself to public service.Mr. Gabay\u2019s relatives reacted to the arrest by praising the police and the district attorney. \u201cOur family is still grieving Carey\u2019s loss but we are encouraged that the justice process is finally moving forward,\u201d the family said in a statement. \u201cWe remain thankful to all those who continue to support us during this difficult time.\u201dMr. Gabay\u2019s death prompted Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who delivered his eulogy, to reassert himself in the debate over gun violence.\u201cToday\u2019s arrest is a major step forward in the pursuit of justice for Carey\u2019s family and loved ones,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said in a statement on Friday. \u201cI commend the investigators and prosecutors for their tireless efforts to ensure those responsible for Carey\u2019s death are held fully accountable for their actions.\u201dThe police said they were still seeking two men and a woman in Mr. Gabay\u2019s killing.Mr. Alleyne was previously arrested on assault charges in April 2015. The police said he punched a 21-year-old woman in the face in October 2014, leaving her with a split lip. The disposition of that case could not be determined because it is sealed.\u201cAs I have said from the beginning, we are determined to get justice for Mr. Gabay and his family,\u201d Ken Thompson, the Brooklyn district attorney, said in a statement. \u201cAnd we will continue to press forward until we hold everyone responsible for his death accountable.\u201dMr. Alleyne has been living at the Lincoln Motor Inn, a motel in Queens that is used by New York City to house homeless families that can not be accommodated in city shelters. Living there with him were his 2-year-old daughter, Skyla, and her mother, Tasha Morgan, other residents said.Mr. Alleyne recently graduated from a phlebotomy program and had worked as a health aide, other shelter residents said. A woman who described herself as a close friend of Ms. Morgan\u2019s said Mr. Alleyne had started \u201cbugging out\u201d after seeing a grainy surveillance photo of one of the shooting suspects in Mr. Gabay\u2019s killing.The woman, who declined to provide her name because she feared retaliation by friends of Mr. Alleyne, said that after the shooting, Ms. Morgan showed signs of great stress, crying often and losing considerable weight. \u201cShe did a lot of crying about it, she didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on,\u201d the woman said, adding, \u201cShe lay beside him in bed at night like, \u2018I don\u2019t know who you are.\u2019\u201dHis parents were Jamaican immigrants, and he was raised in the Boston Secor Houses, a public-housing complex in the Bronx. He went to Harvard, where he studied government and was elected student government president in his senior year. After graduation, he attended Harvard Law School. After getting his law degree, he worked at several firms in New York, specializing in corporate finance law.He became an assistant counsel to Mr. Cuomo in 2011, and was appointed in January 2015 as first deputy counsel for the development corporation.\u201cThe violence has become so brutal, so aimless,\u201d he said, \u201cthat the most innocent can be struck down anytime, anywhere.\u201dNate Schweber contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Floating Arts Park for New York\u2019s Waterfront", "Date": "2016-05-06", "News": "Supported byEditorialFive years after Pier 54 had to be closed as it crumbled on the Hudson River waterfront, an ambitious plan is moving ahead to replace it with a 2.4-acre island park emphasizing the arts amid landscaped knolls and a public amphitheater.The park, renamed Pier 55, is to rest like a floating garden, its pathways undulating 15 feet to 62 feet above the water off West 13th Street. Reached by walkways, it will be secured by hundreds of pilings and the strength of the largest private donation to a public park in New York\u2019s history. A minimum of $113 million has been pledged for construction by Barry Diller, the media billionaire, who has also promised to underwrite 20 years of operating expenses.The result, if opponents\u2019 continuing legal challenges fail, would be an offshore cynosure for Manhattan\u2019s High Line district, which is already a booming tourist attraction heavily supported by the philanthropy of Mr. Diller and his wife, Diane von Furstenberg, the fashion designer.Critics have questioned whether the park will turn out to be a preserve for the affluent and the artistic. But trust officials and Mr. Diller say that 51 percent of park performances will be free or inexpensive enough for public participation. \u201cRich or poor or in-between, artistic or not,\u201d says Mr. Diller, \u201cnothing in our process and planning involve being exclusionary to anyone, and instead, in every demonstrable way, the opposite.\u201dOne persistent critic, the City Club of New York, asks on its website: \u201cShould private donors determine the future of public places?\u201d But noblesse oblige is no problem for budget-strapped officials like Mayor Bill de Blasio. \u201cI know a good deal when I see one,\u201d he said when the park, whose cost estimates run to $200 million, was announced in November 2014 with a total contribution of $35 million from the city and state.There is no denying that Pier 55 could become a popular destination in Lower Manhattan. Though its financing through a private gift isn\u2019t traditional, this project would advance the public\u2019s interest for more public park space along the Hudson while offering an adventurous venue for the arts.Advertisement"}

Now, Can He Make a Legacy?", "Date": "2016-05-22", "News": "Supported byCongressional candidates who speak of \u201cliberating the American underclass\u201d are flush with campaign donations. The likely Democratic presidential nominee has not only moved to the left on a range of issues, but now routinely rails against the influence of \u201cbig money.\u201dThere are plenty of signs that Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has left a mark on the political moment. But some liberal Democrats are beginning to worry that as Mr. Sanders continues his quest for the nomination, his chance to build a lasting legacy may be slipping away.Liberals who remember watching with fear and awe how the Christian Coalition rose from the ashes of Pat Robertson\u2019s 1988 campaign \u2014 using his mailing lists and leftover cash to build a grass-roots organization, publish conservative voter guides and promote candidates at every level \u2014 are asking when, or if, Mr. Sanders will help do the same for the left.Far from laying the foundation to transform his campaign into a movement, Mr. Sanders is wrapped up in the race itself, sharpening his attacks on Hillary Clinton and demanding she debate him before the June 7 primary in California. And many of his supporters are following his cue.\u201cHe has the greatest appeal of any progressive candidate we\u2019ve seen probably since Teddy Roosevelt, but that has to be converted into an on-the-ground machine that delivers,\u201d Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont who ran his own insurgent campaign for the Democratic nomination in 2004, said about Mr. Sanders. \u201cThere have to be candidates who are supported. There have to be issues that are put forward. There have to be opportunities to put pressure on legislators. That is not the same thing as a political campaign.\u201dThus far, Mr. Sanders has offered little support for a broader progressive movement, beyond using his email list to solicit money for a handful of congressional candidates, including Washington State\u2019s Pramila Jayapal, New York\u2019s Zephyr Teachout and Nevada\u2019s Lucy Flores.Even if he does try to redirect the energy behind his candidacy into a new liberal organization, the task may not be easy. His campaign has brought together disparate individuals and volunteer groups that might be inclined to go their separate ways after the primary. His regular diatribes against the influence of big money in politics could make it awkward, if not impossible, for him to raise money from wealthy liberals.An interactive delegate calculator that lets you simulate how the 2016 Democratic nomination process could unfold.Mr. Sanders, who declined to be interviewed, has offered few hints about his post-primary plans, saying that he remains focused on winning the nomination, even taking the fight to the party\u2019s convention in July.The group compared Mr. Sanders\u2019s situation to that of Barack Obama after he energized millions of supporters during his 2008 campaign. They said that Mr. Obama subsequently failed to capitalize on the opportunity to change \u201cthe distribution of power\u201d in America, and they warned that Mr. Sanders could wind up following in his footsteps if he does not move swiftly.Calling it a crossroads, the authors wrote, \u201cDoes Bernie Sanders and his campaign facilitate the growing voice of a new generation of activists?\u201d\u201cOr does he raise hell at a party convention and leave the remains of his organization to be picked over by groups on the left that, to date, have been mostly marginal to the broad majority of Americans and Sanders supporters alike?\u201dFew dispute that Mr. Sanders has already had an effect. His campaign has not only galvanized young voters, but also produced an invaluable email list, several million strong, of fervent activists and donors.Mr. Sanders has inspired candidates pushing policies like tuition-free public colleges and universal health care, initiatives that were once regarded as radical but that now have the support of many millions of Americans. Echoing the senator\u2019s fiery tone, Democrats from his wing of the party are regularly railing against billionaires, lamenting the disappearing middle class and demanding reforms to campaign finance laws.Mr. Sanders has also created a road map for other insurgent candidates by eschewing \u201csuper PACs\u201d and raising more than $212 million through small donations.\u201cThe Sanders movement brought Occupy Wall Street into Democratic Party presidential politics,\u201d said Jamie Raskin, a Maryland state senator running for Congress. \u201cHe occupied the Democratic primaries.\u201dMr. Raskin, 53, is among those who have already benefited, winning his Democratic primary against a field that included David Trone, a self-funded multimillionaire who owns the nation\u2019s largest independent wine retailer, and the former TV reporter Kathleen Matthews, whose husband, Chris, hosts \u201cHardball\u201d on MSNBC.So is Timothy Canova, 56, a law professor running an upstart campaign in Florida against Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee. Mr. Canova has raised more than $1 million \u2014 an average of $18.55 at a time \u2014 and has railed against his rival, saying she took money from large corporations and voted in favor of Wall Street banks.\u201cBernie Sanders could disappear from the scene and what he has helped ignite is going to keep going on,\u201d Mr. Canova said. Mr. Sanders has endorsed Mr. Canova and is using his prodigious email list to help him raise money.A new organization that emerged from the Sanders campaign would not necessarily require his leadership. Many of the economic issues at the heart of his campaign have been bubbling up for years, finding expression in the protests of the Occupy movement and in the speeches of Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts.Indeed, if the movement is going to endure beyond the primary, the responsibility for driving it forward may fall less on Mr. Sanders than on the next generation of progressives.\u201cWe need people running for school boards,\u201d said Representative Keith Ellison of Minnesota, who has endorsed Mr. Sanders. \u201cWe need people running for City Council. We need people running for state legislatures. We need people running for zoning boards, for park boards, to really take this sort of message that Bernie carried and carry it and lead it in their own local communities.\u201dRalph Reed, the longtime executive director of the Christian Coalition, once spoke in similar terms, talking about creating a \u201cfarm team\u201d of socially conservative candidates at every level of government.\u201cThe Republican Party is manifestly more hard-line than it would be had the Christian Coalition never existed,\u201d said the MSNBC host Rachel Maddow. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought would happen on the left with Obama in 2008, but it never did. It seems like Bernie has the same option, but he\u2019s also not working on it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The M.T.A.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s budget is subject to audits by the state comptroller, who would no doubt pay close attention to how the agency was using a significant source of new revenue. It is healthy to be skeptical of lawmakers making big promises but the fear that toll revenue will be abused should not be a reason not to act.As a Queens resident I fully agree that the M.T.A. and the city ought to improve transit in that borough and in Brooklyn. But transit service is actually quite good along the four bridges that will get new tolls under the plan. Transit service is weakest the further you get from Midtown. That is one reason the creators of Move NY propose to lower tolls on bridges like the Robert F. Kennedy (formerly Triborough) and the Verrazano-Narrows. In the areas served by these bridges many people have to drive because there is only limited bus or subway service. The good thing about the plan is that these are areas that will see an expansion in transit service paid for by the new tolls.Following the moneyVB: Good question. We will look into it.Despite this progress, achieving a state of good repair throughout the system has been elusive. The MTA has sought funding levels for its capital programs that have not materialized. The current five-year capital program, for example, invests 43 percent less ($13.8 billion) than the amount identified by the MTA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own needs assessments.Strollers, backpacks and bikesAt some point the NYC system is going to have to upgrade away from the cheap swipe cards and move to more of a distance based smart card (like the London Oyster card).VB: Certainly, some of these suggestions could help create more space but they will only help a little and it won\u2019t be easy to police them or practical to do so. Backpacks might be annoying but commuters need to carry things to school, college and work.I completely agree with you about the addition of glass barriers and sliding doors on platforms. As stations become more crowded, these barriers and doors will become an important safety device to protect commuters from falling onto the tracks. If combined with air conditioning, they will also make platforms much more comfortable during the summer.The M.T.A. is planning to replace its current fare card, which is truly outdated.

Trump resigned shortly after the candidate became the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, a fresh blow to a group whose other senior strategist was convicted on Thursday of trying to hide payments made to an Iowa politician in an effort to effectively buy his endorsement. The resignation of Amy Kremer, the former Tea Party activist, came as the group, Great America PAC, has tried to ramp up for the general election in the hopes of receiving an overt blessing from Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. The group announced that the veteran Republican consultant Ed Rollins would become its new strategist this week, and, in a conference call, used Ben Carson, the former Republican presidential candidate, as a signal to prospective donors that they should participate in the group\u2019s activities. But Ms. Kremer,  who along with the businessman William Doddridge was an early leader of the group \u2014 originally called TrumPAC \u2014 quit because numerous decisions were made without her involvement. And the future of the group\u2019s structure was not yet clear after Jesse Benton,  a former adviser to Representative Ron Paul and his son, Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, was brought on board as a senior adviser. Mr. Benton was convicted on Thursday in Iowa on federal charges of public corruption related to efforts to woo a state senator to endorse the senior Mr. Paul for president in 2012. In a statement, Ms. Kremer confirmed that she had left. \u201cAs of May 4, I\u2019m no longer at Great America PAC,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m working on an amazing new project that I will announce soon.\u201d In her resignation email to Eric Beach, who oversees the finance operation, Ms. Kremer wrote, \u201cThis isn\u2019t working out as we agreed when you asked me to join you, so I\u2019m resigning effective immediately.  I hate for it to end this way, but I cannot allow my name to continued to be used when there is too much going on without my knowledge.\u201d In a statement, Mr. Beach said, \u201cWe think the world of Amy Kremer and she remains a good friend. We are sorry to see her move on, but we know she will continue to do tremendous work supporting limited government principles.\u201d He declined to address Ms. Kremer\u2019s complaint about activities taking place without her knowledge. A person involved in the super PAC and briefed on Ms. Kremer\u2019s issues said that she was never apprised when Mr. Benton was brought on board. Decisions were made by Mr. Beach, Mr. Benton and the group\u2019s attorney, Dan Backer, without her knowledge, she said. Her name went out on email solicitations that she was never shown, the person said, including last week when Mr. Trump became the party\u2019s presumptive nominee. And Mr. Benton produced a video aimed at softening Mr. Trump\u2019s image without seeking her input, the person said. The group has drawn scrutiny for its unusual ad-buying efforts, purchasing television time through DirectTV and the Dish network, instead of by using traditional methods. Some of their ads urged viewers to call a telephone number to vote on who should be Mr. Trump\u2019s vice presidential running mate, a technique that is often used to harvest names for future small-dollar fund-raising solicitations.

{"Headline": "Saudi King Shakes Up Government as Economic Plan Moves Forward", "Date": "2016-05-07", "News": "Supported byRIYADH, Saudi Arabia \u2014 Troubled by low oil prices and unsettled by a hostile landscape in the Middle East heightened by a growing rivalry with Iran, Saudi Arabia is moving to chart an ambitious new direction for the kingdom.In a series of sweeping royal decrees announced Saturday, King Salman replaced top ministers and restructured government bodies, the first concrete steps in a bold plan to reduce the country\u2019s heavy dependence on oil, diversify its economy and improve its citizens\u2019 quality of life.The decrees, which included a restructuring of the oil ministry and the replacement of its longtime minister, Ali al-Naimi, set in motion a plan that was announced last month to great fanfare by the king\u2019s son Mohammed bin Salman, the deputy crown prince. Prince Mohammed has emerged over the last year as a significant influence in Saudi Arabia, overseeing economic and oil policy and heading the Defense Ministry, despite being only about 30.The moves announced Saturday amount to a significant restructuring of the government at a difficult time for the kingdom. The regional order over which Saudi Arabia has long prevailed is in tatters, with wars raging in Iraq, Syria and Yemen, and with its regional nemesis, Iran, extending its influence. Those stresses come as low oil prices have shaken the Saudi economy, causing the government to run huge budget deficits and leaving government contractors falling behind in paying salaries.\u201cWhat you are seeing in Saudi Arabia is a genuine need for reform that is felt at the very top of the ruling establishment,\u201d said Adeel Malik, the Globe fellow in the economies of Muslim societies at Oxford University. \u201cYou can clearly see that there is fire under the seats of the rulers.\u201dThe rise of Prince Mohammed has effectively overturned decades of cautious Saudi policy traditionally overseen by senior princes, many of whom have found themselves sidelined by a man who is decades younger. While some grumble privately, Prince Mohammed has forged ahead with a clear mandate from King Salman, who also put him second in line to the throne, after Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, the interior minister.Prince Mohammed bin Salman was the driving force behind the country\u2019s new development plan, Saudi Vision 2030, which many Saudis have lauded as a powerful statement of purpose from a royal family that has often failed to communicate its plans or do much to prepare for the future. But analysts and economists have questioned the ability of Saudi Arabia\u2019s bloated bureaucracy and unproductive native work force to meet the plan\u2019s aggressive targets.Many of the changes announced Saturday were aimed at restructuring the government so it would work toward the plan\u2019s goals.These included the replacement of the country\u2019s long-serving oil minister, Mr. Naimi, who is 80 and had held the position since 1995. Mr. Naimi\u2019s oversight of oil policy for the kingdom, the world\u2019s largest oil exporter, had made him a towering figure whose mere utterances were closely scrutinized by traders seeking to divine the country\u2019s thinking.The decline in oil prices, which began in mid-2014, led Mr. Naimi to champion the Saudi strategy of maintaining production levels to preserve market share and undermine higher-cost producers like the United States. While the approach has largely worked, it has also contributed to an oil glut that has kept prices low, analysts say.Mr. Naimi has long been essential to the royal family\u2019s policy of using the country\u2019s oil wealth to finance government social policy \u2014 a tradition Prince Mohammed wants to move away from through widespread privatization.Although Mr. Naimi had long expressed a wish to retire, the suddenness of his exit struck some foreign analysts as a sign that Prince Mohammed was flexing his muscles.\u201cTo essentially drop him in a cabinet reshuffle rather than celebrate his retirement was pretty rude, even by Saudi standards,\u201d said David L. Goldwyn, who was a senior energy official in the State Department during the first Obama administration. \u201cThe way he left is a sign of Mohammed bin Salman making clear that he is directing the appointment of important positions.\u201dMr. Naimi was named an adviser to the royal court and was replaced by a younger official, Khalid al-Falih, who had previously run the Health Ministry and served as the chairman of Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil company.Some energy experts viewed the appointment of Mr. Falih as a signal to both the Saudi power structure and international oil markets that Prince Mohammed was pushing forward with plans to transform Saudi Aramco into an energy conglomerate that could invest in projects with less interference from the royal family.In the announcement on Saturday, the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources was renamed the Ministry of Energy, Industry and Natural Resources, a semantic shift meant to indicate the country\u2019s commitment to diversifying away from oil.Most energy experts said they did not see Mr. Naimi\u2019s departure as a sign that oil policy would soon change, especially with prices gradually rising and Saudi leaders refusing to endorse production limits unless Iran does as well.\u201cThe Saudis sneeze and the oil market catches a cold, but I think it\u2019s going to turn out not to mean much,\u201d said Michael Lynch, the president of the consultancy Strategic Energy and Economic Research, who has been an adviser to OPEC. \u201cBy picking Khalid al-Falih, it doesn\u2019t seem like this means a radical change.\u201dOther decrees announced on Saturday changed the head of the central bank, renamed and combined ministries, and put new officials in charge of water, commerce, social affairs, health and transport.\u201cAll these measures were ultimately aimed at making government more efficient and more accountable, reducing red tape,\u201d said Fahad Nazer, a senior political analyst at JTG Inc., a consulting firm based in Vienna, Va. \u201cThey are clearly meant to help in terms of implementing the vision going forward.\u201dNone of the decrees addressed the country\u2019s political structure, and missing from Prince Mohammed\u2019s vision were any moves toward allowing Saudis a role in choosing their rulers. None of the newly appointed officials were women.Other changes were in line with goals articulated in the new vision.The Ministry of Hajj, an important body in a country that derives much of its international standing from its management of Islam\u2019s holiest sites, was changed to the Ministry of Hajj and Umra. While the Hajj pilgrimage happens once a year, the Umra pilgrimage can be done year round, and Prince Mohammed has spoken of raising the number of Umra visitors as a source of unexploited income. The body\u2019s minister was also replaced.Many among Saudi Arabia\u2019s large population of young people \u2014 more than two-thirds of the country\u2019s 20 million citizens are under 30 \u2014 speculated on social media, often with sarcasm, about the duties of the newly created General Authority for Entertainment, a surprising body in a hyperconservative country where public movie theaters are banned and many people flee abroad for vacations and weekends.Prince Mohammed has spoken about the importance of providing Saudis with more ways to enjoy life in their country, although it remains to be seen what new options will be provided under the new plan.Follow Ben Hubbard on Twitter @NYTBen.Follow Ben Hubbard on Twitter @NYTBen.Clifford Krauss reported from Houston.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Inquiry Highlights Terry McAuliffe\u2019s Ties to Chinese Company", "Date": "2016-05-24", "News": "Supported byFour years ago, one of China\u2019s largest agricultural importers sent representatives to the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., hoping that meetings with elite party officials might yield business opportunities. The company, the Dandong Port Group, was particularly focused on the governors in attendance, according to an interview with Dandong\u2019s general counsel broadcast by Chinese state television.The meetings, arranged by a former South Carolina governor, marked a period of expansion in the United States for Dandong and its affiliated companies, involving negotiations with officials in Washington, Arkansas, South Carolina and Virginia. But now, the company\u2019s widening influence is coming under scrutiny by federal prosecutors, who are examining the relationship between Dandong\u2019s wealthy and connected chairman, Wang Wenliang, and Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia, a Democrat who was elected in 2013.A federal law enforcement official said the inquiry included $120,000 in contributions that a New Jersey construction firm controlled by Mr. Wang made to Mr. McAuliffe\u2019s 2013 campaign and inaugural committee. That official and a second law enforcement official, both of whom asked for anonymity to discuss the matter, said it was a preliminary inquiry of Mr. McAuliffe\u2019s campaign donations, and they provided no detail about the nature and scope of any potential violations being scrutinized.Though Mr. Wang is a Chinese citizen, he is also a legal permanent resident of the United States, according to a spokeswoman for him, which entitles him to make campaign contributions.Representatives for Mr. McAuliffe and Mr. Wang said they had not been contacted by the Justice Department or the F.B.I. A spokesman for the Clinton Foundation also said it had not been contacted by law enforcement officials.Speaking to reporters in Virginia on Tuesday, Mr. McAuliffe said he was shocked by reports of an inquiry. He had played no role in soliciting Mr. Wang\u2019s pledge to the Clinton Foundation and said the contributions to his campaign from by Mr. Wang\u2019s company were legitimate.\u201cI\u2019m very confident this gentleman had been fully vetted,\u201d Mr. McAuliffe said of Mr. Wang.But the federal inquiry throws a cloud over Mr. McAuliffe at a critical time: He is a top fund-raiser for Hillary Clinton, a close confidant of her and her husband, and the governor of a swing state critical to her chances of becoming president. On Sunday, Mr. McAuliffe headlined a $5,000-a-head Virginia fund-raising event for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.The review said department officials had created a perception of \u201cspecial consideration\u201d for Mr. McAuliffe and other prominent Democrats, but found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing.Mr. Wang is a delegate to China\u2019s legislative house, the National People\u2019s Congress. His companies run ports, import agricultural products and construct Chinese embassies around the world. His extensive business empire is based in Dandong, a port city that borders North Korea.After starting his career as a municipal adviser to the Dandong government on planning and economics issues, he amassed a fortune, partly by securing construction contracts to work on Chinese embassies and consular offices around the globe, including the Chinese Embassy in Washington.From 2012 to the end of last year, according to federal records, Mr. Wang\u2019s companies paid $1.5 million to McGuireWoods Consulting to lobby on trade and visa issues. Dandong\u2019s lobbyists included Jim Hodges, the former South Carolina governor. In 2012, Mr. Hodges arranged meetings with governors for Mark T. Fung, who was Dandong\u2019s general counsel.Mr. Wang also met with Mr. McAuliffe before he ran for governor, at a 2012 dinner hosted by Mr. Hodges. Mr. McAuliffe was an American businessman investing in China; Mr. Wang was a Chinese executive whose firms did business in Virginia. The next year, when Mr. McAuliffe ran for governor, one of Mr. Wang\u2019s companies, West Legend, contributed to his campaign. (Corporate contributions are permitted in Virginia.)But records and interviews reveal that Mr. Wang\u2019s companies have had numerous reasons to seek the favor of United States government officials. Among Mr. Wang\u2019s ventures are importing and crushing soybeans. In late 2012, his company entered negotiations to buy a privately owned port on the Mississippi River in Arkansas. The negotiations led to a review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which includes representatives of the departments of State, Commerce and Homeland Security.A letter from Rilin, one of Mr. Wang\u2019s companies, to the American Embassy in Beijing, obtained by The New York Times, says that company representatives met with then-Gov. Mike Beebe of Arkansas while negotiating that deal, which was worth $27 million. Reached on Tuesday, Mr. Beebe said he did not remember ever having met with the company.The foreign investment committee approved the deal in April 2013, but it ultimately fell through. Mr. Wang\u2019s company complained that a delegation of Chinese nationals the company wanted to review the port had been denied visas.About that same time, McGuireWoods contacted the American Embassy to discuss \u201cvisa issues.\u201dReached on Tuesday, Mr. Locke, who is a lawyer in Seattle, said that he remembered visiting Dandong, but added that there was no such thing as a group visa for a company.In a statement, a spokeswoman for Mr. Wang said: \u201cWest Legend does business in Virginia and supports Gov. McAuliffe\u2019s jobs-creation agenda. Its political contributions comply with all federal and state laws.\u201dEric Lichtblau and Kitty Bennett contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": " PAID FOR AND POSTED BY As Jai Shekhawat knows well, taking a business from small to scale can be a herculean task. When the founder of Fieldglass, a Chicago-based company that helps businesses manage their contract work force, started in 1999, he was the only employee. By the time he sold his business to SAP for $1 billion in 2014, he had about 500 staffers and was making millions. How did he do it? It wasn\u2019t by focusing solely on marketing or product development or another single division. It was done by managing and growing all parts of his budding operation. \u201cThere are a number of different problems and issues that have to be addressed when scaling,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd you have to get in the mindset that you\u2019re running a marathon rather than a sprint.\u201dProperly scaling requires companies to take a multidisciplinary approach to growth. In Shekhawat\u2019s case, that meant finding the right employees, doing robust research and development, securing financing from investors and much more. Many business owners think solving one problematic issue will set them up for success, but it\u2019s far more complicated than that.The only way to go from small to scale is to manage all the different functions of a business in concert, says Ben Jones, a professor of entrepreneurship and strategy, and the faculty director of the Kellogg Innovation and Entrepreneurship Initiative. \u201cIt\u2019s operations, it\u2019s marketing, it\u2019s finance and it\u2019s culture,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the whole thing.\u201dScott Dorsey, a Kellogg alum, understands the importance of the big picture. It\u2019s unlikely his business would have grown from a three-person founding team to a multi-billion-dollar company if he let one department expand faster than the others. As co-founder and former CEO of Indianapolis-based ExactTarget, a digital marketing and analytics software company, Dorsey built a very collaborative leadership team and company culture to make sure every part of his business grew in tandem.In 2009, he and his leadership team created the company\u2019s Accelerate 2013 plan, which detailed what it would take to become the dominant market leader in their space. \u201cIt was a very prescriptive four-year plan on how we were going to scale the business and what we were going to accomplish,\u201d he says. By starting with the end in mind, the plan empowered leaders and workers throughout the business to make the near-term investments needed to produce long-term results.Even with his precise planning, there were times when one part of the business grew faster than another. \u201cYou always have a little disharmony, in that some functions are leading and pulling the rest of the company along,\u201d says Dorsey. Instead of slowing things down, though, he found ways to speed things up in the other departments.Recruiting and strategic human resources were two areas essential to scaling the company. \u201cWe had to work really hard to build the recruiting engine to be able to support our ambitious growth plans, while still retaining a high bar for talent and sharp focus on cultural fit.\u201d Beyond human resources, his company identified three core levers to growth \u2014 moving into the enterprise market, expanding internationally and building and acquiring new digital marketing products \u2014 and he had to make sure that all of those areas were growing together. \u201cAll the functions had to work in lockstep,\u201d he says.It felt like a juggling act at times, he says, but it paid off. Dorsey took ExactTarget public on the New York Stock Exchange in March 2012 and sold his business to Salesforce in June 2013 for $2.5 billion.While everything has to grow together, there are some common problems that companies need to be mindful of. One issue that Jones has witnessed is the disconnect between marketing and operations. Often times, a marketing department will start promising something without knowing whether or not operations can deliver. It\u2019s the same thing with research and development. R&D is often busy working on one thing, while the marketing department is talking up something else. \u201cWhat you end up doing is overpromising and then delivering badly,\u201d he says.Companies also want to be everything to everyone, and that can result in the company moving in a number of different directions, says Gad Allon, a professor of managerial economics, decision science and operations management at Kellogg. Business owners need to think more about what they really want to be and then focus the entire organization on what they decide that they can do best. That goes with products, but it also works with culture, too. Online shoe company Zappos, for instance, prides itself on its strong customer service. \u201cThat\u2019s non-negotiable for them,\u201d says Allon.One way to become more multidisciplinary is to embrace delegation, says Mike Mazzeo, an associate professor in the department of strategy at Kellogg. CEOs often have a hard time letting go of certain functions, he says, especially if they started the business and are used to doing everything themselves. However, executives need to let others take responsibility for certain aspects of the business and then put the right incentives in place, such as who gets a raise when, to help each division grow.It also helps to have processes in place that people across the company can follow, says Mazzeo. That might be for individual jobs \u2014 if one person leaves, can another person quickly take over? \u2014 or it could be for business-wide initiatives such as how to handle customers.As a company is scaling up, executives who take a multidisciplinary approach will likely be asking themselves a lot of different, but still-related questions, says Jones. \u201cHow do I actually expand my capacity to deliver my products or services? How do I maintain quality? How do I find new customers? How do I extend the brand? How do I finance any kind of expansion? What\u2019s the right way to do that?\u201d he says.Unfortunately, there\u2019s no checklist that will answer all of these questions for business owners and company CEOs. However, people can learn how to think in a more holistic way. Last year, Kellogg started offering a \u201cgrowth and scaling pathway\u201d for current or aspiring entrepreneurs, family business owners, C-Suite executives and private equity employees on how to expand. It teaches this multidisciplinary approach to growth by offering courses, such as \u201cstrategies for growth\u201d and \u201cscaling operations,\u201d that can be applied to all areas of a business.While the program is new, Shekhawat and Dorsey each learned about growth when they went to the school in the 1990s and both say their studies are a big reason why they\u2019ve been as successful as they have. Lisa Earnhardt, president and CEO of Intersect ENT, a rapidly expanding, public medical device company, also graduated from Kellogg and says that the school taught her the importance of deep customer understanding. \u201cCustomer focus is in the DNA of Kellogg alums,\u201d she says. \u201cAt Intersect ENT, we know that when we do what\u2019s right for the patient and the physician, growth will follow.\u201dBy learning more about what it takes to become a big business, and then growing all parts of the company together, almost anyone can take their company to another level, says Shekhawat.

Trump, turning his attention to the general election, has begun quietly reaching out to key elements of the Republican establishment as he seeks to unite the party behind his candidacy before his anticipated battle against Hillary Clinton.Mr. Trump, who is expected to run on a nonideological platform of his own design, is trying to reassure party officials that he understands there are certain norms even he needs to follow as the Republican nominee, and that he is capable of producing an organization and infrastructure that can sustain a costly general election campaign.His team, already working to transform a lean operation into a national presidential campaign apparatus, has been reaching out to members of Congress and Washington think tanks; strategizing on how best to take on Mrs. Clinton and woo supporters of her primary opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont; and planning to head to Cleveland next week to help direct the party\u2019s July convention, according to aides.The campaign has also begun thinking about what a convention with Mr. Trump, a circus master and media savant, as the prime-time act will look like.\u201cThe site has been chosen and the arena is fine, but I\u2019d want to have \u2014 you know, the last Republican convention was extraordinarily boring,\u201d Mr. Trump said in one of two phone interviews Wednesday. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to come up with some things that will make it interesting and informative, but also smart and different.\u201dMr. Trump, a former reality television host, added that he would look to organizations like IMG, a global talent management company, to help with the production.To improve its outreach to the Republican political and policy establishment, the Trump campaign recently opened an office near the nation\u2019s capital, in the Old Town neighborhood of Alexandria, Va. But it is unclear whether the core of the campaign will be based in the Washington area or in New York, where Mr. Trump returns almost every night.Soon, the campaign plans to put a transition team in place to prepare for a Trump administration, and on Thursday announced Steve Mnuchin, the head of a private investment firm, as the team\u2019s national finance chairman.As the presumptive nominee, Mr. Trump will begin raising money for the Republican Party and various congressional committees, his campaign said. He has largely self-funded his campaign so far \u2014 a fact he often promotes as evidence that he is not beholden to special interests \u2014 but has signaled he will raise money for his general election effort.He also did not rule out the possibility of accepting public matching funds, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know enough about it,\u201d but he added that he would receive a briefing on the topic on Thursday.On Tuesday, Ed Rollins, once Ronald Reagan\u2019s campaign manager, joined Great America PAC, a \u201csuper PAC\u201d supporting Mr. Trump, as a chairman. On a call with prospective supporters of the group on Wednesday, Mr. Rollins said its goal would not be to spend large amounts on television ads, but instead to try to plug holes for the campaign. \u201cI think what we want to do is really examine what are the pieces that are missing,\u201d he said.Since last month, Mr. Trump\u2019s congressional team has held meetings on Capitol Hill every Thursday morning when Congress is in session. It said that attendance at the meetings, which often feature a guest speaker from the Trump campaign, had swelled after the recent string of Trump victories, and that it would announce more than half a dozen endorsements in the coming weeks.Mr. Trump\u2019s fund-raising efforts could help court lawmakers.\u201cDollars matter a lot in these tough races, so to the extent that Mr. Trump is helping us raise money, money that will help us protect our majority, he\u2019s going to win a lot of friends in Congress,\u201d said Representative Chris Collins of New York, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s congressional chairmen. \u201cThat\u2019s going to soothe a lot of folks and show he does care about the House maintaining its majority.\u201dThe campaign has begun reaching out to Washington consultants and operatives from rival campaigns, as well as meeting quietly with Republican leaders in swing states where it believes Mr. Trump can win in November.\u201cI\u2019ve seen it when the campaign comes in and says: \u2018This is the way we\u2019re going to run the state, whether you like it or not. We know more about your state than you do,\u2019\u201d Mr. Manafort said in an interview. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not an effective way to do it.\u201dBut recruiting supporters in the Washington establishment has been something of a challenge.\u201cIt\u2019s still very much an insurgency campaign, and there\u2019s still a high degree of reluctance in D.C. to get on board with the campaign, even though a lot of people have made the jump or are softening their positions,\u201d said Joe Kasper, chief of staff to Representative Duncan Hunter of California, a chairman of Mr. Trump\u2019s congressional outreach effort.The campaign is also refining its messaging for the general election, with Mr. Trump preparing lines of attack against Mrs. Clinton \u2014 including, possibly, continued assaults on her gender \u2014 and discussing how he can woo supporters of Mr. Sanders, who his team hopes will be receptive to his anti-Washington message of economic populism.In an interview, Mr. Trump suggested that Mrs. Clinton had \u201cbad judgment\u201d and \u201ca lot of baggage\u201d that could harm her. \u201cThe emails are bad judgment,\u201d he said. \u201cBenghazi was bad judgment. Libya was bad judgment. Whitewater was bad judgment.\u201dThe campaign also plans to bring on additional staff to help with the news media, and it is seeking a point person for surrogates, who would recruit and book Trump supporters to speak on television and hone their talking points.Ultimately, however, Mr. Trump said he did not plan to make wholesale changes to his approach after his primary victories. \u201cWhen you win the pennant and you\u2019re in the World Series and you\u2019re three games up, you don\u2019t want to start changing your lineup,\u201d he said.Jeremy W.

{"Headline": "Sheldon Adelson Is Poised to Give Donald Trump a Donation Boost", "Date": "2016-05-13", "News": "Supported byThe casino magnate Sheldon G. Adelson told Donald J. Trump in a private meeting last week that he was willing to contribute more to help elect him than he has to any previous campaign, a sum that could exceed $100 million, according to two Republicans with direct knowledge of Mr. Adelson\u2019s commitment.As significant, Mr. Adelson, a billionaire based in Las Vegas, has decided that he will significantly scale back his giving to congressional Republicans and direct most of his contributions to groups dedicated to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. The two Republicans familiar with Mr. Adelson\u2019s plans spoke anonymously because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.Mr. Adelson\u2019s pledge to Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, comes at an opportune time. Mr. Trump has relied on a mix of his own wealth and small-dollar contributions to finance his primary effort and lacks the sort of major donor network needed to sustain him in the general election. Mr. Trump has said that he may need $1 billion for the campaign but has only recently begun scheduling fund-raisers and hiring finance staff members. Many of the Republican Party\u2019s wealthiest contributors, including the billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch, have indicated they are unlikely to give to his candidacy.What remains unclear is how Mr. Adelson plans to contribute his money to Mr. Trump. He will give the maximum allowed to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and the Republican National Committee, but to spend the amount he contemplates would require donating through a \u201csuper PAC,\u201d able to accept unlimited donations.According to the Republicans familiar with Mr. Adelson\u2019s planning, he and his advisers are still uncertain about which super PAC to use as their vehicle for the bulk of the contributions. They are wary of some of the current groups that purportedly exist to help Mr. Trump, who has been clear that he is uneasy with outside entities promoting his candidacy. At rallies, he has consistently criticized opponents who relied on super PACS, saying they were being bought by wealthy donors.Mr. Adelson, 82, the chief executive of Las Vegas Sands, is among the world\u2019s wealthiest individuals and has given hundreds of millions of dollars to Republican candidates and causes over the years. In 2012, he contributed at least $98 million to Republican efforts, according to a study by ProPublica. But that money went to 34 separate campaigns and groups.Donald J. Trump is set to be the Republican standard-bearer, but when it comes to some of his policies, he is out of sync with many Republican leaders in Congress.Mr. Adelson is frustrated by congressional gridlock and believes the only way to affect the country\u2019s political system is to ensure a Republican president is elected, say the Republicans familiar with his thinking.While he may help some local or gubernatorial candidates, he is not planning to give much to congressional candidates or super PACs dedicated to keeping Republican control of the House and Senate, a substantial blow given the largess he has showered on them in recent elections.Mr. Adelson and his wife, Miriam, met with Mr. Trump and his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, at the St. Regis Hotel in Midtown Manhattan while Mr. Adelson was in town for a gala dinner to benefit the World Values Network, an organization dedicated to disseminating Jewish values in politics, culture and media. The two moguls, who do not know each other well, had met earlier in the campaign.But their conversation last week marked the first time they had talked in person since Mr. Trump effectively won the nomination this month.Mr. Trump assured the Adelsons that he was dedicated to protecting Israel\u2019s security, an issue about which the couple are passionate.But Mr. Adelson was plainly not bothered \u2014 or he at least forgave Mr. Trump. He told reporters last week he would get behind Mr. Trump and wrote an op-ed article in Friday\u2019s Washington Post extolling his fellow casino owner.\u201cHe is a candidate with actual CEO experience, shaped and molded by the commitment and risk of his own money rather than the public\u2019s,\u201d Mr. Adelson wrote, adding that Mr. Trump \u201chas created a movement in this country that cannot be denied.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Young Analysts Press the Case for Innovation, and Tolerance, in Pursuing a Post-Carbon Energy Menu", "Date": "2016-05-06", "News": "Sivaram just wrote a post on the Council on Foreign Relations\u2019s \u201cEnergy, Security, and Climate\u201d blog responding to and exploring the reactions to the essay. His piece is reposted below with permission, followed by some overarching thoughts from me.One of the best arguments I\u2019ve read for why the U.S. should invest in an energy revolution: https://t.co/58978QoWeY https://t.co/xJV5Dm8hSp\u201cFighting climate change successfully will certainly require sensible government policies to level the economic playing field between clean and dirty energy, such as putting a price on carbon dioxide emissions. But it will also require policies that encourage investment in new clean energy technology, which even a level playing field may not generate on its own.\u201d\u2013 We have made a factual error by asserting, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf the world is to avoid climate calamity, it needs to reduce its carbon emissions by 80 percent by the middle of this century\u00e2\u0080\u0094a target that is simply out of reach with existing technology.\u201d\u2013 It is impossible to achieve deep reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by mid-century using \u00e2\u0080\u009cmysterious nonexistent technology.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u2013 Existing clean energy technologies have fallen in cost and will continue to do so as a function of their deployment, which implies that they are sufficient to achieve ambitious climate goals.Concretely, in our essay we propose several clean energy technologies that the world needs to achieve deep decarbonization. We write:\u201cNew reactor designs could make nuclear meltdowns physically impossible, and nanoengineered membranes could block carbon emissions in fossil-fueled power plants. Solar coatings as cheap as wallpaper could enable buildings to generate more power than they consume. And advanced storage technologies\u00e2\u0080\u0094from energy-dense batteries to catalysts that harness sunlight to split water and create hydrogen fuel\u00e2\u0080\u0094could stabilize grids and power vehicles. The wish list goes on: new ways to tap previously inaccessible reservoirs of geothermal energy, biofuels that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t compete with food crops, and ultra-efficient equipment to heat and cool buildings. Every one of those advances is possible, but most need a fundamental breakthrough in the lab or a first-of-its-kind demonstration project in the field.\u201dNone of these technologies are mysterious or non-existent, but they will require resources and time to achieve commercial entry and displace fossil fuels. Dr. Romm argues that the pace of previous energy transitions and the colossal amounts of capital required for such a transition preclude next-generation technologies from playing a major role before 2050.\u201cIf we have a viable pathway at building nuclear power in smaller bites, the whole financing structure can change and make it much more affordable\u00e2\u0080\u00a6If we can demonstrate let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s say the first modular reactor in the early part of the next decade, then what we hope is it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part of the planning process in the middle of the next decade for our utilities. Around 2030 the 60-year lifetime of existing reactors will start to kick in, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a time period when utility commitments to a new round of nuclear will be especially important\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 If a couple of [the more than 50 privately funded companies developing advanced nuclear technologies] make it it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a big deal.\u201dPartnering Innovation with DeploymentDr. Romm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s third contention is actually one on which we share substantial common ground. We should celebrate the fall in the costs of several clean energy technologies as a function of their cumulative production (the \u00e2\u0080\u009cexperience\u00e2\u0080\u009d effect). But I do disagree with Dr. Romm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s extrapolation that existing technologies will suffice to meet the climate challenge. Still, I think that their deployment plays an important role in paving the way for superior technologies to succeed them.Deployment and innovation go hand in hand. Sometimes, policies that encourage deployment can discourage innovation. I contend, for example, that some solar deployment policies create ring-fenced markets in which mature technologies can lock out emerging competitors through incumbency advantages. But in most cases, public and private resources for deployment do not come at the expense of resources for innovation. And by holistically designing policies that support both emerging technologies as well as mature ones, as we argue in our essay, policymakers can most cost-effectively confront climate change. We assert that a price on carbon, in conjunction with increased support for research, development, and demonstration of innovative clean energy technologies, can best coordinate innovation with deployment.I hope this resonates with anyone committed to the cause of combating climate change. I invite Dr. Romm and others who might disagree with me to engage in civil discourse\u00e2\u0080\u0094we have a lot to learn from each other. And if we find we have irreconcilable differences, I will be more than happy to respectfully agree to\u00c2\u00a0disagree.Keep it up, Varun and Teryn.In today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s political world of binary debates, is there a way to get traction simultaneously on both deployment of today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clean tech where it makes the most sense and on greatly boosting spending on fundamental science related to energy systems?\nI\u2019ve explained my thinking in two slides that build on an important 2003 study of ecosystem resilience. Have a look here:Response Diversity Builds Resilience in Ecosystems \u2013 Society, Too?In working to boost energy access while limiting global warming, #ResponseDiversity is vital. But is it tolerable? https://t.co/cbC5MiNmQQI\u2019m exploring this idea with a variety of social scientists. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a testable hypothesis.

{"Headline": "Fraud Charges Mar a Plan to Aid a Struggling Vermont Region", "Date": "2016-05-10", "News": "Supported byNEWPORT, Vt. \u2014 Jo-Ann Brooks grimaced as she looked out the window of her jewelry store in this tiny town in northern Vermont, near the Canadian border. Across Main Street, an entire block of shops and apartments was razed more than a year ago in the expectation of a new \u201crenaissance\u201d development that has yet to materialize. In its place is a gaping hole, with old concrete cellars.\u201cWe call it Little Beirut,\u201d Ms. Brooks said. \u201cIt looks like it was bombed.\u201dThe hole is a visual monument to the failed plans of two ambitious businessmen who vowed to revitalize this struggling region, known as the Northeast Kingdom. With an $850 million dream, they promised the biggest economic development in Vermont history. They planned to finance it through a federal program that allows wealthy foreign citizens to invest $500,000 in projects in distressed areas in return for green cards, leading to permanent residency in the United States.Instead, the two have been accused of perpetrating the biggest fraud in Vermont history \u2014 as well as in the history of that federal visa program, known as EB-5.The allegations against Mr. Stenger particularly stung people here because they had known him for decades as a friend and civic-minded neighbor. He was not accused of siphoning money for his personal use, but the S.E.C. said he \u201cextremely recklessly ceded control of investor funds to Quiros\u201d and \u201cdid almost nothing to manage investor money, even when confronted with red flags of Quiros\u2019 misuse.\u201dIn an email interview, Mr. Stenger said he could not discuss the specific allegations against him. But in his most extensive comments yet on the situation, he said he knew he had let people down.\u201cBetrayal is a strong term, and I understand the disappointment because I\u2019m terribly disappointed not to be able to finish the work I started,\u201d he said. Still, he said, the projects have generated 6,500 direct and indirect jobs of the 10,000 he promised for rural Orleans County, the poorest in the state. He estimated that 650 of nearly 800 investors already have or would get their green cards.\u201cI\u2019m terribly upset that some of these folks could be at risk,\u201d he said, adding that he was seeking to make them financially whole.He said his \u201cbiggest heartbreak\u201d was the failure to build the biotech firm, called AnC Bio, which the S.E.C. said was \u201cnearly a complete fraud.\u201dMr. Leahy, a longtime Stenger backer, has been one of the biggest supporters of the EB-5 program, seeing it as an important tool for economic development. Indeed, it is working successfully in other projects in Vermont. But because of fraud in the program elsewhere, he was already pushing for an overhaul. Now, he says unless fundamental changes are made, \u201cEB-5 will die, and it should die.\u201d\u201cThere isn\u2019t a human being on this earth, when you go through a disappointment like this, that doesn\u2019t ask, \u2018Couldn\u2019t something have been done to find this sooner?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Shumlin said in an interview. \u201cWe all wish the answer were yes, we all wish we got subpoena power to look at accounts earlier. But there was no reason to believe that what the developers were representing wasn\u2019t true.\u201dBut others say the state was lax in pursuing hints of trouble, in part because officials trusted Mr. Stenger and had high hopes that the development could stimulate the economy.\u201cI didn\u2019t know there was a Ponzi scheme or fraud,\u201d Mr. Gibson said. \u201cBut I had suspicions that they couldn\u2019t repay their initial investors and that they were taking investor money to pay for ongoing operations. And everyone told me to bug off.\u201dMohammed Adil, 49, an Indian who runs a fashion retail company and who wanted his four daughters to be educated in the United States, said he invested $550,000 in Jay Peak in 2012.\u201cI thought, if the government is giving out visas, there must be checks and balances on this program,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we have ended up in the soup, our money is probably gone and our green card is in trouble.\u201dSimilarly, Felipe Vieira, 50, a financial analyst who moved his family to Vermont from Brazil in 2013, invested in townhouses at Jay Peak that are half finished. His chief concern is staying in the United States.\u201cGoing back would feel like an enormous personal failure,\u201d he said.Even as they contemplate financial losses, some investors said they might put more money into the unfinished projects; creating at least 10 jobs is a condition of obtaining a green card.\u201cThe investors don\u2019t want to liquidate; they want these jobs to continue so they can get their green cards,\u201d Mr. Shumlin said. Noting that Jay Peak plans to stay open and pay its employees, he added, \u201cIn two years, this will look like a bump in the road to good jobs and great resorts.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Representatives for Quicken Loans and Berkshire did not return requests for comment.The companies in the second round of bidding are seeking to buy one of the best-known names in Silicon Valley \u2014 though one that ceded a longtime hold on the Internet to younger rivals like Google and Facebook. Repeated efforts to reinvent itself, led by a string of chief executives, including the company\u2019s current leader, Marissa Mayer, have failed to take hold.As Yahoo and its bankers canvassed for preliminary bids, the company received criticism, including from some prospective bidders and from the activist hedge fund Starboard Value, over the state of the sales process.Yet Yahoo can point to progress. It settled a looming board fight with Starboard, offering the investment firm four director seats. One of those is held by Starboard\u2019s chief executive, Jeffrey Smith, who now sits on the special board committee overseeing the potential sale.Yahoo executives, including Ms. Mayer, and advisers have been sitting down with bidders in the second round, furnishing those suitors with additional details.Among them is Mr. Gilbert, who built his multibillion-dollar fortune with the financial empire. But he is also an active investor in his own right, having taken stakes in a number of online start-ups.Yahoo would be orders of magnitude larger than those other technology investments and significantly more troubled. But Mr. Gilbert\u2019s consortium, like other bidders, has been interested in the still-significant digital footprint that the company possesses, including its popular finance and sports sites.Backing him is his friend Mr. Buffett \u2014 who has long spoken of his aversion to technology companies, outside of an investment in IBM. But the role of Berkshire in the Gilbert bid would be financial, and Mr. Buffett\u2019s conglomerate would collect interest from its financing with the opportunity to convert those holdings into an equity stake in the company.And one of Berkshire\u2019s directors is Susan L. Decker, a former president of Yahoo.Providing advice to the Gilbert consortium are the former senior Yahoo executives Dan Rosensweig, who is now chief executive of the education company Chegg, and Tim Cadogan, now the head of the online advertising platform OpenX. Neither has expressed interest in rejoining Yahoo, one of the people briefed on the matter said.Mr. Buffett and Mr. Gilbert have another \u2014 albeit more troubled \u2014 tie to the Internet company. In 2014, Berkshire, Quicken Loans and Yahoo briefly united to offer a \u201cBillion Dollar Bracket Challenge\u201d tied to the NCAA basketball tournament that year, though the contest was called off and devolved into a morass of lawsuits.Advertisement"}

The attacks raised alarm bells because the thieves gained access to Swift, which is considered the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most secure payment messaging system. It is used by 11,000 banks and companies to move money between countries, making it a tempting target. Swift itself had warned of a coordinated assault on banks, although it stressed that it was the banks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 connections to its networks, rather than the network itself, that were breached. Oracle contended that Google used copyrighted material in the software code for the Android mobile phone operating system. Oracle asked for $9 billion from Google.

The decision directly conflicts with an earlier decision by an appeals court in Louisiana and the split could prompt the Supreme Court to wade back into the fray. In a pair of decisions in 2011 and 2013, the Supreme Court blessed the use of arbitration in a case pushed by a group of credit card companies. The credit card companies turned to a 1925 federal law that formalized arbitration as a means for companies to hash out their disputes with one another.Courts across the country have largely upheld arbitration clauses, deferring to the Supreme Court, which ruled that the Federal Arbitration Act beat even federal laws.Mr. Denton assured Mr. Thiel that Gawker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s journalists would be reporting on his involvement in lawsuits against the company.  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Passes $81 Billion Measure for Veterans and Military Construction", "Date": "2016-05-19", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The House on Thursday approved an $81.6 billion spending measure for veterans affairs and military construction programs after hours of contentious floor debate that at times focused on cultural disputes, including efforts to restrict the flying of the Confederate flag and a bitter split over workplace protections for gays and lesbians employed by federal contractors.Those disputes showed once again that the societal fissures that divide Republicans and Democrats are never far below the surface of any debate in Congress, even over a relatively routine spending measure.The debate over workplace protections had spilled over from Wednesday night when Republicans inserted an amendment to the annual military policy bill that would overturn an executive order by President Obama banning federal government contractors from discriminating against employees based on sexual orientation.The bill, which was considered must-pass legislation, passed along with the amendment by a vote of 277 to 147.During floor debate on the spending measure on Thursday, some Democrats pushed back. Representative Sean Patrick Maloney, Democrat of New York, turned to Representative Pete Sessions, Republican of Texas, and asked: \u201cIs it necessary to discriminate against gays and lesbians to support our military?\u201dMr. Sessions fired back, accusing Mr. Maloney of coming to the House floor \u201cwith spilled milk\u201d on his face to \u201crelitigate a decision that was made last night.\u201dThe argument led to an unusual skirmish on the House floor, with Democrats accusing Republicans of abusing the process to allow their party members to anonymously switch votes at the last minute and sustain the amendment. As the vote closed, Democrats on the House floor shouted, \u201cShame, shame, shame.\u201dIn a separate legislative tussle, the House on Thursday approved an amendment to the spending measure prohibiting cemeteries operated by the Department of Veterans Affairs from flying the Confederate flag. Democrats failed in a broader effort to ban any school that receives federal financing from flying the Confederate flag.The veterans affairs and military construction spending bill is the first appropriations measure adopted by the House this year.The annual military policy bill included several provisions that Republicans said showed increased support for service members and their families, including a 2.1 percent pay raise for troops. It also included a provision to continue a ban on the transfer to the United States mainland of any prisoners held at the detention center at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba.Amid the skirmishing in the House, the Senate on Thursday adopted a combined spending measure for veterans affairs and military construction programs, as well as for transportation and housing programs.The Senate legislation includes a measure to provide $1.1 billion in emergency financing to combat the mosquito-borne Zika virus, which can cause severe neurological defects in infants born to infected mothers. The vote in the Senate was 89 to 8.Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who managed the bill in the Senate, emphasized a provision that would provide $57 million in housing vouchers to help homeless veterans.\u201cThe bill makes vital investments in our nation\u2019s infrastructure, helps meet the housing needs of the most vulnerable among us and provides funding for economic development projects in our communities that create jobs,\u201d Ms. Collins said in a statement.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Best Picture Adaptations", "Date": "2016-05-28", "News": "Not everyone loves a punny theme as much as I do, but we\u2019re all wordplayers here, so let\u2019s enjoy the humor in Mr. Der\u2019s puzzle. He offers us nine very original entries that change one letter in a film title that won the Best Picture award to make a humorous adaptation of the original film. The first theme clue at 21 says \u201cBest Picture adaptation about \u2026\u201d and the others continue with the rest of the clue, most likely to save space.I tumbled to the theme with 50A\u2019s \u201c\u2026 fools accompanying a pack of wild animals?\u201d for DUNCES WITH WOLVES (for \u201cDances With Wolves\u201d), because I am neck-deep in college TOURing and knew the crossing 39D without having to think about it. From there, all I had to do is figure out which letter to change in each title based on the clue. For example, 84A\u2019s \u201cBest picture adaptation of an \u00c3\u00a9clair or cr\u00c3\u00a8me br\u00c3\u00bbl\u00c3\u00a9e, with \u2018The\u2019?\u201d takes \u201cThe French Connection\u201d and changes one of the Ns to an F to get THE FRENCH CONFECTION. Likewise, 24A\u2019s \u201cBest Picture adaptation about inaudible metrical poetry, with \u2018The\u2019?\u201d takes \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs\u201d swaps an L for an I and becomes SILENCE OF THE IAMBS.In nontheme news, I also liked Mr. Der\u2019s longer entries like RAVE REVIEW and RAN LIKE MAD. There were a couple of obscure words, like AIT and ANA in today\u2019s puzzle, but that\u2019s bound to happen in a large Sunday grid.\u2013 Alert from the Department of Things You Need to Know to Be a Better Crossword Solver! An AIT is a small river islet and might also be called an \u201ceyot.\u201d Commit those to memory.\u2013 Foreign language reminder: If the clue is in a foreign language, the answer has to be in that language. At 18A, the Italian clue \u201c60 minuti\u201d requires the Italian answer ORA, or \u201chour.\u201d\u2013 32A\u2019s \u201cGame for bankers?\u201d might sound like it\u2019s talking about games that people in finance play \u2014 and it might yield some snarky guesses at the answer \u2014 but the word \u201cbankers\u201d refers to the game of POOL today. People can bank shots in POOL when they bounce the ball off a cushion in order to go into the pocket or hit another ball.\u2013 79A\u2019s \u201cWords before and after \u2018what'\u201d for I AM refers to the play \u201cLa Cage Aux Folles\u201d and its anthem \u201cI AM What I AM\u201d:\u2013 I\u2019ve been on safaris, but have seen few links on them.

What\u2019s more, it\u2019s separate from the word \u201cpoint. That\u2019s a hint that you\u2019re not supposed to be thinking about the word \u201cpinpoint.\u201d \u2013 \u201cMerino mother\u201d for EWE at 63D refers to the Merino breed of sheep, and you might know it as a type of wool. A EWE is a female sheep.\u2013 72D\u2019s \u201cRing around the collar?\u201d for LARIAT is terrific wordplay. In the late 1960s, Wisk detergent inflicted on us one of the most annoying advertising campaigns ever known to the human race, which took housewife-shaming to new levels. Woe betide the housewife who let her husband go to work with dirt rings around his shirt collar. Only Wisk could rescue her from the fate of being the neighborhood domestic failure. But today, thank goodness, we\u2019re only talking about LARIATS.Let\u2019s hear from Mr. Der:This puzzle might be the most straightforward Sunday theme I\u2019ve had in The Times, but hopefully it\u2019s no less enjoyable. I love movies, so it was a lot of fun to go through all of the Oscar Best Picture winners and see which ones were one letter away from odd, funny phrases. One choice during construction was to add the two extra 10-letter entries right alongside longer counterparts; this made the grid a bit less wide open, but with a theme like this, I figured it was worth it so that more solvers would find their favorites Oscar movies in the grid.

Instead of venture capitalists begging to be allowed to invest, entrepreneurs are coming to them begging for cash. Investors are exerting their newfound power by asking more questions about a start-up\u2019s prospects and taking more time to invest. Some are pushing for management changes or for financing terms that would help cushion any losses they might face.\u201cVenture capitalists are putting founders through everything short of a proctology exam before they invest,\u201d said Venky Ganesan, a partner at Menlo Ventures, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm.The changing balance of power is evident in the numbers. Venture capitalists have put less money into start-ups in the United States in the last two quarters, according to the National Venture Capital Association; funding dropped 11 percent to $12.1 billion in the first quarter from a year earlier. With a smaller capital pie, entrepreneurs have to work harder for a piece.\u201cInvestors have materially more time to do diligence than before,\u201d said Ben Ling, a partner at venture capital firm Khosla Ventures. \u201cAcross our portfolio, even for the best companies, fund-raising is a longer process.\u201dMr. Ling added that while particularly strong companies were being funded as always, valuations for others were generally flat to about 20 percent lower than this time last year.One start-up whose valuation was recently reduced was CARD. com, an online banking start-up. The Los Angeles-based company closed a $5.5 million financing round in February that valued it lower than its last funding round in December 2014, something known in industry parlance as a down round.Ben Katz, CARD.com\u2019s chief executive, said it was growing by 3,000 new accounts a day, had its first month with $1 million in revenue in February and should have $1 billion in new deposits this year. Even so, Mr. Katz, 37, was pragmatic about taking money at a lower valuation.\u201cEntrepreneurs shouldn\u2019t be too stressed by a down round as long as they are getting the capital they need to build their vision,\u201d he said.Venture capital firms that might have invested outside of their comfort zone in boom times have now reverted to form, said Justin Langseth, chief executive of Zoomdata, a data analytics start-up. When he tried to raise money at the end of last year, many venture capitalists deemed Zoomdata, which is four years old, too big or too small for their liking, he said.Mr. Stein, 36, said some start-ups were postponing fund-raising in the hope that they would have more leverage later. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to build more traction,\u201d he said.With the shifting power balance come shifting messages from investors. Whereas investors once worshiped growth at nearly any cost at a start-up, many are now more concerned about profitability, entrepreneurs said.Justin Yoshimura, 25, who invests in young companies and is chairman of the online jewelry business Ice.com, said his start-ups had generally eschewed raising large amounts of money to control spending. Yet some investors in recent years encouraged him and the companies he has invested in to take a lot of money and spend it on marketing and other growth tactics.Now he is bemused to hear that investors are suggesting smaller rounds, less spending and a focus on not losing money.\u201cEveryone told us we were wrong last year, that we needed to spend,\u201d Mr. Yoshimura said. \u201cNow when you say you\u2019re profitable, everyone wants to invest.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Today\u2019s clean energy innovators are finding power by looking beyond the expected.Consider solar energy. In the early 1950s, Bell Labs engineers were stumped with a power problem. In the tropics, batteries used by the telephone system had a habit of corroding, a humid hang-up that disrupted service. Toying with alternative power sources, engineers couldn\u2019t make a connection until someone mentioned their promising experiments with silicon, then seen as a cheap byproduct of sand. Despite the unorthodox material and methodology, they followed their gut instinct, and after endless prototypes, arrived at the Bell Solar Battery \u2014 a remarkable new device that could convert sunlight into useful electricity, and the ancestor of today\u2019s rooftop arrays. Billed as \u201ca modern version of Apollo\u2019s chariot,\u201d the technological leap suggested that, even when attempting to harness the world\u2019s most abundant energy source, success comes from serendipity, tangential thinking and vision.Kerosene lamps are the main source of nighttime light for millions of low-income households around the world \u2014 principally in Africa, China and India. Every time a family lights one up, the clock starts ticking on the amount of light they can afford and on the harm to their health from its smoky emissions.While you read this page, witness how \u2014 for the same cost of energy \u2014 the light from a kerosene lamp dwindles as you advance, while the LED\u2019s light barely changes.It\u2019s an unprecedented clean energy challenge: create affordable, scalable and decentralized power. How do you tackle a challenge of this scale? It requires progressive change, something Shell supports via Shell LiveWIRE and Shell Springboard, initiatives which have provided assistance and millions in funding to help startups and today\u2019s clean energy innovators realize their visions. Real shifts often come from small, smart and flexible ideas, ones that seem as outlandish as harvesting the sun\u2019s rays with silicon seemed more than a half century ago.Asad LiaquatFor Pakistani electrical engineer Sanwal Muneer, 22, the solution came by recasting a longtime enemy of environmentalists \u2014 traffic \u2014 as a savior and energy source. The company he co-founded with CTO Asad Liaquat and Sidra Muneer, Capture Mobility, a Shell LiveWIRE alumnus that recently won an Outstanding Achievement award from the UK Trade and Investment department, manufactures 8-foot tall columns topped with a spinning turbine, which resemble roadside artwork. But when positioned in medians or along highways, the hybrid power source uses a built-in helical turbine, turned by the wind and turbulence from passing cars and trucks, as well as solar panels, to generate electricity. Portable enough for roadsides and rural areas, the device creates enough power in a day to run a small home. Removable filters also help clean air that\u2019s been polluted by passing traffic.The idea came to Muneer in 2013, when he was competing in Shell Eco-marathon \u2014 a competition to design, build and test an energy-efficient vehicle. A stray observation led him to consider the high speed traffic turbulence which made him think about using wind turbines to capture the energy of traffic being wasted; soon he was planting prototypes beside local roads.\u201cI wanted to create something that could be scaled up easily irrespective of geography and environment,\u201d says Muneer. \u201cAvailable renewable resources might not be efficient and reliable everywhere \u2014 such as solar in Scotland \u2014 so we need to come up with innovative ways to generate clean energy to pace up with the demand.\u201dRoads are getting more crowded, but energy created by cars doesn\u2019t go to use.Displaced air created by automobile momentum is an unharvested energy source.Click to advanceThe idea came to Muneer in 2013, when he was competing in Shell Eco-marathon \u2014 a competition to design, build and test an energy-efficient vehicle.

{"Headline": "New Crowdfunding Rules Let the Small Fry Swim With Sharks", "Date": "2016-05-14", "News": "Supported byStarting Monday, new rules will permit anyone, not just the moneyed, to risk $2,000 a year or more investing in small companies in exchange for a stake in the business. Companies can raise up to $1 million a year this way.It is also an opportunity for start-ups and other small businesses, which can raise money with fairly few regulatory burdens. For instance, small companies seeking less than $500,000 and most first-time issuers will not need to provide audited financial statements, just unaudited ones.That was four years ago. It took a long time to iron out the details, in part because the Securities and Exchange Commission was concerned that ordinary people could lose their life savings because of fraud or na\u00efvet\u00e9.\u201cWhen high-growth companies are looking to raise money, it\u2019s not just for the money,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re also looking for validation, and they want it from venture funds or well-known angels. They won\u2019t get that from a crowdfunding offer.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re building a tribe of women around the world who are passionate about African textiles and want to support these emerging designers,\u201d Ms. Anyadiegwu said.Ms. Anyadiegwu wants to increase her part-time workers\u2019 hours, move her base of operations from Sayreville, N.J., to Atlanta, where she has built a clientele, and do more marketing. To finance that, she\u2019s willing to part with some of her equity in the business.\u201cOur customer base is so engaged,\u201d she said. \u201cThis could be a perfect opportunity for them to participate and be a part of the company in another way.\u201d\u201cWe can build a community around our company. That\u2019s an intangible that you don\u2019t get from private fund-raising,\u201d said Kyle Henson, 23, the company\u2019s chief business officer. He is preparing Rorus to comply with the new securities rules, he said, if it chooses to do a crowdfunding offering.But are the 230 million adult Americans who aren\u2019t millionaires really that interested in becoming do-it-yourself venture capitalists? While supporters cheer the new rules as a democratization of high finance, potentially opening up to the masses deals once reserved for the rich, skeptics worry that regular investors might get only the leftovers.They may dream of discovering the next Facebook. But the most promising companies \u2014 the high-growth ventures delivering the monster returns that keep the entire venture-capital industry afloat \u2014 may also be the ones least likely to bother raising money in small dribs from the crowd, they fear.But what got people excited was the crowdfunding provision allowing companies to raise up to $1 million with few regulatory obstacles.The company caught Mr. Hensch\u2019s eye nearly two years ago, after it raised $1.1 million on Kickstarter. He scoured tech blogs for tidbits, signed up for the company\u2019s newsletter and followed along as executives posted updates from China about their production process.So when Virtuix announced in March that it would crowdfund its next investment round, Mr. Hensch and Ms. Roumagoux jumped in. \u201cI\u2019ve seen where Robert\u2019s recommendations have gone in the market. Typically, when he identifies something early on, it becomes a blockbuster item,\u201d said Ms. Roumagoux, recalling her husband\u2019s early enthusiasm for Tesla, Netflix and a \u201creally neat\u201d search engine called Google.Ms. Roumagoux works as a lawyer, and Mr. Hensch is a real estate business manager. As financiers, \u201cwe\u2019re definitely novices,\u201d she said with a laugh, but both like the idea of diversifying their retirement fund and other investments by gambling on a small portfolio of fledgling technology ventures.Jan Goetgeluk, Virtuix\u2019s founder and chief executive, likes the idea of having hundreds or thousands of stakeholders along for the ride. \u201cThis allows us to turn those fans into true brand advocates. It\u2019s incredibly powerful.\u201dMr. Goetgeluk, a 32-year-old mechanical engineer, had dreamed of becoming an entrepreneur since moving to the United States from Belgium nine years ago. The money he raised from 3,000 backers on Kickstarter funded Virtuix\u2019s early production, and the publicity the campaign created got him a spot pitching his company to a panel of rich investors on \u201cShark Tank\u201d \u2014 where he failed to land a deal.\u201cIf my husband brought this into my house, I would divorce him immediately,\u201d Barbara Corcoran, a real estate entrepreneur, announced on the show.The rules that take effect on Monday make crowdfunding far cheaper and easier for companies to use. But the cost of that concession is a $1 million cap on the amount they can raise in a 12-month period.\u201cWe had no idea that it would take the S.E.C. four years to write all these rules,\u201d Mr. Tommarello said. \u201cWe had to figure out how to stay alive and not go bankrupt.\u201dStill, this isn\u2019t like investing in the stock market. Want to sell Facebook? Just call your broker. Want to sell your shares in Ms. Anyadiegwu\u2019s company, Zuvaa? Well, under the new crowdfunding rules, people must generally hold their shares for at least a year. And even then, there are few marketplaces for finding another buyer.But Ms. Roumagoux, who said she had skimmed the circular, isn\u2019t worried. She and her husband may not be millionaires, but she says they\u2019re financially sophisticated enough to judge the risk that they\u2019re taking.\u201cI know all these rules are there to protect us, but honestly, I don\u2019t think we need the protection,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re relatively young, and this is a long-term investment.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Israel\u2019s Top Tennis Academy Is Streamlined for Success", "Date": "2016-05-28", "News": "Supported byRA\u2019ANANA, Israel \u2014 David Coffer sank into a green plastic chair. His eyes fixated on two tennis courts as five teenagers whizzed balls across the court, slinging groundstrokes to one another.Though he is not physically spry as he nears 70, Coffer is full of energy. He is not shy about speaking his mind. Age is all about your spirit, he says.Coffer, a Jewish businessman and philanthropist from Britain who made his money in real estate, is the man responsible for changing the youth tennis landscape in Israel. He and his son, Adam, finance and manage the David Squad, an elite tennis roster that handpicks the top players in Israel to train. Named after ancient Israel\u2019s King David, the David Squad has become the pre-eminent tennis academy in Israel.\u201cBetween the two courts, you\u2019ve got two players ranked at the top of their division in the country, two national champions and one world champion \u2014 not bad, right?\u201d Coffer said, pointing at each player. \u201cYou won\u2019t see this collection of talent in one setting in most countries, especially in Israel.\u201dOne of those prized talents is Yshai Oliel, Israel\u2019s best tennis prospect in years. A tall, lanky left-hander originally from Ramla, Oliel, 16, has seen his stock rise steadily in recent years. He is a two-time champion of the prestigious Junior Orange Bowl international tournament, one of nine players to have won consecutive titles.\u201cFor the last four years, he\u2019s probably been one of the top three players in his age group in the world,\u201d said Shlomo Glickstein, the chief executive of the Israeli Tennis Association and a former top-25 player on the ATP Tour.Oliel is far and away the best junior player in Israel. His year-round schedule includes minimal time spent training, and competing, in Israel because of the lack of top-level competition available. For the few weeks a year he does spend in Israel, he often trains with the Davis Cup team and with Dudi Sela, Israel\u2019s top professional player on the ATP Tour.The rest of the year, he plays tournaments around the world and spends weeks at a time training in Florida or in Spain, where he practices with the former ATP player Francisco Clavet to improve his conditioning and movement around the court.Oliel\u2019s highest ranking in the 18-and-under junior circuit was 48, which came last year, and he is currently in the top 60. His coaches have taken cautionary steps in his development, and they have been deliberate in ramping up his schedule and training. They have slowly mixed in more difficult tournaments, pushing him to play the junior Australian Open in January and then the French Open. He won his two qualifying matches for the French Open and will very likely be in the main draw for the boys\u2019 singles tournament this week.Andy Zingman, one of his main coaches at the David Squad, does not think that Oliel\u2019s ranking is an accurate description of where he is in his development.\u201cOliel is probably one of the top 30 or 40 players in juniors,\u201d Zingman said. \u201cWe try to challenge him and make him play tougher tournaments, even if it means he\u2019s going to lose and have his ranking suffer.\u201dZingman said he could choose to have Oliel play easy tournaments and thus improve his ranking, but added that he would gain little besides the \u201cbump.\u201d\u201cHe needs to get used to losing,\u201d Zingman said.Not known for producing tennis players, Israel has seen that change slightly in the last few years thanks, in large part, to Coffer and the David Squad. Coffer started the David Squad in 2006 and will train any player, Jewish or Arab, with the potential to excel in international competition and the willingness to abide by a strict code of conduct.Coffer, who with his son travels to Israel several times a year, has made it his goal to improve the level of youth tennis and in turn the level of professional talent that the country produces. At the recent Pesach National tournament in Israel, David Squad members won the girls\u2019 under-21 tournament, as well as the boys\u2019 under-16, under-14 and under-12.Only 10 players are officially part of the Squad, and that suits Coffer. He wants to produce the best talent he can and appropriately devote his resources to all of his players. He also says that keeping the Squad small and exclusive adds to its mystique.Ultimately, Coffer wants to improve the world\u2019s perception of Israel through sports.\u201cNo one knows who the prime minister is of Serbia or the president is of Switzerland, but everyone knows Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s an improved perception of those countries because of them. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do here.\u201dThough there are other tennis academies in Israel, none have the same level of financing that Coffer provides. He brings in coaches, trainers, nutritionists and psychologists. He covers travel expenses, which include trips to international tournaments, as well as trips to train in Florida and Spain.The impact is not lost on Israel\u2019s other tennis governing bodies.\u201cI personally think what David\u2019s doing is a positive thing and a great program,\u201d Glickstein said. \u201cThe country just doesn\u2019t have the money to financially support all of these talented players, and so he\u2019s able to do that. He does what he does out of his love for Israel and tennis, and he\u2019s helping grow tennis in Israel.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Looming Crisis in Lebanon", "Date": "2016-05-03", "News": "Supported byIn Levantine landscapes, history is piled high. The present is layered on the remnants of the past, both modern and ancient.Nowhere is this more apparent than in Lebanon\u2019s capital, Beirut. Sparkling buildings and sweeping urban highways rise up out of heaps of rubble that remain a quarter-century after the 1975-1990 civil war. Yet the crumbling edifices of earlier eras are also, amazingly, still inhabited.Metaphors involving unwanted detritus have been irresistible to commentators as Lebanon again finds itself in the crossfire of geopolitical conflict. The regional rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia has found a new focal point in Lebanon with its uneasy equilibrium.At the center of the crisis is the growing role of Hezbollah, the Shiite political party and militia. Beyond its Lebanese strongholds, the group has also become one of Iran\u2019s main strategic assets in the region: Heavily supported by Hezbollah fighters, the Russian-Iranian surge in Syria has swung the momentum of the war back in favor of the government of President Bashar al-Assad.Lebanon\u2019s own political dynamics have also shifted. Beirut has long been trapped in a Syrian orbit; as the fortunes of the Assad regime have revived, Hezbollah\u2019s power in Lebanon has grown. Hezbollah had already angered the Saudis and their Gulf allies by its intervention in Syria and support for Iran. The Shiite group has also stalemated domestic politics by blocking the selection of a new Lebanese president.The Gulf states\u2019 cutting off aid to their Lebanese allies \u2014 an incongruous grouping of Sunni, Druze and Christian factions whose only common ground is a shared fear of Hezbollah \u2014 undoubtedly cedes the field to Iran. But as a senior Gulf diplomat told me, \u201cOur money in Lebanon just didn\u2019t stretch as far as Iran\u2019s.\u201d It did not have the same political impact because most Gulf aid went to national institutions like the army, while Iran\u2019s mainly goes directly to a proxy militia: Hezbollah. With the growing power of Hezbollah, the Gulf states felt that, by underwriting Lebanon\u2019s national institutions, they were subsidizing what were becoming, in effect, Iranian assets.The key to Lebanon\u2019s relative stability, as the veteran Druze leader Walid Jumblatt told me, is that \u201cits security services are able to work with the Syrians, the Saudis, the Iranians and the West simultaneously.\u201d If that balance is lost, Lebanon\u2019s fragile equilibrium may collapse.Worse, with proxy conflicts raging in Syria, Yemen and elsewhere, Lebanon, too, is a potential battleground for indirect Iranian-Saudi hostilities. So far, the country\u2019s competing factions have united to quarantine the spillover of the Syrian war to a remote part of northern Lebanon. But should Tehran or Riyadh authorize a new theater of confrontation, Lebanon is a potential powder keg.The country is poised, in a way familiar to the Lebanese, between tense calm and a potential conflagration. But the pressures are rapidly mounting, and outside actors will have a decisive role in determining whether the country can avoid being sucked into the inferno raging around it.Hussein Ibish is a senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Paging Trump\u2019s Wallet", "Date": "2016-05-13", "News": "Supported byThere\u2019s a great way for Donald Trump to grab the high road in this presidential race. All he has to do is announce he\u2019s going to pay for the campaign himself.Sure, we\u2019re talking about more than a billion dollars. But the man is superrich, right? And he did say he was going to do it. (\u201cI\u2019m self-funding my campaign. I\u2019m not taking all of this blood money.\u201d)Or: \u201cI\u2019m a self-funder. I\u2019m not taking any money, O.K.?\u201dOr: \u201cBy self-funding my campaign, I am not controlled by my donors, special interests or lobbyists. I am only working for the people of the U.S.!\u201dWhen asked by MSNBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough whether he would \u201cchange possibly \u2026 and start taking money in the future,\u201d Trump said, \u201cNo, no.\u201d But we already knew that because of all those self-funding quotes.Nevertheless, he\u2019s now hired a hedge fund manager as his national finance chairman and started scheduling fund-raisers. He\u2019s working out an arrangement with the Republican Party that will allow him to accept megadonations. Presumably from people who have no special interests whatsoever but just happen to have $300,000 on hand. (The casino magnate Sheldon Adelson has just declared his support; casino magnates are famous for their indifference to anything but the common good.)We\u2019re used to Donald Trump changing his mind. Right now he claims to be down to \u201cfive or six\u201d possible choices for vice president \u2014 which means that, given his current rate of switching positions, close to 100,000 Americans could wind up on the list before the convention. But his whole point was supposed to be his independence. And his wealth. Plus we\u2019ve heard so, so much about the way he used his own personal fortune to fund his primary races.Although \u2014 wait \u2014 most of the money came in the form of loans from Trump to his campaign. Which he has a legal right to repay with future donations. Yes! Until the election, Trump can reclaim what he says was \u201cnearly $50 million\u201d in primary-season loans, out of the humble coin of his faithful followers. (Make America Pay Again.)Could that really happen? On Friday, Trump told MSNBC he had \u201cno intention\u201d of doing that. His campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, has said the same thing in the past. Because, um, Lewandowski claimed Trump wouldn\u2019t be soliciting donations in the first place: \u201cWe have said over and over, he\u2019s self-funding. I don\u2019t know how [you] can pay yourself back with money you\u2019re not raising.\u201dSo very easy to clear this all up. Donald Trump just has to pay for his presidential campaign himself. Like he promised.Trump is not a particularly generous guy. A Washington Post analysis of the 4,844 charitable contributions he claimed to have made over the last five years found that they were heavy on free rounds of golf at Trump courses and light \u2014 well, actually nonexistent \u2014 when it came to personal money. A lot of the expenses he claimed to be covering during the primary campaign were actually bills for the rental of offices in Trump buildings or flights on Trump planes.(Wait a minute \u2014 if you donate to the Trump presidential campaign, is there any chance the money could be used to pay back a Trump loan for money to pay rent in a Trump office tower? Just asking.)Maybe he doesn\u2019t have the money. Cynical minds have suggested that he\u2019s refusing to make his tax returns public because he\u2019s actually worth way, way less than the $10 billion he keeps claiming. What if it\u2019s only $1 billion? Or a few million? Once, years ago, I referred to him as a \u201cthousandaire\u201d and the reaction was \u2026 harsh.There\u2019s certainly something in those documents he doesn\u2019t want us to know. But I believe I speak for a great many Americans when I say that if Donald Trump announced he was going to keep special interests out of his campaign by paying for the whole damn thing himself, we would be so impressed that the tax return issue would completely disappear.Coming up with a billion dollars over six months would certainly be a challenge. Hardly something you could expect an ordinary person to do. Even an ordinary person with $4 billion \u2014 whoops, $10 billion. But isn\u2019t the whole attraction of Trump supposed to be his specialness? Couldn\u2019t he make a deal?Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s hard. Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a simple-minded idea. Simple-minded ideas are what Donald Trump is all about. People, the next time you hear him brag about his incredible, unique, no-Washington-insiders campaign, feel free to yell back:Show me the money.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York City and Nonprofit Clash Over Accessibility of Roosevelt Memorial", "Date": "2016-05-09", "News": "Supported byThe little-known dispute has now reached an impasse, with the de Blasio administration declaring categorically that the park is not accessible and needs to be fixed.President Roosevelt himself would have been unable to use a 12-by-60-foot sunken terrace at the southernmost end of the memorial. He was paralyzed from the waist down and depended on a wheelchair for mobility.\u201cThere is a particularly tragic irony in a park commemorating the legacy of Franklin Delano Roosevelt \u2014 one of this country\u2019s great historical figures with a disability, and a role model to so many \u2014 that is not completely accessible to those with disabilities,\u201d said Natalie Grybauskas, a spokeswoman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat.Though the park is open and operating, the city is withholding a permanent certificate of occupancy and hundreds of thousands of dollars in financing until the matter is resolved.\u201cYou feel like you\u2019re in a pit,\u201d Mr. Polshek said.Both the conservancy and City Hall say their positions are supported by the law. It seems possible to interpret the welter of complex accessibility regulations under the federal act either way.The remedy favored by the de Blasio administration would be to install ramps on either side of the Room.Railings would have to be installed along the ramps and behind benches that are now sheer slabs of Mount Airy granite, set off against monumental blocks of the same whitish-gray stone. This would compromise the Kahn design, which the conservancy tried to follow as faithfully as possible.\u201cThe consequences of doing it \u2014 for everyone\u2019s experience \u2014 seemed to outweigh the value,\u201d Ms. Minard said. \u201cThe decision was not seen as a problem because we believed then, as we do now, that the park more than meets the requirements for accessibility for those with a disability, and that the memorial as a whole is A.D.A. compliant.\u201dShe said that the conservancy was prepared to continue operating as it does now, under a temporary certificate of occupancy, while acknowledging that the missing financing from the city is \u201cmeaningful.\u201d (City Hall puts the figure at $900,000, the conservancy at $600,000.)It is unclear at the moment how or when the issue will be resolved. For the time being, the lowest level of the ha-ha is closed to everyone.Jim Bates, the president of the association, who uses a wheelchair and motor scooter, said there is a better view from the Room above than there is from the ha-ha below because of a wide parapet wall at the end of the sunken terrace.\u201cThe upper level is ideal,\u201d Mr. Bates said. \u201cYou can see everything.\u201dThe Kahn design had already been modified in subtle ways to improve accessibility, Ms. Minard said.Accessibility has generally improved at the south end of the island because of the memorial, Mr. Bates said. It had been rutted parkland before \u2014 hostile terrain for a scooter. \u201cI probably got stuck three or four times going into that area,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cuomo Campaign\u2019s Role in Scrutinized Senate Races Comes Into Focus", "Date": "2016-05-12", "News": "Supported byIt did not, however, end well.The Republicans prevailed on Election Day, weeks after the unusual alliance between the governor and the mayor ruptured amid accusations that Mr. Cuomo was sabotaging the effort. The Democratic Senate candidates were not the only losers: Eighteen months later, Mr. de Blasio and several aides, along with a number of consultants and labor union operatives, find themselves caught up in a criminal investigation focused on how they directed money into some of the contested races.The inquiry focuses squarely on the de Blasio team\u2019s effort to use county committees to deliver more money than would be allowed through contribution caps that apply to individual candidates.But the Cuomo campaign was nonetheless involved in the overall effort to help the Democrats retake the Senate, at least behind the scenes, according to documents and correspondence reviewed by The New York Times, and to people briefed on the effort.Meetings were held, plans drawn up and lawyers consulted. And perhaps most important, money was raised \u2014 in the end, well over $1 million.A senior aide to the governor, Joseph Percoco, took part in some of the earliest organizational and planning sessions with a top de Blasio administration official and campaign lawyers for the mayor and the governor, the materials reviewed by The Times show.Mr. Percoco also received central legal and operational documents on how the fund-raising effort would be carried out. Three weeks before the election, he corresponded with Emma Wolfe, one of the mayor\u2019s closest advisers, about the procedures for paying for hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign advertisements and mailings for Democratic candidates in targeted races, according to the materials.Basil A. Smikle Jr., the executive director of the New York State Democratic Party, which took part in the effort and is controlled by Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, said that neither the state party nor the governor\u2019s campaign took part in the fund-raising activities that are now under scrutiny.Mr. Smikle said that Mr. Percoco, Ms. Wolfe and others were \u201cclearly advised\u201d by legal counsel \u201cthat fund-raising earmarking was a circumvention of the state\u2019s campaign finance limits.\u201d Eventually, the \u201ccoordinated effort became divided\u201d after \u201cinternal strategic and operational disagreements,\u201d he said. Citing published reports, Mr. Smikle added that the mayor\u2019s group is now under investigation, suspected of using earmarked funds through the Democratic county committees of Ulster and Putnam Counties.An election lawyer for the mayor, Laurence D. Laufer, who advised on the Senate effort, dismissed Mr. Smikle\u2019s version of events.\u201cThere was clear legal guidance provided to all parties that was rigorously adhered to,\u201d he said in a statement provided by Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign. \u201cThe notion that the state party had concerns about any legal issue, or backed away from the effort because of that, is patently ridiculous.\u201dThe state party, according to correspondence reviewed by The Times, continued to pay roughly $1 million for television commercials, mailings and consultants as part of the effort up until the final weeks before the election, with most of that money raised by Mr. de Blasio.The mayor, a Democrat, has repeatedly defended the fund-raising campaign, saying in a recent radio interview, \u201cWe specifically followed \u2014 every step along the way \u2014 legal guidance.\u201d He and others have said political campaigns have used similar practices for decades.It is a felony for donors to earmark contributions to the committees to be passed on to certain candidates. Prosecutors involved in the investigation interpret the statute, which has never been tested in court, to mean that it is also a felony under state election law to solicit donations in order to avoid contribution limits, people briefed on the matter have said, an interpretation that Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign lawyers dispute.No evidence has been uncovered that Mr. Percoco did anything illegal or improper as part of the fund-raising efforts, people briefed on the matter said; he is the target of an unrelated federal corruption investigation focused on the governor\u2019s largest economic development project, known as the Buffalo Billion.At the time of the fund-raising effort, Mr. Percoco resigned as the governor\u2019s deputy executive secretary so he could serve as the manager of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s 2014 re-election campaign.Among the materials The Times reviewed was a July 16, 2014, document prepared as part of that year\u2019s Senate campaign effort that summarized the fund-raising and spending rules that would apply to the coordinated effort. It listed the contribution limits and restrictions on funds for five \u201crecipient committees\u201d that could be used in the undertaking. They included the county committees, the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee and the New York State Democratic Committee, which is controlled by Mr. Cuomo.The inclusion of another committee, the Women\u2019s Party multicandidate political committee, also underscored the governor\u2019s influence. That committee, created and controlled by Mr. Cuomo, would later be named the Women\u2019s Equality Party. For reasons that are unclear, the Women\u2019s Equality Party was apparently not used in the effort.Mr. Percoco and a legal adviser for the State Democratic Party attended one of the fund-raising effort\u2019s early planning meetings, on July 16 at the Lower Manhattan office of the law firm Genova Burns Giantomasi Webster, according to the documents, correspondence and people briefed on the effort.Among others in attendance were Ms. Wolfe and Mr. Laufer, who represents Mr. de Blasio\u2019s successful 2013 mayoral campaign, his current re-election campaign and the Campaign for One New York, a nonprofit that has pushed his agenda. Mr. Laufer, who was then with the Genova firm, also represents some of the other entities involved in the 2014 fund-raising effort.The materials reviewed by The Times also included a brief legal analysis, prepared by Mr. Laufer and dated Oct. 8, 2014, which concluded that the fund-raising effort was not engaging in earmarking; the other, dated Oct. 17, was a longer, more detailed examination of election law relating to the fund-raising operation, which said it was written to provide guidance to ensure the campaign was carried out in compliance with the law.The investigation is one of at least five separate corruption inquiries focused on the mayor and his inner circle, people with knowledge of those inquiries have said.The 2014 Senate materials reviewed by The Times also show that Mr. Percoco was involved until at least mid-October, when correspondence with Ms. Wolfe shows that the two were negotiating over how to track and pay some of the roughly $1 million in television advertising and mailings.Other questions about the investigation, including whether it may expand beyond violations of election law or remain narrowly focused on those allegations, remain. Prosecutors have subpoenaed several of the mayor\u2019s senior aides and the finance chairman of his campaign, as well as a number of consultants who worked on the effort who are very close to the mayor, according to City Hall officials and others briefed on the inquiry. Democratic candidates from the 2014 race have also received subpoenas, as have some of the county committees.While the ultimate outcome of this particular investigation is uncertain, a number of political consultants and lawyers involved in the inquiry say one thing is clear: The investigation, along with the others swirling around the mayor, will not make fund-raising for him any easier in this election season.An article on Friday about fund-raising efforts in 2014 for New York Senate races overstated what Basil A. Smikle Jr., a leader of the New York State Democratic Party, knew about allegations that a group led by Mayor Bill de Blasio used earmarked funds through local county committees. While he cited published reports of such allegations, Mr. Smikle did not know of such an effort. The article also misstated the circumstances of Joseph Percoco\u2019s departure from the Cuomo administration to run the governor\u2019s re-election campaign. He resigned from the administration; he did not take a leave of absence. The error also appeared in an article on Wednesday.Advertisement"}

Others even seemed a little relieved; at least the long battle was almost over.\u201cI\u2019m convinced that there is more than enough proof of her crimes,\u201d said Marta Suplicy, a senator from S\u00e3o Paulo who was Ms. Rousseff\u2019s ally before defecting from her leftist Workers\u2019 Party.Even some of Ms. Rousseff\u2019s supporters in the Senate expected her to lose the vote, which would oust the Workers\u2019 Party from the presidency it has held for 13 years.\u201cThere is no other path for us than opposition,\u201d Humberto Costa, the Workers\u2019 Party leader in the Senate, told reporters during the session on Wednesday. Still, he said it would be a \u201cvery firm opposition.\u201dThe Senate vote is a watershed in the power struggle consuming Brazil, a country that experienced a rare stretch of stability over the last two decades as it strengthened its economy and achieved greater prominence on the world stage.Dilma Rousseff, Brazil\u2019s president, is facing removal from office. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the proceedings.If she is suspended and put on trial, she will become the second of Brazil\u2019s four elected presidents to be removed from office since democracy was re-established in the mid-1980s after a long dictatorship.\u201cPlainly said, this is the worst crisis in our history, with its combination of economic calamity, discredited politics and the violation of the lowest ethical standards,\u201d Boris Fausto, a Brazilian historian, told reporters this month.Unlike some of her adversaries in Congress, Ms. Rousseff is not suspected of stealing for personal enrichment. Instead, she faces accusations that she borrowed money from state banks to plug budget holes. Her opponents say she used this strategy to hide Brazil\u2019s economic problems, in an attempt to improve her re-election prospects.\u201cTemer is what we\u2019ve got,\u201d Mr. Fausto said. \u201cI hope he\u2019ll be up to the difficult and often highly unpopular tasks ahead of him.\u201dBut the impasse between Ms. Rousseff and her rivals has kept the government in Bras\u00edlia distracted from these problems, exposing the political establishment to withering scrutiny around the country.While Ms. Rousseff, Brazil\u2019s first female president, has largely stuck to her routine in recent days, consulting with cabinet ministers and meeting with supporters, aides said they expected her to watch the Senate vote on television.Ms. Rousseff, 68, contends that her predecessors enacted the same budgetary manipulation policies that she is accused of. Her rivals say that does not make her innocent.Beyond that, an array of figures in her Workers\u2019 Party are either in jail or under investigation on charges of graft, dealing a blow to the legitimacy of a party that came to power vowing to end such practices.During a suspension, her salary would be cut in half, to about $4,400 a month, though she would still have access to a large staff, numbering in the dozens. The man seeking to replace her, Mr. Temer, would take the helm of government while living in his official residence, the Pal\u00e1cio do Jaburu.Concerns are growing about the legitimacy of a government assembled by Mr. Temer. If Ms. Rousseff and the Workers\u2019 Party shift into the opposition, they will most likely claim her ouster was illegal, and Mr. Temer\u2019s top allies remain mired in corruption scandals of their own.Several of his top advisers are under investigation, including Romero Juc\u00e1, a senator from Roraima State in the Amazon, and Geddel Vieira Lima, a former executive at one of Brazil\u2019s largest public banks. Mr. Temer has insisted that those inquiries would not prevent him from naming the advisers to his cabinet.The president has maintained a sense of resolve. Speaking in Bras\u00edlia to activists promoting women\u2019s rights this week, Ms. Rousseff, who was an operative in an urban guerrilla group in her youth, addressed the crestfallen mood around her.Calling her adversaries \u201ctraitors,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m not tired of fighting.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Upon approach, the points quickly grew bigger, brighter, weirder, like a roadside attraction made by an atomically enlarged infant \u2014 seven totem-pole stacks of limestone boulders, the rocks painted in Kool-Aid shades so intense they were sometimes hard to look at in the full sunlight.The work, which officially went on view May 11, is one of the largest land-art pieces created in the United States in the last 40 years, in a part of the West that defined the land-art movement beginning in the 1960s with artists like Mr. Heizer, Robert Smithson (\u201cSpiral Jetty\u201d in Utah), Nancy Holt (\u201cSun Tunnels,\u201d west of the Bonneville Salt Flats) and Walter de Maria (\u201cThe Lightning Field\u201d in western New Mexico).Building on a renowned collection of photographs by artists like Robert Adams and Edward Burtynsky who have charted humanity\u2019s impact on the land beginning in the late 20th century, the museum founded the Center for Art and Environment in 2008, devoted to what it calls \u201ccreative interactions between people and their environments.\u201d The center is home to a rapidly growing archive, now one of the largest in the world, committed to land art, very broadly defined. And with the Rondinone project, the museum is now moving past exhibiting photographs, documentation and artifacts from historical land-art pieces and decisively entering the business of ushering new pieces into the world.\u201cI saw no reason when I came here in 2007 to strive to make this into an encyclopedic museum or one that would have a general collecting focus,\u201d said David B. Walker, the museum\u2019s executive director and chief executive, who came to the job after past lives as an academic dean, an art-magazine publisher and the singer and guitarist in two California rock bands. \u201cOr you could also go down the easy, convention-center path \u2014 taking these big flashy traveling shows and drawing big crowds to those and making a lot of people happy without much to show for it.\u201dQuoting a McKinsey consultant he once heard (who was probably paraphrasing a piece of life advice often attributed to Jerry Garcia), Mr. Walker said it became apparent to him that in the 21st century, places like his would lose in the game of trying to make themselves smaller versions of large, wealthy urban museums and that the way to succeed was not to try being the best at what you did \u201cbut to be the only one who does what you do.\u201dOf course, institutions like the Dia Art Foundation in New York and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art have long-established histories with land art. But Mr. Walker and his curators, including William L. Fox, a poet and historian of land art who runs the Center for Art and Environment, believe that the museum, in its city perched on the western edge of the Great Basin, is a logical home for such a focus and can distinguish itself by delving deeper than larger establishments are likely to do.\u201cIt feels very good when you can come back from L.A. with a half-million-dollar check for a project in Nevada that\u2019s really pretty out there,\u201d said Mr. Walker in his office at the museum, an angular black zinc-clad building completed in 2003 on the site of the institution\u2019s modest former home, a repurposed title company building.Jamie Kingham, via Nevada Museum of ArtThe Rondinone project, which the artist describes in a poetic written statement of purpose as partly about \u201cthe contrary air between the desert and the city lights\u201d and the solidarities between \u201cthe natural and the artificial,\u201d is in many ways a fitting first flag for the museum to plant. The sculptures, which will remain in place for two years and were financed mostly by private and corporate donors, connect themselves to the history of postwar American land art but also push it raucously, impishly into the 21st century, recalling a phrase that Mr. Fox likes to quote from the art critic Jeff Kelley to describe Las Vegas: \u201cThe American dream in drag.\u201dAll of the documents and ephemera chronicling the creation of the pieces, and they are legion \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t think I have any files as fat with legal documents,\u201d Mr. Fox said \u2014 will go into the museum\u2019s archives. And the outsize presence of the sculptures within easy driving distance of Las Vegas, rising from a scatter of mesquite bushes, yucca and stumps of dead Joshua trees, is like a high-art billboard for the institution\u2019s particular ambitions.Mr. Rondinone, who had seen the sculptures as the boulders were being shaped, connected and painted at a nearby quarry but never in their intended setting, looking like sentinels stationed before the sweep of the McCullough mountain range, walked around them quietly, almost reverently, as the sun went down. He said he welcomed whatever the desert would do to the pieces over the next two years. The erosion, fading and dirt would become part of the works. (Human intervention, in the form of spray paint or target-practice bullets, is not invited; the pieces have been coated with an antigraffiti shield and will be repaired if damaged.)\u201cBut then I realized that size doesn\u2019t mean anything out here,\u201d said Mr. Rondinone, 51, who was raised in the Swiss resort town of Brunnen and lives and works in Harlem. \u201cThe scale makes everything look small. That\u2019s what you quickly figure out in the desert.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like they even have their own personalities,\u201d he added. \u201cNot exactly human, I guess.

{"Headline": "Mitsubishi Grabs a Shiny Sliver of the American Market", "Date": "2016-05-05", "News": "Supported byWheelsANN ARBOR, Mich. \u2014 IN Japan, the automaker Mitsubishi Motors is mired in a heap of trouble.Last month, it acknowledged cheating for the last 25 years on gas-mileage tests for cars in Japan, embarrassing top executives and tarnishing a name that has been dented by scandal before. Since then, its stock price has plunged, and it has had to halt production of the tiny models at the center of the scandal.But in the United States, it\u2019s a brighter picture.Although Mitsubishi is a bit player, it is increasing new-car sales faster than most other automakers and is expanding its sliver of the American market. Helping the surge are a few affordably priced models that can appeal to consumers on tight budgets, a group other car companies often ignore.The company says the vehicles it sells in the United States \u2014 like the Outlander sport utility vehicle and the Lancer compact \u2014 are not affected by the fuel-economy deception that took place in Japan. American customers and dealers seem unfazed.\u201cI read about it; it doesn\u2019t change my mind a bit,\u201d said Timothy Harig, a retired factory worker in Canton, Ohio, who bought a metallic brown Outlander in October for about $24,000, a few thousand less than competing models from Honda and Nissan. \u201cI track my gas mileage on every tank and I\u2019m happy with what I have.\u201dThere are others like Mr. Harig. In April, while the gas-mileage scandal was making headlines in Japan, Mitsubishi\u2019s sales in the United States rose 18 percent.Its performance stands in contrast to that of Volkswagen, which has been mired in an emissions scandal of its own. Last month, Volkswagen sales fell 9 percent, continuing a steady decline since the disclosure in September.If anything, Mitsubishi\u2019s low profile has helped it weather the storm in the United States. \u201cWith Mitsubishi, it\u2019s a very small number of people who even possibly care\u201d about its troubles at home, said Karl Brauer, an analyst with the auto research firm Kelley Blue Book.He added that Mitsubishi enjoyed the continuing support of its major shareholders, including the Mitsubishi Corporation, Japan\u2019s largest trading company with holdings in electronics, finance, machinery and chemicals.\u201cThey still think there\u2019s potential in the U.S. market and so they stick with it,\u201d Mr. Brauer said.Although it is growing in the United States, Mitsubishi still faces hurdles. The gas-mileage controversy has caught the eye of American regulators, and the Environmental Protection Agency has asked the company to provide more information about its vehicles and to repeat one test that is used to determine a car\u2019s official fuel-economy rating.Don Swearingen, chief operating officer of Mitsubishi Motors North America, said the company was complying and was confident there were no irregularities with the fuel-economy ratings of its American models. He added that he had no concerns that the scandal in Japan could hamper Mitsubishi\u2019s push to grow in North America.\u201cI think they are very committed,\u201d Mr. Swearingen said. \u201cWe add tremendous value to the company.\u201dMitsubishi recently reported that its North American business generated $58 million in operating profit in 2015, the second annual profit in a row in the region after seven years of losses.Still, in the highly competitive American market, Mitsubishi struggles to measure up. Its brand is not a household name like Ford, Chevrolet, Honda or Toyota, and it trails in quality. Last year in J. D. Power\u2019s closely watched initial quality study, Mitsubishi ranked well below average.Automakers also increasingly push dealers in the United States to build megashowrooms offering coffee bars and other plush amenities. Mitsubishi showrooms are often small and spartan.Ann Arbor, Mich., for example, has a Mitsubishi dealership, but it is tucked behind Hyundai and Nissan franchises, and is overshadowed by Toyota, BMW and Chevrolet showrooms down the street. On Tuesday, the dimly lit Mitsubishi showroom was occupied by four Outlanders and no sales employees.Ryan Lester, the sales manager, acknowledged that selling Mitsubishis could be tough. \u201cIt is what it is,\u201d he said.Not so long ago, Mitsubishi\u2019s future in the United States was uncertain.In 2000, it admitted that it had covered up safety defects in its vehicles for years. Then, like other automakers, Mitsubishi was hit hard by the recession.In 2011, a devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan disrupted auto production for months. Lacking inventory, Mitsubishi saw its American sales slump in 2012 to fewer than 58,000 vehicles, half the number in 2007.The next year, another small Japanese automaker, Suzuki, exited the United States market, a move that followed Isuzu\u2019s departure in 2008. It seemed Mitsubishi could be next.To turn around its North American business, Mitsubishi trimmed its model line, ending production of one of its most popular cars, the Galant, and leaving itself without a midsize sedan. It also decided to close its lone American plant, in Normal, Ill. Production ended in November.At the same time, Mitsubishi redesigned the Outlander sport utility vehicle, just in time to catch the wave of consumers moving out of cars and into S.U.V.s. The company also added a small car, the Mirage, that could travel 40 miles or more on a gallon of gas.Both vehicles are aggressively priced. The Mirage, for example, starts under $15,000. In the last two months, Mitsubishi offered rebates of $3,500 that brought prices on 2015 Mirages down further, said Doug Waikem, owner of a Mitsubishi dealership in Massillon, Ohio.\u201cI like the brand,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not huge volume, but I can take someone who\u2019s looking at a used car and say, \u2018Hey, I can get you into something new for about the same price.\u2019\u201dThat is just the deal Steven Sanders made at Mr. Waikem\u2019s dealership last month. Mr. Sanders, a Y.M.C.A. teacher and college student, was looking to trade in his beaten-up minivan for a used Honda Civic. New Civics, which sell for $18,000 and up, were out of his price range.But then his wife ran across the Mirage and fell in love with it, Mr. Sanders said. With his trade-in and the rebate, his total cost came in at $11,000.As for Mitsubishi\u2019s troubles in Japan, he didn\u2019t put much stock in it. \u201cI read a lot of reviews,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a friend who has a Mitsubishi.\u201d He added, \u201cI feel good about it.\u201dAn article on the Automobiles page on Friday about Mitsubishi\u2019s growing success in the American automobile market misstated the Mitsubishi Corporation\u2019s relationship to the automaker. It is a shareholder, not the automaker\u2019s parent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.O.P. Donors Shift Focus From Top of Ticket to Senate Races", "Date": "2016-05-20", "News": "Supported byHundreds of millions of dollars that Republican groups had been poised to spend in the 2016 presidential election are now increasingly likely to move into Senate and House races, as many big donors look to distance themselves from the party\u2019s presumptive nominee, Donald J. Trump.These groups and their Democratic counterparts have already spent more than $25 million on advertising in Senate general election races alone, according to Kantar Media/CMAG, significantly outpacing both the 2014 and 2012 campaigns in outside spending. And more than $134 million in advertising for Senate races alone has been reserved by groups for the general election.Mr. Law added that many of the donors to his group, which was founded by Karl Rove, the Republican strategist, are still eager to play a role in the 2016 election, but do not necessarily feel comfortable yet supporting Mr. Trump.\u201cA lot of our donors were investors in either campaigns or super PAC activity on behalf of specific presidential candidates who are no longer in the race, and that investment opportunity has been taken away,\u201d he said.Crossroads, which in early 2015 created a new group devoted solely to protecting the Republican Senate majority, is in a wait-and-see crouch, with officials saying that they currently have no plans to buttress Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy and that they expect the Senate contests to remain the focus.The Koch network announced on Tuesday that it had reserved an additional $30 million in digital and broadcast advertisements in crucial Senate swing states for September alone.And Republican groups that spent more than $25 million trying to stop Mr. Trump\u2019s march to the nomination are also directing their funds elsewhere. The Club for Growth, which ran a series of negative ads against Mr. Trump, has been spending aggressively in Senate and House races in Georgia, Indiana, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, among other states. (The group is frequently a target of criticism in the stump speeches of Mr. Trump, who calls its members \u201ccrooked as hell.\u201d)Larry McCarthy, a Republican ad maker who worked for both Right to Rise, the group that supported Jeb Bush, and Our Principles PAC, an anti-Trump group, said he expected that as money from donors slows to a trickle for the \u201cStop Trump\u201d movement, those donors who might be reluctant to flip and support the candidate will turn to the places where they think their money will have an impact.There is deep concern among Republicans about political divisions and the future of the party, a new Times/CBS News poll shows. We want to hear from the party\u2019s longtime members or those who have just registered as Republicans.\u201cIf the traditional G.O.P. donors and financial infrastructure is not enthusiastic about the presidential race, then they will circle the wagons around the Senate,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said.He noted the \u201ctightrope\u201d that the Republican senatorial candidates can expect to walk with Mr. Trump at the top of the ticket, saying that most of the ads for them will \u201cfeature copy lines of \u2018independence\u2019 and \u2018delivering for their home state.\u2019 \u201dIn New Hampshire, Senator Kelly Ayotte, locked in a tight race with Gov. Maggie Hassan, has received support from 10 different Republican groups, who, combined, have given about $5.8 million, nearly double what Democratic groups have spent on the race.But Democratic groups are also poised to spend a lot more. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee\u2019s independent expenditure arm has nearly $50 million in advertising reservations for both digital and broadcast ads. Senate Majority PAC, which supports Democratic candidates, also has reserved $7.5 million in New Hampshire, $9.5 million in Ohio and $8.5 million in Nevada.Mel Immergut, a prolific fund-raiser for Mr. Bush\u2019s 2016 campaign, said he was watching the presidential race closely, but focusing his energy on the Senate, especially the races of Ms. Ayotte and Senator Rob Portman of Ohio.\u201cI am getting very interested in a number of Senate contests because I think no matter what happens in the presidential election, it\u2019s going to be crucial for the Republican Party to keep control of the Senate,\u201d Mr. Immergut said. \u201cIf Donald Trump wins the White House, obviously having Republican control of the Senate with a new president is important, and that\u2019s even more the case if Hillary Clinton were to win.\u201dTo help Republican candidates navigate the fine line they may have to walk, ad targeting firms are looking for ways to reach voters they had not sought before: \u201cHillary Republicans\u201d and \u201cTrump Democrats,\u201d split-ticket voters who could help Republicans win down-ballot contests.Deep Root Analytics, a Republican data firm specializing in television advertising, has been experimenting with models built around the type of voters who might support Mrs. Clinton at the top of the ballot because they could not bring themselves to vote for Mr. Trump, but who would vote Republican the rest of the way. Or those Democrats drawn to Mr. Trump rather than Mrs. Clinton, who then might also be swayed down ballot.\u201cTwo important political audiences this year are going to be the Hillary Republicans and Trump Democrats,\u201d said Brent McGoldrick, the chief executive officer of Deep Root Analytics. \u201cThat will be the most marketed to, advertised, sought after audience in the free world over the next six months. Those slivers of the electorate who can\u2019t bring themselves to vote for their own candidate. Republicans in swing seats or seats that are safe that now that map has expanded.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Big Insurers Send a Wake-Up Call to Hedge Fund Investors", "Date": "2016-05-12", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseLike many sophisticated investors, the nation\u2019s largest insurers drank the hedge fund Kool-Aid, pouring billions into the high-fee investment funds and helping drive hedge fund assets to over $3 trillion.Now comes the hangover.Steep losses in hedge fund investments during the last quarter damaged many insurance company earnings, reinforcing decisions to rethink the premises that led them to follow the Pied Pipers of finance in the first place.The American International Group said it would cut its hedge fund exposure in half, to $5.5 billion by the end of 2017 from $11 billion at the end of last year. MetLife said it would slash its hedge fund portfolio by two-thirds, to $600 million from $1.8 billion.The pain from the last quarter has shown up most visibly in recent insurers\u2019 results, but it is also spreading to pension funds, endowments and other giant investment funds. Last month, New York City\u2019s largest pension fund said it was abandoning hedge funds entirely, and the Illinois State Board of Investment voted to reduce its hedge fund portfolio by $1 billion.\u201cThey\u2019re finally getting the mediocre results they deserve,\u201d said Simon Lack, an early skeptic about hedge funds and author of \u201dThe Hedge Fund Mirage: The Illusion of Big Money and Why It\u2019s Too Good to Be True.\u201d\u201cI imagine you\u2019ll see more and more institutional investors re-examining their commitment to hedge funds,\u201d Mr. Lack added, \u201cas they see what they\u2019re getting for those outrageously high fees they pay.\u201dListen to the chorus of recent hedge fund criticism. Warren E. Buffett blasted their high fees and mediocre performance at his recent investors\u2019 conference in Omaha. The activist investor and hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb called their recent performance \u201ccatastrophic\u201d in his latest letter to investors.Even the legendary hedge fund manager Steven A. Cohen, whose fund averaged 30 percent annual returns before Mr. Cohen\u2019s close brush with insider trading charges, complained this month: \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to maximize returns and maximize assets.\u201dApart from industry experts, most people probably didn\u2019t realize that insurance companies, which belong to one of the most heavily regulated industries in the country, were big investors in hedge funds, one of the most lightly regulated of all investment vehicles. Then again, before the financial crisis, hardly anyone realized A.I.G. was exposed to trillions of dollars in derivatives tied to mortgage-backed securities until catastrophe struck and the company had to be bailed out by taxpayers for more than $180 billion.Luckily, there\u2019s little danger of that now with hedge funds, because they make up only a small fraction of insurers\u2019 vast investment portfolios. Even at A.I.G., the $11 billion hedge fund portfolio represented just 3 percent of its approximately $340 billion in total investments. At MetLife, hedge funds account for less than one half of a percent.Still, losses from even these small percentages can have a big impact on earnings. A.I.G. reported pretax hedge fund losses of $537 million for the first quarter, which wiped out operating profit and led to an overall loss of $183 million. MetLife reported a 19 percent drop in operating earnings for the quarter, in part because of what Steven J. Goulart, its chief investment officer, said were \u201cnegative\u201d results from hedge funds.Insurers strive to match their liabilities to their assets, which generally means low-volatility United States Treasuries, along with other bonds and fixed income positions. But they are allowed to invest their excess capital any way they see fit.To be sure, those investments are subject to stiffer capital requirements: generally 30 percent in the case of stocks and equity-like investments, which include hedge funds and other so-called alternative investments.Hedge funds promised to provide high equitylike returns, with less volatility, that were uncorrelated with the ups and downs of the stock market \u2014 in other words, a variation on the age-old siren song of higher returns with lower risk.Hardly any of that turned out to be true, at least for insurance companies.What went wrong? Pretty much every everything, based on conversations I had this week with chief investment officers at several insurance companies. \u201cTheir marketing skill proved to be much better than their investing ability,\u201d Mr. Lack said of hedge fund managers.For starters, hedge funds didn\u2019t deliver equitylike returns. Hedge funds have trailed the benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index every year since 2009, often by significant amounts. Even ordinary investors can earn very close to that simply by buying a low-fee index fund.To some extent, that was to be expected in a strong bull market. But the volatile market of the last year was exactly the environment in which so-called long-short hedge funds were supposed to thrive. They didn\u2019t.A major culprit, everyone I spoke to agreed, was the sheer size of assets managed by hedge funds.\u201cWe thought a lot about what\u2019s wrong with the hedge fund space,\u201d said Mr. Goulart, who also serves as an executive vice president at MetLife. \u201cOne problem is that there are just too many funds, roughly 10,000 with almost $3 trillion invested. There\u2019s too much money chasing a limited number of attractive trades.\u201dMany hedge funds found themselves crowded into positions in the same handful of stocks \u2014 such as the controversial drug maker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International \u2014 and found they couldn\u2019t exit positions without causing further big losses even while being hit with investor redemptions.\u201cThe last quarter showed there were a lot of guys in the same trades,\u201d said Douglas Dachille, A.I.G.\u2019s chief investment officer. \u201cThey all looked good until the trade turned against them. Then the exit door turned out to be very small. The result was a lot of bad performance.\u201dMr. Cohen, speaking at the Milken Institute in Santa Monica, Calif., made a similar point: \u201cOne of my biggest worries is that there are so many players out there trying to do similar strategies.\u201d Noting that his fund lost 8 percent in February, he added, \u201cMy worst fears were realized.\u201dHedge funds\u2019 lack of transparency was another problem. Investment officers had trouble matching investment assets to their existing balance sheets when they didn\u2019t know what was in a hedge fund\u2019s portfolio.This was especially true for so-called activist hedge funds, which take large equity positions, hoping to shake up management or otherwise influence corporate strategy. A.I.G., for example, discovered it was invested in hedge funds that were making opposite bets on the same company.And with so many managers \u2014 at its peak, A.I.G. had more than 100 hedge funds \u2014 due diligence was time-consuming and distracting. Mr. Dachille said it took months to review A.I.G.\u2019s positions after he arrived last year.\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder A.I.G. experienced weak performance,\u201d Mr. Lack said. \u201cWith that many funds, you get the average, and the average is mediocre. If you aren\u2019t highly skilled in picking hedge funds, there\u2019s no point in being there.\u201dGiven their weak performance, hedge funds\u2019 high fees \u2014 the so-called two-and-20 formula that characterizes the industry (2 percent of assets under management and 20 percent of any gain) \u2014 were increasingly hard to swallow. \u201cI have no trouble paying great people,\u201d Mr. Dachille said. \u201cBut I get upset when I pay mediocre people great compensation.\u201dHedge funds aren\u2019t about to disappear. A few hedge fund managers continue to post sterling returns, and both A.I.G. and MetLife said they planned to retain some hedge funds that fit their investment strategies and met performance targets.But the hedge fund fever that gripped the investment world for the last decade \u2014 minting scores of billionaires \u2014 may have broken.Over all, hedge fund assets dropped by $14.4 billion during the first quarter of this year after a $26.8 billion decline in the last quarter of 2015.\u201cThere is no doubt,\u201d Mr. Loeb wrote in his letter to investors, \u201cthat we are in the first innings of a washout in hedge funds.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Drought and \u2018Rice First\u2019 Policy Imperil Vietnamese Farmers", "Date": "2016-05-28", "News": "Supported bySOC TRANG, Vietnam \u2014 When the rice shoots began to wither on Lam Thi Loi\u2019s farm in the heart of the Mekong Delta, a usually verdant region of Vietnam, she faced a hard choice: Let them die in the parched earth, or pump salty water from the river to give them a chance.Like many seasoned farmers here, she risked the saline water. The crop perished within days.The Mekong Delta, Vietnam\u2019s premier rice growing region, is suffering its worst drought since French colonial administrators began recording statistics in 1926. Giant cracks, some a foot deep, gouge the hard earth; brown stalks of dead rice litter the fields; and the dryness is so severe even the pests lie shriveled on the ground.\u201cI\u2019ve been planting rice since I was 13, and I have never seen anything like this,\u201d Ms. Loi, 38, said as she sat in her neat living room. \u201cIn February I got one bag of rice. Last year we harvested 1.4 tons.\u201dThe Communist government\u2019s insistence that farmers grow three rice crops a year, instead of the traditional one or two, has depleted the soil of nutrients, exacerbating the impact of the drought, they say.And water from the sea has invaded the lower reaches of the Mekong River, which is more shallow than usual, sweeping saline water farther up the delta than ever before and wiping out rice fields.Saline water has long been invading the delta, but because of the drought there is not enough fresh water in the river and its distributaries to dilute the seawater. The salt is having a more deleterious impact, the scientists say.The rice crop crisis has highlighted the need for the government to adjust its heavy emphasis on rice growing, and to encourage shrimp farming as a more profitable and practical substitute, said Nguyen Huu Thien, a consultant with the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\u201cVietnam is the second-biggest rice exporter after Thailand,\u201d Mr. Thien said, referring to the Southeast Asian region. \u201dBut there is no glory in that because the farmers are not thriving, and there is a lot of migration out of the delta.\u201dThe government is stuck on a \u201crice first\u201d policy that harks back to the 1970s, after the Communist victory in the Vietnam War, when the people were hungry and the country was isolated, bereft of trading partners and without a manufacturing sector.In those days, the government mobilized work teams to construct earthen dikes along major canals in the delta to keep the salt water out and to foster better conditions for rice growing, said Timothy Gorman, a researcher on the delta at Cornell University.Government-financed sluice gates were built in the 1990s, he said. By 2001, some farmers were so fed up with the efforts to hold back the salt water that they attacked the sluice gates and destroyed them, making way for the cultivation of tiger prawns in the western part of the delta.Many farmers know the saline water is good for producing shrimp, Mr. Gorman said, but while they get subsidies for rice, they are not encouraged to switch to shrimp.The construction of hydropower dams upstream from the delta, and dams in China\u2019s southern province of Yunnan, are adding to the woes.A 2010 study commissioned by the Mekong River Commission warned against the building of 11 dams in Laos and Cambodia because they would trap valuable sediment and stop it from reaching the delta. The report was ignored, two of the dams are under construction, and the rest are scheduled to go ahead.In a rare concession to Vietnam, the Chinese released water from dams in Yunnan Province in March, but the flow was too small to make a difference to the failing rice crops, the Vietnamese authorities said.Resentment toward the government is rising among the villagers.Two other big reservoirs of water in the Vietnamese provinces of An Giang and Dong Thap that help soak the rice fields were also at extremely low levels.Ms. Loi said she had not been warned. She went ahead, plowing and planting. She has lost more than $1,000 on seeds, fertilizers and labor, she said.Yet when she attended a meeting called recently by district officials to discuss the problems, the villagers were met with scorn, she said. \u201cThey offered me only $120,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is nothing. We have no right to negotiate with them. They said the farmers don\u2019t know anything. But we do know our business.\u201dOn the banks of the river two hours away, a more prosperous rice farmer, Huynh Anh Dung, 34, presides over six acres of land, his share of a vast property founded by his grandfather nearly 100 years ago.When his rice crop failed in February because of salty water, he decided to forsake a third crop. He knew it was folly to try again.\u201cA friend had a machine that measures the salt in the water,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was 4.8 parts per thousand. Anything over two parts per thousand kills the plants.\u201dSome farmers have fled to Ho Chi Minh City to find work, leaving villages with only half their population.In some towns and villages, farmers like Mr. Dung have comfortable homes with polished wood furniture, televisions, motorbikes for getting around on the roads and outboard motor boats on the rivers. A mildly sweet iced tea, with crushed ice, is served as a welcoming drink to visitors.Mr. Dung is staying put, tethered to his ancestral lands. He had saved enough money from past crops that he did not need part-time work. His uncle had started growing organic bitter melons on a portion of land on the family farm, a project that was doing well.On a recent morning, he hired a worker to dig shallow trenches in the fields so that when the rains finally arrive the salt now embedded in the earth will run away more quickly.The signs of well-being will not last, said Mr. Thien, who was one of the authors of the 2010 report on the dams. With so many dams coming on line upstream, the lack of sediment will eventually kill the delta, leaving it a wasteland in the next 100 years or so.\u201cThe impact of the dams will be irreversible,\u201d he said.Mr. Dung could not see so far into the future. As he contemplated the salt damage, and his scorched earth, thunder rumbled in the distance. Gray clouds hung overhead, the first in six months. \u201cI hope it rains,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greek Debt Talks Enter Familiar Summer Tumult", "Date": "2016-05-09", "News": "Supported byBRUSSELS \u2014 The Greek debt talks are entering an all-too-familiar stage, as the country\u2019s creditors on Monday sought to overcome a standoff over whether to give new aid to Athens.Eurozone finance ministers discussed the bailout terms and for the first time formally debated ways to possibly ease Greece\u2019s giant debt burden. But the talks here on Monday were inconclusive.The ministers said they would meet again on May 24 in hopes of signing off on a long-delayed review of whether Athens is complying with the terms of the 86-billion-euro bailout agreed to last summer \u2014 its third financial lifeline since the crisis began seven years ago.Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers, told a news conference Monday evening that there could be an agreement leading to more aid for Greece at that May 24 meeting.The Greek government said on Monday that it hoped an agreement would make it possible to dispense \u20ac5.7 billion, or about $6.5 billion, from the bailout funds.European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.Once again, though, there are wide gulfs between European officials, Greece and the International Monetary Fund over a continuing austerity program and the prospects of debt relief for Athens.Greece needs the money to make a debt payment in July. If the parties involved do not come to terms, the country could default, and the markets could be put through another summer of tumult. A year ago, the jockeying over the bailout prompted fears that Greece could crash out of the eurozone and destabilize the wider regional economy.The situation does not seem to have changed much in a year.The I.M.F., a major creditor, has been threatening not to contribute to the bailout program if eurozone member states fail to offer Greece some debt relief. And although the Greek Parliament has narrowly approved a bill overhauling the debt-ridden country\u2019s pension and tax systems, workers in Greece started a three-day general strike on Friday, protesting austerity that has cut household incomes by a third, with around 25 percent of Greeks still unemployed.The Eurogroup ministers have struggled for weeks to find common ground between their national governments and the I.M.F., which has demanded far-reaching guarantees to make the prospect of Greece paying back its loans more realistic.Greek debt is around 177 percent of gross domestic product, and its potential to climb was underlined by an analysis prepared by the European Stability Mechanism, the eurozone bailout fund. That analysis, seen by The New York Times on Monday, showed that Greek debt could fall as low as 63 percent of gross domestic product by 2060 \u2014 or rise as high as 258 percent by that same year. The wide range was a result of different scenarios using variables like the Greek growth rate and the external economic environment.Germany, the main national lender, and a number of smaller countries that have endured austerity, are skeptical about whether Greece needs such relief.\u201cMy assumption will be that there will be a problem of debt sustainability that we need to address,\u201d Mr. Dijsselbloem acknowledged during the news conference. \u201cHow big it is, when we need to address it, how we can address it, we will discuss in detail next Eurogroup,\u201d he said.Euclid Tsakalotos, the Greek finance minister, warned over the weekend that imposing more pain on Greece could lead to the breakdown of bailout negotiations and the creation of a \u201cfailed state\u201d in the region that could shake the currency bloc.But on Monday, at a separate news conference after the finance ministers\u2019 meeting, Mr. Tsakalotos suggested that the plans for an austerity \u201cmechanism\u201d were acceptable to Greece.Asked whether the \u201cmechanism\u201d would also be acceptable to the I.M.F., Mr. Tsakalotos indicated there could be still be more wrangling ahead. \u201cThe I.M.F. made it quite clear it wasn\u2019t its favorite mechanism \u2014 that it didn\u2019t think it was what it would have chosen,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think there is a general recognition by the I.M.F. that we can only do what is legally possible.\u201dThere has also been mounting discontent among ordinary Greeks over the new measures. Protests during the weekend\u2019s general strike briefly turned violent on Sunday when hooded youths pelted the police with firebombs and stones outside the Parliament building in central Athens.The package of measures includes 5.4 billion euros, or about $6.2 billion, in budget savings, chiefly stemming from an overhaul of the social security system, including more cuts to pensions and higher social security contributions. The package also includes higher taxes for Greeks on medium and high incomes, and higher levies on alcohol and cigarettes.Niki Kitsantonis contributed reporting from Athens, and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Security Tightened in Paris for French Open", "Date": "2016-05-20", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 Asked if she noted a difference in security this year at the French Open, the Spanish star Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza chose to demonstrate by frisking herself thoroughly.\u201cI sense that there is more focus on it,\u201d she said Friday shortly after the draw at the world\u2019s premier clay-court tennis tournament.The new level of scrutiny at Roland Garros is evident and understandable as France, still in a state of emergency, prepares for two months of sport that also present a major security headache.The European soccer championship, from June 10 to July 10, will be the much bigger challenge, with its full stadiums and fan zones nationwide. But the French Open, nestled among the foliage and red clay on the fringes of the city\u2019s 16th Arrondissement, could also be a target.It begins Sunday with Novak Djokovic aiming to win the only Grand Slam singles title that he lacks and Serena Williams trying to tie Steffi Graf for the Open era record by winning her 22nd major singles title.There are new checkpoints and policies and a much more visible police presence outside the stadium gates, with the security cordon clearly much wider.\u201cI think you have to have confidence in the professionals,\u201d said Guy Forget, the new French Open tournament director. \u201cFor security questions, we are required to count on the professionals: the prefecture of police, the special forces. And we say, \u2018What should we do? Give us the means. We want there to be as close to zero risk as possible.\u2019 And we follow what they tell us to do to the letter.\u201cIn our organization internally, we have security employees inside the stadium because security is not only the risk of an attack. It can be minor things, too. It is to protect the players, the public and all the populations here from the smallest danger. It was always the case, and today we know with the current political situation that the risks are greater, so we have taken much greater measures. And now we will cross our fingers and be as vigilant as possible.\u201dThat Forget, a former French star, is now the tournament director is a reflection of the tumult in the last four months within the French Tennis Federation, which organizes the event. In February, Forget\u2019s predecessor, Gilbert Ysern, was dismissed by the federation president Jean Gachassin and summarily escorted off the Roland Garros premises. Gachassin maintained that Ysern had mishandled the replacement of the French Davis Cup captain Arnaud Clement by Yannick Noah, and too often acted unilaterally.Ysern has disputed those accusations, but Gachassin, the diminutive and ebullient former French rugby star whose final term will soon end, now has major problems of his own, including a police investigation into allegations that he sold French Open tickets that he received as president for personal gain. He has denied the charge through his legal representatives.On May 3, the police searched the French Federation headquarters at Roland Garros. All this does not help the tournament\u2019s expansion cause, which has required public support even if the work is to be largely financed by loans and the federation\u2019s own revenue.\u201cObviously, not one second I\u2019m happy about it,\u201d Federer said after the incident.The timing of this year\u2019s event has only increased the urgency about security. The French Open, which lasts 15 days and attracts crowds of more than 30,000 daily during the first week, will be the most significant and extended sporting event in Paris since the terrorist attacks in November that left 137 dead.\u201cI mean, that\u2019s something I think a lot of the players wanted, as well, is a little bit more security,\u201d Williams said Friday. \u201cWe\u2019ll see. You know, we just want to be here. We want to do what we do. We just want to play tennis. We want to enjoy ourselves and just live our lives.\u201dWilliams, still ranked No. 1 at age 34, has an apartment in Paris, and many other players also have a deep connection with the city and its inhabitants.\u201cThey have gone through a lot,\u201d said Bethanie Mattek-Sands, the reigning French Open women\u2019s doubles champion with Lucie Safarova. \u201cWhen we first heard about those attacks, it was one of those moments where you remember where you were, and you stop for a moment and think about it because it\u2019s not somewhere in a land faraway. It\u2019s the place where you go every year.\u201cComing back, it\u2019s something that is in the back in your mind. It\u2019s something that didn\u2019t happen long ago, and it\u2019s something you can\u2019t really predict. So as much as you don\u2019t want to kind of live in fear of what could happen, you never know. And I hope that the French Open, like with the Olympics and other sports, brings people together. I\u2019m still going to explore and love Paris as I have in years past.\u201dBut work inside the existing site has continued apace, and where Court 7 once stood, there is now a large construction pit, hidden for the duration of the tournament by temporary pavilions and concession stands.The iconic Place des Mousquetaires is also lacking musketeers, with the four statues of the four great French players of the 1920s and 1930s \u2014 Rene Lacoste, Jean Borotra, Henri Cochet and Jacques Brugnon \u2014 no longer in place, at least for the moment, to improve pedestrian flow during the renovation.Roland Garros, overcrowded during the first week in the best of circumstances, could become even more of a scrum in 2016. But that would only be an annoyance. What matters most, of course, is that everyone emerges safe and sound from 15 days of watching forehands, backhands and long, sweeping slides in the terre battue.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inglewood, Calif., Pins Hopes for Commercial Revival on N.F.L.\u2019s Rams", "Date": "2016-05-17", "News": "Supported bySquare Feet7 PhotosINGLEWOOD, Calif. \u2014 At Posh Klipz, the barber and owner Sonny Wells points to a framed photograph of Magic Johnson, sitting for a haircut in his shop two decades ago. \u201cThat was my best client,\u201d Mr. Wells says.Eventually, Mr. Johnson, a longtime Los Angeles Laker, stopped frequenting Posh Klipz, going for the shaved look instead. Chairs really emptied at the barbershop, though, in 1999 after the Lakers and the National Hockey League team the Kings left the Forum here, Mr. Wells said, and moved to the Staples Center in Downtown Los Angeles, about a half-hour\u2019s drive northeast.The development will include about 900,000 square feet of retail space, a hotel, 2,500 residential units and 25 acres of public parks, all on the site of the former Hollywood Park Racetrack. Plans include almost 800,000 square feet of office space.\u201cThis development adds a dimension to the city that it has never had before,\u201d said Inglewood\u2019s mayor, James T. Butts Jr.Inglewood, a city of 110,000, is just 10 miles from downtown Los Angeles and a short drive from its upscale western environs like Beverly Hills. \u201cInglewood is strategically located in the L.A. basin,\u201d said Bob Healey, a senior vice president at the commercial real estate firm CBRE who specializes in the South Bay area of Los Angeles. Mr. Healey added that commercial values in the areas surrounding the stadium site had already risen.The city has a predominantly black, lower-income community with pockets of middle-class residents and a growing Hispanic population, said Jamie Brooks, a CBRE executive.\u201cThe stadium reinforces the idea that this is going to be a destination,\u201d Mr. Brooks said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a master developer to figure it out: This place has a lot of potential.\u201dIn 2005, Stockbridge Capital Group, a real estate investment management firm, acquired the 238-acre Hollywood Park site, across the street from the Forum and a premier place for horse racing in its day. The firm aimed to build the entertainment complex, which will include a 6,000-seat performing arts theater.The Kroenke Group, a development firm founded by Mr. Kroenke, in 2013 bought a 60-acre parcel adjacent to Hollywood Park and the Forum, which reopened in 2014 and hosts many concerts. The groups formed a joint venture the next year, the Hollywood Park Land Company, to develop Hollywood Park and the newly acquired site.\u201cOur deal involved no financial contribution from the city,\u201d said Mr. Butts, who supported the project. \u201cEverything public and private is financed by the developer.\u201dOnly in a year when the city derives more than $25 million in direct tax revenue from the project is it responsible for any financial reimbursement of the cost of public infrastructure, Mr. Butts said.Now, just as values have increased in markets affected by Los Angeles International Airport, Inglewood expects to see the same.\u201cSince Jan. 12 when the announcement was made, if a Realtor puts a sign on a property in the morning, by the time they get back to the office in the afternoon, they usually have five to six offers, $10,000 to $20,000 over asking price,\u201d Mr. Butts said.\u201cN.F.L. stadiums are used little more than 10 times a year,\u201d Mr. Tomer said. \u201cAnd as we\u2019ve supersized our sports facilities, much like other components of American life, it has become difficult to integrate them into the fabric of our cities.\u201dBut in the case of the Inglewood stadium, he added, \u201cTypical rules may not apply.\u201dOne reason is that the stadium is not directly supported by taxpayers. And Inglewood is close to Los Angeles International Airport and will be accessible by light rail after a Metro stop is completed in 2019.While a professional football stadium might not be the reason people and businesses choose Inglewood, Mr. Tomer said, it encourages them to consider it.\u201cThis is the kind of pattern we see in highly successful regional economies like L.A., San Francisco, New York,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s like your Brooklyn. Inglewood could be on that list, but it\u2019s going to be because of access to other amenities and jobs in the regional district.\u201dInglewood businesses hope to claim some of the influx from the project. Linda Credit, 61, opened up the Rusty Pot Caf\u00e9 on South Market Street two years ago. The restaurant, one of the few lively storefronts on the street, serves the kind of kale salads and specialty aiolis more often found in nearby Santa Monica.\u201cI was thinking about moving,\u201d Ms. Credit said. But the council members who stopped in for lunch urged her to stay before the N.F.L. announcement. \u201cIt\u2019s changing, and that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d she said.Mayor Butts said, \u201cI really do believe that within five years you won\u2019t be able to recognize the new Inglewood.\u201dAmelia Hernandez, 32, runs Selwyn Jewelers, a family business a few blocks from the Rusty Pot Caf\u00e9 on South Market Street. While she expressed concerned about how to keep a mom-and-pop business competitive as bigger enterprises come in, she predicted the development would help the area. \u201cBuy in Inglewood,\u201d she said. \u201cDo not sell.\u201dLast month, Keion Morgan, 37, was in Posh Klipz barbershop in preparation for a job interview as a college recruiter. He grew up in Inglewood and hopes it will have more options as his two young sons mature, he said.\u201cI\u2019m blessed to \u2014 I guess you say \u2014 make it out of the \u2019hood, or the \u2019wood,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of opportunity.\u201dMr. Wells, the barber, said he wanted to secure a long-term lease because he expected rents to rise. But over all, his outlook was positive.\u201cClients are excited. We\u2019re excited,\u201d said Mr. Wells, who has been in the city 22 years. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to get some of those N.F.L. players in that chair.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on the Square Foot page on Wednesday about a revival of Inglewood, Calif., underpinned by a new stadium and a new National Football League team, referred incorrectly to the founding of the Kroenke Group, a development firm involved in that revival. It was founded in the 1980s \u2014 not in 2013, which was the year that the firm bought a parcel of land next to Hollywood Park and the Forum in Inglewood.Advertisement"}

His wife, Chirlane McCray, introduced the celebrity draw for the $100-minimum-donation event, the comedian Louis C.K.

A jury sided with Google.Do you understand any of this? I\u2019m guessing no. The upshot for you is, thanks to this win, your phone won\u2019t get superexpensive and will probably still keep getting better. And that\u2019s probably pretty much all you care about.Let\u2019s talk about the big news of the week, or month, in tech and media land: #Thielgate.The story is sort of unbelievable, in and of itself, but also hits a sweet spot within all the crazy things that editors love: tech, billionaires, tech billionaires and, of course, media.The basic argument of those on the tech side was that Gawker was singularly bad. They said that Gawker abused its journalistic platform, it routinely invaded people\u2019s private lives, including outing their sexual orientation, and in other ways made life very difficult for wealthy coastal techies.I\u2019ve certainly not been a fan of everything Gawker has done. But I\u2019m struck by the inability of techies to consider both the proportionality of this punishment and the chilling effects this case could induce on the media generally.

And I don\u2019t see how techies could support that.All of these examples are potentially far more damaging to the world than a leaked sex tape.

Do tech venture capitalists really want to support a system in which moving fast and breaking things results in company-ending lawsuits?I\u2019m not sure I quite believe that. But it\u2019s fair to say that Gawker had its day in court \u2014 with a lot of caveats over jurisdiction and judge and jury, Gawker supporters would say \u2014 and that the company lost the case.

No. Do I think they do good journalism? Absolutely.

{"Headline": "A Rich Feast of Folk Art at the New-York Historical Society", "Date": "2016-05-19", "News": "Supported byArt ReviewFolk art barely existed as a term, much less a category in the years just before 1920, when it became a presiding passion of the Polish-born American sculptor Elie Nadelman (1882-1946). After spending six years absorbing modernity in Paris, the young artist landed in New York in 1914, his crossing on the Lusitania financed by Helena Rubinstein, a client.Constantly on the lookout for sculptural inspiration, Nadelman was already taken with European peasant art and was also buying antiquities before he reached New York. Within a few years, folk art from both continents would fuel some of his best and most expressive work, the svelte carved-wood figures of dancers and dandies he called woods. Moreover, folk art was a crucial element in his marriage to Viola Spiess Flannery, a widow, American heiress and, like him, natural-born collector. Antique textiles were among her early interests.The couple wed in 1919, using their honeymoon to visit museums of peasant art in Oslo and Stockholm. Soon, they were conducting intense buying sorties paid for by Viola\u2019s fortune and Elie\u2019s portrait commissions, in the Old World, New York and the American Northeast into Canada. Their omnivorous shopping \u2014 which included the purchase of French and American pharmacies \u2014 reached a peak, but hardly ceased, in 1926. That year, they opened the Museum of Folk and Peasant Arts in a stone building that they erected and later expanded on Alderbrook, their estate overlooking the Hudson in Riverdale, N.Y. It was the first museum of folk art in this country and the first anywhere to combine American and European material.This show and its exceptional catalog, which adds \u201cMaking It Modern\u201d to the title, form a rich feast of art, art-world history and visual dot-connecting. Research was greatly bolstered in 2012, when the Historical Society was given several boxes of the index cards that the couple kept on their purchases by their granddaughter, Cynthia Nadelman, an art critic, poet and editor.The roughly 250 objects here skim across the collection but indicate its scope and aims, one of which was to show American folk art\u2019s roots in European peasant art. The four needlepoint samplers on view are variously American, German and Spanish. Two wood blanket chests decorated with repeating arched-window motifs are 17th-century Swiss (carved) and 18th-century American (painted).The show is loosely divided between cases of mostly frivolous things (toys, amusing ceramics and fabulous painted boxes) and the functional, often beautifully decorated tools, especially those for baking and textile-making. Sometimes the function was to decorate, as with a Swiss wafer iron and several carved wooden butter molds. Sometimes the objects leave you clueless as to function, or name. For example, a well-used length of wood carved with medallions and the year 1791 is a mangle board, used for pressing linen \u2014 a harbinger of irons. A kakelorum is an early roulette game: A marble dropped into a carved spiral figure circles down to a plate with round indentations, each numbered. Pick a number, insert a marble, see where it lands.The displays range from several large cigar-store figures and a marvelous ship\u2019s figurehead of a flirtatious woman \u2014 whose once-broken forearm is a replacement carved by Nadelman \u2014 to 10 mostly American mechanical toys and banks and eight ornate lace bobbins from Hungary. Whenever possible, the couple seem to have bought in quantity. The 17 radiant painted-paper cutout figures, sometimes with interiors, that they called paper dolls were selected from 85 purchased on a trip to Drummondville, Quebec.This show was organized by Margaret K. Hofer, a longtime curator at the Historical Society who became its director six months ago, and Roberta J. M. Olson, an art historian and, since 1999, the society\u2019s first curator of drawings. They have smartly included 11 sculptures by Nadelman, predominantly the woods, which give the show an exciting spin. The mutual enhancement especially clarifies both Nadelman\u2019s debt to folk art and his original use of it: his playful but unerring perfection of line, shape, facial expression and applied color. He streamlined his inspirations into forms that are at once weightless and solid, modern and timeless. If these volumes say now, their astutely worn painted surfaces say then, and forever.You can often sense Nadelman\u2019s relentless opportunistic eye. His lovely \u201cPiano Player\u201d and the gliding couple of \u201cTango\u201d have distant ancestors in the mechanical toys, one wearing a top hat. A pair of plain wood clothespins predict the curves and buoyant stances of his figures. The small convex circus horses on a carved cake print (think shortbread) encapsulate his clean, rounding line. A pair of crude but charmingly carved wood milliner heads and one made of painted papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 attest to his attraction to both unadorned material and applied color. Clearly, Nadelman found this piece and a case of wonderful chalkwork (painted plaster) figures and a bust germane.Next to the chalkwork are a pair of smallish ceramic casts of two female acrobats, one glazed, one painted. (Greatly enlarged versions of them have reigned over the lobby of the former New York State Theater \u2014 now the Koch \u2014 at Lincoln Center for decades.)Those interested in the evolution of the New York art world will want to delve into the catalog. The curators lead off with the history of the collection, including the Nadelmans\u2019 desperate attempts to keep it. (The loss unquestionably shortened Elie\u2019s life.) Elizabeth Stillinger, a scholar who has written previously on the collection, sets it, its creators and (for a time) their lavish lifestyle within the fascinating context of other early artist-collectors of folk art in America, like William and Marguerite Zorach, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, and Charles Sheeler.Cynthia Nadelman details the life and avid collecting instincts of her grandmother, Viola, as well as her skillful multitasking, which so benefited the museum. According to the curators, Viola may have felt slighted when, to protect the remainder of her fortune from creditors, it was decided that the New-York Historical Society\u2019s transformative acquisition would be called the Elie Nadelman Folk Art Collection. This show and its catalog delineate her full participation and reinstate her name.\u201cThe Folk Art Collection of Elie and Viola Nadelman\u201d is on view through Aug. 21 at the New-York Historical Society, 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street; 212-873-3400, nyhistory.org.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greek Lawmakers Narrowly Approve Austerity Legislation", "Date": "2016-05-22", "News": "Supported byATHENS \u2014 After days of heated debate, Greek lawmakers voted narrowly on Sunday to approve a fresh set of financial measures aimed at ensuring that eurozone finance ministers will decide this week to unlock billions of euros in badly needed rescue loans from the country\u2019s third bailout.The legislation passed 153 to 145, with all of the government coalition members in Parliament voting in favor. It includes a one percentage point increase in the highest rate of sales tax to 24 percent, higher taxes on coffee, alcohol, fuel and other goods and new rules liberalizing the market for nonperforming bank loans. There is also a measure creating a privatization fund to sell off state assets and utilities, including public transport companies, the post office and the state power corporation.The legislation also introduces a so-called contingency mechanism that would cut state spending if Greece misses budget targets set by its creditors for the next three years.Addressing Parliament before the vote, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said he had \u201cnegotiated hard to secure the chance for the country to stand on its own two feet.\u201d He later added: \u201cToday, European leaders get the message that Greece is keeping its promises. Now, it\u2019s their turn to do the same.\u201dKyriakos Mitsotakis, the leader of the main opposition party, the conservative New Democracy, accused the leftist-led governing coalition \u2014 which first came to power on a pledge to reverse austerity before signing a third bailout \u2014 of \u201corganized political fraud.\u201d Mr. Mitsotakis, whose party is leading in opinion polls, said the new taxes would \u201cannihilate everyone\u201d and accused the government of \u201cplebifying the middle class.\u201dOutside the Parliament building, protesters gathered to express their exasperation at yet another round of austerity measures. The ones approved on Sunday came on top of pension cuts and increases to income tax adopted earlier this month.The vote came two days before eurozone finance ministers are to meet in Brussels to sign off on rescue loans for Greece and decide what kind of debt relief to offer.Greece and its European creditors have been locked in talks on how to reduce the country\u2019s debt burden, which the International Monetary Fund is insisting on before it joins Greece\u2019s third international bailout. The bailout agreement, signed last summer, is worth 86 billion euros, or $96.5 billion. It follows two bailouts worth a total of 240 billion euros that Greece\u2019s eurozone partners and the I.M.F. granted in 2010 and 2012 in exchange for a barrage of measures that have slashed the economy by a quarter and pushed the unemployment rate to 25 percent.Last week, the I.M.F. said that Greece would need a lengthy period free from debt repayments to put its finances on a stable footing. But eurozone nations, led by Germany, are reluctant to offer debt relief to Greece, fearing the political impact of obliging the taxpayers bailing out Greece to bear an even bigger burden for the country\u2019s past profligacy.Unless the I.M.F. and eurozone officials find a compromise \u2014 or agree to further postpone a decision on the I.M.F.\u2019s participation in the third bailout \u2014 a new crisis is likely.Greece needs fresh bailout loans to pay down some 3.6 billion euros of debt maturing in July. And the prospect of new upheaval in Greece is of particular concern as Europe faces other potentially destabilizing challenges, including a migrant crisis \u2014 with Greece a major transit country for thousands of desperate people \u2014 and a crucial vote in June on Britain\u2019s continued membership in the European Union.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republican Party Unravels Over Donald Trump\u2019s Takeover", "Date": "2016-05-07", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisBy seizing the Republican presidential nomination for Donald J. Trump on Tuesday night, he and his millions of supporters completed what had seemed unimaginable: a hostile takeover of one of America\u2019s two major political parties.Rarely if ever has a party seemed to come apart so visibly. Rarely, too, has the nation been so on edge about its politics.Many Americans still cannot believe that the bombastic Mr. Trump, best known as a reality television star, will be on the ballot in November. Plenty are also anxious about what he would do in office.But for leading Republicans, the dismay is deeper and darker. They fear their party is on the cusp of an epochal split \u2014 a historic cleaving between the familiar form of conservatism forged in the 1960s and popularized in the 1980s and a rekindled, atavistic nationalism, with roots as old as the republic, that has not flared up so intensely since the original America First movement before Pearl Harbor.Some even point to France and other European countries, where far-right parties like the National Front have gained power because of the sort of resentments that are frequently given voice at rallies for Mr. Trump.Yet if keeping the peace means embracing Mr. Trump and his most divisive ideas and utterances, a growing number are loath to do it.The ties between Republican elites \u2014 elected officials, donors and Washington insiders \u2014 and voters have actually been fraying for years. Traditional power brokers long preached limited-government conservatism and wanted to pursue an immigration overhaul, entitlement cuts, free trade and a hawkish foreign policy, and nominees like John McCain and Mitt Romney largely embraced that agenda. Republican leaders also vilified President Obama and Democrats, stoking anger with rank-and-file conservatives.Many Republican voters trudged along with those earlier nominees, but never became truly animated until Mr. Trump offered them his brand of angry populism: a blend of protectionism at home and a smaller American footprint abroad. And he was able to exploit their resentments and frustrations because those same Republican leaders had been nurturing those feelings for years with attacks on Mr. Obama, Democrats, illegal immigrants and others.Mr. Trump, with his steadfast promises to deport immigrants who are in the country illegally and to build a wall with Mexico, may have done irreversible damage to his general election prospects. But he quickly earned the trust that so many of those voters had lost in other fixtures of America \u2014 not just in its leaders, but in institutions like Congress, the Federal Reserve and the big-money campaign finance system that Mr. Trump has repudiated, as well as in corporations, the Roman Catholic Church and the news media.12 PhotosAnd he has amplified his independent, outsider message in real time, using social media and cable news interviews \u2014 and his own celebrity and highly attuned ear for what resonates \u2014 to rally voters to his side, using communication strategies similar to those deployed in the Arab Spring uprising or in the attempts by liberals and students to foment a similar revolution in Iran.\u201cTrump leveraged a perfect storm,\u201d said Steve Case, the founder of AOL, in an email message. \u201cA combo of social media (big following), brand (celebrity figure), creativity (pithy tweets), speed/timeliness (dominating news cycles).\u201dMr. Trump is an unlikely spokesman for the grievances of financially struggling, alienated Americans: a high-living Manhattan billionaire who erects skyscrapers for the wealthy and can easily get politicians on the phone. But as a shrewd business tactician, he understood the Republican Party\u2019s customers better than its leaders did and sensed that his brand of populist, pugilistic, anti-establishment politics would meet their needs.After seething at Washington for so long, hundreds or thousands of miles from the capital, many of these voters now see Mr. Trump as a kind of savior. Even if he does not detail his policies, even if his language strikes them as harsh sometimes, his supporters thrill more to his plain-spoken slogans like \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d than to what they see as the cautious and poll-tested policy speeches of Mr. Ryan and other Washington Republicans.\u201cI love the death out of Paul Ryan, but honestly, I\u2019m going to vote for Trump anyways,\u201d said David Myers, 49, who attended a campaign rally for Mr. Trump in Charleston, W.Va., on Thursday night. \u201cBecause Paul Ryan, and I love him to death, but he\u2019s one of those career politicians.\u201dMr. Trump now feels so empowered that he does not think he needs the political support of the party establishment to defeat the likely Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton. He is confident that his appeal will be broad and deep enough among voters of all stripes that he could win battleground states like Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania without the support of leaders like Mr. Ryan, Mr. Trump said in an interview on Saturday.Although he plans to meet with Mr. Ryan and House Republican leaders on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he would not materially change his policies or style to win their endorsements. \u201cEverything is subject to negotiation, but I can\u2019t and won\u2019t be changing much, because the voters support me because of what I\u2019m saying and how I\u2019m saying it,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThe establishment didn\u2019t do anything to make me the nominee, so its support won\u2019t really make much difference in me winning in November.\u201d (Mr. Trump will, though, be somewhat dependent on the party\u2019s fund-raising muscle since he has indicated he will not fully self-finance his general election campaign.)One reason Mr. Trump takes a skeptical view of establishment support is that he does not believe much in the power of the Republican elite. He is the party\u2019s presumptive nominee, after all, because the political forces that once might have halted his rise have been enfeebled. Leaders such as Mr. Romney warned in the direst terms that Mr. Trump\u2019s nomination would stain the party and lead it to ruin. Venerable media outlets on the right, like National Review, sought to reprise their role as arbiters of who is fit to carry the banner of conservatism. Their pleas fell on deaf ears.Mr. Trump\u2019s arsenal was far more fearsome. Combining modern-day fame and an age-old demagogy, he bypassed the ossified gatekeepers and appealed directly to voters through a constant Twitter stream that seemed interrupted only by television appearances.In doing so, he seemed to grasp that a new twist on direct democracy was in the offing: that disaffected voters who tune out the traditional modes of political communication might be reachable through their smartphones, and Twitter messages or Reddits might be more relevant to those voters than the findings of a more scientific poll.On the left, too, Senator Bernie Sanders has built his own movement with millions of voters, and $210 million in fund-raising, by using online tools as simple as email to seek support. Yet Mr. Trump\u2019s celebrity has been an enormous asset with voters who feel gratified and inspired that he would lavish them with attention and bluntly express some of the ideas and attitudes they share.For 12 consecutive years, polls have indicated that Americans believe the country is on the wrong track, and Republicans have been especially vulnerable to a political campaign like Mr. Trump\u2019s that seeks to channel voter anger. In every state where the question was asked in exit polls during the primary season, 50 percent or more of Republicans said they felt betrayed by their leaders.The adhesive that once held Republicans together \u2014 a shared commitment to a strong national defense and limited government \u2014 was weakened by the demise of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War. But internal divisions were papered over when new, unifying threats emerged after the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.It was not until near the end of President George W. Bush\u2019s second term that those fissures broke open again, first with Mr. Bush\u2019s attempt at an immigration overhaul, including a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, and then after the financial rescue of big banks from the 2008 financial collapse.Alongside the turbulent economy were signs of something more profound plaguing blue-collar white communities, which have increasingly become core Republican constituencies: an increase in children born to single parents, higher rates of addiction and suicide, and shortened average life spans.\u201cThe economic deprivation of the last 30 years for working-class whites, combined with growing social isolation, was really dry tinder,\u201d said Robert D. Putnam, the Harvard political scientist who wrote \u201cBowling Alone.\u201d And Mr. Trump, Mr. Putnam contended, \u201clit a spark.\u201d\u201cHe constructed a series of scapegoats that these folks would find plausible,\u201d said Mr. Putnam, citing Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on Muslims and immigrants. \u201cHe was willing to say things that might have always been popular, but you couldn\u2019t say it.\u201dWith Mr. Trump now saying it loudly and clearly, many Americans feel deeply unsettled by the nation\u2019s politics. Not since Mr. Bush invaded Iraq have so many liberals been murmuring about moving to other countries. And many Republican officials and donors just hope to get through the election with their party intact.\u201cThe party has never been more out of touch with our voters,\u201d Vin Weber, a former Minnesota congressman, said of the two factions, acknowledging that Republicans could splinter completely after this election. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you reconcile a lot of them.\u201dMr. Weber expressed hope that Mr. Trump and Mr. Ryan would find some common ground. But few in the party now deny that the threat of an enduring split is real.\u201cI think there\u2019s a pretty clear Trump wing of the party coming to life,\u201d said Barry Wynn, a prominent fund-raiser who supported Jeb Bush for president and has not yet fallen in behind Mr. Trump. \u201cBut I have to think that four or eight years from now, the Trump wing will be a little more traditional, a little less hard-edged, and will be blended into the party just like the evangelical Pat Robertson voters were after the 1988 election.\u201d\u201cAt least,\u201d he added, \u201cI hope that\u2019s what\u2019ll happen.\u201dNick Corasaniti contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Revenge and the Future of Media Finances", "Date": "2016-05-26", "News": "Supported byThe Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel has put the future of Gawker Media in doubt by secretly funding a successful lawsuit that threatens to undermine the media company\u2019s finances.To do it, Mr. Thiel, a co-founder of PayPal, adopted tactics from a strategy used by investment firms and others who are increasingly underwriting lawsuits in the hope of turning a profit on their outcomes. Over the last decade, the types of lawsuits that have attracted outside money range from product liability claims brought by consumers against manufacturers to lawsuits filed by one business against a competitor over commercial issues like copyright violation.But Mr. Thiel has also turned the model of third-party lawsuit funding on its head. Instead of looking for profits, the entrepreneur had a personal goal: extracting revenge against Gawker and warning others who adopted the website\u2019s ethos that they could face similar legal attacks.Now, the question running through many media circles is whether other wealthy people upset with news accounts will decide to follow Mr. Thiel\u2019s example and go after other organizations. And if so, to what extent those suits could hurt the financial future of media companies and stifle free speech.But legal experts said that a lawsuit, regardless of who is funding it, will ultimately succeed or fall based on its merits.\u201cThis case is unusual,\u201d said Michael McDonald, an assistant professor of finance at Fairfield University in Connecticut who also works as a consultant to lawsuit investors.Mr. Thiel said he was irate that a website owned by Gawker had, among other things, outed him and several of his friends as gay, solely to be prurient. And an instrument used to channel his outrage was a lawsuit filed by the retired wrestler Hulk Hogan against Gawker that the entrepreneur financed with about $10 million.The former wrestler, whose real name is Terry Gene Bollea, sued Gawker Media for invasion of privacy after it published a video of him having sex, and a Florida jury recently awarded him $140 million.\u201cI saw Gawker pioneer a unique and incredibly damaging way of getting attention by bullying people,\u201d Mr. Thiel said in an interview this week.Experts like Mr. McDonald said they were hard-pressed to find other examples in which someone financed a lawsuit in the hope of settling a score. One exception appears to be a libel action brought in 1990s against James B. Stewart over his book \u201cDen of Thieves,\u201d which examined a series of Wall Street scandals including one involving Michael Milken, the junk bond king.That lawsuit, which was brought by a minor character in the book, was financed by Mr. Milken\u2019s brother, according to a 2002 article in Legal Affairs, a magazine. The case against Mr. Stewart, who is now a columnist for The New York Times, was dismissed, but not before millions of dollars in legal fees were spent.The case involving Mr. Thiel has raised questions about whether media companies may face other such costly cases in the future.Lawsuits financed by third parties are legal. But as the legal financing industry has grown, business groups have claimed that outside investing helps fuel frivolous litigation. Other experts, however, see the involvement of outside funders as a boon that helps plaintiffs without resources take on deep-pocketed defendants.\u201cMany academics fully embrace third-party litigation funding as leveling the playing field,\u201d said Nora Freeman Engstrom, a professor at Stanford Law School.The precise nature of the relationship between Mr. Thiel and Mr. Bollea\u2019s lawyer is unclear. However, legal experts like Ms. Engstrom that say lawyers who accept funds from people who are not parties to a case face certain obligations, like not disclosing confidential information obtained during a lawsuit to an investor or placing an investor\u2019s interests ahead of those of a client.Roy D. Simon, a professor emeritus of legal ethics at Hofstra University School of Law, said the interplay among an investor, a lawyer and a plaintiff could get tricky. While most firms that invest in litigation are happy to settle a case for the right price, an aggrieved individual who doesn\u2019t need money might be more interested in driving a case to judgment. Gawker Media made several settlement offers.\u201cThe ordinary investor would not have an ax to grind,\u201d Mr. Simon said.For a plaintiff, significant legal hurdles exist for a lawsuit against a media organization to be successful. In addition, many states have adopted laws intended to deter lawsuits filed by companies and others seeking to chill advocacy on public policy issues. Such actions are known as strategic lawsuits against public participation, or Slapp suits.Anthony Sebok, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in New York, said parties in a case were not normally required to disclose whether outside investors were funding a lawsuit. But the issue has come to the attention of Congress.Last year, two Republican Senators, Charles E. Grassley of Iowa and John Cornyn of Texas, sent a letter to three of this country\u2019s largest litigation financing firms, asking about the types of cases they funded, the financial arrangements and their return on investment.\u201cThird-party litigation financing pumps millions of dollars into our justice system,\u201d Senator Cornyn wrote at the time, \u201cand the current lack of oversight makes it difficult to track this money\u2019s influence.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brazilian Lawmaker Behind Rousseff Impeachment Is Told to Step Down", "Date": "2016-05-05", "News": "Supported byThe decision added to the political turmoil in Brazil, a country deeply divided over its scandal-plagued leaders. Just this week, Vice President Michel Temer, the man preparing to take over the president\u2019s office from Ms. Rousseff, was ordered to pay a fine for violating campaign financing limits.The twin decisions are not expected to save Ms. Rousseff\u2019s presidency. Support for her ouster remains strong in the Senate, which is preparing to vote next week on whether to remove her from office and put her on trial over claims of budgetary manipulation.Still, the decisions tarnish the men in line to take over from her. Despite his conviction, Mr. Temer is still expected to become president if Ms. Rousseff is removed by the Senate. Yet the ruling could make him ineligible to run for elected office for eight years, creating an unusual situation in which a politician who may be barred from campaigning ends up running the country.Brazil is in the midst of its deepest political crisis in decades, with its president facing impeachment proceedings and many in Congress facing criminal or corruption charges.Scholars and political analysts described the initial ruling by Justice Zavascki, which the 11-member court later endorsed, as reflecting the capacity for Brazil\u2019s legal system to curb abuses of power. Joaquim Barbosa, a former chief justice of the Supreme Court, called the move \u201cextraordinary and courageous.\u201dThe ruling to remove Mr. Cunha, an evangelical Christian radio commentator, sidelines a top political opponent of Ms. Rousseff after much of his role in impeachment process had been completed. The impeachment decision is now in the hands of the Senate, which is expected to vote against the president on May 11.Mr. Cunha can appeal the ruling against him, and he is expected to do so. A spokesman for Mr. Temer said he would not appeal his conviction and would pay a fine of about $23,000. (Mr. Temer, 75, has already signaled that if he were to become president, he would not run for re-election.)In a statement, Mr. Temer\u2019s office said that he had exceeded the limit for campaign donations because of a \u201ccalculation error.\u201d Mr. Temer\u2019s office also said that he would become ineligible to run for office only if another court chose to act on the electoral court\u2019s ruling.In the lower house, attention now shifts to Waldir Maranh\u00e3o, an obscure ally of Mr. Cunha poised to take over as speaker. Like Mr. Cunha, Mr. Maranh\u00e3o is under investigation on graft charges, raising the possibility that the Supreme Court could also order him to step down.Dilma Rousseff, Brazil\u2019s president, is facing removal from office. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the proceedings.The legal clouds around Mr. Cunha and Mr. Temer raise concerns over the legitimacy of a possible government led by their centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, which recently broke an alliance with Ms. Rousseff\u2019s leftist Workers\u2019 Party to seek her impeachment.The ruling involving Mr. Temer was issued on Tuesday in a case before an electoral court in S\u00e3o Paulo. In that case, prosecutors were trying to increase the fine against him over campaign donations he made in 2014. The court decided against increasing the fine, but it upheld the ruling that Mr. Temer had violated campaign finance laws.Mr. Temer said this week that he saw no problem naming such politicians to his cabinet, maintaining that they were innocent until proven guilty.D\u00e9bora Nogueira and Paula Moura contributed reporting from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Chief Fund-Raiser Heads Straight for Las Vegas", "Date": "2016-05-12", "News": "Supported byLAS VEGAS \u2014 Less than a week after being recruited by Donald J. Trump to be his campaign fund-raiser, Steven Mnuchin did not waste any time looking for big-money donors.On Wednesday, Mr. Mnuchin met with hedge fund managers at the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas, where the nation\u2019s largest hedge fund conference, the SkyBridge Alternatives Conference, or SALT, is being held.On the sidelines of the conference, Mr. Mnuchin sat with Scott Brown, the former Republican senator from Massachusetts, as he shook hands with prospective Trump donors.Later, Mr. Mnuchin attended a dinner that included the billionaire hedge fund manager Kenneth C. Griffin, David H. Petraeus, the former C.I.A. director and general, and John A. Boehner, the former House speaker. The host of the dinner was Anthony Scaramucci, who runs the investment firm SkyBridge Capital and who last week publicly endorsed Mr. Trump.It is hard to avoid presidential politics this year at SALT, where prominent hedge fund managers weigh in on subjects like the economy and geopolitics and tax policies in the United States. It is the main topic in the speeches delivered on the brightly lit stage and in the closed-door meetings and Champagne-filled after-hours events.Mr. Trump picked Mr. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs executive who is a hedge fund veteran, to be his finance chairman to help him raise as much as $1.5 billion for his campaign.For many on Wall Street, however, publicly supporting Mr. Trump is awkward. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee has been vocal in speaking out against hedge fund managers, talking tough about their pay and saying they \u201cget away with murder.\u201d He has also said he plans to put an end to a tax advantage called carried interest that enables private equity and hedge fund executives to treat their income at the lower capital gains rate, rather than having it taxed as ordinary income.Many of the biggest political backers in the financial world have put sizable amounts of money into the failed campaigns for other Republican presidential hopefuls, like Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush. While many have said they would never support a Democratic candidate, they have also publicly objected to Mr. Trump.Before becoming one of the first on Wall Street to back him, Mr. Scaramucci had been one of Mr. Trump\u2019s loudest critics. Less than a year ago, he called Mr. Trump a \u201chack politician,\u201d warning that his politics were divisive.Mr. Scaramucci had served as Scott Walker\u2019s top fund-raiser and his national finance co-chairman. After Mr. Walker dropped out of the political race in September, urging some of his rivals to follow his lead so that the party could unite against Mr. Trump, Mr. Scaramucci became a fund-raiser for Mr. Bush.But at SALT, Mr. Scaramucci took a very different approach.Mr. Trump, he said, was \u201csaying cuckoo-la-la things to insult the intelligentsia because what he\u2019s discovered is that the average American, the red-meat eating Middle American, loves the swipes at the know-it-alls and I think Donald Trump is enjoying doing that.\u201dMr. Scaramucci met twice with Mr. Trump to talk about his election campaign. The two even discussed the possibility of Mr. Trump coming to speak as a surprise guest at the SALT conference this week.The oil tycoon T. Boone Pickens said at the conference that he expected most Republicans to eventually fall in line and back Mr. Trump.\u201cYou sit there and you say, well, Donald Trump wasn\u2019t who I wanted \u2014 but you have no other choice,\u201d Mr. Pickens said in an interview. Next month, Mr. Pickens will hold a fund-raiser at his ranch in Texas to raise money for Mr. Trump, but he declined to comment on how much he might be willing to donate.Speaking to an audience of money managers on Wednesday, Mr. Pickens said that he agreed with Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal to ban Muslims unless they were vetted.\u201cI\u2019m tired of having politicians as president of the United States,\u201d he added. Yet a year ago, Mr. Pickens announced he would back Mr. Bush, the former governor of Florida.In private and public, hedge fund managers here in Las Vegas have expressed concern that the possibility of Mr. Trump as president could pose a risk to the economy and markets.Others have lamented a decision by Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, not to run for president.Mr. Bloomberg, who addressed an audience in the ballroom of the Bellagio on Wednesday, considered entering the political arena as an independent candidate but decided not to run out of concern that he would help Mr. Trump to secure the nomination. He declined to endorse any candidate when pressed onstage.Mr. Boehner, the former House speaker, made the rounds of the conference, speaking onstage and in private sessions about his views on the apparent unraveling of the Republican Party as Mr. Trump won primary after primary.\u201cWhen you look at Donald Trump and you look at Bernie Sanders, what it tells you is that there is a lot of frustration in America,\u201d Mr. Boehner told a small group of money managers in a session held by Morgan Stanley.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What I Got Wrong About Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-05-04", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceWe will never know just how wrong we were about Donald Trump.Did he have a 1 percent chance to win when he descended the escalator of Trump Tower last June? Twenty percent? Or should we have known all along?The answer, as best I can tell, is all of the above.I do think we \u2014 and specifically, I \u2014 underestimated Mr. Trump. There were bad assumptions, misinterpretations of the data, and missed connections all along the way.But I also think Mr. Trump was a tremendous long shot when he entered the race, and even for months thereafter. Victory wasn\u2019t inevitable \u2014 and it took a lot to go his way.If there was anything that should have signaled that \u201cthis time would be different\u201d from the very start, it was 17: the number of Republican candidates who entered the race.The sheer number kept many donors and officials on the sidelines, waiting to see who would emerge as a strong contender. It diffused whatever power the \u201cparty elite\u201d had to influence the outcome.It created a huge collective action problem, in which none of the Republican candidates had a clear incentive to attack Mr. Trump \u2014 just their rivals for their niche of the Republican Party. The effect was to legitimize Mr. Trump as an ordinary candidate and to damage the others.And at just about every stage, there were too many candidates to mount a truly effective anti-Trump effort. By New Hampshire, there were still nine. In South Carolina, there were six. On Super Tuesday, there were five. The race narrowed to three candidates only after two-thirds of all of the delegates to the Republican convention had been awarded. It became a one-on-one race only after Mr. Trump had effectively secured the nomination.Maybe Mr. Trump really did have a \u201cceiling\u201d at various stages. There was evidence for it in public polling and in the actual results. We\u2019ll never know.Another result of the large field was that Mr. Trump\u2019s opposition was always far less organized and underfunded than it would otherwise have been. A candidate like Marco Rubio never had a chance to take advantage of the benefits that usually accompany elite support; he didn\u2019t have time.It was clear from the start that Jeb Bush was a weak establishment front-runner. I never thought much of Mr. Rubio\u2019s chances. And Scott Walker, on paper the best of the bunch, quickly raised doubts about his preparedness.It was also obvious that the \u201cmainstream\u201d candidates could face serious challenges on their flanks: from John Kasich on the left and Ted Cruz on the right. The notion that successful factional candidates could prevent a mainstream candidate from building a broad coalition was also discussed at several times, even in the specific context of Mr. Kasich. It\u2019s basically what happened to Mitt Romney in 2008.But what wasn\u2019t really discussed was what ultimately happened with Mr. Kasich. He was strong enough to prevent Mr. Rubio from consolidating the center-right of the Republican Party, costing him states like Virginia on Super Tuesday. But he wasn\u2019t strong enough to become a plausible contender in his own right, like Mr. McCain in 2008.In the end, Mr. Kasich was strong enough only to block a viable mainstream candidate, leaving Mr. Cruz as the sole remaining candidate to defeat Mr. Trump. This, to me, is a \u201cWorld War I\u201d black swan advantage for Mr. Trump \u2014 parts of it were foreseeable, but not the totality of what ultimately happened.The failure of a broadly appealing candidate to break out left Mr. Trump with one rival: Mr. Cruz.I think we got a lot wrong about Mr. Trump, but I think we nailed Mr. Cruz. He was strongly opposed by party elites and had so little appeal to voters who didn\u2019t consider themselves \u201cvery conservative\u201d that he couldn\u2019t win the nomination. It was a lucky break for Mr. Trump.Who knows what would have happened if Mr. Rubio hadn\u2019t stumbled in that debate ahead of New Hampshire, and come in second instead of Mr. Kasich. Perhaps Mr. Kasich and Mr. Bush would have left the race, allowing Mr. Rubio to consolidate the center-right of the party \u2014 and maybe even win it all? We\u2019ll never know.In recent cycles, they had backed the establishment against conservative candidates. They were a big reason I believed that an establishment-backed candidate had an advantage against a conservative outsider, despite the turn toward Tea Party conservatives in Congress. Polling data showed they were well educated and moderate \u2014 natural allies for the establishment.To some extent, this view has been vindicated. Mr. Cruz, this year\u2019s conservative outsider, was pummeled in the blue states.But it was completely wrong in a far more important sense: The Republicans in these states were no allies of the establishment, at least not against Mr. Trump. The blue-state Republicans gave him his first win in New Hampshire, and later, they put him over the top.This could just be the result of a simple analytical error: conflating opposition to ideologically consistent conservatives with an affinity for establishment-backed candidates.Or perhaps they would have voted against Mr. Trump if someone other than Mr. Cruz had been the principal opponent to Mr. Trump.Either way, I thought the party\u2019s establishment could count on these voters, and instead they were among Mr. Trump\u2019s strongest backers in the end.There\u2019s an important lesson here: These aren\u2019t liberal or moderate Rockefeller Republicans. These are voters who showed a surprising tolerance for Mr. Trump\u2019s extreme comments on immigration, women and other issues.I didn\u2019t consider myself that much of a \u201cparty decides\u201d disciple at the beginning of the race, but I was sure of one thing: It would be extraordinarily hard to win if a candidate were deemed unacceptable by the party\u2019s elected officials, donors and operatives.Such a candidate would lack the resources and staff to run an effective campaign. He or she would face both a chorus of vocal opposition from credible leaders and a well-financed fight to the end.In the end, Mr. Trump didn\u2019t face many of the challenges that outsiders usually do.His limited resources were irrelevant \u2014 he had unlimited free media. His weakness at delegate selection conventions could have cost him the nomination, but he ultimately won enough contests to ensure victory.It never did.The Republican elite treated Mr. Trump as it would have treated a fairly ordinary candidate, even as he said extraordinary things. That\u2019s a big part of why he won.I did not expect that the party would cede its biggest prize to an outsider who had so many dissenting policy views and who faced so many questions about his fitness for the presidency.Maybe because I never cared much about pop culture and don\u2019t watch much television, I never would have guessed that Mr. Trump would be able to sustain nonstop dominance of television media for the entire campaign season.The tremendous news media coverage of Mr. Trump was a big reason he looked like a \u201cboom, bust\u201d candidate, like Herman Cain in 2012. But Mr. Trump\u2019s media coverage never faded.If you had told me about the persistence of the coverage, I wouldn\u2019t have dismissed his chances. After all, the media was the fuel of his rise from the start.Mr. Trump benefited from party rules and a calendar that made it far easier for him to win the nomination.If the Republicans had delegate rules like those of the Democrats, Mr. Trump would not yet be the nominee. He would be counting on superdelegates.He was also helped by this year\u2019s calendar. Two-thirds of all of the delegates were awarded in the 45 days after Iowa, making it important for the party to narrow the field quickly in a year when it was not positioned to do so.Even when it looked as if Mr. Rubio might benefit from unified Republican support, he had only a week for fund-raising and to try to build a strong organization ahead of Super Tuesday. With the calendar from 2012, he would have had five weeks.We were just overconfident. There haven\u2019t been very many presidential elections in the modern era of primaries. There certainly haven\u2019t been enough to rule out the possibility that a true outsider could win the nomination, even if it seemed very incongruent with what had happened in the post-reform era.That\u2019s a lesson to keep in mind heading into the general election.Advertisement"}

The ministry, which Mr. Najib oversees in his capacity as the country\u2019s finance minister, will take over 1MDB\u2019s remaining assets.Critics are concerned that the ministry will also assume the fund\u2019s estimated $6.75 billion debt, setting the stage for a government bailout.\u201cMy reading is that they will take the opportunity to transfer as much of the debt as possible to the Ministry of Finance,\u201d said Tony Pua, an opposition member of Parliament. \u201cOur fear is that the Ministry of Finance will mount a multibillion-dollar bailout of 1MDB, which is now unable to pay its debts.\u201dGovernment officials did not respond to requests for comment. The fund\u2019s president, Arul Kanda Kandasamy, declined to discuss plans for scaling back the fund, how much it owes or the possibility of a government bailout.Malaysian officials once had high hopes for the fund, which Mr. Najib created in 2009, promising that its investments would produce significant revenue for the country. The fund had planned a $3 billion initial public offering for its energy assets as recently as last year, which could have generated even more cash.But critics say that the wealth fund was nothing more than a Ponzi scheme and that huge sums it borrowed were fraudulently diverted to well-connected insiders.Mr. Najib\u2019s role in establishing 1MDB as prime minister, overseeing it as finance minister, directing its advisory board and reportedly receiving money from the fund has raised many questions about his culpability.He denies any wrongdoing.In all, Mr. Najib has banked more than $1 billion from various sources, his office has acknowledged.The Foreign Ministry said that it would take over 1MDB\u2019s assets, accept the resignation of the 1MDB board effective May 31 and abolish its advisory board, which Mr. Najib had overseen.The ministry said it would appoint new members to the board \u201cto reflect the limited business profile of 1MDB.\u201dAn adviser to Mr. Najib said that sales of 1MDB assets that are underway, combined with the transfer of other assets to the ministry, would leave 1MDB as a shell company without any operations. The fund will continue to service any remaining obligations, he said, but will eventually cease to exist.Mahathir Mohamed, a former prime minister and a leading critic of Mr. Najib, charged that the fund\u2019s debts could bankrupt the government.Mr. Mahathir also challenged the contention by Mr. Najib\u2019s allies that much of the money that the prime minister received came from a Saudi donor.\u201cNone of his explanation can be believed,\u201d Mr. Mahathir said. \u201cNo one would give this huge amount to anyone even if he had done something for Islam or for any other cause. The belief is that the money came from 1MDB, the only source of such sums accessible to Najib.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Did Ku Klux Klan leaders say they were sorry for their endorsements after Trump said he\u2019d be good for \u201cthe African-Americans?\u201dThe rapist and the racists are all in with the man from Trump Tower, along with Ted Nugent. Nugent called President Obama \u201ca subhuman mongrel\u201d and suggested that he be lynched. \u201cTrump is as close to Ted Nugent as you\u2019re going to get in politics,\u201d he said.But some things have to be erased, and quickly. Etch A Sketch? That was Mitt Romney\u2019s plan. (Such a choker, Mitt.)

Count on American amnesia, our opioid.He started the take-it-back tour with Ted Cruz. Trump had linked the senator\u2019s father to the assassin of President John F. Kennedy. He\u2019d insulted Ted\u2019s wife, implying that she was ugly. And he\u2019d stuck a name on him that will follow him back to the Senate \u2014 Lyin\u2019 Ted Cruz.

It\u2019s beyond his range. Imagine Trump with the daily briefing in the White House, trying to discern a tabloid rumor from a national security threat.An easy take-back was breaking the promise to self-finance his campaign. He claims to be a billionaire, beholden to no one. Let the beholding begin. \u201cDo I want to sell a couple of buildings and self-fund?\u201d he said this week, by way of announcing he\u2019s open to donations from special interests. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I want to do that personally.\u201dMexican immigrants \u2014 presumably still rapists and criminals in his mind, without doubt, but unlike the convicted rapist and registered sex offender Mike Tyson, not sold on Trump. On Tuesday, he promised he would have \u201cunbelievably great relationships with the Hispanics.\u201d One bit of advice for \u201cthe Hispanics\u201d: When the deportation squad shows up on your doorstep on Day 1 of the Trump presidency, have your papers ready.\u201cThe blacks,\u201d or as Trump now calls them, \u201cthe African-Americans,\u201d will be a hard sell as well. They will not forget that Trump spent considerable time trying to delegitimize the first African-American presidency. He sent his investigators to Hawaii, looking to prove that the president was not an American citizen. What they found was \u201cabsolutely unbelievable,\u201d Trump said, but he\u2019s never released it. Here you should read \u201cunbelievable\u201d in the literal sense.Women \u2014 big, big problem there for a thrice-married man who said his personal Vietnam was keeping himself safe from the \u201cscary world\u201d of women with sexually transmitted diseases. Can\u2019t take back \u201cfat pigs\u201d and \u201cdogs\u201d and \u201cdisgusting animals,\u201d or musing about punishing women who get abortions.

{"Headline": "Capitol Hill Newspapers, Once a Protected Class, Redefine Themselves", "Date": "2016-05-14", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When Neetzan Zimmerman arrived at The Hill as its first director of audience development in January 2015, he found a publication largely unchanged since its heyday as a scrappy weekly for Washington\u2019s deal makers.\u201cI don\u2019t know if struggling is the right word because that would imply they had been trying, and they really had not,\u201d he said recently, referring to the paper\u2019s efforts to compete in a digital ecosystem. \u201cThey did not have any reasons to think they needed to exist in any meaningful way in this world.\u201dIt has been the job of Mr. Zimmerman, a former editor at Gawker and Whisper, the anonymous messaging app, to help change that. And the challenge is daunting.Capitol Hill publications like The Hill, Roll Call and National Journal were for decades a Beltway staple, strewn across desks on K Street and in Congress. With a captive audience and a strong advertising base, they were protected from broader economic forces and less concerned about competition from more nationally focused newspapers.Now these publications are scrambling to find their footing in a political landscape that is more competitive and almost unrecognizable from the one they chronicled for decades. Advertisers have fled, in part, these publications say, because of congressional inaction, which has sapped the special interest advertising that once padded their balance sheets.\u201cA generation ago, ad sales people would sit back and wait for phone calls and probably have opportunities to tell people the book was full,\u201d David Ellis, the chief content officer for CQ Roll Call, said recently. \u201cThose days are long gone.\u201dIn addition, Politico, founded in 2007, has been changing the media game in the Beltway, offering readers fast, savvy political reporting in a more digitally native form. The old lions of Capitol Hill were left straining to catch up.The realignment has already led to a profound adjustment by National Journal, a weekly magazine known for its substance-heavy writing on politics and policy. In January, it suspended its print magazine, leaving the free news business, and laying off or transferring a large portion of its staff as it reorganized. It now relies on about 1,000 corporate members paying four to five figures a year for services like Hotline, a well-known election news aggregator; live events; and access to databases of PowerPoint presentation slides and data sets.The move constituted a return to the publication\u2019s roots, said David G. Bradley, whose Atlantic Media Company owns National Journal, and to a business model that serves as a counterweight to advertising-driven publications.The Hill and Roll Call have tacked in the opposite direction, in pursuit of a national readership they can sell to potential advertisers.At The Hill, Mr. Zimmerman, the senior director for audience and strategy, said his goal is to emulate the attitude and approach of sites like Gawker and BuzzFeed without distorting what he calls The Hill\u2019s distinct voice. He has filled a handful of new positions, including a director of emerging platforms, who is exploring ways to use Snapchat and Facebook Live to share its content.Mr. Zimmerman\u2019s digital efforts come as The Hill\u2019s owner, the New York media investor Jimmy Finkelstein, is proceeding with ambitious expansion plans.\u201cWe want to be one of the big sites of America within a year,\u201d Mr. Finkelstein said in an interview.The Hill\u2019s website had almost 14 million unique visitors in March, up 126 percent compared with the previous year, according to comScore, the traffic measurement firm. Those kinds of raw numbers have put the site in competition with sites like Politico, which it managed to surpass for the month of December, according to comScore. The Hill\u2019s print circulation of about 26,000 has remained roughly steady.Much of the site\u2019s growth can be attributed to social media, aggressive aggregation and a premium on breaking news. The Hill\u2019s aggregation strategy has prompted critics to brand it as less serious than other competitors.Mr. Zimmerman countered that criticism, saying it \u201cchanges the notion of aggregation\u2019\u2019 if you are furthering a conversation about an issue and giving proper credit to the work of others.To Mr. Finkelstein and Bob Cusack, the editor in chief, the strategies are being used to finance a transformation of the once-parochial publication into a national player.\u201cWe don\u2019t want just the people who watch C-Span all the time to read us,\u201d said Mr. Cusack, who assumed the top editorial post in July 2014. \u201cOur name suggests really only Capitol Hill. What we have become now is more about original content and interviews. You should know what\u2019s going on in the entire world of politics.\u201dThat has meant cosmetic tweaks, like getting the names of obscure lawmakers out of headlines and framing stories for a larger audience.Mr. Finkelstein declined to discuss the publication\u2019s finances in detail; he said he expects profit to grow this year as The Hill undergoes a rapid election-year expansion that includes increasing the editorial staff about 25 percent and expanding opinion content. Just this week The Hill announced a rash of new hires, including a new publisher, Johanna Derlega, formerly of the National Journal; three new associate editors; and reporters to cover political fund-raising in Hollywood, Latino issues and transportation.Those moves are being watched closely at Roll Call, once known as the \u201ccampus newspaper\u2019\u2019 of Capitol Hill. Mr. Ellis and the paper\u2019s new editor, Melinda Henneberger, are trying to use techniques like narrative storytelling and human interest to attract a wider audience.\u201cI don\u2019t want to win the two-minute cycle; I want to go deeper,\u201d said Ms. Henneberger, a former reporter at several publications, including The New York Times.The evolution has been slower to make an impact on web traffic, though, which dipped sharply in January, February and March compared to the previous year, bottoming out well below 500,000 unique visitors, according to comScore. The paper\u2019s print circulation of about 21,000 has been largely unchanged.Mr. Ellis and Ms. Henneberger said they expected a new, multimedia-heavy website and a print design that made its debut in mid-March to help.Roll Call\u2019s strategy has partly been shaped by the financial security it receives through its relationship to CQ, the subscription-supported congressional tracking publication. The two publications, owned by The Economist Group, merged in 2009.Some in the Beltway worry that the drive for wider readership has necessitated a kind of betrayal of Capitol Hill DNA. \u201cPut me down as questioning whether they can pull it off,\u201d said Jim Manley, a Democratic strategist and former congressional staff member who described himself as an avid reader of Washington\u2019s political press. \u201cIt seems to me that they are moving away from their bread and butter and tying to find new ways to bring in clicks.\u201dStill, as the rules of doing business evolve, the Capitol Hill publications insist that their only choice is whether to learn them.\u201cI\u2019m not nostalgic at all,\u201d said Mr. Finkelstein, whose father helped found The Hill in 1994. \u201cEvery media organization is different, and you have to figure out how you\u2019re going to grow each one. I loved The Hill when it was just in paper. I love it much more now.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Sunday about changes underway at Capitol Hill newspapers misstated the surname of the new publisher of The Hill. She is Johanna Derlega, not Derlerga.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tesla Says It Will Sharply Ramp Up Production of Model 3", "Date": "2016-05-04", "News": "Supported byDETROIT \u2014 Tesla Motors said on Wednesday that it was confident it could accelerate production to meet high demand for its forthcoming Model 3 electric vehicle, despite the departure of two top manufacturing executives.The carmaker\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, said that Tesla expected to produce a total of 500,000 vehicles by 2018, two years sooner than previously announced.The goal represents a huge leap from Tesla\u2019s production of about 15,000 vehicles in the first three months of this year. But Mr. Musk expressed confidence that the company could meet the ambitious target, and begin filling more than 325,000 orders for the Model 3 by late next year.\u201cI think we have done a good job on the design and technology of our products,\u201d Mr. Musk said in a conference call with analysts. \u201cThe big thing we need to achieve in the future is also to be the leader in manufacturing.\u201dThe expansion will take place without the help of Greg Reichow, Tesla\u2019s vice president for production, who is taking a leave of absence after five years with the company. Also leaving the company is John Ensign, who had been vice president for manufacturing since 2014.Mr. Musk, who said he was recruiting new manufacturing executives, gave no reason for the unexpected departures.\u201cWe\u2019re confident that with the strength of the team, high-quality manufacturing at Tesla will continue,\u201d he said.The company said Mr. Reichow would assist in the transition.\u201cMy belief in Tesla\u2019s ability to successfully deliver great cars and inspire the world to drive electric remains as strong as ever,\u201d Mr. Reichow said in a statement released by the company.Mr. Musk did not share details of how Tesla would increase vehicle production, but he said in a letter to shareholders that the move \u201cwill likely require some additional capital\u201d to finance the expansion.The company is also building a major battery plant for its vehicles in Nevada, and expects to produce its first battery cells there by the end of this year.An expansion is necessary to meet the extraordinary demand for the Model 3, which will be the company\u2019s first electric vehicle aimed at mass-market consumers.One industry analyst said converting all the orders into sales could be a difficult task, particularly if new electric cars from other automakers hit the market before the Model 3.\u201cWhile pre-orders suggest demand could be there, with recent executive departures and more competitive offerings, this may be tough to achieve,\u201d Efraim Levy at S&P Global Market Intelligence said in a research note.Mr. Musk reiterated earlier forecasts that Tesla would sell up to 90,000 Model X S.U.V.s and Model S luxury sedans this year.For the first quarter, Tesla reported wider losses, but larger revenues, than in the same period in 2015. The company said that it lost about $283 million, on revenues of $1.15 billion, in the first three months of this year. During the same period last year, it reported revenues of about $940 million and a loss of $154 million.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Silicon Valley, Gossip, Anger and Revenge", "Date": "2016-05-25", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Silicon Valley likes to keep the media on a tight leash. Tech executives expect obedience, if not reverence, from reporters. They dole out information as grudgingly as possible. Sometimes they simply buy a chunk of a publication, a time-honored method of influencing what is deemed fit to write about.Outing famous people has a long and not particularly respectable history, but Valleywag said it was celebrating Mr. Thiel. The point, as Valleywag\u2019s then-editor Owen Thomas wrote in his post, was that even in Silicon Valley, \u201ca gay investor has no way to fit into the old establishment. That frees him or her to build a different, hopefully better system for identifying and rewarding talented individuals, and unleashing their work on the world.\u201d\u201cSilicon Valley is a closed world and has become more closed at the elite levels,\u201d said Fred Turner, chairman of the department of communication at Stanford. \u201cThe gossip that circulates between people doesn\u2019t always leap into the media the way it might in New York. So Americans know the Valley primarily through its advertising, its self-promotion and its products.\u201dValleywag challenged that, and the Valley \u2014 or at least Mr. Thiel \u2014 pushed back.\u201cWe should not be surprised that they act like entitled industrialists out here, because they are,\u201d Mr. Turner said.Valleywag was born in 2006, an arm of Gawker\u2019s then-expanding empire of blogs, and it died last winter. It had a hiatus or two along the way, with Nick Denton, the Gawker founder, stepping in to write the blog at one point. Its most influential years were in the beginning, especially under Mr. Thomas, who ran the site from 2007 until 2009.\u201cOn one hand the reporting was terribly caustic and brutal and on the other it was really thorough and investigative and accurate in a lot of cases,\u201d said Brandee Barker, former head of global communications at Facebook. \u201cI would read a story and think, \u2018How on earth did they find this information that is correct?\u2019 Other times I\u2019d read Valleywag and think, \u2018This is the most evil and unfair characterization of somebody I\u2019ve ever read in journalism.\u2019\u201dJohn Cook, executive editor of Gawker Media, who helped put Valleywag to rest last year, said the site \u201cdidn\u2019t play the access game.\u201dMr. Thomas, now business editor of The San Francisco Chronicle, said the goal of Valleywag was to improve the tech community.\u201cSilicon Valley said it had ideals,\u201d he said. \u201cAll we asked was that it live up to those ideals. If you\u2019re going to say that you\u2019re a meritocracy, then don\u2019t hire all of your buddies to launch a start-up who all happen to be young white men. Don\u2019t say you\u2019re apolitical when you\u2019re secretly funding anti-immigration measures.\u201dFor Mr. Thiel, taking action against Gawker may be a win. Dan Lyons, an author who was briefly a Valleywag writer, said what Mr. Thiel did \u201csets a scary precedent,\u201d but \u201cmy guess is that most people hate Gawker as much as he does, so he probably ends up looking like a hero among his own crowd.\u201dMr. Adams wrote approvingly of Mr. Thiel, \u201cI assume he is acting out of a combination of revenge and a desire to make the world a better place.\u201dWithout this week\u2019s news, Valleywag\u2019s legacy would be uncertain. Several Silicon Valley figures asked to comment on Wednesday said they had not read it or did not know it was defunct.Others, like the Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff, an occasional Valleywag target, said simply about the site and this week\u2019s events, \u201cI don\u2019t care about any of those people.\u201dThe news about Mr. Thiel funding the suit against Gawker broke just as the previous contretemps about Silicon Valley and the media \u2014 how Facebook shapes the news that its users see, sparked by a story in Gizmodo, another Gawker property \u2014 was dying down. Mr. Thiel, as it happens, is a Facebook board member. Facebook declined to comment on Mr. Thiel.Mr. Thomas, who is himself gay, argues that Valleywag was not really outing Mr. Thiel. \u201cI did discuss his sexuality, but it was known to a wide circle who felt that it was not fit for discussion beyond that circle,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe he was in the closet. He was never hiding it.\u201dHowever much Valleywag said it admired Mr. Thiel for being \u201cthe smartest V.C. in the world,\u201d it took a more disparaging view as well. In one post about Mr. Thiel\u2019s claims of hiring only the best to work at his hedge fund, Clarium Capital, Mr. Thomas wrote, \u201cOh, really? Take a look at their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s on LinkedIn. Like so many of this outspokenly harebrained libertarian\u2019s theses, the claim sounds good on paper but doesn\u2019t stand up to inspection.\u201d\u201cIt scares everybody,\u201d he said in a 2009 interview with Pe Hub, a private equity publication. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible for the Valley, which is supposed to be about people who are willing to think out loud and be different. I think they should be described as terrorists, not as writers or reporters.\u201dQuentin Hardy and Mike Isaac contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Trump, as it looks to raise roughly $1 billion over the next six months.The financial vice chairmen include Woody Johnson, the New York Jets football owner, and former Ambassador Mel Sembler, of Florida, two major supporters of Jeb Bush\u2019s failed presidential campaign. The other four are: Elliott Broidy, a California-based venture capitalist; Ray Washburne, a former R.N.C. finance chairman who raised money for Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s presidential race; Diane Hendricks, the widow of the philanthropist Ken Hendricks; and Ronald Weiser, another former ambassador who also served as an R.N.C. finance chairman.Mr. Trump is facing a well-financed opposition and has no donor network of his own to draw on. His national finance chairman, Steve Mnuchin, is a former Goldman Sachs executive who is working with the R.N.C. finance chairman, Lewis M. Eisenberg.Mr. Trump met on Monday with Mr. Johnson, a longtime friend whom Mr. Trump nonetheless poked fun at for backing Mr. Bush early in the year. The two mended fences.Individual donors and their ability to write large checks are themselves a significant force, but so are bundlers, who have wide networks of fellow wealthy donors to tap into. Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign can only accept contributions of $5,400 until the party convention July 18-21 in Cleveland. After that, the campaign can only accept checks of $2,700.On the list of bundlers who will be part of a \u201cpresidential trust\u201d are Joe Craft, a Kentucky coal baron who met with Mr. Trump in his office a week ago, and his wife, Kelly. The list also includes former Ambassador Sam Fox; Diana and E. Llwyd Ecclestone; former Ambassador Howard Leach, an appointee under President George W.

Several of the party\u2019s biggest donors, including the hedge fund executive Paul Singer and the businessman Bruce Kovner, have said they will not support Mr. Trump or raise money for him.Others, including the energy executive Robert Murray, who has been critical of President Obama, said this week that he met with Mr. Trump and sees him as \u201cthe horse to ride.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "General Mills Adds Kite Hill to Food Start-Up Investments", "Date": "2016-05-19", "News": "Supported byGeneral Mills, one of America\u2019s corporate food titans, is quietly establishing itself in venture capital, investing in some of the hottest new food companies.It is just one of a small but growing number of giant food companies that have decided they can no longer afford to sit on the sidelines as smaller, more nimble start-ups outmaneuver them in the race for consumers seeking minimally processed, locally sourced, environmentally sustainable foods free of preservatives and chemicals.General Mills\u2019 latest investment is part of $18 million going into Kite Hill, which makes versions of cheese and yogurt from nuts \u2014 no cows involved.\u201cPlant-based used to be more synonymous with sacrifice than with taste,\u201d said John Haugen, vice president and general manager of 301 INC, General Mills\u2019 venture capital arm. \u201cNow, companies like Kite Hill are able to deliver plant-based products that taste good.\u201dThe investment is the fifth for 301, which General Mills established last fall out of its former new business development unit. That unit often created products based on established brands, like a refrigerated Pillsbury pancake batter and Progresso soups in pods that could be used with single-serve coffee makers.General Mills is not the only food company dabbling in venture capital. This year, Campbell put $125 million into an in-house venture capital business called Acre Venture Partners. And Unilever has long had a venture capital unit.\u201cYou could argue that we could just make an acquisition, but what 301 allows us to do is engage in companies that are still small and emerging and keep the chief executive and leadership team in place to help preserve the culture,\u201d Mr. Haugen said.\u201cBig food companies have many assets and advantages,\u201d Mr. Friedberg said. \u201cBut developing in-house brands that consumers will perceive as healthier and authentic has been a problem for them \u2014 they\u2019re just not designed to do that.\u201dBut most small food companies struggle to develop on a larger scale, which is why Kite Hill elected to take the investment from 301 instead of raising capital through one of the many accelerators and incubators set up to support small food businesses or from a conventional venture capital firm.Whole Foods, for instance, asked Kite Hill to make a pumpkin tart marbled with its nut-based cream cheese for the holiday season. The product sold so well, Mr. Sade said, that Whole Foods wanted to stock it year round \u2014 but Kite Hill lacked the capacity to meet that demand.Many small food businesses are wary of taking money from, or getting bought out by, food giants, mindful of the many stories of small, successful companies that are bought only to all but disappear into a multibillion-dollar corporation.CAVU, which announced a $156 million fund to invest in food and beverage businesses this year, has joined General Mills in the Kite Hill investment. (Khosla Ventures, a major Silicon Valley investment firm, and a handful of other investors also put in a small amount.)CAVU also joined General Mills to invest in Good Culture, a cottage cheese business.\u201cIt was kind of a strange, unplanned thing that we ended up in partnership with them,\u201d Mr. Christopher said. \u201cBut we complement each other \u2014 General Mills brings a ton of expertise around supply chains, production, technology and operations, while where we come in is with experience building new, national brands that really appeal to today\u2019s consumers.\u201dThe investment in Kite Hill was drawn up before the Wall Street rumor mill began excitedly discussing General Mills as a target for 3G Capital, the giant Brazilian private equity firm that owns Kraft Heinz, Burger King and Budweiser. 3G is infamous for cutting costs and cheapening ingredients to achieve large increases in profit margins, striking terror into big companies and small.Mr. Sade demurred from commenting on the rumor, saying he was \u201cfar removed from the world of private equity, where they move large pieces around on the chessboard.\u201d\u201cGenerally speaking,\u201d he added, \u201cI don\u2019t think consolidation on such a big scale is good for consumers.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Friday about giant food companies\u2019 investments in start-ups misstated, in some editions, the role of General Mills in an $18 million investment in Kite Hill. General Mills is the lead investor, not the sole investor.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Solar Project Pairs Muslims and Jews to Aid West Bank Farmers", "Date": "2016-05-14", "News": "Supported byAUJA, West Bank \u2014 Samer Atiyat, a Palestinian farmworker, had climbed halfway up a 20-foot date palm and was trimming stalks that held rich clusters of the fruit, still green and unripe. Working near the Dead Sea on land that still evokes its biblical past, Mr. Atiyat, 28, grew animated when asked about a 125-foot bank of solar panels, whose power draws water from deep underground to irrigate the grove.\u201cThe water that\u2019s brought here comes from the panels,\u201d Mr. Atiyat said, using an Arabic slang term for the units, muri, that can also be translated as \u201cmirrors.\u201dSolar panels dot some of the poorest Arab villages in the West Bank and Israel, often donated by European governments. But experts in the field say the $100,000 project here in Auja is the first substantial one to be financed by a group involving both Jews and Muslims in the United States, and to have both Israeli Jews and Palestinian Muslims on its technical team. In addition to its environmental benefits, the solar project gives an economic push to farmers who struggle with unreliable and expensive electricity.In a place of nationalist, religious and political animosity, Palestinian farmers embraced the project on one condition. The community, said Ben Jablonski, who is Jewish and from New York and who led the initiative, insisted only that the collection of donors and engineers be free of any connection to the Israeli settlements scattered across the West Bank on land Palestinians consider their own.Mr. Jablonski, 33, resigned from the board of the Jewish National Fund, where he had been a rising star, over its modest but politically fraught involvement in West Bank settlements.Ahmad Injoum, whose family owns the property on which the solar array was built and who negotiated the deal for 45 farm families in the area, is quick to point out that Auja, a town of about 5,000 Palestinians, has settlements to its north, south and west.\u201cWhat you heard is 100 percent right,\u201d Mr. Injoum, 54, said of the condition. Known as Abu Bilal, father of Bilal, in Palestinian tradition, he added of donors involved with the settlers, \u201cWe don\u2019t want anything to do with them.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s one thing for American Jewish organizations to talk vaguely about economic development for Palestinians,\u201d Mr. Beinart said. \u201cTo be willing to take a stand in opposing settlements as part of it, as Ben has done \u2014 that makes it unusual.\u201dMr. Robinson also pointed out that the Arava Institute, an Israeli-based partner on the solar initiative, is a major beneficiary of the Jewish National Fund. (In 2013, the fund was the institute\u2019s largest donor, giving $1.8 million.)Clive Lipchin, the director of a water-management center at Arava, said the Jewish National Fund financing had led to \u201ctensions\u201d in the 20-year-old institute, whose programs include Israelis, Palestinians and Jordanians. He said the Auja project worked in part because it had been done on private land, the details worked out directly with Abu Bilal rather than with the Palestinian local or national government.\u201cWe didn\u2019t have to seek permission from any political entity, and that\u2019s partly why we\u2019ve succeeded,\u201d Mr. Lipchin said.The political complexities, in a place where any cooperation with Israelis is generally denounced by Palestinian leaders as \u201cnormalization\u201d of the occupation, were apparent when Auja\u2019s mayor, Fakhri Injoum, approached the solar array during a visit this month by the initiative\u2019s Israeli and Palestinian partners.\u201cWe are eager to develop Auja, but projects with the Israelis are not welcomed,\u201d said the mayor, who described himself as independent politically but leaning toward Fatah, the party that dominates the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Authority.In its first phase, which started last month, the new solar array supplies about a third of the electricity needed to run a subterranean pump; the rest comes from the local electricity company. The project also included agricultural training for the farmers growing the prized Medjool dates, and surveys to assess the farmers\u2019 needs.In the valley, the underlying aquifer is relatively shallow, said Deeb Abdelghafour, a senior official at the Palestinian Water Authority, and has been under pressure from drought for as much as a decade. Electricity is also expensive, and service can be unreliable.One asset the valley has is sunlight, and plenty of it, said Monther Hind, a senior engineer at the Palestinian Wastewater Engineers Group, a private organization that is a partner on the initiative. So engineers came up with the idea of powering the pump with photovoltaic panels.\u201cThey have daylight \u2014 use it,\u201d Mr. Hind said of the engineers\u2019 reasoning.In a small building next to the solar array, a meter was counting its output, and water was audibly rushing through a pipe connected to the pump, about 250 feet below ground. Ashraf Yahiaa, an engineer with the contracting company that built the array, said it was 3,000 square feet and could produce 25,000 watts when the sun was at its brightest. (A typical light bulb uses 100 watts.)Soon after, their initiative won $100,000 from Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York. It has since raised $50,000 more from both Jews and Muslims, the founders say.Mr. Jablonski said he had left the Jewish National Fund after hearing the objections from Auja farmers, despite what he called his enduring respect for much of the group\u2019s work.\u201cIt\u2019s either you\u2019re all in or you\u2019re not in,\u201d he said of his project with the Palestinians, adding that he was disappointed that the fund would not publicly distance itself from Keren Kayemet Leyisrael\u2019s work in settlements.Alon Tal, a professor of environmental policy at Ben-Gurion University who founded the Arava Institute and was until recently on the Keren Kayemet Leyisrael board, called that work \u201cextremely minimal\u201d but said he still considered it \u201cinappropriate.\u201dIn Auja, Abu Bilal brushed off the criticisms by his town\u2019s mayor, noting dryly that \u201che\u2019ll be gone in October,\u201d when his four-year term ends.The heads of three of the farm families, during a meeting with Abu Bilal, said they, too, had no objections to Israelis or American Jews being part of the initiative.But one of the farmers, Ibrahim Injoum, 58, had a request.\u201cWe still need more muri,\u201d he said, using the slang term for the solar panels.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Three Days, 700 Deaths on Mediterranean as Migrant Crisis Flares", "Date": "2016-05-29", "News": "Supported byROME \u2014 The migrant ships kept sinking. First came a battered, blue-decked vessel that flipped over on Wednesday as terrified migrants plunged into the Mediterranean Sea. The next day, a flimsy craft capsized with hundreds of people aboard. And on Friday, still another boat sank into the deceptively placid waters of the Mediterranean.Three days and three sunken ships are again confronting Europe with the horrors of its refugee crisis, as desperate people trying to reach the Continent keep dying at sea. At least 700 people from the three boats are believed to have drowned, the United Nations refugee agency announced on Sunday, in one of the deadliest weeks in the Mediterranean in recent memory.The latest drownings \u2014 which would push the death toll for the year to more than 2,000 people \u2014 are a reminder of the cruel paradox of the Mediterranean calendar: As summer approaches with blue skies, warm weather and tranquil waters prized by tourists, human trafficking along the North African coastline traditionally kicks into a higher gear.Taking advantage of calm conditions, smugglers in Libya send out more and more migrants toward Italy, often on unseaworthy vessels. Drowning deaths are inevitable, even as Italian Coast Guard and Navy ships race to answer distress calls. Last year, more than 3,700 migrants died in the Mediterranean, a figure that could be surpassed this year.In a statement on Sunday, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund said many of the migrants who drowned in the past week were believed to be unaccompanied adolescents.The grisly week also underscored the complex problem that the refugee crisis poses for Europe. The Continent\u2019s leaders, facing an anti-immigrant backlash in many countries, have signed a controversial deal with Turkey that so far has sharply reduced the migrant flow into Greece; last year, roughly one million people marched through the Balkans toward Germany.Yet closing the Greek route has shifted attention to the longer, more dangerous sea route from Libya to Italy. As of Wednesday, roughly 41,000 migrants had been rescued at sea after leaving Libya, nearly the same number from the same period last year, according to the United Nations and the International Organization for Migration.The potential for a sudden increase in traffic is clear: An additional 4,000 migrants were rescued on Thursday alone, the same day that as many as 550 people died on the second migrant boat that sank.\u201cThis was a very intense and exceptional week for the number of fatalities,\u201d said Federico Fossi, a spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.The deaths also point to the lack of solutions to the migrant crisis, which has been exacerbated by the violent chaos in Libya and fueled by the conflict in Syria.Officials with the refugee agency have been interviewing survivors of the three shipwrecks after they have been delivered to Italian ports. Those interviews were the primary basis for the estimate of 700 deaths, though some migration specialists cautioned that the number might turn out to be higher. The Italian authorities have also released grisly video footage taken by rescue ships approaching at least two of the sunken vessels.What was apparently the deadliest episode occurred on Thursday. A boat was towed away from the Libyan coastline by a larger smuggler ship. Survivors described being crammed onto a flimsy vessel filled with 670 people. Once the larger boat dropped the towline, the smaller one capsized.There were already 100 people missing from the ship that sank on Wednesday \u2014 a wooden fishing boat that flipped within sight of the Italian Navy (which later released a video that showed desperate people clinging to the deck or being tossed into the sea). On Friday, the navy rescued 135 migrants \u2014 and recovered 45 bodies \u2014 from a sinking smuggling boat on its way from Libya to Italy.\u201cThis week was a massacre,\u201d said Giovanna Di Benedetto, a spokeswoman in Sicily with Save the Children, the nonprofit humanitarian group.Mr. Fossi, the United Nations spokesman, warned that the death toll could grow. \u201cAnd surely many of those victims will be women and children, as usual,\u201d he added.The vast majority of migrants trying to reach Italy are coming from sub-Saharan African nations like Eritrea, Gambia, Ghana and Nigeria. Last year, refugees from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq poured into Europe, mostly traveling through Turkey into Greece.Now that the Greece route is largely shut down, the question is whether Syrians and Iraqis will try to reach Libya for the dangerous journey to Italy. That was the case in 2014, before smugglers began focusing on Greece.Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy has tried for months to force the European Union to focus on Libya. He raised the issue again at the recent meeting of the Group of 7 nations and has proposed holding a Group of 7 meeting next year in Sicily, which has borne the brunt of Italy\u2019s migrant crisis. Mr. Renzi also has proposed the creation of Euro bonds to help finance the response to the crisis \u2014 a move opposed by Germany so far.Much attention has been focused on Germany, as it absorbs nearly one million refugees who arrived last year. But Italy is also feeling the strain. With the summer migrant season soon to arrive, more than 115,000 migrants are already in Italy, an enormous increase from only a few years ago.Italian news media regularly broadcasts videos and photographs of sinking boats, as well as men, women and children wrapped in thermal blankets. In one striking image, a rescue official held a 9-month-old girl who had lost her pregnant mother.On Saturday at the Vatican, Pope Francis showed a gathering of children a life jacket used by a Syrian girl who died while trying to reach the Greek island of Lesbos.\u201cMigrants are not a danger \u2014 they are in danger,\u201d Francis told his young audience.Jim Yardley reported from Rome, and Gaia Pianigiani from Siena, Italy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018President Trump?\u2019 Here\u2019s How He Says It Would Look", "Date": "2016-05-04", "News": "Supported byDonald J. Trump is now the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, but he is also keenly aware that many in his own party \u2014 and many Americans, frankly \u2014 are scared and anxious about the idea of him in the Oval Office. Even he is not sure how a deeply divided nation would adjust to the first 100 days of a Trump presidency.What he does know, however, is what he wants to do in those early months. In a series of recent interviews, he sketched out plans that include showdowns with business leaders over jobs and key roles for military generals, executives and possibly even family members in advising him about running the country.Shortly after the Nov. 8 election, President-elect Trump and his vice president \u2014 most likely a governor or member of Congress \u2014 would begin interviewing candidates for the open Supreme Court seat and quickly settle on a nominee in the mold of Justice Antonin Scalia.He would start \u201cbuilding a government based on relationships,\u201d perhaps inviting the Republican leaders Paul D. Ryan and Mitch McConnell to escape the chilly Washington fall and schmooze at Mar-a-Lago over golf and two-pound lobsters.On Inauguration Day, he would go to a \u201cbeautiful\u201d gala ball or two, but focus mostly on rescinding Obama executive orders on immigration and calling up corporate executives to threaten punitive measures if they shift jobs out of the United States.And by the end of his first 100 days as the nation\u2019s 45th leader, the wall with Mexico would be designed, the immigration ban on Muslims would be in place, the audit of the Federal Reserve would be underway and plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act would be in motion.\u201cI know people aren\u2019t sure right now what a President Trump will be like,\u201d he said. \u201cBut things will be fine. I\u2019m not running for president to make things unstable for the country.\u201dThe New York Times interviewed Mr. Trump three times over the past two months, most recently on Saturday, as well as several campaign advisers and Trump confidants.While professing some surprise at his success, Mr. Trump increasingly sounds like a man who thinks he knows where he will be eight months from now, and the unrivaled power he will hold. He talked of turning the Oval Office into a high-powered board room, empowering military leaders over foreign affairs specialists in national security debates, and continuing to speak harshly about adversaries. He may post on Twitter less, but everyone will still know what he thinks.\u201cAs president, I\u2019ll be working from the first day with my vice president and staff to make clear that America will be changing in major ways for the better,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a telephone interview on Saturday. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to waste time. I want a vice president who will help me have a major impact quickly on Capitol Hill, and the message will be clear to the nation and to people abroad that the American government will be using its power differently.\u201dBut he also acknowledged that he might face significant and incessant protests \u2014 even thousands of demonstrators massing on the National Mall as he takes the oath of office nearby at the Capitol.Mr. Trump said he would try to unite Republicans and disaffected Democrats and independents over the next six months before the November election, and then work in office to show Americans that his chief interest was fighting for their needs. He argued that the fact that he would not have to rely on wealthy donors to finance his campaign would ultimately prove appealing to many voters as they realize he is not \u201cbought and paid for.\u201d\u201cI know everyone won\u2019t like everything I do, but I\u2019m not running to be everyone\u2019s favorite president,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThings are seriously wrong in this country. People are hurting, business is hurting. I\u2019m running to move quickly to make big changes.\u201dSeveral friends and allies of Mr. Trump said that \u201cnegotiating\u201d was the word he used the most to encapsulate his first 100 days in office. He wants to put strong-willed people \u2014 business executives and generals are mentioned most often \u2014 in charge of cabinet agencies and throughout his senior staff, and direct them to negotiate deals and plans with congressional leaders and state officials, as well as insurance companies and others in the private sector. They say he will accomplish the things he has promised or else keep trying, well aware that his supporters will have his head if he does not.\u201cHe\u2019s not going to depart from the agenda he\u2019s laid out, not a bit,\u201d said Roger Stone, a longtime adviser and confidant. Mr. Stone declined to describe details of his private conversations with Mr. Trump, except to say: \u201cHaving gone out a thousand times to say \u2018I\u2019m going to build a wall,\u2019 he has to build a wall. He has said he would scrap trade deals; his voters will demand he scrap trade deals. He knows that.\u201dModern America has never seen anything like a Trump administration. Business leaders and even entertainment figures new to politics have been elected governors, of course, and insurgents like Newt Gingrich rose to power.But this is different. A Manhattan real estate developer and bombastic reality television star, Mr. Trump would be a president like no other. Yet historians suggest the country would adjust: He would quickly find himself consumed with the urgent and normalizing tasks of building a cabinet, assembling senior staff and reassuring Wall Street and the public that he was capable of governing America.\u201cTrump is predicting he\u2019ll be able to do all these things, but his workload will be pretty enormous and his power would be so limited by precedent, by the bureaucracy, by the Constitution,\u201d said Robert Dallek, a presidential historian. \u201cEven in trade and immigration, where Trump says he will make revolutionary changes, Congress has a say on those things. A lot of people have a say. The president is not king.\u201dBut Mr. Trump pledged in the interviews to deliver on his campaign promises, even if they prove disruptive or explosive.On his first day in office, he said, he would meet with Homeland Security officials, generals, and others \u2014 he did not mention diplomats \u2014 to take steps to seal the southern border and assign more security agents along it. He would also call the heads of companies like Pfizer, the Carrier Corporation, Ford and Nabisco and warn them that their products face 35 percent tariffs because they are moving jobs out of the country. Democrats and some Republicans have warned that financial markets would react poorly and that Mr. Trump\u2019s protectionist stances might plunge the country into recession, but he insisted that trade is \u201ckilling the country\u201d and \u201cthe markets would be fine.\u201d\u201cBilateral talks with Mexico would start pretty quickly on the wall, and I would have chief executives into the Oval Office soon, too,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Oval Office would be an amazing place to negotiate. It would command immediate respect from the other side, immediate understanding about the nation\u2019s priorities.\u201dAs for which foreign leader he would call first as president, he said \u201cthey would not necessarily be a priority.\u201d\u201cWe have to take a tougher stand with foreign countries,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re like the policemen of the world right now. So I wouldn\u2019t be calling them up right away and getting more entangled.\u201dFor good or ill, he would command the nation\u2019s attention unlike any modern president, and not simply because of his penchant for redecorating in gold and renaming planes and buildings after himself. (For the record, he said he had no ambitious renovation plans.)\u201cHis first 100 days would be riveting,\u201d said Ari Fleischer, a former press secretary for President George W. Bush. \u201cThe question would be whether he is capable of downshifting from the hot rhetoric of his campaign to the serious business of building a presidency based on sound judgment and necessary coalition building.\u201dMr. Fleischer said it was possible that Mr. Trump would make the adjustment, given his frequent comments about negotiating with Democrats and Republicans to reach compromises.\u201cThat side of him intrigues me,\u201d Mr. Fleischer said. \u201cHe keeps alluding to how well he gets along with people. It\u2019s almost like Trump is playing a shrewd game. Tough campaigner today. Great deal maker later.\u201d He added, \u201cOf course, if he wins he\u2019ll have some level of strength and momentum akin to a mandate. That would help.\u201dMr. Trump did seem aware that his early months could be consumed with trying to win confirmation for his cabinet and perhaps a new Supreme Court justice and with making appointments throughout the bureaucracy.He made it clear that he was not interested in delegating these tasks and that he wanted to make sure his appointees shared his governing philosophy. One of his closest advisers, his daughter Ivanka, would probably stay with his company, but he said he would seek counsel from her and her husband, the businessman Jared Kushner, and noted that family members had served in administrations before.Even jobs that might seem incidental in a Trump universe, like a United States ambassador to the United Nations, have apparently crossed his mind.\u201cI think about a U.N. ambassador, about a secretary of defense and secretary of treasury, but I think more about winning first,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cOtherwise I\u2019m wasting time. I want people in those jobs who care about winning. The U.N. isn\u2019t doing anything to end the big conflicts in the world, so you need an ambassador who would win by really shaking up the U.N.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It actually has a high quality of life, a modestly priced housing stock, an excellent cultural life and access to the countryside even by public transportation. Like many cities, it has major social problems, especially among immigrants, a tiny percentage of whom are hell-bent on mayhem.These problems are being addressed but not effectively enough. The Belgian authorities have been widely criticized since the March 22 attacks for their ineffective response to the terrorist threat. What has only occasionally been reported is that a substantial number of prominent radicals are in prison and that a year ago a radical cell was dismantled in Verviers in southeastern Belgium. As New York, London, Madrid and Paris have learned, there is no sure defense against terrorism, and mistakes were also made in those cities.A study I led with Wayne State University in 2006, financed by the German Marshall Fund, compared Muslim communities in Brussels and Detroit. The broad conclusion was that the origins and educational levels of Muslims in the two communities was the determining factor in their integration into their host societies. In Brussels, Muslims largely came from poor regions of the Rif in Morocco as reported in your article. In Detroit, the immigrant educational level was higher from the outset. Much more needs to be done in Brussels to raise the educational level and employment opportunities for immigrants, but this can take several generations.RICHARD LEWISBrusselsAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Contract for Deed\u2019 Lending Gets Federal Scrutiny", "Date": "2016-05-10", "News": "Supported byA revival in seller-financed home sales aimed at people who cannot qualify for a mortgage has started to attract scrutiny from the nation\u2019s top consumer watchdog.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau recently assigned two enforcement lawyers to investigate the prevalence of seller-financed home transactions and determine whether the terms of some deals may violate federal truth in lending laws, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter but who were not authorized to speak publicly at the request of federal officials.Such contracts proliferated in recent years as banks retrenched from lending to low-income families and private investment firms like hedge funds stepped in to fill the void.Sam Gilford, a consumer bureau spokesman, confirmed that staff members had conversations with members of the consumer advisory board about seller financing, specifically a type of arrangement called a contract for deed or a land contract.\u201cWe want all consumers to be treated fairly, and we monitor the marketplace to stay apprised of emerging developments in consumer finance,\u201d Mr. Gilford said in an emailed statement. \u201cAs part of that work, staff from our research, markets and regulations division have had conversations with members of our consumer advisory board about land contracts.\u201d He declined to comment on whether the agency had assigned two enforcement lawyers.A contract for deed is a long-term, high-interest installment financing deal.Actual ownership, or title to a home, passes to the buyer from the seller only after the last payment is made. The contracts, which can run for as long as 40 years, have become widespread in the Midwest and the South, where there are a large number of homes that sell for less than $100,000.In the wake of the financial crisis, contracts for deed and other seller-financing arrangements have had a resurgence. The foreclosure crisis created a bountiful supply of cheap, often dilapidated, homes for investors to buy and left millions of people with damaged credit histories. Thousands of the homes that are now being sold to borrowers under contracts for deeds were ones that had been foreclosed on by Fannie Mae, one of two mortgage finance firms bailed out by the federal government.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau may or may not look to bring any enforcement actions over contracts for deeds and it is only in the early stages of researching the financing model.Contracts for deeds and other seller financing transactions have been around for decades, often used by family members or friends to sell properties to one another. But the arrangements have had a history of being predatory and the terms have often benefited the seller at the expense of the buyer.Legal aid lawyers in 13 states say that the contracts are being aimed at black and Hispanic homebuyers, according to a national survey undertaken by the National Consumer Law Center. The center has begun to survey housing lawyers in states where these contracts are most commonly used, in part to help determine the effect of new institutional players in the market.Statistics on the number of homes sold through contracts for deeds are hard to come by because not every state requires contracts to be recorded with the county. It is also not uncommon for borrowers to walk away from homes without contesting a seller\u2019s eviction proceeding in court.Often issues with homes that are sold through contracts for deeds emerge only once local municipalities bring cases against the sellers. Even then, the sellers sometimes do not show up to court and the code violations on their homes pile up.Heather K. Way, a professor of law at the University of Texas, said: \u201cThis segment of the homeownership market cries out for greater federal oversight. It\u2019s a toxic mix out there of sellers looking to make a quick and easy buck on the shoulders of vulnerable, unsophisticated buyers.\u201d She added, \u201cUnlike bank-financed sales, with seller financing there is typically no outside third party involved in the sale.\u201dHomes sold through a contract for deed often are put on the market \u201cas is,\u201d meaning buyers must spend a significant portion of their disposable incomes on repairs and renovations. When they do not \u2014 or cannot \u2014 problems result.Municipal officials across the United States have complained that out-of-state investors selling properties with a contract for deed often tend to do little maintenance on properties and fall behind on paying property taxes or water bills.\u201cThey do not take care of the code violations with these properties, which is why they are trying to pass them off to other people,\u201d said Jill Steele, city attorney for Battle Creek, Mich.Ms. Steele said Battle Creek has had a number of code violation issues with Harbour Portfolio Advisors, a firm out of Dallas that is one of the larger national players in the contract for deed business.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is trying to determine how many other firms are selling homes nationally with a contract for deed already in place or are renting out homes with an option to buy, said the people with direct knowledge of the matter.Still, there are some in the housing market who think that contracts for deeds and seller-financing plans can help people with no credit get back on the housing ladder.Odell Barnes, a longtime buyer and seller of foreclosed homes who operates out of Gilbert, S.C., chafed at the idea of government regulation in the industry and emphasized that seller financing contracts were a way to make homeownership accessible to anyone.\u201cOur government thinks all poor people are stupid,\u201d Mr. Barnes said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Better, Not Fatter, Defense Budget", "Date": "2016-05-09", "News": "Supported byEditorialTo hear some military commanders and members of Congress talk, the American military is worn out and in desperate need of more money. After more than a decade in Iraq and Afghanistan, they say, troops are lagging in training and new weaponry, which is jeopardizing their ability to defeat the Islamic State and deal with potential conflicts with Russia and China.For nearly a decade after 9/11, the Pentagon had a virtual blank check; the base defense budget rose, in adjusted dollars, from $378 billion in 1998 to $600 billion in 2010. As the military fought Al Qaeda and the Taliban, billions of dollars were squandered on unnecessary items, including new weapons that ran late and over budget like the troubled F-35 jet fighter.The waste and the budget games continue with the House Armed Services Committee approving a $583 billion total defense authorization bill for 2017 last month that skirts the across-the-board caps imposed by Congress in 2011 on discretionary federal spending.The caps are supposed to restrain domestic and military spending equally, but defense hawks have insisted on throwing more money at the Pentagon. That doesn\u2019t encourage efficiency or wise choices. The panel took $18 billion from a $59 billion off-budget account, which has become a slush fund renewed annually to finance the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and other trouble spots, and is not subject to the budget caps, and repurposed that money for use in the $524 billion base military budget.The move will underwrite the purchase of more ships, jet fighters, helicopters and other big-ticket weapons that the Pentagon didn\u2019t request and will keep the Army from falling below 480,000 active-duty troops. It also means the war account will run out of money next April. Representative Mac Thornberry, the Republican chairman of the committee, apparently assumes the next president will be forced to ask for, and Congress will be forced to approve, more money for the war account. This sleight of hand runs the risk that troops overseas, at some point, could be deprived of some resources, at least temporarily. The full House should reject this maneuver.Many defense experts, liberals and centrists as well as hawks, agree that more investment is needed in maintenance, training and modernizing aging weapons and equipment. These needs were identified years ago, yet the Pentagon and Congress have chosen to invest in excessively costly high-tech weaponry while deferring maintenance and other operational expenses.Todd Harrison, a defense budget expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says that sustaining the current military force of roughly two million and paying for all the new weapons systems will cost billions more than Congress has allowed under the budget caps. To maintain sensible troop levels, Congress and the administration need to begin honestly addressing the hard fiscal choices that they have largely been loath to make.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Panama Papers May Inspire More Big Leaks, if Not Reform", "Date": "2016-05-29", "News": "Supported byThe disclosure by an anonymous leaker of 11.5 million documents from a Panamanian law firm at the center of the offshore industry to a German newspaper was a landmark in another way as well. It was the latest and biggest in a series of recent megaleaks, establishing the large-scale, unauthorized disclosure of government and corporate secrets as a contagious phenomenon that is unlikely to go away.Since 2010, when a low-ranking intelligence analyst in Iraq copied thousands of classified files onto CDs labeled as Lady Gaga songs and gave them to the antisecrecy organization WikiLeaks, it has become clear that technology has revolutionized leaking. Pfc. Chelsea Manning, then known as Bradley, disclosed hundreds of thousands of diplomatic cables and military field reports. In 2013, Edward J. Snowden, citing Private Manning as an inspiration, gave a similar number of highly classified National Security Agency documents to a few journalists.Trevor Timm, the executive director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which supports what it calls transparency journalism, said the impact of each leak had inspired the next leaker.\u201cEspecially with the Panama Papers, I think it\u2019s now a trend,\u201d Mr. Timm said. \u201cWhen people inside organizations see the impact that whistle-blowing on this scale can have, they follow that example.\u201dNone of this would have been conceivable in the photocopier era, when the Panama Papers would have required a fleet of tractor-trailers to deliver. \u201cThese are disclosures not of documents but of databases \u2014 entire libraries,\u201d said Steven Aftergood, who tracks government secrecy for the Federation of American Scientists. John Doe\u2019s manifesto was tellingly titled \u201cThe Revolution Will Be Digitized.\u201dFor Mr. Obermayer and a colleague at S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, Frederik Obermaier, the fact that anonymous companies created by Mossack Fonseca were being used to evade taxes and launder illicit money justified publication. They shared the Panama Papers with the international journalists\u2019 group to bring strength and local expertise to the data.When the articles were published, their newspaper\u2019s web servers crashed from the initial volume of readers. Mr. Obermayer said it was \u201ca really strange feeling \u2014 that something that started with you has led to mass demonstrations in several countries.\u201dIn fact, some experts believe the \u201cPanama\u201d label is misleading, obscuring the central role of several states, including Delaware, Wyoming and Nevada, in registering companies with hidden ownership. Mossack Fonseca probably represents just 5 or 10 percent of the industry creating anonymous companies, Mr. Zucman of Berkeley said, so the disclosures have left the vast majority hidden.And no matter where shell companies may be registered, he said, much of the wealth they own is invested in the United States, in real estate, stocks and bonds. \u201cThe U.S. could find out who the true owners are,\u201d Mr. Zucman said.But the United States may illustrate the difficulty of moving from splashy revelations to serious change. States with a stake in the lucrative corporate registration business are likely to resist serious changes, and Congress appears unlikely to act anytime soon on comprehensive reform bills.\u201cThe offshore system is incredibly resilient, with a ton of smart lawyers and accountants to find new ways to hide money,\u201d said Marina Walker Guevara, the deputy director of the international journalists\u2019 consortium.Mr. Marchant said he believed the reform push from the leak would fade. \u201cThe people using the offshore system to evade their financial responsibilities tend to be very wealthy and influential people,\u201d he said. He predicted that any changes in laws and regulations after the disclosures would be \u201cmostly window dressing.\u201dOn the other hand, Mr. Marchant said, the example of John Doe will probably be followed by other leakers. \u201cThis is the age we live in,\u201d he said. \u201cThis record will be broken before long.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Bulls are killed with spears after being pursued on foot and horseback.Pacma, a political party that defends the rights of animals, said in a statement Thursday that the ban was \u201ca historic step\u201d toward eliminating all celebrations involving violence toward animals. The regional government\u2019s decree, however, must still be approved by the regional Parliament. The mayor of Tordesillas told reporters on Thursday that his administration would appeal the ban in court.The regional decree says that the ban is a response to the rising number of protests against animal violence. While it notes that the festivals are part of the country\u2019s cultural heritage, modern lawmakers must recognize that times and the sensitivities and ethics of Spaniards have changed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Time to End the Greek Debt Tragedy", "Date": "2016-05-13", "News": "Supported byEditorialIt\u2019s the season when Greece\u2019s continuing debt saga approaches what has now become a familiar summer climax, with citizens protesting austerity cuts and international creditors squabbling over the terms of loans. It\u2019s time to exit this cycle and face reality: Without relief, Greece\u2019s economy will never recover, with repercussions the European Union can ill afford.Still, on Sunday, Greek legislators approved an additional 5.4 billion euros in austerity measures, the day before European finance ministers met in Brussels to discuss whether Greece was meeting the terms of last year\u2019s bailout program and could qualify for an infusion of 5.7 billion euros. Greek citizens were in the streets protesting the idea of more cuts. .But, Europe\u2019s finance ministers failed to agree on whether Greece had made enough progress, putting off a decision until they meet on May 24. They are also balking at an International Monetary Fund demand that Greece get debt relief when the bailout program ends in 2018. The I.M.F. is threatening to pull its support from the program if that relief is not offered.The problem is Germany, Greece\u2019s main national creditor: German federal elections will take place next year, and many German citizens feel their hard work and thrift should not be squandered on rescuing the Greeks from the pain of their fiscal sins.Last year, Germany threatened to oust Greece from the European Union and the euro if it didn\u2019t deliver on austerity measures. Given Greece\u2019s front-line position in Europe\u2019s refugee crisis, Germany can no longer afford to threaten Greece. The last thing Europe needs is a \u201cfailed state,\u201d as Greece\u2019s finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, warned on Saturday, on its border with Turkey.When Europe\u2019s finance ministers reconvene, they would do well \u2014 for Greece, for the European Union and for Germany \u2014 to approve the July release of funds and agree to debt relief. Greece has gone a long way to satisfy austerity demands, but without debt relief its crisis will never end.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Readers\u2019 Turn: The Inventions That Mattered Most", "Date": "2016-05-18", "News": "Supported byAn Age of MiraclesHere are some of our favorite comments, together with a few more old pictures.Control of infectious diseases and parasites, for sure. Look how we freak out today over the threat of anything transmissible. What must it have been like to live in fear of tuberculosis, smallpox, yellow fever, plague, tetanus, etc. Imagine watching half your children die. One of the greatest fears was over a disease we hardly think about today \u2014 rabies. The South was plagued with hookworm around 1900, with almost half the population infected. It blows me away when I hear people seriously consider the iPhone as the greatest invention of all time. I put the iPhone well behind the pizza.You forgot to include the development of the safety bicycle during the late 1800s. Its advanced technology (chain drives, wire spoke wheels, pneumatic tires, etc.) was an essential step before automobiles could become practical. Even aviation (think Wright brothers) was based on bicycle technology. Besides causing a technological revolution, the bicycle also caused a social one \u2014 women\u2019s emancipation. As Susan B. Anthony famously said, \u201cI think it has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world.\u201dMy grandmother passed away several years ago at 101. She had lived through two world wars, a man on the moon, television, phone (initial and cellular), the polio vaccine, 9/11... I asked her what she thought were the greatest innovations that had occurred during her lifetime. Without missing a beat, she replied electricity and women obtaining the right to vote. Indoor plumbing came in a close third.You are not even close. The biggest advancement in all of human history is effective birth control. It changes every aspect of life: economic, social, day-to-day life, moral. Impacts everyone and every social structure.Since the origin of homo sapiens, there was little recording of anything until perhaps 40,000 years ago when they began to paint in caves and on rocks. To me, speech and the ability to tell a story is the greatest innovation ever.The biggest innovation is education and allowing even the poorest girls and boys to reach their full potential. For education to be available, kids have to have time to go to school (so no chores fetching water or firewood) and they have to survive long enough to make it to school (so neonatal care, food for healthy mother, antibiotics and vaccinations). This article didn\u2019t try to cover the social changes in the years 1870-1916, but the biggest was the idea that people should be educated (especially girls) and that everyone should have a chance. That wasn\u2019t the case in 1870, when sprawling families were there to work the land.In my view the era that began with Sputnik in the late 1950s and ended with moon landings was the greatest era of innovation. We watched as the first communication satellites were built and launched. Nuclear submarines became the norm. The Concorde was built, as was the Saturn rocket that launched men to the moon. The Lockheed corporation built the world\u2019s fastest aircraft, the Blackbird, and the first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier the U.S.S. Enterprise was also launched. Telstar too was launched in the early 1960s. The New York World\u2019s Fair in 1964-65 demonstrated touch tone dialing, and I.B.M. built the first small computers for schools and business. Many colleges began to offer computer programing courses. The Bell Telephone Laboratories were doing experiments with lasers and other optical-electrical devices. Even the Armalite rifle was built by Eugene Stoner, changing the combat rifle forever. Microwave radio transmissions and color TV technology raced ahead, as did FM stereo multiplexing. And don\u2019t forget the introduction of the Mustang and other pony cars! I\u2019m lucky. I got to live in the most innovative time of all. The time of the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and the Beach Boys, too. Great time to be a young teenager.Invention/discovery does not occur over a straight line. Use of a tool for cutting, use of fire for cooking, language and the narrative myth to put these diverse items to use (hunting and eating animals) occurred over hundreds of thousands of years.Express tracks. Whoever thought to build four New York subway tracks on many lines instead of two was brilliant, and still affects the lives of millions of commuters every day.Pretty simple: Indoor plumbing is more important than jet travel or cellphones. Try living without each and see what happens to most people.I know this article has an American bent, but to me from a purely public health point of view the invention of soap and sewers advanced the human cause more than any machine invention. In Europe a long, long time ago, the tradition was for the man to walk closer to the buildings on the street while dating a woman. Why? Because, if anyone living above decided to throw out the day\u2019s household waste out the window, the man took the brunt. A second after the date, scrubbing with soap would be required.American innovations in commercial banking and finance made all the other innovations possible. Without our financial infrastructure, largely perfected in 18th, 19th and 20th century America by our illustrious robber barons, we would have been unable to produce telephones, aircraft, trains, roads, bridges, a stable food supply, clean water, government services and all the rest. Our entire modern world rests on the bottoms of shiny-pants bookkeepers with green eyeshades and sleeve garters. The accountants and bankers are the modern masters of the universe.Sorry to let you know, but there has been nothing truly new for decades. Internet, personal computer, email, cellphone. These are all stemming from one thing: 1947 transistor/semiconductor; integrated circuit, 1958. The theory for these ... 1905-1927 mostly. But electrical systems created lighting, heating, and allowed immense productivity in the workplace and home: washers, dryers, toasters, clocks, factory machinery, automobile plants, aluminum. Vastly more impactful to humankind.The greatest era is always now, for it builds on the advances of the past, without which it would have to start from the beginning. The greatest \u201cinnovation\u201d was the Roman aqueduct, the knowledge of water, and subsequently, by others, much later, the flush toilet. More important for all \u2014 the Gutenberg first and the printing press second.I was promised a flying car by now, and all I got was Facebook.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "With Donald Trump in Charge, Republicans Have a Day of Reckoning", "Date": "2016-05-04", "News": "Supported byRepublican elected officials, donors and strategists grappled uncomfortably on Wednesday with the inevitability of Donald J. Trump as their presidential nominee, an unexpectedly sudden denouement that left many in a state of political paralysis and others vowing to oppose the party\u2019s new standard-bearer.While some called for unity, many Republican leaders refrained from falling in line behind Mr. Trump, with dozens avoiding inquiries about where they stood or saying they wanted Mr. Trump to detail his policies or tone down his language first. Others tied themselves in knots as they praised and criticized Mr. Trump in a single breath, or suggested that they could abide Mr. Trump but loathed his agenda.For a party that usually rallies around its presumptive nominee quickly, the brutal primary campaign and the questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s substance and style have fueled a remarkable level of dissatisfaction \u2014 antipathy that will not fade simply because Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio have ceded the race to him.The journey from denial and resistance to grudging acceptance, and even peace, with the Trump nomination may never be complete for some Republicans. But leaders hope to change that quickly, to save the party from splintering and to have a real shot at winning in November.\u201cThere will be some that will take days and weeks to realize that there are two choices and that it\u2019s between Donald Trump and the Democratic nominee, which most of us believe will be Hillary Clinton,\u201d said Gov. Phil Bryant of Mississippi. Mr. Bryant, who supported Mr. Cruz, called on him and others to back Mr. Trump. \u201cRealistically, and I think Republicans are realists, this is an opportunity to have a Republican president sitting in the Oval Office,\u201d he said.But Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a veteran House member and Republican strategist, said he was counseling his colleagues in competitive races to be coldblooded about how they approach their nominee.\u201cPosition yourself in the way you think is best for you,\u201d he said, allowing that \u201cit is difficult\u201d for some members.\u201cI know a lot of Republicans who are in red-leaning districts in blue states who see Trump as more helpful to them than they would have Cruz,\u201d Mr. Cole said, citing Representative Elise Stefanik, who represents a sprawling district in upstate New York. \u201cBut if you\u2019re in a heavily Hispanic district, your calculation is very different.\u201dFor some in the party, the question of whether to embrace Mr. Trump is not merely an intellectual exercise. Some staff members at the Republican National Committee were told Wednesday that if they were unable to get behind the nominee, they should leave by the end of the week.\u201cAs far as any involvement or campaigning, it\u2019s really going to depend on him filling in the gaps and consolidating his policies,\u201d Mr. King said. \u201cRight now, there\u2019s no real coherence.\u201dThe lingering resistance to Mr. Trump is especially strong in some of the states and congressional districts with hotly contested races this year. Representative Carlos Curbelo, who is from a competitive district in South Florida and has been outspoken about his refusal to support Mr. Trump, said Hispanics in his district were furious at Mr. Trump over his inflammatory language about Latinos.\u201cResentment is a kind way of putting it,\u201d Mr. Curbelo said. \u201cPeople are offended and really incredulous.\u201d He added that he would consider supporting a third-party presidential candidate, though that option did not appear to have much support among other Republicans on Wednesday.But the widespread discomfort and anxiety about Mr. Trump was utterly clear in the hours after he became the presumptive nominee on Tuesday night. Most leading Republicans were publicly silent. And the dearth of congratulatory news releases and Twitter posts spoke volumes.Over the last two days, more than 70 Republican governors, senators, representatives, officials and donors were contacted directly or through aides for comments about Mr. Trump. Only about 20 replied, with many aides saying their bosses did not want to take a stand yet; others begged off by saying the officials were traveling or \u201ctoo busy\u201d to email, call or release a statement.Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said in a news release issued after 7 p.m. Wednesday that Mr. Trump had \u201cthe opportunity and the obligation to unite our party around our goals.\u201dDemocrats were gleeful: Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign issued a list of more than 40 conservatives denouncing Mr. Trump\u2019s success, among them Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, who said Wednesday that he would not vote for Mr. Trump. (A spokeswoman later said Mr. Baker would not vote for Mrs. Clinton, either.)\u201cA ton of Republicans are waking up this morning \u2014 and I know because we\u2019ve already chatted \u2014 and many are saying, \u2018I\u2019m not getting in this mess,\u2019 \u201d said Gregory W. Slayton, a top Republican fund-raiser who remains adamantly opposed to Mr. Trump. \u201cSome are saying, \u2018Well, I\u2019m going to have to back Trump,\u2019 and of course many are saying, \u2018I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do.\u2019 \u201dTwo influential Republican groups, the Club for Growth and the Republican Jewish Coalition, said they planned to focus on helping House and Senate candidates this fall and on keeping both chambers under Republican control, rather than making the presidency their top priority.William Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, said the hostility toward Mr. Trump could be damaging if the Republican convention this summer gets out of hand or if his unusually high negative ratings end up hurting other Republicans on the ticket.\u201cI think people are underestimating the degree to which you could see a crisis in the Republican Party,\u201d he said.And Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina, who supported Mr. Rubio and had castigated Mr. Trump at times, issued a statement Wednesday reiterating that she would support \u201cthe Republican nominee for president.\u201d A spokesman for Ms. Haley said she and Mr. Trump had not spoken.Trent Lott, a former Senate Republican leader from Mississippi who supported Mr. Kasich, said he thought more Republicans would come around to Mr. Trump once they appreciated his appeal among conservative Democrats and independents, as well as among Republicans who do not traditionally vote.\u201cThe thing about Trump is, he has been turning out historic numbers, even in my state here,\u201d Mr. Lott said. \u201cI talk to some labor union people in my hometown, they\u2019re for Trump.\u201dJennifer Steinhauer contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Humans Are Lousy at Predicting Rare Events. Exhibit A: Donald Trump.", "Date": "2016-05-11", "News": "Supported byWhat Are the Odds?Last summer, the great mass of the American political punditocracy scoffed at the possibility that Donald Trump would win a single state in the Republican race. Now he\u2019s all but certain to win the party\u2019s presidential nomination.Anyone can simply be unlucky. But there are systematic biases and errors our puny human brains tend to make repeatedly when we try to predict the future, some of which are evident in the biggest political and sports upsets of 2016.But it seems more likely that the odds were misjudged all along. And if that\u2019s the case, understanding the mental errors behind those mistakes can be valuable for anyone who cares about forecasting and prediction (which, one way or another, is pretty much all of us).The biggest is recency bias, a concept most often evoked in financial markets by people who study the intersection of psychology and finance. We tend to overweight recent history in thinking about the likelihood that something might happen. People who have experienced a recent stock market crash are more likely to think another one is imminent, for example.That helps explain why, even when Mr. Trump entered the presidential race and rocketed to the top of the Republican polls, so many smart people remained so skeptical of the idea that he would win.Remember the 2012 Republican race, when a string of improbable candidates like Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain briefly rose to the top of the polls, while Mitt Romney, who had the support of establishment donors, made a slow-and-steady path to the nomination. You could say the same of the 2004 Democratic race, when anti-establishment Howard Dean led in the polls for months but John Kerry won the nomination.But it hasn\u2019t always been that way. Wendell Willkie is the closest counterexample. Amid a divided Republican party in 1940, Willkie, a businessman who had never held public office and had been a Democrat just a year prior, emerged from nowhere to claim the Republican nomination. Barry Goldwater in 1964 was opposed by many Republican party leaders.And in English soccer, in the last 21 years, only four teams with big budgets and reputations \u2014 Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United and Arsenal \u2014 had won. But before that, there are examples of teams emerging to challenge the elite, like the 1995 champion Blackburn Rovers.Knowing history in other words \u2014 and not just recent history \u2014 can help a person avoid assuming that the way it has been recently is the way it always is.A related lesson is to be aware of just how small the sample is when looking to the past for guidance. American presidential elections take place every four years, and English soccer championships once a year. A basic lesson of sampling is that one should have less confidence in the results the smaller the sample is, which in turn implies great modesty about what might happen in the future.In a game, the rules are fixed. If you spin a roulette wheel, or even send a baseball team out on the field to face an opponent, there are a set range of things that can happen, and it\u2019s relatively straightforward to figure out the probability of each.But in politics, external events, media coverage, public opinion and the strategies of opponents \u2014 even the number of opponents \u2014 are constantly in flux in unpredictable ways. That means something that happened in a past year may or may not be good evidence for what will happen this year.Prediction is hard. Complex systems with constantly changing rules, a limited historical sample to analyze and our own psychological biases and short historical memories make it harder. And that has rarely been more evident than in the worlds of politics and sports in 2016.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "House to Consider I.R.S. Commissioner\u2019s Impeachment", "Date": "2016-05-23", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When the House Judiciary Committee convenes on Tuesday to consider the alleged misdeeds of the Internal Revenue Service commissioner, John Koskinen, it will contemplate action that has not been taken in more than 140 years, and that in some respects has never been pursued: the impeachment of an agency head of Mr. Koskinen\u2019s rank.Tuesday\u2019s hearing on accusations by House Republicans that Mr. Koskinen lied under oath to Congress and defied a congressional subpoena is a remarkable moment, even for a Washington long fractured by partisanship.Not since Secretary of War William W. Belknap in 1876 has the House impeached an administration official other than the president, said Michael J. Gerhardt, a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law and an expert on the federal impeachment process. And an official below the president\u2019s cabinet has never been impeached.\u201cThis is unprecedented in many respects,\u201d Professor Gerhardt said.Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the Finance Committee, has made clear that the Senate would not convict Mr. Koskinen, which would require a nearly impossible two-thirds vote. But the effort in the House highlights the extent to which the I.R.S. has become a symbol for House Republicans of everything they despise about the federal bureaucracy, and their outrage about what they view as a pattern of obstruction by the Obama administration.\u201cWe can have our disagreements with him, but that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s an impeachable offense,\u201d Mr. Hatch said last week.President Obama turned to Mr. Koskinen in 2013 to lead the I.R.S. because of his reputation in the public and private sectors as a go-to manager of troubled enterprises. Mr. Koskinen, who was 74 at the time, agreed.\u201cHe is one of the truly dedicated public servants who has been respected as a top government manager for years,\u201d said G. William Hoagland, who was a longtime staff director of the Senate Budget Committee and fiscal policy adviser to Senate Republican leaders.But amid the mishandling of email messages sought as evidence by House investigators, that fury turned on him. Mr. Koskinen will not appear at the Tuesday hearing, the I.R.S. said on Monday, because he just returned from a multinational tax conference in China and had little time to prepare given the committee\u2019s recent invitation.\u201cHe provided, I think, a whole series of false testimony,\u201d said Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah and chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, who is one of the leaders of the push for impeachment. \u201cYou can\u2019t be under a duly issued subpoena and mislead Congress, and when you provide false testimony there has to be a consequence.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re left with no other remedy,\u201d Mr. Chaffetz added. \u201cThe F.B.I. is not going to take action. The president is not going to take action, but clearly he provided false testimony.\u201dCongressional Democrats and the White House have characterized the criticism as part of a broader effort by Republicans bent on destroying the I.R.S. by slashing its budget and impeding its work.\u201cInstead of taking real action on critical issues that involve the security and well-being of Americans, House Republicans are busy engaging in political witch hunts,\u201d said Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee.The drive to impeach Mr. Koskinen is running parallel to the Republicans\u2019 investigation into the deaths of American diplomats in Benghazi, Libya, and allegations against Planned Parenthood.\u201cThe fact is that John Koskinen has assumed a very difficult task, and that task has been made only more difficult by the false accusations of Republicans and by the continued insistence of Republicans to cut the budget for the I.R.S.,\u201d the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, said at a briefing last week.Mr. Koskinen started as commissioner of the I.R.S. in December 2013, well after the scrutiny was exposed.But House Republicans continued their investigations, and say the new commissioner lied during testimony in the winter and spring of 2014. They point to assurances that the I.R.S. would turn over email messages sent and received by Lois Lerner, a senior official in the Exempt Organizations Division from 2009 to 2010, when Tea Party-affiliated groups applying for tax-exempt status were unfairly scrutinized.Professor Gerhardt said that impeachment might be appropriate if Republicans proved their case. \u201cLying to Congress is a very serious charge, and if somebody were actually guilty of that, that is a perfectly legitimate basis for their removal,\u201d he said.But he said Republicans could undermine their effort if they focused on political arguments and potential wrongdoing by the I.R.S., rather than the legal arguments against Mr. Koskinen.Mr. Koskinen\u2019s supporters say some of the House members pushing for impeachment have been using the effort for their own political gain, including to raise campaign donations. They also note that in recent weeks, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia, has come under pressure by a conservative challenger in the Republican primary, Harry Griego.Some House Republicans have made clear that the targeting by the I.R.S. is still the main backdrop.\u201cWe know they targeted people\u2019s most cherished right, their First Amendment free speech rights, their political speech rights,\u201d said Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio and a leading proponent of impeachment. \u201cThey did it systematically. They did it for a sustained period of time, and then they got caught. And when they got caught, Mr. Koskinen\u2019s response to those investigations has been terrible.\u201dMr. Koskinen was unavailable for comment last week, but in an interview in April he called the House impeachment resolution, which was introduced in the fall, \u201cgroundless.\u201d\u201cWe testified truthfully and completely on the basis of what we knew at the time,\u201d he said. He attributed the loss of some of Ms. Lerner\u2019s emails to \u201cthe inadvertent destruction of very old tapes.\u201dMr. Koskinen is something of an unlikely target for the first impeachment of an agency\u2019s leader. Before his I.R.S. appointment, he was enlisted to run the mortgage giant Freddie Mac when it was put under government conservatorship in September 2008 during the nation\u2019s financial crisis. Before that, he was named by President Bill Clinton to lead a federal task force overseeing the tricky \u201cY2K\u201d computer coding transition at the turn of the century, and the deputy director for management of the White House Office of Management and Budget.Still, only two Republicans voted with Democrats to confirm Mr. Koskinen for the I.R.S. job. One was Mr. Hatch, who last week told reporters at the Capitol, \u201cFor the most part, he\u2019s been very cooperative with us.\u201dFred T. Goldberg Jr., a tax lawyer and Republican who was the commissioner of the I.R.S. under the first President George Bush, called charges of unethical or illegal behavior \u201cpreposterous\u201d and calls for impeachment \u201cjust way over the line.\u201dBut House Republicans are resolute. Last week, Mr. Chaffetz proposed a resolution censuring Mr. Koskinen. Mr. Chaffetz said he viewed the step as a \u201cprecursor\u201d to impeachment, but one that also might be sufficient for some colleagues who regarded impeachment as too drastic.Mr. Chaffetz said he did not know if the full House would ultimately vote on impeachment.\u201cIt\u2019s incumbent upon us to make the case and rally enough support in the conference in order to justify it coming to the floor,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Europe to Remove 500-Euro Bill, the \u2018Bin Laden\u2019 Bank Note Criminals Love", "Date": "2016-05-04", "News": "Supported byFRANKFURT \u2014 A suitcase stuffed full of cash may soon be worth a lot less.When it comes to moving money nefariously, the \u20ac500 note has been especially handy.It is a large denomination in a widely circulated and easily convertible currency. In the United States, the largest denomination is $100, after the Federal Reserve discontinued the $500, $1,000, $5,000 and $10,000 bills in 1969. Switzerland has a 1,000-franc note, worth about $1,050, but its supply is limited.After the European Central Bank phases out the \u20ac500 note by the end of 2018, the next highest denomination will be \u20ac200. That same $1 million would weigh roughly two and half times as much.And using $100 bills is just downright bulky. That would clock in at roughly 22 pounds and require an entire briefcase to carry.Getting rid of the \u20ac500 bill \u201cwill make life harder for criminals, raising their costs and increasing their detection risks,\u201d Peter Sands, the lead author of the Harvard study and a former chief executive of the British bank Standard Chartered, wrote in an emailon Wednesday.There are still many ways to hide illegal transactions, like using offshore banks and shell companies. Digital currencies like Bitcoin also allow financial transactions outside the purview of central banks and regulators.But Robert Palmer, an expert on money laundering at Global Witness, an advocacy group, said cash remained an important element in the criminal economy.\u201cThere is a range of ways that people launder money,\u201d Mr. Palmer said by telephone from London. \u201cSome are new and innovative, and some are old fashioned. Hard cash is still a common way of moving dirty money.\u201dThe decision Wednesday to phase out the notes by the European Central Bank\u2019s Governing Council does not immediately remove from circulation the roughly \u20ac300 billion worth of the purple \u20ac500 notes, which depict an unidentified modern building on one side and a bridge on the other.The decision simply means that, beginning at the end of 2018, central banks in the 19 countries of the eurozone will no longer replace \u20ac500 bills that are returned for sorting or other reasons.The European Central Bank said it would not take the more radical step of declaring that \u20ac500 bills are no longer legal tender. Such a move would have meant the notes could no longer be legally used for transactions. People with \u20ac500 notes would have had to bring them back to a central bank to be exchanged for smaller denominations.Mr. Sands said the central bank could take steps to discourage use of the notes still in circulation, for example, by requiring banks to ask questions when customers present \u20ac500 bills for deposit.To critics, the steps taken on Wednesday were seen as an infringement on personal freedoms, as they make it harder for people to opt out of the traditional financial system.One leading German economist also accused the European Central Bank of ulterior motives. With fewer large bills, it will be easier for the central bank to push interest rates to new lows, said Clemens Fuest, president of the Ifo economic research institute in Munich, which has been critical of the central bank\u2019s cheap money policies.That is because for almost two years the European Central Bank has been charging lenders a so-called negative interest rate to keep money in its virtual vaults, which are considered the ultimate safe haven. The policy is intended to push down market interest rates and force banks to lend money rather than hoard it. Currently the central bank deposit rate is minus 0.4 percent.In theory, banks can avoid this de facto rent on their deposits by holding cash in their own vaults. But in practice it is expensive to store large amounts of bills safely \u2014 and it would become even more so if the denominations were smaller.With fewer \u20ac500 notes available, the banks might be even more likely to do what the European Central Bank wants them to do, which is lend money rather than sitting on it. \u201cIt would be significantly more expensive for banks and savings banks to store lots of smaller bank notes, \u201d Mr. Fuest said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tycoon on the Run Hopes Russia\u2019s Reach Stops at the French Riviera\u2019s Edge", "Date": "2016-05-20", "News": "Supported byThe Saturday ProfileNICE, France \u2014 When his bodyguards found a small brown package with protruding wires taped to the undercarriage of his Rolls-Royce in London, Sergei Pugachev decided it was time to take cover. Already on the run from Russia, he fled Britain last year for what he now hopes will be a less stressful refuge on the French Riviera.\u201cLondon is a dangerous place,\u201d said the 53-year-old Russian tycoon and bitterly estranged former friend of the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, noting that at least three Russian exiles at odds with the Kremlin had died under mysterious circumstances in or near the British capital over the last decade.\u201cI felt the noose tightening,\u201d Mr. Pugachev added. \u201cHere I can live in peace, and the weather is better, too,\u201d he said, standing on a tiger-skin rug in the study of his Nice villa overlooking the Mediterranean.Unmoved by Mr. Pugachev\u2019s claims that his life could be in danger, a High Court judge, Vivien Rose, in February sentenced him in absentia to two years in prison for contempt of court and ordered him to pay 375,000 pounds, or about $548,000, in costs.As it turns out, the device hidden under his Rolls-Royce and similarly mysterious objects found under three other family cars contained no explosives or poison but were only tracking devices put there by a private British security company acting for the Russians.THE contempt of court verdict was the latest in a long series of setbacks for a man who just a few years ago ranked as one of Russia\u2019s richest, best connected and most secretive tycoons: a friend of Mr. Putin; a patron of the Russian Orthodox Church; and the head of a business empire that included a bank, two shipyards making vessels for the Russian Navy, a huge coal deposit in Siberia and a prestige real estate project right on Red Square.All the same, Mr. Pugachev has found it difficult to extricate himself from his Russian past and what he described as mafialike codes of conduct that are expected to bind current and former members of the Kremlin inner circle. His many critics in Russia view him as a crook who simply tried to grab too much money for himself, but Mr. Pugachev insists he fell prey to a system that rewards absolute loyalty and punishes those who break ranks by asserting their own business interests against the demands of the state.At one point, he was as deep into that inner circle as anyone. His family photograph albums contain pictures of his two sons, now adults, playing as teenagers with Mr. Putin\u2019s daughters in the Kremlin and at Mr. Pugachev\u2019s country house outside Moscow. Other photographs record long-ago dinner parties attended by powerful Kremlin insiders like Igor Sechin, a former K.G.B. officer whose portfolio now includes the United Shipbuilding Corporation, a state-owned ship maker that now controls Mr. Pugachev\u2019s ship yards.The famous photographs of a shirtless Mr. Putin fishing, hunting and riding horses were taken at Mr. Pugachev\u2019s estate in the Siberian region of Tuva, which the businessman represented from 2001 to 2011 as an elected senator in the upper house of Parliament.LIKE many of Russia\u2019s wealthy elite, Mr. Pugachev got his start amid the chaos of the 1990s, when he set up a bank, Mezhprombank, and used it to finance other business ventures and cement relations with state and church hierarchies. The son of a Soviet military officer, he now has five children, two sons by a Russian wife, from whom he is now divorced, and three more children with Alexandra Tolstoy, an English equestrian, socialite and distant relative of the Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy. She now lives mostly in London, where their three young children attend a French school.The couple used to appear regularly in British and Russian gossip columns, particularly when both were still married to other people. The British news media named him \u201cthe Kremlin\u2019s banker,\u201d a role he denies having played. Though he says he is no longer a billionaire and deeply out of favor in Moscow, Mr. Pugachev is far from down-and-out in Nice, where he keeps a full-time staff of cooks, servants and bodyguards.A 2014 court order issued in London at Russia\u2019s request froze his assets worldwide but still granted him weekly living expenses of \u00a350,000 and left him with a string of properties, including homes in Chelsea, one of London\u2019s most expensive areas, and Nice, as well as a yacht with an onboard swimming pool moored in nearby Monaco.But perhaps his most valuable remaining asset is a cache of documents and other evidence assembled in preparation for a showdown with Russia in an arbitration process in The Hague. There, he hopes to demonstrate that Russia violated an investment treaty with France by expropriating properties he owned worth at least $12 billion, and to win compensation for his alleged losses.Among his documents are the minutes of a 2011 inter-ministerial meeting in Moscow that laid out a plan to force Mr. Pugachev to hand over control of his St. Petersburg shipyards to Mr. Sechin\u2019s state-owned United Shipbuilding Corporation. The meeting recommended, among other steps, that the Federal Security Service, the post-Soviet version of the K.G.B. known as the F.S.B., \u201cinitiate checks\u201d and find \u201csigns of crimes\u201d so as to force a transfer of ownership.The entry of the F.S.B. into what had previously been normal business negotiations, Mr. Pugachev said, showed that \u201cdiscussions moved very quickly onto a noncommercial track.\u201d He said he was always ready to give up the shipyards, but only if the state paid a proper market price. It paid nothing in the end, seizing the property after declaring his bank, which had pledged the shipyards as collateral for loans, bankrupt.Like most of the Russian feuds over money that have ended up in British and other European courts over the years, Mr. Pugachev\u2019s struggle has so far yielded millions of dollars in income for lawyers but little clarity. Bewildered judges have been left struggling to reconcile flamboyantly contradictory accounts of the truth.THE British judge who sentenced Mr. Pugachev to jail over his flight to France, Ms. Rose, questioned the businessman\u2019s trustworthiness but also acknowledged that he had \u201cfaced very considerable pressure.\u201d Referring to \u201cthe realities of political power in the Russian Federation,\u201d she noted that Mr. Pugachev\u2019s evasiveness was in part understandable.\u201cI hope this will be over by end of the year. I am confident of a positive outcome,\u201d said Mr. Pugachev of the arbitration process in The Hague. He added that he does not \u201creally need\u201d the billions of dollars he is seeking in compensation but does want vindication against a Russian system that he helped put in place by promoting Mr. Putin as a successor to President Boris N. Yeltsin.\u201cI took part in bringing him to power,\u201d he said, recalling how at the end of Mr. Yeltsin\u2019s tenure in 1999 he had sung Mr. Putin\u2019s praises to Mr. Yeltsin\u2019s daughter, Tatyana Dyachenko, and her partner Valentin Yumashev, an influential Kremlin insider.\u201cI now see this was a mistake,\u201d he added.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Economic Promises a President Trump Could (and Couldn\u2019t) Keep", "Date": "2016-05-21", "News": "Supported byIn the hills and hollows of Mingo County, W.Va., where unemployment is nearly triple the national average, it\u2019s coal. On the southwest side of Chicago, where the landscape couldn\u2019t be more different but the economic fears are much the same, it\u2019s Oreo cookies. Elsewhere, it is cars, computers and air-conditioners.And whether it is through rolling back regulations, imposing tariffs or making some none-too-discreet phone calls from the Oval Office to the C-suites, Donald J. Trump has vowed to bring back the vanishing jobs of miners, bakers and assembly-line workers, beginning on Day 1 of his administration.\u201cIt\u2019s going to happen fast,\u201d Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, recently told a cheering crowd in Charleston, W.Va. \u201cThis is so easy.\u201dIf only that were true.For all of the appeal his message might have for residents there (Mr. Trump captured almost 90 percent of the vote in Mingo County), much of what he is promising to do \u2014 on his own, and through congressional legislation \u2014 couldn\u2019t be accomplished in the first 1,000 days of a Trump administration, much less the first 100.For example, Mr. Trump has suggested easing clean-air regulations enacted by Democrats and Republicans alike that have hurt the coal industry. But King Coal is unlikely to ever recapture market share lost in recent years to natural gas made cheap by the fracking boom, not to mention fast-growing alternative energy sources like wind and solar.Nor could Mr. Trump, a billionaire businessman, force steel makers to buy coal from Appalachia to heat furnaces in Asia, Europe and North America that have been idled by weak demand.\u201cI will not say he can\u2019t do anything, but it\u2019s very unlikely he\u2019ll be able to restore coal to where it was,\u201d said John Deskins, director of the West Virginia University Bureau of Business and Economic Research. With production and employment in the mines down by about a third since 2008, Mr. Deskins said, \u201ceven in our most optimistic scenario, we don\u2019t expect a big bounce back.\u201dOf course, a Trump presidency is far from certain. And any president\u2019s sway over the national economy is debatable.But a big part of what has gotten Mr. Trump this far are his outsize promises. And while the case of coal and clean air illustrates the limits of a president\u2019s power in the economic arena, there are other places where Mr. Trump would have considerably more room to maneuver.Like much of his speechifying, Mr. Trump\u2019s economic and business agenda is a mixture of opening bids and dog-whistle messages as well as some nuts-and-bolts proposals he might be able to put in effect as president, even without congressional approval. Sorting out what\u2019s what, though, isn\u2019t simple or safe. Just ask the pundits who wrote off Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy as a sideshow even as he won one primary after another.For his part, Mr. Trump warns it would be a mistake to underestimate his ability to change the rules of the game.\u201cIn my whole life, I\u2019ve gotten things done,\u201d he said in an interview on Saturday. \u201cWhether it\u2019s getting a city built on the West Side of Manhattan or getting zoning board approvals, my whole life has been finding a consensus.\u201dBut when it comes to companies moving jobs out of the United States, he said a tougher tone was in order.\u201cI\u2019m not Obama, and there are stupid people in our government,\u201d he said. \u201cWith me, there will be consequences if you move, and the consequences will be severe.\u201dIn terms of coal and recovering all of those vanished jobs in West Virginia, Mr. Trump acknowledged that price competition from cheaper natural gas was fierce.\u201cBut coal is still less expensive, and it has a major place in terms of energy,\u201d he said. And regulatory relief \u2014 whether in terms of environmental rules or workplace safety \u2014 would benefit the industry, he said.\u201cI have become very well versed on coal,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThe regulations are brutal, and they are sending inspectors into the mines two and three times a day. Even the miners say it\u2019s out of control.\u201dIn law firms, corporate boardrooms, lobbyist watering holes and think tanks in Washington and beyond, experts are quietly assessing what a Trump presidency might actually look like in practice. Or to put it more bluntly, business is business. So whether they find Mr. Trump politically abhorrent or a welcome antidote to the status quo, these insiders also want to know what he might mean for their bottom line.National debate: \u201cTrump would put the bully in bully pulpit.\u201dPerhaps the greatest opportunity for Mr. Trump lies in the extraordinary ability of any president to direct the tone and contours of the national debate, especially on issues he has highlighted, like how American companies should treat their American workers. And unlike most past Republican candidates, Mr. Trump has not been reluctant to criticize big business on that topic.\u201cDonald Trump would put the bully in bully pulpit,\u201d said Seth Harris, who served as a top official in the Labor Department under Democratic presidents.Immigration: \u201cWhere the president\u2019s power is least restricted.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a reason why so many of Trump\u2019s proposals revolve around the idea of denying visas to people,\u201d said William A. Stock, a lawyer in Philadelphia who is the president-elect of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. \u201cThat\u2019s where the president\u2019s power is least restricted, if he asserts it.\u201dThe Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, Mr. Stock said, gives the president \u201cthe ability to suspend the entry of foreign nationals whose entry is deemed to be detrimental to the interests of the U.S.\u201dNoting that recent administrations have invoked the law to forbid entry to individuals from the former Yugoslavia accused of human rights violations, as well as to Cuban and Iranian government officials, Mr. Stock said, \u201cThis is a tool that is pretty powerful, but it\u2019s usually been used in more limited instances.\u201dFinancial reform: \u201cWhen it comes to regulation, people are policy.\u201dRepealing the law might be difficult, but experts who helped draft the regulations agreed that Mr. Trump could defang them through selective enforcement \u2014 appointing different officials to the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission \u2014 and by issuing new executive orders.A President Trump would have wide latitude to name his own people to oversee less conspicuous but powerful agencies like the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and to seed Treasury and other government departments with like-minded officials.\u201cWhen it comes to regulation, people are policy,\u201d said Aaron Klein, a top official at the Treasury Department from 2009 to 2012 and helped draft the Dodd-Frank bill. \u201cRegulators who don\u2019t want to regulate can thwart the will of Congress.\u201dBut the president\u2019s reach isn\u2019t unlimited. Nor is it speedy. And however stupendous Mr. Trump\u2019s deal-making skills may be, the forces of gridlock in the nation\u2019s capital are no less awesome.\u201cThe system doesn\u2019t change,\u201d said Tom Korologos, a longtime Republican strategist and an adviser at the law firm DLA Piper in Washington. \u201cTrump can say, \u2018I\u2019m going to repeal this or I\u2019m going to repeal that,\u2019 but it\u2019s going to take longer than 100 days.\u201dMr. Korologos, who served on the transition teams of President Ronald Reagan and President George W. Bush, isn\u2019t supporting Mr. Trump this year. He added that while the presumptive Republican nominee\u2019s promises might make \u201cfor nice talking points, it will be harder than he thinks.\u201dTax cuts: A Republican Congress is unlikely to accept a $10 trillion deficit over 10 years.That\u2019s especially true when it comes to the macroeconomic picture. Mr. Trump claims his proposal for sweeping tax cuts for individuals and businesses wouldn\u2019t bust the budget and could lift the economy\u2019s annual growth rate to 6 percent.More sober-minded experts say that\u2019s magical thinking, a 2016 version of \u201cvoodoo economics,\u201d as President George H. W. Bush famously described what came to be known as Reaganomics in the 1980s. They estimate Mr. Trump\u2019s tax plan could create a $10 trillion shortfall at the Treasury over the next decade, and note that annual economic growth has topped 5 percent only once in the last 35 years.\u201cI have a hard time believing that even a Republican Congress would enact his tax plan, because it would create enormous deficits,\u201d said William G. Gale, an economist under the first President Bush who is now co-director of the Tax Policy Center in Washington.Mr. Trump responded that \u201cthose tax cuts go hand in hand with many other things.\u201dAs a result of getting tough on trade policy and what he considers currency manipulation by China, Mr. Trump argues that more jobs would return to the United States, which in turn would spur economic growth and therefore tax revenues.Whether or not that\u2019s realistic, any significant alteration in trade or tax policy means winning over the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee, both of which zealously guard their turf. \u201cThis is what makes them tick,\u201d Mr. Korologos said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take more than just a bunch of rhetoric to change things.\u201dLabor: An ebb and flow when administrations change hands in Washington.Like Mr. Korologos, Mr. Harris, the former Labor Department official, has seen the ebb and flow when administrations change hands in Washington. Except he was on the opposite side of the aisle, having served on the Democratic transition teams after President Bill Clinton was elected in 1992 and after President Obama\u2019s victory in 2008.At Labor, where he was a top adviser under Mr. Clinton, and then as deputy secretary in the Obama administration, Mr. Harris saw firsthand just how much influence the president could have.Tasked with enforcing regulations on whether companies are abiding by minimum wage requirements, child labor restrictions, affirmative action guidelines, workplace safety rules and a web of other laws, Mr. Harris said, the Labor Department has never been very popular with big business or the Republican candidates it supports.And when George W. Bush succeeded Bill Clinton, the change was swift, Mr. Harris said. Budgets were cut, and travel to inspect factories and mines decreased. There was less emphasis on enforcement, going into workplaces and punishing violations, he said, and more on educating employers about potential infractions.After Mr. Harris returned to the Labor Department in 2009, budgets were increased, and surprise workplace inspections were resumed.\u201cWe investigated more deeply, enforced procedures, and were more likely to find violations,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was no executive order or action by Congress or the White House. We just did it. The laws existed \u2014 it was a matter of whether you were going to solve the problem aggressively or be more passive.\u201dRepublicans, including Mr. Trump, have long argued that regulatory zeal kills jobs and undermines economic growth. Democrats maintain it is necessary to protect employees from abuses and risks, while imposing checks on the power of big companies.Both arguments contain elements of truth. But Mr. Harris said that what was critical was that rank-and-file civil servants quickly adapted to the message coming down from the Oval Office.\u201cThe president sets the tone for how our government is going to relate to our country,\u201d said Mr. Harris, who is now a lawyer in private practice in Washington. \u201cHow the laws are implemented and enforced, how the money is spent and how motivated people are to do their job.\u201dHealth care: \u201cSelling insurance isn\u2019t like selling credit cards.\u201dDodd-Frank isn\u2019t the only big Obama-era law Mr. Trump has talked about repealing. The other prominent target of Mr. Trump\u2019s ire \u2014 the Affordable Care Act \u2014 would be trickier to dispose of.The problem, said Nicholas Bagley, a professor of law at the University of Michigan, is that insurers don\u2019t want to do it because it\u2019s not practical. \u201cSelling insurance isn\u2019t like selling credit cards,\u201d Mr. Bagley said. \u201cOut-of-state health insurers don\u2019t have networks of doctors and hospitals in place. The problem isn\u2019t legal restraints, and it\u2019s not a solution to what ails the health care economy.\u201dMr. Trump responded that deregulation is still the answer, despite the skepticism of experts like Mr. Bagley.\u201cThe problem is rules, regulations and restrictions,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have rate increases that are catastrophic, and the deductibles are so high people can\u2019t even use the health care. If it was really open and you got competition going, amazing things will happen.\u201dEnvironment: Sending \u201ca chill down the spine\u201d of people who enforce the laws.Environmental regulation offers a more promising target for Mr. Trump, who has called the Environmental Protection Agency a laughingstock and a disgrace, and has promised to cut its budget.In fact, in the absence of congressional action, the Trump administration could target many other environmental regulations by simply going after the people who enforce them, said Don Barry, who spent two decades at the Interior Department and directed the United States Fish and Wildlife Service under President Clinton.Decades later, Mr. Barry still recalls how a round of firings in the Interior Department at the dawn of the Reagan administration signaled a turnabout in policy. \u201cThe single biggest thing they can do is send a chill down the spine of career survivors in the bureaucracy and bring things to a halt,\u201d he said.Similarly, a Trump administration might be willing to approve state environmental plans that are more friendly to fossil fuels, said Kevin Book, head of research at ClearView Energy Partners. Proposed, but not completed, clean-water regulations aimed at restricting mountaintop-removal mining for coal in West Virginia could be eased, he said.Trade: Trump can punish countries, but jobs are unlikely to return.Still, even if Mr. Trump were to win in November and roll back some environmental regulations, it wouldn\u2019t significantly alter the fate of Mingo County and much of the nation\u2019s depressed coal industry.\u201cTaking a more lenient stance on clean-air or clean-water rules would do nothing to help coal demand,\u201d Mr. Book said. \u201cCoal-fired power plants have been mothballed and are being disassembled, and that capacity is gone. It\u2019s not even close to something you could reverse by administrative fiat.\u201dIf Washington\u2019s ability to gridlock even the most ambitious of presidential agendas were to block Mr. Trump\u2019s White House plans, he would still have the bully pulpit, of course. And unlike Theodore Roosevelt, who coined that term, Mr. Trump probably wouldn\u2019t speak softly.Announced in July 2015, the Nabisco layoffs in Chicago continued during the Illinois primary in March, despite jabs from Mr. Trump and both Democratic presidential contenders, Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders.United Technologies is similarly unlikely to rethink Carrier\u2019s move out of Indianapolis. And in an era when Apple is willing to fight the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to unlock an iPhone on national security grounds, more corporate defiance may become the norm.Blanketing countries from China to Mexico with import duties would be a tall order without congressional approval. The White House, though, does retain plenty of leeway to punish countries it thinks are engaged in currency manipulation, dumping of products below the cost of production and other free-trade abuses.The problem for Mr. Trump \u2014 or any president who wants to get tough on trade violators \u2014 is that, in the global economy, imposing tariffs on competitors abroad could have serious economic consequences at home by sharply raising prices on imported goods.Cheaper flat-screen televisions, computers, clothes, furniture and other products from Walmart, Amazon and elsewhere have been a rare bright spot for struggling working- and middle-class Americans. And trade wars cut both ways: Retaliatory tariffs on American-made products from countries like China would prompt howls of pain at still strong domestic manufacturers like Caterpillar and Boeing.But for all the uncertainty around what might happen after Jan. 20, 2017, the lawyers and lobbyists who are now trying to gauge a Trump presidency are already emerging as winners.

In his absence, Ishaq Dar, the finance minister, a relative of Mr. Sharif\u2019s, is managing the day-to-day running of the government.Khawaja Muhammad Asif, the defense minister, said Mr. Sharif would return to Pakistan one week after the surgery, if allowed by his doctors.Ms. Sharif said a team of surgeons had advised her father to undergo the surgery after scans and tests, but she did not describe precisely what the surgeons would do. She said Mr. Sharif would be on medication for the next three days and undergo the operation on Tuesday.The prime minister first underwent open-heart surgery in 2011 after a cardiac procedure to treat atrial fibrillation, an irregular and often rapid heart rate, resulted in a perforation of his heart, his daughter said. He has required regular medical checkups since.The leaks revealed that three of Mr. Sharif\u2019s children controlled shell companies through which they owned expensive residential properties in London.The revelations have caused an uproar in Pakistan, an impoverished country with a history of corruption and malfeasance, and opposition politicians have pressed Mr. Sharif to resign.Mr. Sharif, whose family\u2019s riches were made primarily through dealing in steel, has denied any wrongdoing and has offered to be investigated.But differences persist between the government and opposition political parties over how an investigation would be done, and lengthy negotiations are taking place between the two sides to establish the terms.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Campaign Stumbles as It Tries to Go Big", "Date": "2016-05-27", "News": "Supported byBISMARCK, N.D. \u2014 A constant stream of changes and scuffles are unsettling Donald J. Trump\u2019s campaign team, including the abrupt dismissal this week of his national political director.A sense of paranoia is growing among his campaign staff members, including some who have told associates they believe that their Trump Tower offices in New York may be bugged, according to three people briefed on the conversations.And there is confusion among his donors, who want to give money to a \u201csuper PAC\u201d supporting Mr. Trump, but have received conflicting signals from top aides about which one to support.Two months after assurances that the candidate would become \u201cmore presidential\u201d and transition to a more unifying phase of his campaign, Mr. Trump continues to act as if the primary is still underway. His team has struggled to fill top positions, such as communications director, and Mr. Trump has made clear he still sees himself as his own chief adviser.Asked for comment about his management style, and the current state of his campaign, Mr. Trump declined, criticizing the reporters writing this article. \u201cYou two wouldn\u2019t know how to write a good story about me if you tried \u2014 dream on,\u201d Mr. Trump said in an email relayed by his spokeswoman, Hope Hicks.So far, Mr. Trump has shown little inclination to adjust to a political world. His penchant for setting up competition and infusing tension between his subordinates has carried over from his real estate company.\u201cHe certainly does love playing people against each other, but in my experience he knew how to make me reach my potential,\u201d said Sam Nunberg, who was fired from the campaign in 2015 after a series of clashes with the campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. \u201cYou become very committed in that environment.\u201dBut, as was the case with Mr. Wiley\u2019s dismissal, Mr. Trump is reliant on information he garners himself, and can be swayed by the last person he talked to.Mr. Trump has shown himself to be a masterly communicator, and his instincts, especially in identifying the issues that will animate voters, are shrewd. But the combat within the Trump campaign has undermined the daily messages the team seeks to promote. On Wednesday, for instance, Mr. Trump met with dozens of female chief executives and entrepreneurs before his afternoon rally in California, a meeting that was never publicized. Instead, the campaign sent out a message announcing Mr. Wiley\u2019s dismissal.Current polls show an uphill battle for Donald Trump should he and Hillary Clinton face off in the general election.\u201cThe drama in Trumpville this week,\u201d Mr. Reed said, totally overtook the \u201cdevastating\u201d report, which, he added, \u201cshould be all the country is talking about.\u201dNow, many Republican officials worry that Mr. Trump is uninterested in transitioning into his new role, including the rigors of going up against Mrs. Clinton in a general election fight.The Trump operation, for instance, has talked for weeks about hiring a full-time communications director, but has yet to bring anyone on board. Ms. Hicks is still the sole communications staff member. The Clinton campaign, by contrast, has a press team of more than a dozen, including people devoted solely to the news media for black and Hispanic audiences.To complement its lean operation, the Trump campaign has begun relying on the Republican National Committee for everything from opposition research to communications help and voter data.On Thursday, Mr. Trump expressed confidence that the R.N.C. could take over for what he has not done himself.\u201cThey built, over years and years, staffs in every state \u2014 you can\u2019t do that, or you can\u2019t do it very well, if you\u2019re doing it all over the next few months,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters on Thursday in North Dakota. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that over a period of just a short while, because we have November coming up very rapidly. It\u2019s going to be very soon.\u201dYet officials in battleground states have complained for weeks that the Republican committee has not delivered the promised resources for field organizations.Donald J. Trump is set to be the Republican standard-bearer, but when it comes to some of his policies, he is out of sync with many Republican leaders in Congress.Mr. Trump has also been dismissive of data analytics, suggesting in interviews that his showmanship and rallies will continue to be effective. He has suggested that he will compete in new states, despite the scant resources he has devoted to the traditional Republican map so far. And he has been adamant to aides that he intends to try to compete in New York, which no Republican has captured since Ronald Reagan, and has held discussions about hiring an additional pollster for the state.Mr. Trump, who lent his campaign money during the primaries, has begun fund-raising for the general election, and there are signs that high-dollar donors are willing to help, especially by donating to a super PAC supporting him. But there are several such groups, and the campaign has yet to unofficially sanction one, leaving some donors confused about which super PAC, if any, they should support.There are now two super PACs that have said they are the premier group supporting the presumptive nominee, neither of which Mr. Trump has given his blessing. Mr. Trump\u2019s aides have held meetings about starting yet another super PAC, but so far they have not made moves.\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as job security in a campaign,\u201d Mr. Johnson said of the churn within the Trump team.But Mr. Reed stressed that Mr. Trump needed to grow \u2014 and fast. \u201cTrump is the King Kong of the G.O.P., and when he steps, the world rattles,\u201d he said. \u201cTrump needs to better fully appreciate and understand this new role.\u201dAshley Parker reported from Bismarck, and Maggie Haberman from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Big Are Those Killer Asteroids? A Critic Says NASA Doesn\u2019t Know.", "Date": "2016-05-23", "News": "Supported byBut hundreds of thousands more have not yet been discovered, and whether any of those are on course to slam into our planet, no one knows. So finding and tracking all the asteroids that could cross Earth\u2019s path would allow officials to issue warnings and potentially provide time to deflect dangerous ones.He has also become a statistics scold of scientists.WISE, launched in 2009, snapped images of three-quarters of a billion stars, galaxies and other celestial objects, including the heat emissions of asteroids.Dr. Myhrvold contends that the Neowise analysis is deeply flawed. \u201cThe bad news is it\u2019s all basically wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately for a lot of it, it\u2019s never going to be as accurate as they had hoped.\u201dDr. Myhrvold isn\u2019t arguing that NASA has overlooked dangers from the known asteroids. But he does question whether scientists know as much as they think they do.Most of the millions of asteroids are found between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, but some dip closer to the sun. There is no doubt that some will hit Earth someday.\u201cFrom the practical perspective of finding asteroids,\u201d Dr. Myhrvold said, \u201cit\u2019s really important that we know the distribution of diameters and the distribution of albedos.\u201dAccording to NASA\u2019s scientists, the estimates of asteroid diameters made by Neowise are often within 10 percent of the actual size. But Dr. Myhrvold says the uncertainties are much greater, more than 100 percent in many cases.Space agency officials disagree. \u201cHe\u2019s a very smart man,\u201d said Lindley Johnson, who oversees NASA\u2019s efforts to protect the planet from space rocks. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t make him an expert in everything.\u201dDr. Johnson said NASA experts had pointed out errors and that Dr. Myhrvold had not fixed them. \u201cIt\u2019s overly simplistic, and he makes some assumptions that are not valid,\u201d Dr. Johnson said.Other scientists say that Dr. Myhrvold\u2019s criticisms have merit.But even if Dr. Myhrvold is correct, Dr. Harris said the Neowise data \u201chas good enough validity to be useful for most purposes.\u201dDr. Myhrvold is not an astronomer. He had never done research on asteroids.\u201cWhat they didn\u2019t know is that I had been interested in killer asteroids for a long time,\u201d Dr. Myhrvold said. After all, an asteroid slamming into Earth is believed to have brought the age of dinosaurs to an end 66 million years ago.Each group offered computer simulations of how many unseen asteroids would be spotted, making different assumptions.Ultimately, Dr. Myhrvold, who became wealthy from his Microsoft days, decided not to donate money to B612.He has also not given any money to the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, which has received some private financing from Bill Gates, his former Microsoft boss.Dr. Myhrvold said that Dr. Mainzer argued that a ground-based telescope could not detect asteroids within Earth\u2019s orbit because they would be too close to the horizon.That seemed strange to Dr. Myhrvold, because even amateurs can easily spot celestial objects far inside Earth\u2019s orbit like Venus, 26 million miles closer to the sun than Earth.Dr. Myhrvold said Dr. Mainzer responded that large telescopes were not designed to point that close to the ground. But the one in Chile is, he noted.\u201cI was happy he pointed out there was a misconception that LSST could not see within the Earth orbit,\u201d said Dr. Ivezic, a professor at the University of Washington.Dr. Chesley of NASA is coordinating a more detailed analysis of the telescope\u2019s asteroid-finding prowess, with preliminary findings expected in late summer.In recent presentations, NASA officials have portrayed Neocam more as a complement than a competitor. \u201cIt\u2019s a team sport,\u201d Dr. Johnson said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any one system that is going to provide us all the data we need.\u201dNASA declined to make Dr. Mainzer available for an interview. Responding to written questions, she said the Neowise team stood behind the findings and that the results had been validated by independent observations and other researchers.A simple demonstration of that, Dr. Myhrvold said, is the shiny chrome cooking surface of a restaurant hibachi grill. A dark grill surface would bathe diners in uncomfortable waves of heat. The Neocam models failed to take into account the effects of reflected sunlight, he said.He then took a closer look at Neowise, too. One aspect Dr. Myhrvold found curious was that in more than 100 instances, the Neowise team reported asteroid diameters that matched exactly what had previously been determined by other methods like radar measurements and spacecraft flybys. \u201cI think it\u2019s a pretty strong smoking gun that something is wrong,\u201d he said.For her part, Dr. Mainzer said the asteroids with exact measurement matches were used for calibration and thus the values were set to those that had been previously observed.The younger Dr. Harris agrees that Dr. Myhrvold has raised a valid point about Kirchhoff\u2019s Law and that a closer look at the Neowise analysis would be fruitful. Earlier satellites looked at longer wavelengths where reflected sunlight was less of a problem.Still, he disapproves of Dr. Myhrvold\u2019s scolding tone. \u201cThere\u2019s very much a schoolteacher attitude about it,\u201d he said.Dr. Myhrvold insists he has no vendetta against the Neowise scientists. But, he added, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s unduly mean of me to point out their data is irreproducible.\u201dKirchhoff\u2019s law could again come into play with Neocam, which would make observations at fairly short infrared wavelengths. Neocam is one of five lower-cost missions under consideration, and NASA is to approve one or two of them in September, aiming for launch in the 2020s.Dr. Mainzer deferred answering some follow-up questions, saying those issues would be best addressed by the referees reviewing Dr. Myhrvold\u2019s paper. \u201cWe believe at this point it\u2019s best to allow the process of peer review \u2014 the foundation of the scientific process \u2014 to move forward,\u201d she wrote.Advertisement"}

Should the $140 million verdict stand up to appeal, Gawker Media will most likely cease to exist as we know it. And if too much of Gawker survives, Mr. Thiel, with an estimated net worth of $2.7 billion, indicates he will keep financing anti-Gawker lawsuits to kill off whatever is left.Mr. Thiel\u2019s campaign is in keeping with the pledge his favored candidate for president, Donald J. Trump, made to ease barriers to lawsuits against journalists. But it is actually the flip side of the media realm\u2019s new coin. Many of his fellow billionaires have gained control of news organizations by buying them or starting them.Of course, powerful media executives have long been part of the global fabric. Rupert Murdoch, the News Corporation executive chairman, has been at it for decades, and his influence over his news group has taken on mythical status.And long before Mr. Murdoch, there was one William Randolph Hearst, who defined what it meant to be a media mogul.But there is a difference between Hearst and the many billionaires who are trying to control today\u2019s news media, said David Nasaw, the author of the great Hearst biography \u201cThe Chief: The Life of William Randolph Hearst.\u201d \u201cHearst made it abundantly clear \u2014 \u2018This is my newspaper, these are my views, take or leave it,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cHearst put his editorials on the front page, with his picture, and he signed them, for God\u2019s sake.\u201dMr. Nasaw, on the other hand, sees Mr. Adelson as \u201cdissembling\u201d when he says he isn\u2019t involving himself in editorial decisions at the paper. And then there are the Silicon Valley moguls, he said, who \u201ctry to have it both ways \u2014 they try to say, you know, \u2018Oh no we\u2019re playing by the rules and we\u2019re not indulging in our personal whims.\u2019\u201dThat\u2019s because Facebook has something Hearst never had: power over the distribution of content from most major American news organizations, which increasingly rely on exposure to the huge audience Facebook provides. Facebook has said no one person or even group of people controls what news its algorithmic formulas spit out for individual news feeds.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Decapitated Churches in China\u2019s Christian Heartland", "Date": "2016-05-21", "News": "Supported byIn the town of Shuitou, workers used blowtorches to cut a 10-foot-high cross off the 120-foot steeple of the Salvation Church. It now lies in the churchyard, wrapped in a red shroud.About 10 miles to the east, in Mabu township, riot police officers blocked parishioners from entering the grounds of the Dachang Church while workers erected scaffolding and sawed off the cross. In the nearby villages of Ximei, Aojiang, Shanmen and Tengqiao, crosses now lie toppled on rooftops or in yards, or buried like corpses.On a four-day journey through this lush swath of China\u2019s Zhejiang Province, I spoke with residents who described in new detail the breathtaking scale of an effort to remove Christianity\u2019s most potent symbol from public view. Over the past two years, officials and residents said, the authorities have torn down crosses from 1,200 to 1,700 churches, sometimes after violent clashes with worshipers trying to stop them.\u201cIt\u2019s been very difficult to deal with,\u201d said one church elder in Shuitou, who like others asked for anonymity in fear of retaliation by the authorities. \u201cWe can only get on our knees and pray.\u201dHundreds of millions of people have embraced the nation\u2019s major faiths: Buddhism, Taoism, Islam and Christianity. There are now about 60 million Christians in China. Many attend churches registered with the government, but at least half worship in unregistered churches, often with local authorities looking the other way.But Mr. Xi\u2019s decision to convene a \u201creligious affairs work conference\u201d last month \u2014 the first such leadership meeting in 15 years \u2014 suggested that he was unhappy with some of these policies. People familiar with the party\u2019s discussions say it intends to apply some lessons from the campaign in Zhejiang to rein in religious groups across the country.While the government is unlikely to begin tearing down crosses across China, the sources say, local authorities are expected to begin scrutinizing the finances and foreign ties of churches and other spiritual institutions as part of an effort to limit the influence of religions the party considers a threat, especially Christianity.\u201cWhat has been happening in Zhejiang is a test,\u201d said Fan Yafeng, an independent legal scholar in Beijing. \u201cIf the government views it as a success, it will be expanded.\u201dBroadening the campaign to regulate religion could backfire on Mr. Xi, with worshipers abandoning government-run churches in favor of underground congregations, which typically meet unobtrusively in office buildings or homes. It could also antagonize many of the urban, white-collar professionals who have embraced Christianity.\u201cTreating it as a foreign religion could alienate these people,\u201d said Fredrik Fallman, a scholar who studies Chinese Christianity at the University of Goteborg in Sweden. \u201cBut this might also be the purpose \u2014 to be a warning.\u201dSet in a valley 10 miles from the coast, Shuitou is a small market town of streaked-concrete housing blocks and pell-mell streets. Most of its traditional places of worship \u2014 Buddhist, Taoist and ancestral shrines for deceased relatives \u2014 are small structures, sometimes built on the side of a mountain and usually hidden from view.Until recently, most were topped with bright red crosses. But crosses have been removed from half the churches in Shuitou, with orders coming every month for more to come down. Many worshipers interviewed said they feared an era was coming to end.\u201cFor years, we had no problems with the authorities,\u201d a local worshiper said. \u201cOur churches were welcomed by the government.\u201dThe Salvation Church, a complex with three spires atop a three-story congregation hall, offices and a parking lot, quickly became a center of resistance. Hundreds of parishioners encircled the church to protect the cross, facing off against hundreds of riot police officers.In one confrontation, about 50 church members were injured. Pictures of bruised and beaten Christians flooded social media and the websites of overseas Christian advocacy groups.According to parishioners, the government put pressure on the most active members of the congregation. Some businessmen say their partners were pressured into canceling contracts with them. Others were told by their employers that they would lose their jobs if they continued to participate in protests.After the church in Wenzhou was demolished, the Salvation Church gave in and agreed to take down its cross.The crosses have come down in waves, with at least 1,200 removed as of last summer, according to people working for government-run churches. Many local residents estimate the figure is now close to 1,700.\u201cIt was quiet late last year,\u201d one local Christian said, \u201cbut the government is now making it clear that all of the crosses will go.\u201dAs the authorities pressed the campaign, prominent Protestant and Catholic leaders across China, including senior figures in the government\u2019s religious affairs bureaucracy, spoke out against it in sermons and on social media.One of them was Gu Yuese, the pastor of one of the biggest churches in the Chinese-speaking world, the Chongyi Church in the provincial capital of Hangzhou. As one of the best-known Protestant leaders in China, Mr. Gu was influential, and his criticism resonated beyond the region.\u201cThese actions are a flagrant violation of the policy of religious freedom that the party and the government have been implementing and continuously perfecting for more than 60 years,\u201d he wrote in a statement released on official government letterhead.\u201cIt\u2019s a method to make us pay attention,\u201d said the pastor of a government-run church in Wenzhou. \u201cNone of us have financial training, so if you send in an accountant, they will probably find something wrong.\u201dOther churches have begun displaying their building permits, implicitly endorsing the government\u2019s authority to approve or reject church construction, including crosses.\u201cWe have to show that we are loyal Christians,\u201d said an employee of the historic Chengxi Church in Wenzhou, \u201cor else we could face trouble.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s easy for them to fabricate a crime and accuse you,\u201d said the pastor of a large unregistered church in Wenzhou. \u201cWe have to be very careful.\u201dMany worshipers in Shuitou are eager to keep their heads low, in hopes that the storm will blow over.One Sunday last month, about 300 people attended services at the Salvation Church, women sitting on the left side and men on the right \u2014 a reflection of traditional views toward worship. In the front of the church, above a big red cross, were six big characters that read: \u201cHoliness to the Lord.\u201dMost of the people there were in their 50s or 60s, in part because many of the younger worshipers were boycotting Sunday services to protest the church\u2019s decision to comply with the government\u2019s order to remove the cross.They have begun attending services on Thursdays instead, to mark the day of the week the cross came down. They used to participate in the church\u2019s Bible study groups, but now study independently. Some wonder if they and others may stop worshiping in registered churches entirely and go underground.A senior church leader, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said he and others had agreed to take down the cross because they feared the church would be demolished if they did not. People were on the verge of losing their jobs, he added, and church elders felt they had no choice but to call on parishioners to give in.\u201cMore than three decades ago, we didn\u2019t even have a church,\u201d he said. \u201cPersecution in church history has never stopped. All we can do is pray.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They are the men and women who serve in the national legislature.More than half of the members of Congress face legal challenges, from cases in auditing court involving public contracts to serious counts like kidnapping or murder, according to Transparency Brazil, a corruption monitoring group.Many of the legislature\u2019s problems stem from the generous rewards to be found in Brazil\u2019s hydra-headed party system, an unwieldy collection of dozens of political organizations whose names and agendas often leave Brazilians scratching their heads.There is the Party of the Brazilian Woman, for instance \u2014 a group whose elected members in Congress are all men.\u201cThe electoral process allows many distortions,\u201d said Su\u00ead Haidar, the party\u2019s founder and president.

The runner-up, Indonesia\u2019s legislature, has a third fewer parties.\u201cBrazil is not an outlier, it\u2019s a freak,\u201d said Gregory Michener, the director of the public transparency program at Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Get\u00falio Vargas, a university in Rio de Janeiro.Polling has shown that more than 70 percent of Brazilians cannot recall what parties the candidates they elect belong to, and that two-thirds of the electorate has no preference for any party.\u201cThe only thing that\u2019s better than being a political party in Brazil is to be a church,\u201d said Heni Ozi Cukier, a political scientist at the university E.S.P.M. in S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cThey\u2019re opportunists who are looking for something that gives them power, influence, protection.\u201dForming a party requires collecting 500,000 signatures. Mr. Cukier said 62 parties were seeking official recognition, including one named after a soccer team.Although Brazil\u2019s president leads one of the world\u2019s largest countries, he or she must forge coalitions with up to a dozen parties to get legislation passed in Congress. The price of loyalty is often a ministerial post, or three, depending on how many votes the party can deliver.In some instances, cooperation involves the illicit exchange of cash. In 2005, a scandal known as mensal\u00e3o, or big monthly payment, revealed the pervasiveness of such arrangements. To win votes in Congress, the party of President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Ms. Rousseff\u2019s mentor and the standard-bearer of the Workers\u2019 Party, had been paying compliant lawmakers a monthly stipend of $12,000.The most recent graft scandal \u2014 known as Opera\u00e7\u00e3o Lava Jato, or Operation Car Wash \u2014 has proved even bigger, with billions of dollars in bribes directed to political parties from the national oil company, Petrobras. More than 200 people, from business tycoons to party leaders, have been implicated in the scandal, and their numbers are expected to grow.Public fury over the scheme played a pivotal role in the ouster of Ms. Rousseff, who was chairwoman of Petrobras when the kickback arrangement was hatched, though she has not been accused of any wrongdoing. In her impeachment trial, she is accused of a budgetary sleight of hand in an effort to conceal Brazil\u2019s economic troubles and win re-election in 2014 \u2014 not of stealing to enrich herself.The need to form alliances of convenience in Congress can lead to legislative chaos, especially when disgruntled partners bolt from the president\u2019s coalition. Ms. Rousseff, who once enjoyed a wide majority in the lower house, was ultimately knocked aside by the house\u2019s now deposed speaker, Eduardo Cunha, a onetime ally who faces a graft trial.Mr. Cunha\u2019s party, the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, called the P.M.D.B., has become a particular source of outrage in Brazil. Critics say the party, founded five decades ago as an opposition party but tolerated by the nation\u2019s military dictatorship, has become a vast patronage trough for its members, who embrace a wide spectrum of ideologies.The party\u2019s ace is its size, which means that presidents have to enter into a partnership that involves doling out coveted cabinet posts. Ms. Rousseff chose Michel Temer of the P.M.D.B. to be her vice president. This year, he turned against her and withdrew his party from her coalition, paving the way for Ms. Rousseff\u2019s impeachment trial. Mr. Temer, who has been convicted of violating campaign finance limits, is now the nation\u2019s president.Political reform can be challenging, given that legislators must approve undoing the system that protects them. There have been some changes, including a recent law that bars candidates with criminal records from running for office for eight years, and a campaign finance law, scheduled to take effect this year, that limits the influence of corporate money.The crush of Brazilian parties tends to favor celebrity candidates, whose name recognition helps vault them to the top of the ballot heap during elections. The most curious example is Tiririca the Clown, whose stage name translates as Grumpy.In 2010, he ran for the lower house on a lark with the slogan \u201cIt can\u2019t get any worse,\u201d and his campaign literature included this tagline: \u201cWhat does a congressman do? The truth is I don\u2019t know, but vote for me and I\u2019ll tell you.\u201dHe prevailed with more than 1.3 million votes \u2014 nearly twice as many as the next candidate.\u201cAt first it was a joke,\u201d he said of his candidacy. \u201cSo I decided that if so many people believe in me, I would have to give it my best, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\u201dAnna Jean Kaiser contributed reporting from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, and Paula Moura from Bras\u00edlia.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "One of the World\u2019s Greatest Art Collections Hides Behind This Fence", "Date": "2016-05-28", "News": "The superrich have stashed millions of works in tax-free storage. So what does that mean for the art?Supported byThe drab free port zone near the Geneva city center, a compound of blocky gray and vanilla warehouses surrounded by train tracks, roads and a barbed-wire fence, looks like the kind of place where beauty goes to die. But within its walls, crated or sealed cheek by jowl in cramped storage vaults, are more than a million of some of the most exquisite artworks ever made.Treasures from the glory days of ancient Rome. Museum-quality paintings by old masters. An estimated 1,000 works by Picasso.With their controlled climates, confidential record keeping and enormous potential for tax savings, free ports have become the parking lot of choice for high-net-worth buyers looking to round out investment portfolios with art.\u201cFor some collectors, art is being treated as a capital asset in their portfolio,\u201d said Evan Beard, who advises clients on art and finance at U.S. Trust. \u201cThey are becoming more financially savvy, and free ports have become a pillar of all of this.\u201dThe trend is prompting concerns about the use of these storage spaces for illegal activities. It is also causing worries within the art world about the effect such wholesale storage has on art itself. \u201cTreating art as a commodity and just hiding it in storage is something that to me is not really moral,\u201d said Eli Broad, a major contemporary art collector who last year opened his own Los Angeles museum.Free ports originated in the 19th century for the temporary storage of goods like grain, tea and industrial goods. In the last few decades, however, a handful of them \u2014 including Geneva\u2019s \u2014 have increasingly come to operate as storage lockers for the superrich. Located in tax-friendly countries and cities, free ports offer savings and security that collectors and dealers find almost irresistible. (Someone who buys a $50 million painting at auction in New York, for example, is staring at a $4.4 million sales tax bill. Ship it to a free port, and the bill disappears, at least until you decide to bring it back to New York.)Concerned by the rapid growth of these private storage spaces and worried that they could become havens for contraband and money laundering, Swiss officials initiated an audit in 2012, the results of which were published two years ago. The results revealed a huge increase in the value of goods stored in some warehouses since 2007, led by an increase in high-value goods like art. Though the audit did not specifically measure the increase in stored artworks, it estimated that there were more than 1.2 million pieces of art in the Geneva Free Port alone, some of which had not left the buildings in decades.Many masterpieces have long lived outside of public view, buried in the basements of museums or tucked away in the private villas of the rich.But the free ports are drawing more criticism and concern, namely: Are they bad for art? Does the boxing up of millions of valuable works pervert the very essence of what art is supposed to do?Yes, say many in the art world. \u201cWorks of art are created to be viewed,\u201d said the director of the Louvre, Jean-Luc Martinez, who described free ports as the greatest museums no one can see.Some see even higher stakes for contemporary works, as they can be whisked off, their paint hardly dry, before ever entering the public\u2019s consciousness. Storage puts the art \u201cintellectually almost in a coma,\u201d said Joanne Heyler, the director of the Broad Museum.Not everyone agrees, pointing out that there is plenty of art in the world for people to see and that much art was created as private property. \u201cPaintings are not a public good,\u201d said David Nash, a New York gallery owner.Even so, some collectors whose businesses have come to depend on free port storage are a bit sheepish. \u201cIt is a shame,\u201d Helly Nahmad, a London dealer whose family is said to store 4,500 works in the Geneva Free Port, told The Art Newspaper in 2011. \u201cIt is like a composer making a piece of music, and no one listens to it.\u201dSo just what works are locked away? Because most art is tucked into storage spaces quietly, it is difficult to know what is where at any given moment.But assorted legal disputes, investigations and periodic exhibitions featuring stored works have provided glimpses of specific pieces lost from view.There are the rare Etruscan sarcophagi discovered in Geneva by the Italian police two years ago, found among 45 crates of looted antiquities, some still wrapped in Italian newspapers from the 1970s.And the $2 billion collection of the Russian billionaire Dmitry M. Rybolovlev, which includes a Rothko, a van Gogh, a Renoir, Klimt\u2019s \u201cWater Serpents II,\u201d El Greco\u2019s \u201cSaint Sebastian,\u201d Picasso\u2019s \u201cLes Noces de Pierrette\u201d and Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s \u201cChrist as Salvator Mundi.\u201d(Mr. Rybolovlev is suing his former art adviser, a major free port operator in Geneva, and has since shifted his collection from Geneva to storage in Cyprus, according to court papers filed last year.)And there is a portrait of Picasso\u2019s second wife, Jacqueline, by the artist, along with 78 of his other works, shipped by his stepdaughter, Catherine Hutin, to the Geneva Free Port in 2012, according to legal papers.\u201cIf Jacqueline was alive and knew that her paintings were in the free ports, she would just be devastated,\u201d said Pepita Dupont, author of a book about Jacqueline Picasso.Despite enhanced Swiss efforts to track inventory and ownership, the free ports there remain an opaque preserve (though more transparent these days than counterparts in places like Singapore), filled with objects whose ownership can be confoundingly convoluted.Case in point: $28 million worth of works by Andy Warhol, Jeff Koons, Joan Mir\u00f3 and others now stored in the Geneva Free Port. Equalia, a company registered by Mossack Fonseca (the law firm at the center of the Panama Papers controversy about how the wealthy conceal their riches), stored the works on behalf of a diamond broker, Erez Daleyot, in 2009. Once in storage, the art was used as collateral for debts Mr. Daleyot owed to a Belgian bank, according to court papers. Now a man named Leon Templesman, president of a New York diamond manufacturing company, Lazare Kaplan International, is trying to seize the art as part of a dispute with Mr. Daleyot and the bank.Mr. Templesman said the free port\u2019s embrace of confidentiality made such seizures more complicated. The bank, KBC, said it had kept the art in the free port \u201cout of precaution\u201d and that it could not comment further on a matter involving one of its clients.David Hiler, president of the Geneva Free Port, said that as a result of the audit, the Swiss were working to address concerns about lack of transparency. Come September, he said, all storage contracts will require that clients allow additional inspections of any archaeological artifacts they want stored there.Collectors and dealers choose to store art in the free ports for more pedestrian reasons than tax avoidance. Some simply have no more room in their homes, said Georgina Hepburne Scott, who advises collectors. And in a free port, their property is protected in climate-controlled environments, often under video surveillance and behind fire-resistant walls.\u201cWhen it is brought to light, the work is preserved; it\u2019s not been hanging above a smoky fireplace,\u201d she said.Some warehouses also have viewing rooms where collectors can review their art and show it to potential buyers. This year, after voters in Geneva rejected a plan to expand the major art museum, a Swiss lawyer, Christophe Germann, wrote a newspaper column advocating wholesale sharing, arguing that free ports be forced to open their doors to let people see public displays of the private collections, a worthy trade-off for the tax benefits collectors receive.For many living artists, meanwhile, the fact that their work might be stored away in a climate-controlled bunker has become part of the reality of doing business.\u201cIdeally, I would like my work to be on display rather than in storage,\u201d said Julia Wachtel, a contemporary artist who knows that some of her collectors occasionally store art.At their worst, Ms. Wachtel said, free ports represent a financial system in which investors have no connection to the art they buy. But she also recognizes that storage warehouses allow responsible collectors to manage their works and their limited wall space.\u201cPeople buying art is what keeps artists alive,\u201d she said.And at the end of the day, dealers say that most artworks eventually surface.\u201cEven if it stays there for the lifetime of the collector,\u201d said a New York dealer, Ezra Chowaiki, \u201cit\u2019s not going to be there forever. It will come out.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vitamins Join the \u2018Clean Label\u2019 Bandwagon", "Date": "2016-05-26", "News": "Supported byWhen she was about four months pregnant, Katerina Schneider read the ingredient list on the bottle of vitamins her doctor had recommended.On it were things like aluminum and titanium dioxide, some of the same ingredients in the laundry detergents and cleaning products she had been throwing away to help ensure her baby was not exposed to them.She also wondered why the vitamin contained gelatin \u2014 and, as a vegan, where the gelatin came from. Gelatin is usually derived from animals.These discoveries and questions spawned a new business idea: What if she could re-engineer vitamins, stripping out all the things she didn\u2019t like?\u201cI realized that most people didn\u2019t know if the vitamins they were taking had what they needed, or where the ingredients in those vitamins came from or even what they were,\u201d Ms. Schneider said. \u201cNor did they know if they worked.\u201dThe idea has attracted more than $1 million in financing from angel investors, including Upfront Ventures and Troy Carter. Now, the company she founded, Ritual, is about to find out how much this matters to consumers. On Thursday, the company began marketing its first product, a multivitamin, the latest in a surge of products that are part of what the food industry calls the \u201cclean label\u201d or \u201cfree of\u201d movement. Ritual will begin shipping the multivitamin in July, based on sales by online subscription.Consumers wanting to know where ingredients come from and why they are needed in a product have pushed companies like Campbell Soup, General Mills and Nestl\u00e9 to rid many of their products of substances such as carrageenan, high-fructose corn syrup and artificial colorings.Now, some of the same efforts are coming to vitamins, an $80 billion annual business in the United States. Last year, Eric Ryan, the co-founder of Method cleaning products, started Olly, a line of so-called clean vitamins sold online and through Target and other stores. And SmartyPants Vitamins, a line of gummy vitamins that ticks off many of the \u201cfree of\u201d boxes, has raised a total of $19.5 million from investors since it began sales in 2010.\u201cThere\u2019s been this growing interest in transparency we\u2019ve seen across consumer packaged goods and especially food,\u201d said Chris Schmidt, who tracks consumer health products at Euromonitor, a global data collection and analysis firm. \u201cIf anything, the vitamin and dietary supplement industry has been late to the party.\u201dHe said vitamins were now getting the same scrutiny as foods.\u201cPeople are starting to realize this is something I get nutrition from, so why am I not being as demanding of a vitamin as I am of that bag of chips?\u201d he said.Mr. Schmidt said vitamin and supplement businesses became aware of a growing challenge as food businesses have tried to untangle their vitamin supply chains to satisfy curious consumers and picky certification agencies.But when companies tried to get certification that products like vitamin-fortified cereals were free of genetically engineered ingredients, or non-G.M.O., they hit a brick wall.\u201cThird parties doing certification like the Non-GMO Project require a whole lot more information than most vitamin companies are used to handing over,\u201d said Bethany Davis, a spokeswoman for the Coalition for Supplement Sustainability and director of industry and regulatory affairs at FoodState, a vitamins and supplements company.The coalition was formed by vitamin and supplement companies last year after food companies began dropping vitamins from their products. General Mills reduced the amount of riboflavin, or vitamin B2, and magnesium in the original Cheerios. Post Foods ditched vitamin A, vitamin D and vitamin B12 in the original Grape-Nuts.\u201cThese large companies may have difficulty getting enough supply of vitamins to make non-G.M.O. claims because the supply chains are very complex and it\u2019s not the industry standard to have full transparency,\u201d Ms. Davis said.She said most vitamins were non-G.M.O. because they came from a global supply chain that also serves businesses in countries where products with genetically altered ingredients have long required labels.But some, like vitamin A, vitamin B12, ascorbic acid and beta-carotene, which typically are derived from genetically modified crops like soy and sugar beets, are hard to certify. \u201cThe supply chain is very complex and getting all the documentation can be tricky,\u201d Ms. Davis said.Even Ms. Schneider, who set out to make a non-G.M.O. multivitamin, could not make a product completely free of genetically engineered ingredients.\u201cAny ingredients in our product that are plant-based are non-G.M.O.,\u201d she said. \u201cWe do have some synthesized ingredients, made in a lab, that can\u2019t be non-G.M.O. \u2014 but we\u2019re still trying to get there.\u201dThe Food and Drug Administration does not review the safety or effectiveness of dietary supplements before they go on the market. Ritual plans to make public the supply chains for the vitamins it includes in its products, Ms. Schneider said. The company\u2019s website will also offer the research supporting the formulation of its products, which differ from many of the multivitamins sold today.\u201cThe vitamin industry is a black box for people right now,\u201d Ms. Schneider said.Ritual multivitamins have just nine vitamins and minerals, compared with more than 20 in many competitors\u2019 supplements. Ms. Schneider said most multivitamins were formulated decades ago and don\u2019t take into account the nutrients inherent in many of today\u2019s diets or the restrictions some diets have.For instance, although Ritual is targeting women, the multivitamin doesn\u2019t include calcium. Rather, Ms. Schneider said the product is formulated with vitamin K2, boron and magnesium with a special coating that improves absorption, all of which aim to improve the uptake of calcium in foods.To accommodate vegan diets, Ritual\u2019s vitamin D3 is derived from lichen rather than lanolin from sheep\u2019s wool, and its Omega-3 comes from algae instead of fish.The pills themselves resemble tiny, elongated snow globes; the vitamins and minerals they contain are suspended in an oil that promotes better uptake in the body, Ms. Schneider said. Ritual has adopted a subscription model for distribution, 30 days\u2019 worth for $30. The company begins shipping in July.Ms. Schneider said she knew that her formulation might raise eyebrows but was confident of the research behind it. Dr. Luke Bucci, who was responsible for substantiating claims as an executive at Schiff Nutrition International before it was sold for $1.4 billion to Reckitt Benckiser, is Ritual\u2019s head of research and development.\u201cNothing is in our product that doesn\u2019t have a clinical trial of some sort behind it,\u201d Ms. Schneider said. \u201cBut I know people will just have to try it before they believe.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated to Dr. Bucci\u2019s job title. He is Ritual\u2019s head of research of development, not the head of its advisory board.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Details on Donald Trump\u2019s Finances Are Released, but Net Worth Is Unclear", "Date": "2016-05-18", "News": "Supported byLast August, Donald J. Trump was busy igniting a feud with Megyn Kelly, getting under Jeb Bush\u2019s skin and flying around the country to thrill his supporters with promises to build a wall on the Mexican border.That month, Mr. Trump announced a new hotel and tower in Bali, Indonesia. Then he embarked on a venture in Jidda, Saudi Arabia. And he soon set up another business in India with a focus on Kolkata.While Mr. Trump has hopscotched the United States as a presidential candidate over the past year, it has been business as usual at the Trump Organization\u2019s headquarters in New York, complete with new endeavors and international partnerships, according to entries in a 104-page financial disclosure form from Mr. Trump that was made public on Wednesday by the Federal Election Commission.The document offered new details on the enterprises and the financial picture of Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee. The limitations of the form, however, made it impossible to calculate his specific net worth or to verify his claim that he is worth more than $10 billion.Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign said in a statement this week that the disclosure was \u201cthe largest in the history of the F.E.C.,\u201d saying it would show \u201ctremendous cash flow,\u201d including an increase in revenue, which was directed to new construction projects, reducing debt and funding the campaign, among other things.A review of the disclosure form, which covered a period from January 2015 to the present, shows reported income of at least $615 million, an increase from $380 million a year earlier. Portions of the new income came from Mr. Trump\u2019s sale of the Miss Universe franchise, as well as increased revenues from his golf courses and a reduction in some investment account holdings. Mr. Trump reported assets valued at a minimum of $1.5 billion.The elections commission requires the forms so as to alert the government, and the public, about potential conflicts of interest for those seeking office. Candidates typically file the forms grudgingly, wary of divulging too much about their assets and debts, but Mr. Trump has wielded the forms like an advertisement of his wealth and his success as a businessman.A New York Times analysis of Donald J. Trump\u2019s financial disclosure report.Mr. Trump has increasingly relied on his adult children to manage aspects of the business, freeing him to focus on his campaign.But Mr. Trump is still involved, and the outsize disclosure form underscores the reach of his dealings \u2014 listing 564 \u201cpositions held\u201d by Mr. Trump and 188 assets or sources of income. But it also highlights the potential for conflicts down the road if he is elected, and shows how he has juggled his finances as he uses his own money for his campaign.For example, Mr. Trump reduced his holdings in several Baron mutual funds, which were worth between about $7.5 and $33 million when he made his disclosure a year ago. Those holdings now have minimal value, the form showed.Mr. Trump also reported a new loan for at least $50 million from Deutsche Bank on the Old Post Office development in Washington, a hotel project. He reported overall liabilities of at least $315 million.While Mr. Trump added new businesses, some went away. In one instance, Mr. Trump sold the Miss Universe pageant amid a squabble with television partners over remarks about immigrants he made during the campaign, a sale that resulted in income of about $50 million. Likewise, Macy\u2019s terminated its agreements to sell his licensed products.With an extensive stable of books, Mr. Trump reported income between $1 million and $5 million from his latest offering, \u201cCrippled America.\u201d A year earlier, he reported at least $85,000 in income from books. He reported royalties of $50,000 to $100,000 from his most famous book, \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d published in 1987.His portfolio of golf courses continued to account for a dominant share of his revenue, including income of about $132 million from his course in Doral, Fla.; $20.5 million from one in Bedminster, N.J.; and $18 million from his course in Turnberry, Scotland.Over the years, Mr. Trump has celebrated his ability to collect lucrative speaking fees. But his disclosure showed that he had halted that income stream during his campaign.Advertisement"}

And there\u2019s an entire side of the world that knows me, knows my values and knows my face.\u201dMany celebrities go beyond supplying a pretty picture and a quote.The celebrity efforts provide another crucial weapon for conservationists: money.In 2014, donations to animal and environmental causes rose to $10.5 billion, up 43 percent since 2009.At a grass-roots level, a celebrity-fueled social media campaign like #JointheHerd can persuade the masses to reach for the credit card, said Mr. Harmon of WildAid. Since the campaign began in February, WildAid has seen the number of small donors to its elephant initiative rise 94 percent, he said.Celebrities also persuade other celebrities to open their wallets.Elephant Family will make further inroads into the art world this summer, when it takes the Elephant Parade, a showcase of elephant-themed outdoor art by David Yarrow, David LaChapelle, and other artists, to the Hamptons\u201cIf you want to understand the issue, you have to talk former C.I.A. officers who are in touch with Kenyan intelligence who can tell you who is corrupt at the port at Mombasa,\u201d Mr. Neilson said.By contrast, \u201cWhen a well-meaning reality TV star in Los Angeles is tweeting \u2018save the elephants,\u2019 I think it\u2019s safe to say that that has no impact whatsoever,\u201d he said.President Obama has called for a near-total ban on the ivory trade in the United States, and conservation groups expect the new law to be put in effect this summer.She finds the issue gripping in part because elephants seem so human in their behavior, she said: Each herd has its matriarchs, its wise old aunts, its rowdy teenagers.

{"Headline": "Seeking Economic Jolt, Sleepy Hollow Embraces Development", "Date": "2016-05-18", "News": "Supported bySLEEPY HOLLOW, N.Y. \u2014 It would seem ripe for an eruption of not-in-my-backyard furor \u2014 an enormous development along the water.But instead, many in this corner of Westchester County welcome the project, believing it will provide the economic adrenaline that has long been needed, while resurrecting a long derelict industrial site that reflected the unraveling of manufacturing in the region.The site \u2014 nearly 100 acres along the Hudson River here where General Motors once assembled 11 million cars \u2014 has had a protracted gestation period. On Wednesday, however, ground finally broke on the $1 billion development, which will feature 1,177 units of housing, more than 200,000 square feet of commercial space and a 140-room hotel.The ambitious plans are helping heal the wounds caused by the closing of the plant in 1996, which represented such a psychic shift for the village that officials changed its name \u2014 to Sleepy Hollow from North Tarrytown.The name change evoked Washington Irving\u2019s tale of \u201cThe Legend of Sleepy Hollow,\u201d which has as its backdrop the village\u2019s Old Dutch Church and churchyard. But the new moniker also signaled a changing economy, one based not on industry, but on history, the river \u2014 and housing.\u201cPeople are happy that it\u2019s finally happening,\u201d the village mayor, Ken Wray, a Democrat, said of the start of construction. \u201cWe\u2019ve been looking at this empty slab for 20 years now. Plans and approvals are one thing, but it\u2019s not the same as seeing someone out there with a jackhammer.\u201dThe complex is expected to increase the population by a quarter and add an estimated 225 students to the school district. It could also lead to gentrification, especially along a stretch where low-rent housing sits close to the former General Motors site.But residents and local officials, who have suffered through years of anemic tax revenue, are eager for the property to generate income. At one time, G.M. accounted for half of all tax revenue in the village. That fell to less than 5 percent after the company negotiated a deal in the 1980s that was designed to keep the plant in operation.Right before G.M. sold the property to a development team in 2014, Sleepy Hollow, which has an annual budget of $21 million, received only $140,000 a year in taxes from the site. (After the plant closed, officials were forced to raise property taxes 20 percent in a single year.)Now, with the site still a blank slate, tax revenue has already jumped to nearly $800,000 a year. That has enabled the village government to cut property taxes.The new open space will effectively expand the county park by 40 percent. \u201cKingsland Point Park will flow seamlessly into the park space for this development,\u201d said Amy Kacala, a senior planner at Scenic Hudson. \u201cThat\u2019s very exciting.\u201dIn addition, local officials years ago had agreed on a plan that required any developer to give a large chunk of land to the village. Because Metro-North Railroad train tracks cross over the site, the most valuable land \u2014 from a developer\u2019s perspective \u2014 is on the west side of the tracks along the river, with its majestic views.About 30 acres of land on the east side of the railroad tracks has already been transferred to the village, which plans to build a new Department of Public Works building, along with a baseball diamond, an all-purpose athletic field and a recreation center.Under the development agreement, SunCal and Diversified Realty Advisors have committed to paying the village $11.5 million to help finance those amenities.\u201cMy partners outvoted me and we terminated the contract,\u201d Jonathan D. Stein, a former partner in Roseland, said.But Mr. Stein remained bullish about the site. Now a managing partner of Diversified Realty Advisors, he teamed up with SunCal, and the two firms together bought the property from G.M. for $39.5 million.Over the next year, the developers will prepare the site for construction by ripping out acres of concrete foundation \u2014 all that remained after G.M. demolished its plant \u2014 and laying down utility lines.By contrast, the portion of the site that overlooks the rugged Hudson Highlands, where a lighthouse stands just offshore, was designed in a looser style, with native plantings and winding paths.\u201cAs you turn the corner and pass the lighthouse, you see the Hudson River Valley and the pristine, undulating landscape in the distance,\u201d said Mr. Tinson, whose firm is also the project\u2019s master planner. \u201cThe parkland on our site becomes more organic and natural.\u201dUnlike some gated communities that have risen on the river, Edge-on-Hudson is intended to invite people to use the parkland, including a sandy beach for launching kayaks, and to patronize the shops and restaurants.That is reassuring to Mr. Wray, the mayor. But he still wonders about the development\u2019s repercussions on the village, where annual household incomes range from below the poverty line to over $1 million. (About 60 units in Edge-on-Hudson, or about 5 percent of the total, will be set aside for affordable housing.)\u201cWe\u2019re rightfully proud of who we are as a village and the diversity we have,\u201d said Mr. Wray, who heads a foundation in New York City that promotes affordable housing. \u201cI think gentrification will definitely happen, but the challenge of village government will be to maintain that diversity.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Government Must Play a Role Again in Job Creation", "Date": "2016-05-10", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneAmerica has been here before.Notably, the jobs of the new industrial economy were generally more productive and better paid than the jobs it left behind.For politicians on the campaign trail and in Washington struggling to come up with a credible strategy to improve the fortunes of America\u2019s understandably angry working class, that shift poses an unanswered question: Where will new, better jobs come from?Epochal transformations like these are complicated. They are difficult to understand, let alone manage, and are driven not only by domestic forces but also by global dynamics over which American politicians have limited control. During much of the 19th and 20th centuries, government at multiple levels played an essential role in shaping the nation\u2019s transition from farms and small towns to cities and factories. It could do so again. What has stopped it is not the lack of practical ideas but the encrusted ideological opposition to government activism of any kind.The construction jobs once fueled by the housing bubble that burst so violently in 2008 are unlikely to return anytime soon. The jobs picking up the slack today are in retail sales or cleaning buildings, paying little more than $26,000 a year; they are cashier positions paying $21,000, or food-prep jobs paying less than $20,000.Though the decline of well-paid working class jobs is often portrayed as the inevitable consequence of globalization and technological change, it is in large part the result of a failure of government.An observation has recently popped up in the academic debate \u2014 in books such as \u201cConcrete Economics\u201d (Harvard Business Review Press) by J. Bradford DeLong and Stephen Cohen, and in \u201cAmerican Amnesia\u201d (Simon and Schuster) by Jacob S. Hacker and Paul Pierson. They point out that for all our love of rugged individualism, government played a large and underappreciated role in reshaping the American economy before \u2014 and it could do so again.Start with high tariffs against imports imposed from the time of Alexander Hamilton, to help foster America\u2019s industrial development. Then huge grants of land to build railways in the 19th century not only opened up the West, they vastly increased productivity in agriculture. From catalog retailing to centralized meatpacking, the railways enabled innovations that spawned entire industries.The government also played a crucial role on the other side of this transformation: bolstering workers\u2019 human capital. From the Land-Grant College Act of 1862, which created a network of public universities, to the offer in the G.I. Bill of Rights to pay for the college education of veterans returning from World War II, the federal government invested aggressively in higher education.In the early decades of the 20th century, local governments across the country poured money and resources into an impressive expansion of secondary education. Between 1910 and 1940, the high school graduation rate of American 18-year-olds increased to 50 percent from 9 percent.Finally, the government directly created jobs \u2014 whether in the burst of infrastructure investment in the 1930s that gave us the Hoover Dam, among other huge projects, or the tenfold increase in federal spending from 1939 to 1945 as the government built up the military-industrial complex to fight Germany and Japan.Why American politics turned against this successful model of pragmatic policy-making remains controversial. Perhaps it was the increasing footprint of money in politics, which has given more clout to corporate interests lobbying for smaller government and lower taxes. Maybe desegregation led to increasing distrust in government by white voters. Perhaps it was the combination of a recession and high inflation of the 1970s, which discredited interventionist government policies.In any event, there is much the government could do.Start with investment in the nation\u2019s crumbling infrastructure: Lawrence Summers, once the top economic adviser to President Obama, never tires of repeating that this not only is urgently needed but is almost guaranteed to be profitable, given rock-bottom interest rates. While it might not increase employment by tens of millions, as these jobs tend to require high skills, even a relatively small number of construction jobs would provide a needed economic boost.Then there are health care and education, critical sectors that are growing as a share of the economy and will provide many of the jobs of our future. For both good and ill, they are already deeply entwined with the government.To be sure, that raises additional challenges: Republican governors refusing to expand Medicaid, for example. But it also offers an opportunity for the government to shape, through its power as a regulator and a contractor of private services, the kinds of jobs these industries will offer.Why not insist that home health aides acquire a certain set of skills and be paid accordingly?\u201cThe huge issue going forward is, are we going to care for the elderly with a bunch of minimum-wage workers or people with a better certification offering better care for better pay?\u201d asked Lawrence F. Katz of Harvard University. \u201cThere is a potential win-win situation where workers and patients end up in better shape.\u201dThe good news is that the United States may have the best opportunity in decades to overcome its anti-government political biases. Donald J. Trump, the admittedly unusual Republican standard-bearer, has publicly called for extensive public investment in infrastructure. More orthodox Republicans, like the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, are also expressing interest in using government levers to tackle the lack of prospects for so many American workers.There are several levers available. The federal government could try to rebuild a quality bureaucracy, rather than subcontract so much of its work to expensive consultants and bottom-end contractors that employ the cheapest workers available.So what\u2019s holding us back? The loss of a vision, once shared across much of the ideological spectrum, of what government can accomplish, when it is allowed to do its job.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "$1.1 Million Brooklyn Dock, Built for Public Use, Sits in Storage", "Date": "2016-05-11", "News": "Supported byThere, it is in almost constant use \u2014 a flock of swans and sea gulls have colonized it, coating it with feathers, feces and bits of fish.Intended as a way to connect people who live in Bay Ridge to their underused bay, the 40-by-60-foot dock was the culmination of years of planning and over $800,000 in financing provided by Councilman Vincent J. Gentile, a Democrat who represents the neighborhood. (The remaining amount was provided by the offices of Michael R. Bloomberg, then the mayor, and Marty Markowitz, the Brooklyn borough president at the time). And for a season, as school children and residents took to the water off the dock, Mr. Gentile, said, \u201cWe realized that dream.\u201dBut attached to the end of the 69th Street pier, which juts out about 600 feet into Upper New York Bay, the dock was buffeted by waves from passing commuter ferries and the currents sweeping underneath the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. That is probably why the metal gangway attaching it to the pier split from the dock in November 2014, according to a timeline provided by the Waterfront Alliance.But other nearby docks that appear to be of similar size, including one operated by the New York Fire Department just across the bay on Staten Island, seem to be holding up, Mr. Lewis said. He theorizes that the Bay Ridge dock was poorly designed by Ocean and Coastal Consultants, a nautical engineering company in Connecticut, which was contracted by the city to build it. It is now part of an engineering firm, COWI North America, which is based in British Columbia, Canada.Philip Chan, a spokesman for COWI, declined to discuss the dock\u2019s condition, including the quality of the work.New York City\u2019s parks department, the agency responsible for the dock, could not provide a date for when it would be repaired. \u201cThe timeline for replacing the dock is contingent upon a design,\u201d Maeri Ferguson, a spokeswoman for the agency, said in an email. \u201cThe gangway will be included in the re-engineering of the support pilings.\u201d The gangway was never fixed because of the long review process city projects must undergo, the department said.But the gangway became the least of the dock\u2019s problems when it was dealt another blow the past winter, this one fatal: Around January, the pilings that anchored it to the bed of the bay, called spuds, bent. The pilings were no longer deemed stable, and the dock was towed by the parks department to its current swan-filled location in Sheepshead Bay, where it lingers, just across the street from the giant lobster-shaped sign of Randazzo\u2019s Clam Bar.What bent the pilings, which are made of solid steel and 26 inches in diameter, is a mystery, even after the company that designed the dock sent a team of divers to inspect it, according to a report filed with the parks department by Stephen A. Famularo, the chief project manager for the company.

{"Headline": "Making Big Donations to Change the World", "Date": "2016-05-13", "News": "Supported byWealth MattersPhilanthropists may proclaim their desire for social change, but few, it turns out, follow through.That is why someone like Paul Salem, a private equity investor in Rhode Island, is rare. He has made two big bets with his philanthropic dollars: one in a company that makes Plumpy\u2019Nut, a peanut paste to feed malnourished children, and another in Year Up, a nonprofit group started in Boston that teaches young urban adults the skills needed for a professional career.Mr. Salem, senior managing director at Providence Equity Partners, said he decided to make the big bets \u2014 defined as donations greater than $10 million \u2014 only after growing tired of being asked for donations and not knowing what impact his money was having.\u201cYou get bombarded by amazing opportunities to invest in charities that come in over the transom,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can give $5,000 here or $2,000 there. I still do that, but I consider it being nice. My wife and I decided we wanted to focus our giving on something that matters. It\u2019s a way I like to invest money.\u201dWilliam Foster, the head of Bridgespan\u2019s consulting practice and the author of the study \u201cBig Bets for Social Change,\u201d said, \u201cThe desire to give to social change is genuine,\u201d but that the study found that only 20 percent of big donors followed through. The wealthiest people want their money to make an impact on the biggest problems, he said. \u201cBut there are two reasons reality doesn\u2019t match the aspiration.\u201dThe first is it\u2019s hard and takes a lot of time. Big institutions have plenty of projects that a donor can finance and have confidence that they will be completed and their name will be put on the door.More complex problems, not surprisingly, are more challenging to finance. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear that if you wake up one morning and want to write a check to save the fish stocks of the ocean, where to write that check,\u201d Mr. Foster said.The second reason is more nuanced. After decades of the type of success that gives someone the means to make a gift of more than $10 million, many philanthropists do not want to look foolish with their donations.\u201cBeing an expert in a particular industry or field does not make you an expert in anything else,\u201d said Steve Prostano, head of family wealth advisers at Bank of the West Wealth Management. \u201cThe very successful person would like to be successful in everything they do.\u201dThat takes time and requires advice, he said.\u201cThe rewards of giving to a larger, established institution are readily apparent \u2014 the admiration and respect of your peer group, and the certainty that it\u2019s a professional and well-run institution that will use the money well,\u201d Mr. Foster said. \u201cWhen someone makes a gift to their 25th anniversary fund at Princeton, they\u2019re saying, \u2018It\u2019s Princeton. It\u2019s great.\u2019 They don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to change the trajectory of education at Princeton in the next 25 years.\u201dBut such giving isn\u2019t rewarding enough for some philanthropists. Emily Nielsen Jones and her husband, Ross Jones, a private equity executive, began giving in ways that would seem big by most standards. They helped finance the creation of a preschool in Boston that has grown into the Park Street School.Still, as their wealth increased, she wanted to do more on a big issue: stopping the trafficking of women and girls and, more broadly, changing gender norms around the world.\u201cIt came from a deep feeling that we needed to ramp up ethically,\u201d Ms. Jones said. \u201cBut then it was, how do you do that?\u201dMs. Jones, who started the Imago Dei Fund, wanted to look broadly for groups to finance, from the innovative projects at larger nonprofit groups to working directly with religious leaders.\u201cThat changed the direction of our philanthropy overall to make sure we were not guilty of a blind spot of just funding the rock star social innovators who went to the Kennedy School but also change agents working around the world,\u201d she said.One of these is Tostan, an organization in Senegal that aims to end female genital cutting and forced marriage. Her big bet on that group was particularly rewarding, she said. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with these imams who led the anti-genital cutting practice,\u201d she said. \u201cThey described that they had been resistant because this was how it was for centuries but they said when you get new information, you need to move on.\u201dMr. Foster said he advised philanthropists to give to several organizations in the area where they want to bring about change but also not to micromanage the institutions.\u201cIf you say, \u2018I care deeply about the ocean and I\u2019m going to try the three best organizations and give them some money and trust them and not hold their feet to the fire for every T that is crossed and I that is dotted,\u2019 that would probably work out pretty well,\u201d he said.Of course, not everyone agrees with the idea that philanthropists talk about social change in theory but shy away from it in practice \u2014 or that big donations are even a good thing.Paul Connolly, director of philanthropic advisory services at Bessemer Trust, said many philanthropists can finance social change through institutions. Ms. Jones, for example, said she still gave to Dartmouth College, which she and her husband attended, but she focuses on scholarships and entrepreneurial programs.The riskier issue, though, is when philanthropists donate too heartily to a social change organization without thinking through how that donation could affect that group.\u201cThere\u2019s a limited number of nonprofits that can absorb a very large gift,\u201d Mr. Connolly said. \u201cThere are 1.4 million nonprofits, but two-thirds have less than a $500,000 annual budget and only 5 percent have a budget of $10 million or more. If you\u2019re going to make a $10 million gift, you can do harm.\u201dAnd even if a single big donation doesn\u2019t overwhelm a small organization, it could wipe out its base of smaller donors, who feel the group no longer needs their money. Mr. Connolly said he was working with a client who wants to give $350 million to 20 organizations. He said his team\u2019s goal is to make sure those donations are not split equally among the groups but scaled to each organization\u2019s size.With Year Up, Mr. Salem said his involvement has grown over many years. And he has worked closely with its founder and chief executive, Gerald Chertavian, to expand the program beyond Boston to 16 other locations.For his part, Mr. Chertavian, who started and sold a technology consulting company before founding Year Up in 2000, said he had begun raising \u201cfunds\u201d similar to those in the private equity world to bring in donations that will be spent over five years. The first raised $18 million, the second, in 2011, brought in $55 million. \u201cYou can\u2019t grow quickly if you don\u2019t have patient capital,\u201d he said.Those funds have the added benefit of keeping donors involved for at least five years.Mr. Salem, who has given more than $10 million to Year Up over 13 years, said that while he believed in making big bets, he tried to look at his contributions like his private equity investments.\u201cWhen I die, I\u2019ll say I did my part to close the opportunity divide, but I\u2019ll also say the money I put in, I got a return on my investment,\u201d he said. \u201cNot all bets work out.\u201d he added. \u201cBut if I looked at Year Up like an investment in some of my portfolio companies, this was a home run.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Rift Between Labor and Environmentalists Threatens Democratic Turnout Plan", "Date": "2016-05-16", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Two of the Democratic Party\u2019s most loyal constituencies, labor and environmentalists, are clashing over an effort to raise tens of millions of dollars for an ambitious voter turnout operation aimed at defeating Donald J. Trump in the November election.The rift developed after some in the labor movement, whose cash flow has dwindled and whose political clout has been increasingly imperiled, announced a partnership last week with a wealthy environmentalist, Tom Steyer, to help bankroll a new fund dedicated to electing Democrats.That joint initiative enraged members of the nation\u2019s biggest construction unions, already on edge about the rising influence of climate-change activists. The building-trades unions view Mr. Steyer\u2019s environmental agenda as a threat to the jobs that can be created through infrastructure projects like new gas pipelines.The dispute, laid bare in a pair of blistering letters sent on Monday to Richard L. Trumka, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., underscored the tensions between the two pillars of the Democratic coalition.For decades, organized labor was among the most powerful forces on the left, financing Democratic candidates and reliably delivering working-class votes, and political foot soldiers, for the party in crucial states and districts.The letter demanded that the A.F.L.-C.I.O. cut its ties with Tom Steyer, a hedge fund manager who has spent millions promoting efforts to combat climate change.But with blue-collar white voters shifting to the Republican Party and Democrats growing more reliant on higher-income voters and liberal donors like Mr. Steyer, environmental activists are increasingly muscling out unions.Nowhere was this more evident than during the tense debate over the Keystone XL oil pipeline, in which President Obama and Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, ultimately came down on the side of the environmentalists by opposing a project that some of the so-called hard-hat unions fervently wanted.The friction is not just confined to the Democratic Party: The labor movement itself is changing. As manufacturing has declined, power has flowed away from the unions representing factory and construction workers and toward public- and service-sector workers. The unions that formed the alliance with Mr. Steyer included the two largest teachers\u2019 unions and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.The goal of the new voter turnout \u201csuper PAC,\u201d announced last week with an initial goal of raising $50 million, was to ensure that liberal groups did not duplicate their efforts, as had happened in some elections. Some unions were asked to give as much as $1 million. Mr. Steyer, founder of the advocacy group NextGen Climate, announced that he would give $5 million and said it was \u201chighly likely\u201d other unions would participate.But Mr. Steyer has opposed oil and gas projects like the Keystone pipeline, and the construction unions assailed the A.F.L.-C.I.O.\u2019s willingness to make common cause with him as an abandonment of their members and the federation\u2019s principles.In one of the two letters sent on Monday, presidents of seven of the nation\u2019s biggest construction unions threatened to boycott the new get-out-the-vote effort, called For Our Future PAC.\u201cIt saddens us that the very labor movement we have fought for and supported for over a century seems to have lost sight of its core mission and has moved away from us and our membership in the interest of headline-grabbing political expediency,\u201d wrote the leaders of the operating engineers, plumbers, elevator constructors, roofers, laborers, plasterers, and heat and frost insulators.Mr. O\u2019Sullivan, the president of the 500,000-member laborers union, called the partnership a \u201cpolitically bankrupt betrayal\u201d of union members.In a separate and even more harshly worded letter to Mr. Trumka, the president of the 500,000-member laborers union, Terry O\u2019Sullivan, called the partnership a \u201cpolitically bankrupt betrayal\u201d of union members. \u201cWe object to the political agenda of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. being sold to a job-killing hedge fund manager with a bag of cash,\u201d he wrote.Both letters were provided to The New York Times by a labor official who insisted on anonymity.The schism comes as Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, is running a populist campaign that could appeal to some union members, castigating free trade agreements and illegal immigrants while vowing not to cut entitlement spending.Some of the building-trade unions have already gotten behind Mrs. Clinton, but some labor holdouts remain: The Teamsters, for example, have yet to endorse a candidate. And among rank-and-file workers, Mr. Trump could well outperform Mrs. Clinton with the unions that signed on to the letter, a heavily working-class and white male demographic.Membership in most private-sector unions has steadily declined, leaving organized labor under pressure to find new ways to demonstrate its influence. Mr. O\u2019Sullivan, in his letter, zeroed in on this challenge.\u201cYears of financial distress have left the A.F.L.-C.I.O. desperate for cash, and it appears that the answer is to sell out to a billionaire who not only has little or no stake in our movement, our members or their work but who has actively fought against our members\u2019 interest,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Sullivan wrote.Told of the criticism of Mr. Steyer, an executive at NextGen, Sky Gallegos, underscored the new super PAC\u2019s goals of \u201cpreventing climate disaster and promoting prosperity.\u201d\u201cOur new unified effort will help elect progressive leaders who are committed to a just transition to a clean-energy economy that will benefit working families across the nation,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lending Club, a Story Stock That Skimped on the Details", "Date": "2016-05-13", "News": "Supported byFair GameThe recent tribulations of Lending Club, a former highflying \u201cpeer to peer\u201d lender, provide an object lesson for both companies and their investors: When it comes to financial disclosures, less is definitely not more.Celebrated as a Silicon Valley disrupter set to transform the financial industry, Lending Club first issued public shares at $15 in December 2014. Like other wildly popular disrupters (Theranos, the blood-testing company that is now under siege, comes to mind), Lending Club had a star-studded board and a concept that made investors swoon.Its shares peaked at almost $28 in late 2014, giving Lending Club a $10 billion market value. Not bad for a company that generated a $33 million loss on $211 million in net revenue that year.Lending Club was the quintessential story stock. Disrupting finance, though, turned out to be harder than promised.Six months after its public offering the company\u2019s shares had fallen below the deal price. And in recent months, as doubts about the peer-to-peer lending industry emerged, Lending Club\u2019s shares continued to decline.The company cited two reasons for Mr. Laplanche\u2019s exit. First, Lending Club had improperly sold $22 million of loans to an institutional investor that did not meet the investor\u2019s standards. In addition, Mr. Laplanche had not disclosed to company directors his stake in a fund in which Lending Club was weighing an investment.Compared with some of the corporate shenanigans we\u2019ve seen lately, these disclosure failings look relatively minor. So why have Lending Club\u2019s shares taken such a beating?Here\u2019s a hypothesis: Investors don\u2019t have enough information about the company\u2019s operations to keep them confident about its prospects. When shareholders have to rely more on a company\u2019s promise than on the reality of its operations, they often flee at the first sign of trouble.In contrast with traditional financial companies, Lending Club\u2019s disclosures are thin. And the company\u2019s practices in the area were the subject of a whistle-blower submission to the Securities and Exchange Commission last July. The submission, which I reviewed, contended that the company does not disclose crucial operational measures that investors need to evaluate its business.Lacking, for example, is detailed data on Lending Club\u2019s credit decisions and scoring models, its investors\u2019 returns and loan performance. Nor does the company provide specifics showing investor satisfaction with its platform.I asked Lending Club about these areas of its financial disclosures. Taylor Hamilton, a spokesman, pointed me to additional information on the company\u2019s website. But this data was only modestly enlightening.How does Lending Club assess risks among its borrowers? In its most recent annual filing, the company said that in addition to common tools like borrowers\u2019 credit scores, it uses \u201cproprietary algorithms that leverage behavioral data, transactional data and employment information.\u201d The company contends that its \u201cstrong record of loan performance\u201d is evident in its loan origination growth.Nevertheless, Lending Club provides scant details on borrower performance by type, product or vintage (the year in which a loan was made). Other financial institutions provide this kind of data routinely.In its filings, the company does show two tables of charge-off rates on its loans, reflecting borrower defaults. One table spans three years, the other, five. Good luck figuring them out.Since the company is a peer-to-peer lender, the performance on smaller loan purchases would be a more helpful measure.Lending Club filings also state that \u201chigh reinvestment rates\u201d prove that its investor-lenders have confidence in its marketplace. But the company has not disclosed actual reinvestment rates in its regulatory filings.Scott Sanborn, the company\u2019s president, recently told investors in a conference call that its reinvestment rate hit 85 percent \u201cover the past two quarters.\u201dIf the company published these figures regularly, shareholders could watch for investor churn, a risk to its business that Lending Club has acknowledged. It must \u201cmaintain relationships with existing borrowers and investors,\u201d it says in filings.But in its most recent annual report, issued in February, Lending Club noted that \u201ca relatively small number of investors account for a large dollar amount of investment in loans funded through our marketplace.\u201dIf most of Lending Club\u2019s loans come from a handful of investors, such as brokerage firms, hedge funds or pension plans, that\u2019s not so revolutionary a business model. That looks a lot like a bank. More troubling, if one or two of these investors pulled back from Lending Club, the company\u2019s funding capacity could drop significantly.On Tuesday, the company told regulators that its quarterly financial filing, due that day, would be delayed until Monday. That filing, Lending Club said, \u201cwill reflect significant changes in the company\u2019s results of operations for the first quarter of 2016 as compared to those of the first quarter of 2015.\u201dFull and detailed data about a public company\u2019s operations is crucial if investors are to remain confident about its prospects. While it\u2019s not unusual for companies to want to limit their disclosures, Lending Club no longer has that luxury. If it wants to regain its shareholders\u2019 trust, being more forthcoming is a good way to start.The investor lesson here is also clear: Don\u2019t let enthusiasm for a purportedly innovative business model replace hard-nosed analysis of a company\u2019s operations. And if the data to do that analysis isn\u2019t there, move on.Twitter:@gmorgensonAdvertisement"}

In an interview with The Times, he called it \u201cone of the greater philanthropic things that I\u2019ve done. I think of it in those terms.\u201dPortraying a $10 million investment in crushing one\u2019s enemy as a charitable act of justice that will make the world a better place is galling. But students of history can hardly be shocked. Tech\u2019s elite, lauded for their originality, are influencing media, politics and society at large with a kind of venture philanthropy, much as their industrial predecessors did more than 100 years ago.Whether their money came from oil, hotels, railroads or data, titans of industry have long held enough power to both influence the American political system directly and to hack it when necessary. Old money maintains the status quo, while new money openly endeavors to change it.The robber barons of the 19th and 20th centuries were kings of infrastructure. The people with towering wealth today are kings of information. The rise of Silicon Valley is best understood as a new industrial revolution in this tradition. In many ways, it\u2019s not at all revolutionary in the strict definition of that term.To many of Gawker\u2019s critics, Mr. Thiel is a hero on a charitable crusade for justice. It would be safe to say that this is how his fellow Silicon Valley philanthropists would also define their giving. They are under a presumptive mandate to improve society according to their own values, purely because they have made a lot of money while most everyone else has not. The Gospel of Wealth dictates that this is not only their ability, but their responsibility.We did indeed give them this mandate through our politics: loose campaign finance laws and lower tax rates. Through policies that have reinforced exceptional wealth disparities, we have allowed them not just to govern themselves, but us as well. Instead of encouraging the superrich to self-impose a Gospel of Wealth and celebrating \u2014 or criticizing \u2014 their public gifts, the concerned public might take a different, simpler tack.If we\u2019re lucky, there may be, but Mr. Thiel isn\u2019t going to like it. Wealth gleaned by way of tax dodges and monopolistic business practices is wealth stolen from the public, even when it is returned in the form of supposed gifts. Philanthropy has the power to do a great deal of good, but so do tax dollars allocated in an equitable democratic system. Perhaps it\u2019s time to adopt a Gospel of Government.An opinion article last Sunday about Hulk Hogan\u2019s lawsuit against Gawker Media described the suit incorrectly. It claimed invasion of privacy, not defamation.Advertisement"}

Progressive political groups like ColorOfChange.org and Credo Action are pressuring Coca-Cola, Walmart, Microsoft, Facebook and Google to cut off money for the Republican gathering. But the protest against Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t address the deeper problem of corporate influence over both parties.The ITT scandal prompted legislation that provided public financing for conventions, and limited their budgets to that amount. But the parties soon found multiple ways around that, including using \u201chost committees\u201d that operate in the cities where the conventions are held, soliciting unlimited amounts of convention money from corporations and wealthy individuals. These committees, established to skirt federal laws banning corporations from giving to political parties directly, should be abolished.The law shifted ever-escalating convention costs onto rich donors and corporations like Google, Facebook, Duke Energy, Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Bank of America, General Motors and AT&T, which were all past contributors. Corporations can give unlimited cash, services and swag to Democratic and Republican host committees for conventions that basically are four-day-long parties. Shareholders in these companies pick up the tab since the money comes directly from corporate coffers.This year, the two political parties together will most likely spend upward of $150 million on their conventions, all of it paid by private entities.Lawyers who advise corporations on campaign finance laws say that so far, most previous corporate donors will continue financing both conventions, eager to ensure that they\u2019re covered regardless of which party takes the White House in November. \u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous system that creates widespread opportunities for influence peddling,\u201d says Fred Wertheimer, who leads Democracy 21, a campaign finance watchdog group.Convention spending is part and parcel of the creeping corporate buyout of America\u2019s political system. In a year marked by voter anger at a political class out of touch with struggling Americans, one might expect both Republicans and Democrats to rein it in. But as with all political spending, the tendency is always toward more, not less. That publicly held companies seeking favors from the government will underwrite this excess is offensive, and entirely legal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Titans Raise Their Guard, Pushing Back Against News Media", "Date": "2016-05-27", "News": "Supported bySilicon Valley JournalWith its response, the tech community\u2019s message is clear: Treat us the way we want to be treated or we might retaliate. Even though Silicon Valley professes to be for free speech \u2014 this is where Twitter was invented, after all \u2014 the reaction opens a window into the thinking of the digerati, who are becoming more guarded and elusive even as their products make the world more transparent.Given Mr. Thiel\u2019s \u201cbeliefs and objectives, I can\u2019t fault him for his approach,\u201d Parker Thompson, a partner at the venture capital firm 500 Startups, said in an interview.Mr. Thompson was just one of dozens of techies in Silicon Valley who talked or tweeted their approval of Mr. Thiel and their disapproval, or worse, of Gawker and Valleywag in the last few days.Late Friday, First Look Media, which was founded by Mr. Omidyar, said that in keeping with its mission to protect the First Amendment, it would be helping to organize supporting briefs for Gawker\u2019s appeal.\u201cThe possibility that Gawker may have to post a bond for $50 million or more just to be able to pursue its right to appeal the jury\u2019s verdict raises serious concerns about press freedom,\u201d Lynn Oberlander, general counsel for First Look, said in a statement.\u201cWe welcome the support at the appellate level,\u201d Gawker said in its own statement.In some ways Silicon Valley\u2019s reaction is not surprising. A journalist\u2019s job, at least in theory, is to ask questions and print the truth, which means it is less than loved in citadels of power. But in Silicon Valley, even the media hates the media.For Ken Shotts, who teaches ethics and strategy at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, Mr. Thiel\u2019s secret campaign against Gawker brought to mind General Motors\u2019 pursuit of Ralph Nader 50 years ago. G.M. set private detectives on Mr. Nader to get the dirt on him that would nullify his criticism of its Corvair car. G.M. went beyond the pale, and was punished. The president of G.M. was forced to appear before Congress and apologize for harassing and intimidating the company\u2019s critic.\u201cCompanies face constraints,\u201d said Mr. Shotts. \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing. Individuals are less constrained, and billionaires hardly at all.\u201dFrom this perspective, what Mr. Thiel did was less of an aberration and more of that old Silicon Valley stand-by: a new product launch. It is now out of stealth mode and getting good reviews among potential users.As a result, Mr. Shotts said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see more cases like this.\u201dThe situation is complicated by the fact that these days rich tech companies, their owners or venture capitalists are as much the owners and producers of the media as the subject. With the traditional media in a weakened state, it is a trend that seems to be accelerating.Facebook and Andreesen Horowitz declined to comment.\u201cGawker tried to have it both ways,\u201d Venky Ganesan, managing director of the venture capital firm Menlo Ventures, said in an interview. \u201cThey wanted to be taken seriously as journalists, yet they didn\u2019t follow all the norms.\u201dTwenty-five years ago, tech coverage was the domain of geeks and trade reporters \u2014 people who understood their way around a motherboard, were excited by it and wouldn\u2019t dream of crossing certain boundaries. Now, with tech at its zenith, much of the coverage of the industry is still done by enthusiasts. Combine this with the need to get the power players to come to the media\u2019s conferences and there is a real reluctance to look behind the scenes.The result, she wrote, is \u201ca sense of entitlement in the industry where denizens of Silicon Valley expect the media to actively support them and any negative portrayals are met with real anger and resentment, even when they\u2019re 100 percent accurate.\u201dSam Altman, the president of Y Combinator, tried to chart a middle ground between Gawker and Mr. Thiel in a series of posts on Twitter.Danielle Ivory contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "De Blasio\u2019s Elections Strategy, Under Scrutiny, Recalls Predecessor\u2019s", "Date": "2016-05-18", "News": "Supported byControl of the New York State Senate was at stake. The mayor of New York City threw his weight behind a candidate, and money from powerful unions and wealthy donors poured into party committees that quickly funneled the money to candidates in the hotly contested race.The contours of that fund-raising strategy have become familiar, as state prosecutors and F.B.I. agents are now investigating an effort led by Mayor Bill de Blasio to channel donations to a group of Democratic candidates around the state in 2014.But a very similar series of events played out in early 2007 during a special election for a vacant State Senate seat in Nassau County \u2014 only then it was Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s predecessor, who played a crucial role.The Nassau race was \u201ca very perfect example of the fact that this is an unfortunately common practice and has been for quite some time,\u201d said Susan Lerner, the executive director of Common Cause New York, a good-government advocacy group. In 2007, just as in 2014, Ms. Lerner said, money was \u201cgiven to the political parties to be passed through to the candidates without regard to what the giver would be limited to if he or she were giving directly to the candidate.\u201dBecause the Nassau race had striking similarities to Mr. de Blasio\u2019s effort in 2014, it could buttress the argument put forth by the mayor\u2019s allies that he was simply doing what had been done many times before. By singling out Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, they suggest, prosecutors risk criminalizing long-accepted ways of conducting politics in the state.Yet the current investigations focus less on the flow of money than on whether Mr. de Blasio\u2019s team went too far in trying to direct it.Contributions to individual candidates are capped at a relatively low level. But much larger contributions are permitted to party committees, and the law allows those committees to transfer an unlimited amount of money to candidates.It is illegal, however, for the party committees to agree with donors in advance that the money is destined for individual campaigns, a process referred to as earmarking the donations. And that is a line that investigators believe Mr. de Blasio may have crossed in 2014 by directing donations to small county committees that then transferred the money to local candidates.\u201cThe line between legal and illegal is razor-thin,\u201d Ms. Lerner said. \u201cCertainly it is a critical legal difference, but in the real world, they\u2019re practically identical.\u201dNo one has suggested that Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s conduct in 2007 was illegal. News accounts at the time of the special election highlighted the flood of outside money into the race, including from Mr. Bloomberg, a Republican at the time, and cited party leaders on both sides saying the election was crucial to the State Senate\u2019s balance of power.Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire, supported the Republican candidate in that race, Maureen O\u2019Connell. But instead of making the relatively small donation permitted by law directly to her campaign, he sent three checks, for a total of $250,000, to a pair of Republican Party committees.The former mayor gave $75,000 to the New York State Senate Republican Campaign Committee and the same amount to the Republican Party\u2019s main state committee. He also sent $100,000 to what is known as a housekeeping account for the state committee \u2014 a type of account that is not supposed to be used to give direct support to candidates, although in practice the lines are often blurred.Mr. Bloomberg was not alone: From Jan. 1, 2007, through the election on Feb. 6, the campaign committee took in $1.4 million \u2014 a sum that, at the time, helped make the race the most expensive ever for a seat in the State Legislature.Large donations also came from unions \u2014 Local 1199 of the Service Employees International Union sent $84,400 \u2014 as well as New York City real estate interests and wealthy New Yorkers: among them, the philanthropist Jane Forbes Clark and the businessman Andrew Saul, who sent $25,000 each.At the same time that the money was coming in, it was going out to Ms. O\u2019Connell\u2019s campaign. In four transactions in January, the campaign committee transferred a total of $767,500 to her campaign. The final transfer, for $87,500, was made on Jan. 24. Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s $75,000 contribution was reported by the state committee as having been received two days later.The two Republican Party committees also spent enormous sums in other ways to support Ms. O\u2019Connell. They reported spending an additional $745,120, raising the total support for Ms. O\u2019Connell funneled through the committees to more than $1.5 million.\u201cIt was no surprise, and we didn\u2019t make any particular issue of the fact that the mayor of the City of New York, Mike Bloomberg at the time, was pumping in a lot of money,\u201d said Jay Jacobs, who has been the chairman of the Nassau County Democratic Committee since 2001.He said that because it was a special election and there were no other contests, it was clear that contributions to the party committees would go to support candidates in the race. In that sense, the conditions in Nassau in 2007 were not unlike those in the counties where donations rolled in during the 2014 Senate races; in those counties, the Senate contests were the ones with the most competition, so donations to local committees would have logically been sent in their direction.\u201cNo one ever told us how to spend the money,\u201d said Edward S. Lurie, a political consultant who was the executive director of the Senate Republican Campaign Committee in 2007, referring to the fund-raising for the special election, including the contributions from Mr. Bloomberg. \u201cWe did not have to spend it on Maureen O\u2019Connell.\u201dHe added: \u201cThat\u2019s the key. If you direct funds for the purpose of avoiding contribution limits, then you\u2019re violating the law.\u201dMs. O\u2019Connell, the Republican candidate in the 2007 race, who is also the Nassau County clerk, did not respond to requests for an interview.Her Democratic opponent at the time, Craig M. Johnson, who now works at a Manhattan law firm, said he did not recall details of the fund-raising from the race. \u201cIt was really cold,\u201d he said. \u201cI spent my time knocking on doors trying to get myself elected, meeting voters.\u201dStu Loeser, a spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg, declined to comment.On the Democratic side, the party\u2019s Senate Campaign Committee and its state committee took in more than $1 million from Jan. 1, 2007, through the election in February. The two Democratic committees made four transfers to Mr. Johnson\u2019s campaign, totaling $327,200. The two party committees also reported $1.4 million in expenses to aide Mr. Johnson\u2019s campaign.Mr. Jacobs, who has also served as the chairman of the state committee, said the law creates a loophole that is easily exploited, allowing party committees to take in donations far above the levels permitted for candidates while letting the party transfer unlimited sums to candidates\u2019 campaigns.\u201cIf that\u2019s not a legal provision to evade \u2014 if you want to use that word \u2014 to evade limits on contributions to individual candidates, I don\u2019t know what is,\u201d Mr. Jacobs said. \u201cThe answer to fix the problem is, fix that loophole.\u201dIn the end, the 2007 race was similar in another way to Mr. de Blasio\u2019s efforts, which backed mostly losing candidates and failed in its objective to swing the Senate to Democratic control. Despite Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s contributions, Ms. O\u2019Connell lost.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article gave an incorrect middle initial for the former mayor.

{"Headline": "De Blasio, Seeking High Ground, Skips Hearing on Control of New York\u2019s Schools", "Date": "2016-05-19", "News": "Supported byHe had been very respectful, he said. He had testified for nearly four hours and had answered many questions. The facts were clear. Yet his opponents still wanted to play political games. Well, he said, he would no longer play along.Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat seeking to extend mayoral control of New York City\u2019s schools in the face of a Republican-controlled State Senate that appears intent on thwarting him, reached on Thursday for one of his default political strategies: When outgunned, claim the moral high ground.\u201cI wish this was about the substance,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said in an interview on WNYC of the Senate\u2019s reluctance to act on mayoral control. \u201cI wish it was about our children and parents. I\u2019m having trouble seeing how it is.\u201dThe mayor\u2019s decision did not appear to be driven by scheduling conflicts, as he spent the morning sitting for three radio interviews. Instead, he seemed to have chosen, as he has when stymied by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, that rather than negotiating, he was better off publicly accusing his foe of putting politics above the needs of the city\u2019s residents.\u201cWhen you look at facts like that, and the fact that there\u2019s no alternative, there\u2019s no third way here that\u2019s been proposed, it suggests to me that the substance is not the primary consideration here,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said on WNYC.\u201cI hope the State Senate Republicans are listening to all those facts, and they\u2019ll make the right decision here in the name of the kids of our city,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s really what it should be about.\u201dIn a statement, Austin Finan, a spokesman for Mr. de Blasio said, \u201cThe mayor met his commitment to the Senate when he testified earlier this month and laid out a clear case\u201d for mayoral control.Senate Republicans repaid Mr. de Blasio last year, in part, by ensuring that he got only a yearlong extension of mayoral control, an embarrassing defeat that forced him to return this year to request another renewal.The risks in the mayor\u2019s current strategy were evident on Wednesday when the Senate majority leader, John J. Flanagan, issued a statement in which he said he was \u201cextremely disappointed the mayor doesn\u2019t believe this hearing is significant enough to attend.\u201d Senator Flanagan, a Long Island Republican, himself did not attend the hearing; he also missed the first one.Several other senators chastised Mr. de Blasio at the hearing on Thursday, with one suggesting that he should put his ego aside on an issue that concerned the welfare of children.Outside the hearing, two groups opposed to Mr. de Blasio\u2019s education policies held rallies at which they mocked him for not showing up.Later in the day, a charter school principal who had testified at the hearing issued a statement accusing Mr. de Blasio of using mayoral control as \u201ca political wedge against a few children\u201d because of his opposition to lifting the cap on the number of charter schools in the city.Mr. de Blasio suggested in his radio interviews that he was being treated unfairly, noting that the Legislature gave his predecessor, Michael R. Bloomberg, who was first elected as a Republican, seven years of mayoral control in 2002 followed by a six-year renewal in 2009.While Mr. de Blasio asked for a seven-year renewal at the hearing in Albany, he now seems resigned to something shorter. On Tuesday, the State Assembly, which Democrats lead, approved a three-year extension. At a news conference at City Hall on Wednesday where an array of business leaders endorsed mayoral control, Mr. de Blasio asked for three years. Ms. Fari\u00f1a did the same at the hearing on Thursday.Speaking on WINS on Thursday morning, Mr. de Blasio was asked about his feud with Mr. Cuomo, a fellow Democrat. He connected it to the Senate\u2019s opposition on the school control issue.\u201cThere\u2019s a long history of Albany not supporting the City of New York,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI would like to see the maximum cooperation with the Senate, and with the governor as well. But I\u2019m never surprised when that isn\u2019t there.\u201dJ. David Goodman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Attacks in Kabul Keep Wall Builders Busy, Turning City Into Labyrinth", "Date": "2016-05-16", "News": "Supported byKabul JournalKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 After bombings in Kabul these days, new concrete blast walls go up, taller than the ones before. Streets leading to V.I.P. homes are blocked to traffic. To drive in certain neighborhoods is to delve into a frustrating game of maze navigation, with surprise barricades popping up overnight.In a grim reflection of life in the Afghan capital, the small blast-wall factories lined up on the city\u2019s outskirts are among the few businesses that have managed to stay basically viable despite the reeling economy. Mixers churn out concrete, and laborers cast it in wooden molds. Trucks ferry the T-shaped walls to spots around the city, one of the most barricaded in the world.\u201cIt is our sad reality: After a suicide bombing, we get more work,\u201d said Noor ul Haq, who has been managing one such small business for six years.\u201cThe week before the bombing, we had no customers,\u201d he said.The dull structures used to be mainly about 11 feet tall, but newer walls are as high as 20 feet, both to repel the force of larger explosions and to block the sightlines of any Taliban snipers.The blast walls have become such an integral part of Kabul\u2019s identity that they blend into the cityscape. Most residents have accepted the narrowing of the roads and roundabouts, the blocking of the views of iconic buildings, as facts of life.\u201cI am proud of my father \u2014 he is not corrupt,\u201d reads one message, in bold black letters, next to an ArtLords mural. It is painted on the blast walls of a building belonging to the Finance Ministry, long considered one of the most corrupt institutions in Afghanistan.In one of Kabul\u2019s main squares, the blast walls protecting a military base are painted light olive. A tiny park, with two benches and some grass and rosebushes, has seemingly grown in front of the walls, providing a respite for visitors to one of the city\u2019s busiest hospitals, around the corner, or the Public Health Ministry, across the road.But the view from the benches is largely blocked by a makeshift rest stall for the police officers stationed at the roundabout. The stall is boxed by blast walls. Beyond the stall, one can see only the taller blast walls of the United States Embassy, a 36-acre complex. The only spot of color in view is the blue tip of the minaret at the roundabout, dedicated to the prominent victim of a suicide bombing.But not for long. As violence in and around Baghdad has picked up again, with bombings a nearly daily occurrence, the Baghdad Operations Command has decided to use the blast walls to build a protective belt around the city. The first phase of the project, which began in February, stretches 62 miles.In Kabul, there has been no serious effort to move the walls out \u2014 security has been getting only worse in recent years.Despite the walls\u2019 hold on the city\u2019s landscape and consciousness, though, the businesses dedicated to them are not exactly thriving. Their best days are over after the drawdown of American forces, whose need to protect their bases was the engine for the wall industry.Around 2010, the Khwajazada Construction Company had contracts for as many as 1,000 blast walls at a time, loading trucks day and night, said Behdar Kohistani, a former teacher who is the company\u2019s office manager.

{"Headline": "Fannie, Freddie and the Secrets of a Bailout With No Exit", "Date": "2016-05-20", "News": "Supported byFair GameWhen Washington took over the beleaguered mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac during the collapse of the housing market and the financial crisis of 2008, it was with the implicit promise that they would be returned to shareholders after being nursed back to health.But now, with the unsealing of documents this week that were produced as part of a lawsuit filed against the government, new evidence is coming to light on how intimately the White House was involved in the Treasury\u2019s decision in August 2012 to keep all the companies\u2019 profits for the government. That move effectively maintained Fannie\u2019s and Freddie\u2019s status as wards of the state.The newly released documents go beyond previous disclosures in the case and make clear that the Obama administration never had any intention of restoring Fannie and Freddie, which enjoyed implicit backing from the government before the takeover, to their status as stand-alone entities.The documents also show the Treasury moving to modify the terms of the mortgage finance giants\u2019 $187.5 billion bailout shortly after a July 2012 meeting when the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Fannie\u2019s and Freddie\u2019s regulator, learned that they were about to enter \u201cthe golden years\u201d of profitability.Since then, Fannie and Freddie have returned to the Treasury over $50 billion more than they received in the bailout. But the amount they owe to the government remains outstanding.A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment.The Treasury\u2019s integral role in the profit sweep comes through clearly in the new materials, indicating that it was in charge of decisions on Fannie and Freddie, and that the Federal Housing Finance Agency, created by Congress in 2008 as a purportedly independent regulator, did as directed.The profit sweep, the aggrieved shareholders contend, violated that part of the law because it barred the companies from being able to amass capital.In a statement, Adam Hodge, a spokesman for the Treasury, said the profit sweep \u201cended the vicious cycle where Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac drew against Treasury\u2019s backstop to pay the 10 percent dividend owed to taxpayers.\u201dThe recent economic performance of both companies, Mr. Hodge added, further undermines complaints about the sweep because \u201cthe required dividends to taxpayers would have exceeded their income in five of the past six quarters.\u201d Finally, he noted, the best way to end the conservatorship is through comprehensive housing finance reform legislation.Preventing the companies from using their profits to rebuild a strong capital position was an explicit goal of the Obama administration, the newly unsealed materials show. In an email sent the day the profit sweep was announced, Mr. Parrott said diverting Fannie\u2019s and Freddie\u2019s profits would eliminate \u201cthe possibility that they ever go (pretend) private again.\u201dSending a message to Fannie\u2019s and Freddie\u2019s shareholders that they should have no hope of profiting from the companies\u2019 recovery appeared to be top of mind to Mr. Parrott, the documents show. In another email sent the day the sweep was disclosed, he assured Treasury officials that \u201call the investors will get this very quickly.\u201dIn an email, Mr. Parrott later said that his comment about investors referred to those holding Fannie\u2019s and Freddie\u2019s mortgage-backed securities, who would recognize that the Treasury had addressed the problem of the companies drawing from the government to pay dividends owed to taxpayers. \u201cI realize that you appear to want me to be referring to the G.S.E.s\u2019 shareholders, but I am not,\u201d Mr. Parrott said, a reference to government-sponsored enterprises.Investors got the message. But some viewed the action as illegal and began filing lawsuits against the government.Unlike shareholders of other bailout recipients, including Citigroup, Bank of America and even the insurer American International Group, Fannie and Freddie investors have not been able to participate in the rebound at the companies as their operations boomed.Mr. Parrott, now a fellow at Urban Institute and owner of Falling Creek Advisors, a consultant to financial institutions, declined to comment on the matter.The unsealed documents indicate an intense desire to get rid of Fannie and Freddie as independent entities once and for all. They do not show any concern among Treasury officials that their actions on the profit sweep might violate the law.Only a small portion of the materials produced in the case in Federal Claims Court has seen the light of day. Approximately 50 documents were released on Wednesday to lawyers representing Arnetia Joyce Robinson, an individual investor who sued the government in Federal District Court in Kentucky last October.According to that lawsuit, Ms. Robinson, a retired bank manager and loan officer, bought Fannie and Freddie shares in September 2008 to help fund her retirement.But the documents released on Wednesday indicate that the financial projections for Fannie and Freddie the judge received were significantly out of date. These projections, showing large losses in the near term, were produced to the court by the Treasury in a document dated June 2012, but they actually contained figures from September 2011, when the companies\u2019 operations had not yet begun to turn around.Those projections, produced by Grant Thornton for the Treasury to use in valuing its investment in Fannie and Freddie, did not account for improvements in the housing market that took place in late 2011 and early 2012. As the unsealed materials show, Treasury officials knew in the summer of 2012 that Fannie and Freddie had turned the corner and appeared to be well on their way to a strong recovery.Experts disagree about what the government\u2019s role in housing should be and whether Fannie and Freddie should be wound down, replaced by some sort of new mortgage finance guarantee.The significance of these documents, however, goes well beyond the future of housing finance. They demonstrate the perils of allowing the government to act in secrecy. In asking for confidentiality surrounding its actions, the government argued that the release of such documents would roil the financial markets. What seems clearer all the time is that their release will instead help the public understand what the government did here and why.Twitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Trump More Dangerous as Friend or Foe?", "Date": "2016-05-07", "News": "Supported byCampaign StopsDonald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, vowed last week that he could unite the fractured Republican Party.Republicans are trying to figure out what to think, and what to do, about Mr. Trump. Some unlikely politicians have jumped on the Trump train, like Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, a moderate up for re-election.The Republican Party is now at war with itself: elected officials focused on short-term survival against those with longer-term interests; intellectuals against lobbyists; the Republican National Committee against the party\u2019s Senate campaign committee; and governors looking to get in Mr. Trump\u2019s good graces for future appointments against governors in states where he is politically toxic.If Mr. Trump fails to unite the party \u2014 if he runs in the general election as he did in the primaries, as a man without a party \u2014 will it matter?Parties and their supporters play a vital role on the vast landscape of a national election. Governors and legislators mobilize armies of campaign workers to get voters to the polls; top-notch pollsters and consultants devise strategy; wealthy individuals raise money on a moment\u2019s notice.\u201cHe\u2019s going to need infrastructure,\u201d said Josh Holmes, former chief of staff for Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader. \u201cYou can get away with a lot in primaries by getting more attention than the next guy. But when your opponent is better funded, and is deploying over a billion dollars in party infrastructure, you can\u2019t cede that ground entirely.\u201dParty members are weighing different incentives in their determination of whether to get behind Mr. Trump. Republican members of Congress on the ballot face a particularly delicate task. Especially in the states where Mr. Trump performed well in the primaries, many Republicans believe they can\u2019t distance themselves too much from their nominee because they will need his supporters for their own political survival.Politicians thinking of a presidential run in 2020 have their own incentives. If they believe that Mr. Trump\u2019s brand of populism will become the new normal in the party, they\u2019ll need to adapt accordingly. But if Mr. Trump loses badly to Mrs. Clinton and his candidacy damages the party, those who failed to oppose him aggressively will be held to account.Even the party machinery will be fractured. The Republican National Committee\u2019s mission is to support Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy while helping fund get-out-the-vote operations in battleground states. But the party\u2019s congressional campaigns are already plotting the best ways to distance themselves from his campaign in states and districts where Mr. Trump is unpopular.IT\u2019S not inconceivable that Mr. Trump could navigate the general election as he did the primary, without the support of party officials and campaign experts. He spent less money on ads and get-out-the-vote operations than some better-funded rivals, and he beat them. His ability to attract nonstop coverage made up for his limited finances.\u201cDonald Trump won by being an outsider, so he should run an outsider candidacy,\u201d said Ari Fleischer, a former press secretary in the George W. Bush administration who announced last week that he would support Mr. Trump. \u201cBut can he run as an outsider without antagonizing or alienating all the insiders? If you alienate potential supporters, you make it almost impossible to get a majority.\u201cWill he bring out new voters?\u201d Mr. Fleischer added. \u201cWould some crossover Democrats vote for him? Those are the wild cards that could offset his losses among more establishment types.\u201dBut more likely, Mr. Trump will need the establishment to put together a workable ground game and to provide data on the persuadable voters he could win over. His model in the primary \u2014 unconventional messaging, ample news coverage and force of personality \u2014 is not likely to overcome the well-organized Clinton operation with the vastly different electorate in the general election.Will there will be a painful reckoning for those members of the party who throw their support behind Mr. Trump if he loses big? In short, yes. Party leaders could find themselves complicit in their own demise.But perhaps an equally important question is what might happen to those in the establishment who oppose Mr. Trump only to see him win. Not only will he have defied his party, and history, but he will have set the stage for completely reordering the rules of their game.Josh Kraushaar is the political editor at National Journal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trying to Pin Down the Mosaic of Millennial Tastes", "Date": "2016-05-15", "News": "Supported by2016 TV UpfrontsThe television industry is focusing a great deal of attention on millennials these days. Billions of dollars are in play, along with the reputations of industry executives who view this vast, diverse generation \u2014 generally defined as those born between 1977 and 1995 \u2014 as the hot consumers of choice in a bewilderingly changing business.But what, as Freud might have asked if he lived in America in 2016, do millennials want? Does anyone really know? Is it fair to lump together a group of people ages 21 to 39? I was curious. I decided to conduct my own nonscientific study of millennials and their attitudes toward television.It is not hard to find a millennial; there are 79.8 million in the United States. At the Brooklyn Roasting Company\u2019s branch in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, for instance, I found one right there at the counter, arguing with the barista about what \u201crefill\u201d means. He was not free to talk, but Rob Szypko, 25, who was looking up stuff on his laptop, had a moment. He took off his headphones.\u201cI struggle with the term millennial,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe this is a very millennial thing to say, but I don\u2019t feel I\u2019m of the same mind as everyone else just because I happened to be born in the same 15-year life span.\u201dHe had a point. Older people tend to lump millennials together as basically a huge, mysterious group of entitled young people on their phones all the time. They\u2019re fun to mock, just as the baby boomers and Generation X were mocked back in the day.\u201cI think there\u2019s something wrong with this generation,\u201d says Jack Donaghy, the \u201c30 Rock\u201d character played by Alec Baldwin, when a millennial job applicant announces that he has to leave for his \u201cironic kickball league\u201d and that he is \u201cnot interested in this position unless I\u2019m going to be constantly praised.\u201dUnlike that person, or, say, the constantly plugged-in, constantly high, constantly hapless millennial protagonists of \u201cBroad City,\u201d Mr. Szypko (pronounced ZIP-co) already has a respectable job \u2014 he works in city government. But he does not own a television set. He mostly watches shows on Netflix and Hulu. He won\u2019t commit to a series unless he is sure it\u2019s going to be good. He does not like to be told what he likes.\u201cOne of the things people chafe at is the sense that other people are curating things for them,\u201d he said, speaking of his age group. \u201cIf Netflix says, \u2018Hey, Rob, we think you might like this title,\u2019 and it\u2019s too on the nose, it removes part of the fun of discovering an experience for yourself. If I don\u2019t have to scroll past the second line of my Netflix page to find what I want, something is wrong.\u201dLeaving Mr. Szypko to his devices, I set out for Williamsburg, another millennial-heavy section of Brooklyn. I found two \u2014 Austin McAllister and Ryley Pogensky, both 26 \u2014 on a street corner, trying to attract the attention of their friend Danielle, who was crossing the street 20 feet away with her headphones on. She did not respond, even when all three of us shouted, so they sent her a text message to alert her to our location.\u201cPeople have a far-reaching idea of who millennials are, but I don\u2019t know what that word means,\u201d Ms. McAllister, a singer, said.Mr. Pogensky, who identified himself as an editor at a \u201cmillennial media company,\u201d was dismissive of TV programs attempting to portray his generation. (\u201cGirls,\u201d for instance.) \u201cThey try far too hard \u2014 that notion of the over-millenniated hipster,\u201d he said. \u201cThey use, like, slang that no one uses, that your dad would use,\u201d he said.\u201cLOL,\u201d Ms. McAllister said.\u201cShe\u2019s using that sarcastically, rather than in reality,\u201d Mr. Pogensky said.They have televisions, but they do not have cable. (\u201cNo one has cable,\u201d said Danielle, 34, who had finally arrived on the corner and who did not give her last name.) They have had a variety of jobs (Danielle: nurse, maid, sex worker.) Their tastes are almost aggressively idiosyncratic.Ms. McAllister, for instance, said she had watched virtually every episode of \u201cLaw and Order: Special Victims Unit,\u201d because of her love for Mariska Hargitay. Mr. Pogensky said he watched the film \u201cMean Girls\u201d \u201clike once a week.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll binge-watch \u2018House of Cards,\u2019 and then I\u2019ll watch \u2018Daria,\u2019\u201d he said, referring to the classic turn-of-the-millennium animated series about an acerbic high school student.The three of them left for brunch \u2014 it was 3 p.m. \u2014 but it got me thinking about the great challenge for media companies: How do you appeal to people with such splintered, diffuse tastes, who crave novelty and individual experiences and who do not want to be part of a herd?\u201cThey\u2019re the most diverse generation of adults in U.S. history, so that\u2019s a big issue for the entertainment industry,\u201d said Jason Dorsey, whose job as chief strategy officer and millennials researcher at the Center of Generational Kinetics in Austin, Tex., sounds as if it could have its own ironic television show. \u201cHow do we program for such a diverse generation that doesn\u2019t carry checkbooks, a lot of whom don\u2019t carry cash, most of whom are delaying marriage and kids and have a high expectation of diversity and more college debt?\u201dIndeed. \u201cNothing gets all of them, but there are themes that do seem to matter,\u201d said Tom Ascheim, president of Freeform, as the recently renamed ABC Family is now called. While Freeform\u2019s target audience is mostly millennials, the channel is specifically geared to an age group \u2014 people from 18 to 34 \u2014 rather than a generation, on the grounds that what a generation wants changes as that generation becomes older.\u201cWhat unites our shows is that they center around young people in an adult world that revolves around them and that they have the power to shape,\u201d Mr. Ascheim said.That sounds right: Millennials do want to shape their world. \u201cHow long is this going to take?\u201d said Stephane Rochefort, 33, who works in sales and was walking along the street when I asked him about his viewing habits. He had to go. \u201cI don\u2019t watch any TV, but I sometimes watch sports on the Internet,\u201d he said, over his shoulder.Three millennials in the finance industry whom I met in Lower Manhattan were just as difficult to pin down. Morgan Kiss, 23, said her favorite show was \u201cChopped,\u201d because she is learning how to cook. Her roommate likes a program about real estate developers flipping houses. Natalie Urban, 22, likes \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201dIf there is one thing that unites them, it\u2019s their creative way of paying for content (or not) in a world bursting with choice.\u201cWe get our subscriptions through friends,\u201d Ms. Urban said. Kate, the third millennial in the group, who did not want her last name used, mentioned a heady period when she was in possession of a friend\u2019s ex-boyfriend\u2019s friend\u2019s dad\u2019s HBO Go password. \u201cThey didn\u2019t notice, but then he changed the password, so now I use Natalie\u2019s,\u201d she said.Is there a representative millennial? No, just as there is no representative goat.\u201cI don\u2019t think one person in my generation can be representative of the whole thing,\u201d Ms. Kiss said. \u201cThere are so many different shows that are available to us. People can shape their own watching preferences. We can watch what we like.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "De Blasio\u2019s Accusations Over Inquiry Draw Retort From Cuomo\u2019s Side", "Date": "2016-05-13", "News": "Supported byThe governor\u2019s side has decided to swat back. In the first statements from the New York State Democratic Party since Mr. de Blasio began describing the episode as politically motivated, the state party\u2019s head, Basil A. Smikle Jr., suggested that Mr. de Blasio\u2019s allegations were \u201cnothing more than a political smoke screen created by the mayor,\u201d arguing that there was good reason for various agencies to investigate the mayor\u2019s fund-raising without an extra prod from state officials.\u201cTo the extent that the mayor is asserting that the current investigation is politically motivated, that would imply that actions of the Manhattan D.A. and the U.S. attorney are politically motivated,\u201d said Mr. Smikle, the executive director of the state party, which was involved in the 2014 election effort and which Mr. Cuomo controls. \u201cIt would also imply that the newspapers, editorial boards and good government groups that raised these very issues prior to any investigations are all politically motivated.\u201dBoth the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., and the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara, are examining whether Mr. de Blasio\u2019s aides tried to evade campaign finance limits by routing money through county committees during Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign to elect Democrats to the Senate.Mr. Vance opened his investigation after receiving a report from the State Board of Elections that questioned Mr. de Blasio\u2019s activities. The board had made its own inquiries and voted to refer the matter to Mr. Vance. The official who wrote the report, Risa S. Sugarman, the board\u2019s chief enforcement counsel, was appointed by Mr. Cuomo.\u201cThe Manhattan D.A. had no obligation to investigate the matter,\u201d Mr. Smikle said. \u201cLaw enforcement receives many reports from regulatory agencies and could find them to be frivolous, or politically motivated or flawed on its facts or on the law.\u201dIn addition to questioning the leak of the board\u2019s inquiry, Mr. de Blasio has also suggested that the inquiry itself, as well as another investigation by the State Joint Commission on Public Ethics, are politically motivated.\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to participate with an investigation that\u2019s appropriate and within appropriate boundaries, but when an investigation may be motivated by politics, when an investigation may be going beyond its legal mandate \u2014 and obviously be, in a sense, a partisan act \u2014 that\u2019s a whole different matter,\u201d the mayor said.Mr. Cuomo has dismissed Mr. de Blasio\u2019s insinuations about the leak of Ms. Sugarman\u2019s report. Speaking to reporters on May 2, the governor suggested that it was far more likely that a Republican connected to the Board of Elections, rankled by Mr. de Blasio\u2019s support of the Senate Democrats, had publicized the report.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Eurozone Agrees to Debt Relief and Bailout Aid for Greece", "Date": "2016-05-24", "News": "Supported byEurozone finance ministers also gave a green light for the next round of aid for Greece, money that would allow the country to pay bills in the coming months. Further final approvals for those disbursements will be needed, but ministers allocated 10.3 billion euros, or about $11.5 billion, for Greece, to be distributed in several stages starting with \u20ac7.5 billion as soon as the second half of June.The I.M.F. has painted a dark picture, insisting that Greece cannot meet its budget goals. It has outlined particular demands on the cost and timing of the debt payments. Although the discussion Tuesday night on debt relief looked as if it could be enough to bring the I.M.F. into the bailout, officials signaled that hurdles remain.The European heavyweight in the bailout, Germany, has a more upbeat outlook and remains profoundly skeptical of cutting Athens more slack. Some economists warn that Greek politics are unstable, and that a new government might not be prepared to make alterations later in exchange for debt relief now.\u201cThe fund needs to stick by rules. It can\u2019t fund countries with unmanageable debt loads if it wants to remain part of the world\u2019s most high-profile bailout,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, the Europe director for the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy. \u201cThe Germans need to prove their medicine of austerity and bailouts still works.\u201dThe two sides did find some common ground.The I.M.F. \u201cmade a major concession,\u201d Poul M. Thomsen, the director of the fund\u2019s European department, told a news conference Wednesday morning. \u201cWe had argued that these debt relief measures should be approved upfront, and we have agreed that they will be approved at the end of the program period.\u201dMr. Thomsen said the steps taken by Greece and the debt-relief plans outlined by European lenders should \u201cform the basis for I.M.F. support.\u201d But he also emphasized that the I.M.F. would have to carry out another analysis of the Greek economy before joining the bailout.In recent days, European officials have also been discussing a debt swap that would help Greece. That proposal calls for Europe to buy a portion of the I.M.F.\u2019s loans to Greece and then allow Greece to borrow more money at a lower rate.Asked about those plans, Mr. Thomsen said there was \u201cno concrete proposal\u201d for such a buyout, but he suggested that such a step would be helpful.European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.This type of deal could help appease the I.M.F. because it would effectively cut Greece\u2019s debt costs. It could also mollify Germany, where lawmakers want assurances that the fund will be comfortable participating in the bailout.How much of a dent the plans will put in Greece\u2019s debt after three bailouts in six years was unclear on Wednesday morning. The country has more than \u20ac300 billion in debt, amounting to roughly 180 percent of its gross domestic product.Greece was promised debt relief last summer under the terms of a bailout of \u20ac86 billion. The I.M.F. has said it will not contribute to the rescue effort until Greece\u2019s debt load is addressed.Yet the Germans have largely blocked debt relief. Last month, the German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, insisted at I.M.F. meetings in Washington that it was \u201cnot necessary,\u201d saying it would distract Greece from taking steps to transform its economy.With Germany and the I.M.F. at an impasse, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch politician who leads the Eurogroup, sought to broker a compromise in recent weeks. From his country home in Wageningen, the Netherlands, Mr. Dijsselbloem spent most of the first week of May drafting a three-stage plan, according to two people briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity.In the short term, Athens would get money to reduce its debt, and payment terms would be adjusted at the margins. In the medium term, Greece would get longer grace and payment periods. And in the long term, there could be more far-reaching, though unspecified, measures.But the proposal hit an obstacle when eurozone finance ministers convened in Brussels this month.Mr. Dijsselbloem\u2019s short-term plan, according to the two people briefed on the proposal, called for allowing Greece to tap profits on its bonds that were made by the European Central Bank and eurozone central banks. The bonds, bought at fire-sale prices in the depths of the crisis, have since gone up in value, and the profits would give Greece a bit more leeway in the next couple of years.But Mr. Sch\u00e4uble suggested it would be difficult to get German lawmakers to approve the move, and pushed to make the transfer an option only after 2018, the two people said.The Dutch official redrafted the plan, and the finance ministers reached a consensus that they put to the I.M.F. A few days later, the I.M.F. raised the stakes, recommending that Greece\u2019s interest payments to the eurozone be fixed at 1.5 percent for up to 40 years.With the I.M.F. and Germany sticking firm, the situation set off a flurry of back-room diplomacy ahead of the meeting of the Group of 7 industrial nations in Japan.Over the weekend, Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew of the United States urged Mr. Sch\u00e4uble to put Greece\u2019s debt on a sustainable path through \u201cmeaningful debt relief.\u201d Like the I.M.F., the United States has leaned hard on Germany to give easier terms to Athens to help preserve stability in the Europe.Referring to the short-term aspect of the debt relief plans that emerged Wednesday morning, Mr. Dijsselbloem told the news conference that \u201cit\u2019s difficult now\u201d to say \u201cwhat in economic terms the impact of that will be.\u201d\u201cSome may say \u2014 I have heard it twice now \u2014 that the package is not ambitious,\u201d Mr. Dijsselbloem also told the news conference. But \u201cwhat the Eurogroup has put on the table here\u201d for short-term and medium-term debt relief \u201cis something that a month ago I couldn\u2019t have dreamed of that the ministers would have agreed to,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

But Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, has typically provided scant details on how he might make good on his promises \u2014 and ambitious ideas, even the concrete kind, do not always add up.Mr. Trump has suggested he will flesh out his ideas in a forthcoming speech. But experts across many fields who have analyzed his plans so far warn that they would come at astronomical costs \u2014 whoever paid \u2014 and would in many ways defy the logic of science, engineering and law.Mr. Trump has a simple plan to reduce the population of 11 million immigrants living illegally in the United States: Deport them.How? He says he would follow the example of the military-style roundups authorized by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1954. The initiative, known as Operation Wetback, expelled hundreds of thousands of Mexicans.Mr. Trump contends that the start of deportations would show immigrants he meant business and prompt many to leave on their own, and that it would take about two years to finish the job. There, the specifics end.Former senior immigration and border officials are skeptical, to put it mildly. Deportations have peaked recently at about 400,000 a year, so the increase in scale to reach Mr. Trump\u2019s goal would be exponential. And many legal procedures and constitutional constraints on the police did not exist in the Eisenhower era.\u201cI can\u2019t even begin to picture how we would deport 11 million people in a few years where we don\u2019t have a police state, where the police can\u2019t break down your door at will and take you away without a warrant,\u201d said Michael Chertoff, who led a significant increase in immigration enforcement as the secretary of Homeland Security under President George W. Bush.Finding those immigrants would be difficult, experts said. Police officers across the country would need to ask people for proof of residency or citizenship during traffic stops and street encounters. The Border Patrol would need highway checkpoints across the Southwest and near the Canadian border. To avoid racial profiling, any American could expect to be stopped and asked for papers.To achieve millions of deportations, the Obama administration\u2019s focus on deporting serious criminals would have to be scrapped, said Julie Myers Wood, a director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, also known as ICE, under Mr. Bush. \u201cYou would not care if the person had a criminal record,\u201d she said.Large-scale raids, rare under Mr. Obama, would resume at farms, factories, restaurants and construction sites, with agents arresting hundreds of workers and poring over company records. And prosecutors would bring criminal charges against employers hiring unauthorized immigrants.Mr. Trump has said he would triple ICE\u2019s deportation officers, to 15,000 from about 5,000. But even if that could be accomplished quickly \u2014 difficult given the vetting and training required \u2014 it would still be insufficient, experts said. The F.B.I. and other agencies would have to set aside some of their missions to help.John Sandweg, who led ICE for seven months under Mr. Obama, said wholesale deportations could make it easier for immigrant gang members and drug traffickers to escape detection. \u201cIf the agents are looking for volume, they won\u2019t spend the time to do the detective work tracking down the high-value bad guy who has fake documents, the hardened criminals in the shadows,\u201d he said.To prevent flight after arrest, the authorities would have to detain most immigrants awaiting deportation. Existing facilities, with about 34,000 beds, would have to be expanded to hold at least 300,000, Mr. Sandweg estimated, perhaps with tens of thousands of people in detention camps, similar to the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II.Most deportations must be approved by judges. But backlogs in the 57 immigration courts are already severe, with waits as long as two years for a first hearing. The federal government would have to open dozens of emergency courts and hire hundreds of judges, shortcutting the painstaking selection process.There is deep concern among Republicans about political divisions and the future of the party, a new Times/CBS News poll shows. We want to hear from the party\u2019s longtime members or those who have just registered as Republicans.The millions of immigrants from Central American countries, China, the Philippines, India and other noncontiguous nations would have to be flown home at the federal government\u2019s expense. Arranging flights would in itself be a huge and very costly task.At the border, where illegal crossings have fallen to the lowest levels since the 1970s, the Border Patrol would face a rush of newly deported immigrants trying to return, experts said. \u201cMany of these people have been here for decades,\u201d said David V. Aguilar, who was the chief of the Border Patrol and then the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection. \u201cWe should expect an immediate effort to reunify with the family left behind.\u201dMr. Aguilar said a surge of returning deportees could divert the Border Patrol from the fine-tuned hunt for terrorists trying to infiltrate the country, now its top priority.Ms. Wood said mass deportations would add chaos to a dysfunctional immigration system.But the proposals\u2019 main flaw, former officials said, is that they are unrealistic. \u201cUnless you suspend the Constitution and instruct the police to behave as if we live in North Korea,\u201d Mr. Chertoff said, \u201cit ain\u2019t happening.\u201dMr. Trump has promised that the wall will be big, beautiful, tall and strong. Spanning 1,000 miles along the southern border, it will stem the flow of immigrants bringing drugs and crime. And, yes, Mexico will pay for the Great Wall of Trump, as he has called it.But the wall \u2014 symbolic of an iron-fisted immigration policy and providing a rallying cry for his supporters \u2014 has proved to be as divisive in theory as it would be in practice. And experts in domestic security, immigration policy and civil engineering say that building it would be a daunting task and cause more problems than it would solve.Mr. Trump has shared few details. He has said that the wall would be built from precast concrete and steel and that it could be 50 feet tall, if not higher. After calling for it to extend across the entire 2,000-mile southern border, he more recently said half that length could be sufficient because of natural barriers. He has pegged the cost at $4 billion to $12 billion, most recently settling on around $10 billion.Some see that as low. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of logistics involved in this, and I don\u2019t know how thoroughly they\u2019ve thought it out,\u201d said Todd Sternfeld, chief executive of Superior Concrete, a Texas-based builder of walls. \u201cThe resources alone would be astronomical.\u201dMr. Sternfeld, who has led major wall projects across the country and approached the Trump family last summer, suggested that Mr. Trump was overly optimistic about the cost and was underestimating the complexity of the undertaking.Running the numbers, Mr. Sternfeld said a 40-foot-tall concrete wall using a \u201cpost and panel\u201d system that went 10 feet below the ground \u2014 to minimize tunneling \u2014 would cost at least $26 billion. The logistics would be nightmarish, including multiple concrete casting sites and temporary housing for a crew of 1,000 workers if the job were to be completed within Mr. Trump\u2019s first four-year term.Maintenance would be an additional recurring expense, said Walter W. Boles, an engineering professor at Middle Tennessee State University who specializes in concrete construction. Deep trench work would also be necessary for keeping a wall of that height from toppling, he said, and seismic sensors to detect digging would be wise for preserving its integrity from below.\u201cThat\u2019s one heck of a construction project,\u201d said Mr. Boles, who assessed Patrick J. Buchanan\u2019s 1996 proposal for a border barrier. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly a lot more ambitious than I was imagining.\u201dThad Bingel, the chief of staff at Customs and Border Protection during the Bush administration, said the fence offered a cautionary tale. It became mired in lawsuits and environmental controversies that sowed deep anger along the border, and required the extensive use of eminent domain, a practice that Mr. Trump has been criticized for using to seize private properties for his big developments.A wall would be even more complicated, requiring redirection of water so that concrete could be mixed on location, difficult work on rocky terrain and a potential disruption of archaeological sites. Also, Mr. Bingel said, a solid wall could hamper border agents by blocking their view of the wall\u2019s other side.Setting aside the need for congressional approval and a likely fight with Mexico over financing, many who study borders doubt that a mass of concrete would accomplish its purpose. From the ancient Great Wall of China to Israel\u2019s modern security barrier, walls rarely prove totally impervious to people set on traversing them.Walls tend to be crude solutions to complex problems and are evidence of geopolitical failure, said Michael Dear, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who specializes in the border with Mexico.What about the water?Billions of gallons flow between the United States and Mexico, funneling lifeblood to farms and communities on both sides of the border. The Colorado River sends water south; the Rio Grande, a natural boundary for hundreds of miles, delivers precious water from Mexico, through dozens of canals, to much of South Texas.Water experts in the Southwest question how Mr. Trump\u2019s border wall could accommodate those crucial flows and still provide the barrier he wants.Another complication is that a nearly 50-year-old treaty between Mexico and the United States prevents any construction that obstructs or diverts the flow of the waterways. The wall, in other words, could not interfere in any way with the flow of water in either direction.\u201cWe\u2019ve been joking: How big does the hole in the wall have to be to let the water run through it?\u201d said Patricia Mulroy, a Brookings Institution senior fellow and former Nevada water official.One option would be a wire fence, but that would catch all sorts of trash. \u201cThere are going to be consequences for any kind of fence you build,\u201d said Gabriel Eckstein, a water law expert at Texas A&M University.Asked whether the proposed wall might impede water flows, Hope Hicks, a Trump spokeswoman, did not directly respond. \u201cThe proposal speaks for itself,\u201d she said, adding that details could be found on Mr. Trump\u2019s website. But the site does not address water flows.Complicated environmental science and a fraught diplomatic history await anyone seeking to determine how to build a wall that cuts off the flow of people without violating the nation\u2019s water treaty obligations.Experts on those subjects, in interviews, were skeptical that one would ever be built. They speculated that the financial and political challenges were too great, among other reasons.With the will and the financial wherewithal, though, an engineering solution can be found, said Sally Spener, the United States secretary for the International Boundary and Water Commission, which manages the water relationship between Mexico and the United States.But she acknowledged longstanding and delicate water-sharing issues between the United States and Mexico \u2014 a point emphasized by Michael Connor, deputy secretary of the Interior Department, who has worked closely with Mexico on those subjects.A wall could be built that accommodates water flows, Mr. Connor said, but \u201cthe question becomes, when does it become economically significant to address those issues?\u201d(Officials from the Bureau of Reclamation, which reports to Mr. Connor, said they could not quantify the cost given that they had not envisioned or studied such a project.)A bigger concern, he said, was the addition of a potential major wrinkle into the delicate bilateral diplomacy over water sharing. \u201cAny proposal that would threaten that relationship or trust we\u2019ve built would concern me,\u201d Mr. Connor said.Several treaties, particularly one from 1944, outline rules for sharing water from the Colorado River, the Tijuana River and the Rio Grande.It is a complex system that involves water flowing down the Colorado River through Nevada and Arizona into Mexico, and down the Rio Grande from New Mexico into Mexico, where it is replenished by major tributaries before turning to Texas. (On the United States side, the Rio Grande watershed alone includes well over four million people.)Mexico countered that it did not have the water because of drought \u2014 a position that some American environmentalists said was valid.As part of that agreement, Mexico agreed to share some of its water supply from the Colorado River so that the water could be retained in Lake Mead, near the Nevada-Arizona border. That situation worked out well, highlighting friendly but delicate relations.\u201cI was there, and I know the hurdles we had to overcome to assure them we weren\u2019t manipulating the system,\u201d said Ms. Mulroy, from Brookings.\u201cWe are dependent on the Mexicans trusting us,\u201d she said. \u201c It\u2019s an enormous diplomatic issue.\u201dWith a wall, Ms. Mulroy said, \u201cthe chances of another cooperative agreement would be nil.\u201dDonald J. Trump is set to be the Republican standard-bearer, but when it comes to some of his policies, he is out of sync with many Republican leaders in Congress.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What to Make of the Latest Strike in Greece", "Date": "2016-05-06", "News": "Supported byQ & AATHENS \u2014 Greek workers walked off the job on Friday, heeding a call by the country\u2019s labor unions to join a three-day general strike to protest a new round of austerity measures including new pension cuts and tax increases.The walkout, the second general strike this year, halted public transportation services, shut down government offices and closed schools. Here is a look at why Greeks are striking again, and where the country\u2019s tortuous debt negotiations stand:Greece\u2019s two biggest labor unions, which together represent about 2.5 million workers, object to a new round of austerity measures that Greece must adopt to receive fresh bailout funding.The measures include an overhaul of the Greek social security system, involving cuts to the pensions of new retirees and higher social security contributions. They also require increased rates of income tax, a rise in the top level of the country\u2019s sales tax, and higher levies on alcohol and cigarettes.The unions have denounced the measures as a \u201cguillotine\u201d for Greek society, which has suffered six years of austerity measures that have cut household incomes by a third and left a quarter of Greeks unemployed.Social upheaval has been mounting in recent weeks with workers holding sit-ins at city halls and landfills across the country, leaving trash piling up. Greek farmers, who blocked national highways in February to protest pension cuts, are planning to drive their tractors into Athens at the weekend in a symbolic protest.Greece says it has agreed with its creditors on a \u20ac5.4 billion package of austerity measures, and Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for economic and financial affairs, has said the two sides are \u201c99 percent of the way there.\u201dThe legislators are expected to approve the package on Sunday, but the meeting on Monday may be more problematic.Greece\u2019s creditors want the country to legislate an additional \u20ac3.6 billion in contingency measures that would come into effect if Athens misses its 2018 budget targets, but Greece has refused to do so, saying the measures would violate domestic law and go beyond the terms of last summer\u2019s bailout deal.Athens has instead proposed a mechanism to cut spending if it misses budget targets. Its creditors, however, particularly the International Monetary Fund, are skeptical.Mr. Tsipras\u2019s three-seat majority in Parliament is expected to hold for Sunday\u2019s vote, but officials have warned that obliging the authorities to legislate additional contingency measures could prompt a revolt that would shake the fragile government\u2019s stability.New Democracy, the main conservative opposition party, leads Syriza by three percentage points to six percentage points in opinion polls and has been calling for early elections. Ministers have so far ruled out that possibility, but the governing party is rived by dissent, with a radical grouping arguing that the government should \u201cfall heroically\u201d rather than enforce the austerity measures.After six years of crisis management, the eurozone is better prepared to deal with a possible Greek exit from the 19-member currency bloc. Most international banks and foreign investors have sold their bonds and other financial holdings, protecting them from potential upheaval in Greece. Other eurozone countries suffering from debt problems have also largely recovered.But eurozone member states are still heavily invested in Greece, having participated in bailouts worth more than \u20ac300 billion. And they are desperate not to lose their money.Greece does have some leverage, as European officials will be reluctant to face down a new Greek crisis before a June referendum when voters in Britain will decide whether their country should remain a member of the European Union. The bloc is also likely to need Greece\u2019s help in tackling the region\u2019s migration crisis.More than a million migrants entered the European Union via Greece since last year, putting further pressure on the country as it struggles to put its battered economy in order. About 50,000 remain on Greek territory, many of whom are awaiting the outcome of asylum applications. Most are eager to continue their journeys toward more affluent countries such as Germany and Sweden. But those countries have tightened their borders, and more stringent controls may be in place for another six months.The flood of refugees through the Aegean has slowed in recent weeks after a deal between the European Union and Turkey, however. If that trend holds up, Greece\u2019s role in the crisis could lessen.Advertisement"}

But betting on Greece has proved to be tricky and it has been a rough 17 months for hedge funds. It is unclear why Eaglevale waited until this year to close the Hellenic fund, which had already lost about 40 percent of its value by early last year. Greece edged near economic collapse and the situation remains tenuous with the country still arguing with other eurozone nations and its creditors over how to reduce its debt burden. Sam Gilford, a consumer bureau spokesman, confirmed that staff members and the consumer advisory board had discussed seller financing, specifically an arrangement called a contract for deed or a land contract which is a long-term, high-interest installment financing deal. The buyer only becomes the owner after the last payment is made and the contracts can last for as long as 40 years.These contracts have proliferated as banks have retrenched from lending to low-income families and private investment firms like hedge funds have stepped in to fill the void. The foreclosure crisis created a bountiful supply of cheap, often dilapidated homes for investors to buy and left millions of people with damaged credit histories.  Now many of the homes that have been foreclosed are being sold under contracts for deeds. Homes sold through a contract for deed often require buyers to spend a significant portion of their disposable incomes on repairs and renovations.

{"Headline": "Deferred-Interest Promotions Are Back Under Scrutiny", "Date": "2016-05-03", "News": "Supported byNearly seven years after a landmark overhaul of the credit card industry, regulators are renewing their scrutiny of a popular type of loan that can pack a big punch for consumers who don\u2019t use it as intended.Deferred-interest promotions, commonly offered on store-brand credit cards, give consumers a chance to buy big-ticket items like appliances, furniture or even medical procedures and put off paying any interest charges often for the first six to 12 months. Critics warn that the deals can be misleading and costly, because shoppers do not always realize they will be hit with interest charges for the entire period if they fail to pay off their balances by the end of the promotion.In March, Richard Cordray, the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, told Congress that regulators had \u201csignificant concerns\u201d about deferred-interest promotions, repeating a warning he has made for several months. In December, the agency issued a report that said the number of purchases using deferred-payment promotions had risen 21 percent between 2010 and 2013.The report singled out such promotions as \u201cthe most glaring exception\u201d to the trend toward \u201cupfront\u201d pricing after the passage of the 2009 Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act. That act was a sweeping reform of card industry practices that aimed to eliminate hidden fees and curb abusive policies, particularly those affecting borrowers with poor credit.Consumer advocates say stamping out potentially deceptive behavior is a constant challenge. As certain avenues for profit are cut off, the credit card industry moves to other permitted products.\u201cWe think deferred-interest credit cards are probably one of the worst abuses, if not the worst abuse, that remains after the Credit CARD Act,\u201d said Chi Chi Wu, a lawyer at the National Consumer Law Center.Though the bureau won\u2019t say whether it is pursuing specific cases, David Mayorga, a spokesman, says its analysis of the products is continuing.\u201cWhile deferred-interest products can offer benefits to consumers, they can also impose significant costs,\u201d he said.Citibank represented 35 percent of the offers and Synchrony Financial 29 percent, while Comenity Bank, a subsidiary of Alliance Data Systems, backed 12 percent of the promotions examined.At Synchrony, which is a former unit of GE Capital, deferred-interest promotions made up 17.1 percent of its $65.7 billion in outstanding credit card loans as of Dec. 31, 2015. Some 80 percent of transactions are paid off before the promotions end, the company says.Citi and Comenity do not break out financial data for deferred-interest promotions.The promotions help sway consumer behavior. Synchrony explained in a March 2014 corporate filing that \u201cthe availability of promotional financing is important to the consumer\u2019s decision to make purchases of \u2018big-ticket\u2019 items and a driver of retailer selection.\u201d Of the small and medium-size businesses that offer its store-brand cards, 88 percent use deferred-interest promotions.\u201cWe are committed to ensuring consumers understand that deferred interest is a fair, transparent and easily understood product, and that they understand how to avoid paying interest,\u201d Samuel Wang, a spokesman for Synchrony Financial, said. \u201cWe have taken a number of steps to improve and enhance our disclosures and consumer education well beyond what the C.F.P.B. and the law require.\u201dComenity declined to comment. Janis Tarter, a spokeswoman for Citi, said a majority of its borrowers pay off the balance before the promotional period ends.\u201cWe communicate clearly and frequently to customers throughout the life cycle of the product to help customers avoid paying interest,\u201d Ms. Tarter said.The offers can trip up consumers who don\u2019t do their homework, however. Sara O\u2019Hara, 26, and her husband, Brandon O\u2019Hara, 24, accepted a 12-month deferred-interest mail solicitation from Discover in 2013, as they were planning their wedding.The couple, who are from Bozeman, Mont., paid the minimum on their card every month for 12 months but got a big surprise when they returned from their honeymoon during the 13th month: an extra $800 tacked on to their outstanding balance. It was the interest backdated to the month they opened the account.\u201cI\u2019m sure there was very fine print that explained everything, but it was our very first credit card and we didn\u2019t really know how it all worked,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Hara said.\u201cIt was this moment of panic,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was really shocking for us.\u201dDerek Cuculich, a spokesman for Discover, said the company wouldn\u2019t comment on specific accounts, citing customer privacy.Card industry officials defend the promotions as cost-effective. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s December report revealed that a majority of those who take advantage of these deals have prime or superprime credit scores and pay off their card balances before being assessed interest payments roughly three-quarters of the time.\u201cIt\u2019s a very popular program, and overwhelmingly consumers benefit from it,\u201d said Mallory Duncan, general counsel at the National Retail Federation. He said the programs should be structured \u201cin a way that\u2019s transparent, competitive, and so that customers use them in the way they\u2019re intended.\u201dBut for consumer advocates, longstanding problems with the promotions remain.The bureau found that consumers with very low credit scores avoid interest charges only about half the time. Retailer cards, including those with deferred-interest promotions, also tend to carry substantially higher interest rates than so-called general-purpose cards.In January 2009, several financial agencies, including the Federal Reserve, completed a joint rule banning the product.The agencies quickly pulled back, clarifying their position in May that year to allow the promotions in certain cases. The CARD Act, signed into law a few weeks later, also permitted them. Consumer advocates note that the reversal came after several months of lobbying by retailers and banks. But the timing of the push may have also been a factor, coming after the banking crisis in 2008.\u201cThere was a lot of conversation about how deferred-interest promotion programs help customers purchase needed items when credit is tight \u2013 and at the time, credit was tight for everybody,\u201d said Mercedes Tunstall, a partner at the law firm Pillsbury.Lately, there has been a crackdown. In December 2013, regulators ordered Synchrony \u2013 then GE Capital \u2013 to pay back more than $34 million to consumers enrolled in its medical credit card program for lack of clear disclosures. Last August, Springstone Financial refunded $700,000 to consumers who had signed up for its deferred-interest dental card without being given proper instructions.And last May, the online payments giant PayPal was fined $10 million over its \u201cBill Me Later\u201d service, in part for unfairly charging some customers deferred-interest fees. The company was also required to return $15 million to consumers who used the service, which is now called PayPal Credit.The consumer bureau\u2019s approach could mirror actions against credit card \u201cadd-ons,\u201d such as payment protection and identity monitoring. The agency filed a series of enforcement actions against the card issuers starting in 2012, citing deceptive practices, and managed to transform the way those add-ons are marketed and sold without writing a formal regulation.Alan Kaplinsky, a partner at the law firm Ballard Spahr, said he thought many bank issuers had already brought their disclosures around deferred interest into compliance, though it hasn\u2019t always been easy without a formal rule in place.\u201cIt\u2019s taken a while for the industry to figure out what the C.F.P.B.\u2019s expectations were,\u201d said Mr. Kaplinsky.\u201cIf they find an issuer they think is hiding the ball about how these promotional offers work, there\u2019s no question in my mind they\u2019ll certainly go after that credit card issuer,\u201d he added.Advertisement"}

Its founders, Rie Yano, 34, and Jie Zheng, 33, met at Harvard Business School and left their jobs in fashion to start the company in 2012.Like many fashion resellers, they make you an offer upfront, and send that which they won\u2019t accept to a charity, in their case Housing Works. \u201cWhat we\u2019re encouraging is a lifestyle where if you purchase quality fashion,\u201d Ms. Yano said, \u201cwe can extend its life when you don\u2019t want to wear it anymore.\u201d In late March, Material Wrld received $9 million in financing from an e-commerce company based in Japan.Mr. Ambrose, who wrote a college essay about the characters he met while window shopping, is a resale encyclopedia. Some basics: Women\u2019s pants don\u2019t sell. Nor do men\u2019s dress shirts, because people are very particular about these items. Recognizable brands, like Christian Louboutin shoes with their red soles, do. Shoes and handbags hold their value nicely. The RealReal divides the sale price 40/60; once a seller\u2019s wares reach $10,000, that person receives 70 percent. In the world of luxury consignment, Mr. Ambrose said, that benchmark is not the unicorn you\u2019d imagine.I had realized pretty quickly that my Gazelle sale was a fluke. I owned nothing else of value \u2014 at least, nothing that I wasn\u2019t using \u2014 and if I wanted to participate in the Age of Consignment in a meaningful way, I\u2019d have to do so as an observer.

She had decided, she said, to pull some Vanessa Bruno items back from the RealReal to give to friends because the prices weren\u2019t as high as she\u2019d hoped and it made more sense, she wrote, to offer those things to people she loved. As Mr. Ambrose had noted, the more well-known brands received the highest prices: A Chanel turtleneck dress, for example, was marked $895. Of the 90 or so items Mr. Ambrose removed, 10 were rejected for sale.\u201cI have really good stuff, but like everyone, I make mistakes, I get carried away,\u201d she said. Nodding to Ms. Kondo, as one must, she added: \u201cWhen you do interrogate your objects, even if they don\u2019t spark joy, they\u2019re telling you something. Why do I buy endless numbers of white raincoats? I always have to give them away because they make me look like a dental hygienist. But it\u2019s a tic I have.\u201dThis is why consignment can still break your heart. Not every object you send away has a happy ending.Decades ago, when a magazine I worked for went out of business, my father very kindly bought me a suit to wear on job interviews. It was double-breasted, by Claude Montana, and God help me it was also taupe. Is taupe, I should say, because I still have it. I wore it once, to an interview with Carrie Donovan, who was the style editor of The New York Times Magazine, and despite its taupeness, she hired me. \u201cPantsuit,\u201d is what my new colleagues called me, and who could blame them?

The source, who uses the pseudonym John Doe but whose gender is not known, said that the papers could spur thousands of prosecutions, \u201cif only law enforcement could access and evaluate the actual documents.\u201dJohn Doe noted that journalists who have viewed the papers have said they will not turn over the full archive of 11.5 million documents. \u201cI, however, would be willing to cooperate with law enforcement to the extent that I am able,\u201d the source wrote.The statement, which was issued Thursday night under the condition that it not be reported until Friday morning, gave some hints about John Doe\u2019s political views and concerns. They include income inequality, the American campaign finance system and the \u201crevolving door\u201d of United States officials who take jobs at banks or other companies they once regulated.A letter, released Thursday, from a man who describes himself as John Doe: the original source for what are now known as the Panama Papers.\u201cBanks, financial regulators and tax authorities have failed,\u201d the statement said. \u201cDecisions have been made that have spared the wealthy while focusing instead on reining in middle- and low-income citizens.\u201dMost of the revelations so far have involved wealthy foreigners and political players overseas. The statement came on the same day that the Obama administration, citing the disclosures, announced a series of steps intended to prevent wealthy individuals, including political leaders, from using offshore shell companies to hide assets, embezzle or avoid taxes.The proposals would create a centralized federal registry of the actual owners behind any newly established corporation, and would mandate that financial institutions collect and maintain information on these owners as bank accounts are set up. The moves would make it easier to investigate financial fraud.\u201cOur financial system should not provide the rich, the powerful and the corrupt with the opportunity to shield their assets and avoid paying their fair share or with the opportunity to hide any illicit activity,\u201d said Wally Adeyemo, the deputy national security adviser for international economics. \u201cNobody should be able to play by a different set of rules.\u201dThe statement by the Panama Papers source was released through the German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, which originally received the once-confidential archive of documents taken from the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca. Bastian Obermayer, a reporter for the newspaper who received the original leak with his colleague Frederik Obermaier, wrote in a blog post that he had confirmed via encrypted chat that the statement had come from the same person \u2014 of unknown nationality \u2014 who provided the secret documents.S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, working with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, a Washington-based group comprising more than 100 news media organizations, published articles about the Panama Papers starting last month that have set off political furors and unsettled financial institutions around the world.According to the consortium, the documents reveal the hidden assets of 12 current and former world leaders, 128 other politicians and officials, and a range of sports figures and celebrities. The 214,000 shadow companies described in the documents are tied to people in more than 200 countries and territories. The papers include long chains of emails showing how the companies have been used.In the statement, the source denied being a government official or contractor, now or in the past. The confidential source was also extremely critical of the news media, suggesting that certain unnamed news organizations had declined initial offers to take and report on the documents.The measures announced on Thursday by the Obama administration, which in most cases have been in the works for years, would attempt to combat illegal tax shelters with a collection of new tools.Separately, the administration announced on Thursday that it had completed a rule, after four years of effort, that would require banks and other financial institutions in the United States to collect and keep accurate records on these same \u201cbeneficial owners\u201d after they open a new bank account.Treasury officials also called on Congress, after several years of delay, to ratify eight separate tax treaties with nations such as Luxembourg and Switzerland. The agreements would increase the amount of information that tax enforcement authorities in the various countries could share as they tried to crack down on illegal efforts to hide money.And the Treasury Department proposed a regulation that would allow it to mandate that foreign-owned companies set up in the United States, like companies based here, register with the Internal Revenue Service. That would allow the federal government to determine whether the companies owed any taxes to the United States or whether they might have been set up to illegally shield the owners from having to pay taxes overseas.Stefanie Ostfeld, the acting head of the United States branch of a nonprofit group called Global Witness, which has pushed for financial transparency laws, welcomed the moves by the Obama administration but said they were not necessarily sufficient. Many owners would remain hidden, she said, given that under the rules only individuals who own more than 25 percent of a company would have to identify themselves to banks.\u201cThis is an important step to getting dirty money out of the financial system,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there appear to be weaknesses in the regulation that provide would-be money launderers with a blueprint for how to structure companies to avoid detection and continue to have access to American banks.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Disney v. Warner: How Captain America Beat Batman and Superman", "Date": "2016-05-26", "News": "Supported byCommon SensePitched battles between superheroes with huge fan bases? Check.Enough explosions to flatten several Manhattans? Check.Budgets over $250 million, not counting lavish marketing campaigns?Double-check.On paper, this season\u2019s big superhero action films \u2014 \u201cCaptain America: Civil War\u201d and \u201cBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\u201d \u2014 from the rival studios Disney and Warner Bros. could almost be the same movie, so similar are their plots, action sequences and allusions to heavyweight themes of topical interest.Still, \u201cBatman v Superman\u201d would seem to have the edge where it really matters to the studios, which is at the box office. It opened first (on March 25). It had the two most valuable intellectual properties in the comic book universe, appearing together in starring roles. And it had enough A-list Hollywood talent to fill a multiplex.Yet the results are in, and it\u2019s not even close. The theatrical run of \u201cBatman v Superman\u201d is all but over, with a worldwide box office gross of $871 million. \u201cCaptain America\u201d has surged past $1 billion in just three weeks.Warner insists its film will earn a profit. But given that the studio gets only about half the box-office gross, any profit margin will be slim after deducting the film\u2019s enormous production and marketing costs. And that has to be a disappointment considering what the studio must have expected. (Marvel\u2019s \u201cAvengers\u201d topped $1.5 billion in 2012.)More worrisome for Warner and its parent, Time Warner Inc., is that \u201cBatman v Superman\u201d was supposed to reboot the entire DC Comics universe and create a multibillion-dollar superhero franchise to rival Marvel\u2019s. Now that\u2019s in question.\u201cThis is a significant misstep for the DC brand,\u201d said Doug Creutz, senior media and entertainment analyst for Cowen & Company. \u201cThey\u2019ve damaged their credibility with their audience. I\u2019m not saying they can\u2019t recover, but their next few movies had better be really good.\u201dAt one level, the explanation for the outcome is simple: \u201cCaptain America\u201d is a much better movie. After a marathon of superhero moviegoing in Times Square this week, I can attest to that.As a baby boomer who grew up glued to the Adam West \u201cBatman\u201d series that ran on TV from 1966 to 1968, I\u2019m hardly a member of the high-testosterone teenage target audience. But I like a superhero blockbuster from time to time, and I appreciate good characters who convey some development over time, and a coherent (even if far-fetched) plot.All of which \u201cBatman v Superman\u201d lacked. Despite some arresting visuals, the film focuses so intently on the flaws that drive its titular superheroes into battle that it manages to undermine the appeal of both characters. That left me with no one to root for and indifferent to the outcome. What\u2019s a superhero movie without a hero?\u201cCaptain America\u201d sidestepped that problem by never calling into question the essential goodness of its hero characters, instead having them take sides on an issue over which reasonable minds might differ: Should heroes be subject to United Nations oversight?The starkly different outcomes show how difficult it is to make a successful blockbuster, even for a studio with an enviable track record like Warner Bros. (\u201cHarry Potter,\u201d \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d). Sony faltered with its latest Spider-Man installment and forged a partnership with Marvel allowing its superhero to return to the Marvel fold. Fox has at times struggled with its X-Men franchise.Much of the credit goes to Kevin Feige, the 42-year-old president of Marvel Studios, who runs the studio with an unusual degree of artistic independence. He reports to Alan Horn, chairman of Walt Disney Studios, who gives him wide latitude. (Mr. Horn was pushed out as president of Warner Bros. even after overseeing the successful \u201cDark Knight\u201d Batman trilogy.)People who know him told me Mr. Feige lives and breathes the Marvel universe and has a deep and intuitive understanding of its characters and their fans. \u201cHe\u2019s a total film and comic book buff,\u201d said Michael Nathanson, a veteran Hollywood analyst and a partner at MoffettNathanson.While individual directors put their stamp on Marvel films, they ultimately reflect Mr. Feige\u2019s sensibility, and he got the sole producer credit for \u201cCaptain America: Civil War.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s the most underappreciated asset in Hollywood,\u201d Mr. Creutz said. \u201cWhat he\u2019s done is nothing short of a miracle.\u201dBy contrast, no one seems sure exactly who is responsible for \u201cBatman v Superman.\u201dWarner has long been known as a director\u2019s studio, meaning ultimate creative control lies with the director, which was presumably the case with the director of \u201cBatman v Superman,\u201d Zack Snyder.Still, \u201cit felt like filmmaking by committee,\u201d Mr. Creutz said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just do it by formula. That\u2019s not how creativity works. You need someone with a vision who can make something great. There are only a limited number of people who can do that.\u201dMr. Snyder may not be one of those people. He previously directed the 2013 Superman reintroduction \u201cMan of Steel,\u201d which wasn\u2019t exactly a resounding success. It grossed about $668 million, and just 75 percent of the audience on Rotten Tomatoes liked it.\u201cI haven\u2019t studied his work, but when Zack Snyder was named, I heard doubts about whether he was the right director for this movie,\u201d Mr. Nathanson said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have the track record to deliver a movie this important.\u201dMr. Creutz agreed: \u201cLooking at this objectively, he wasn\u2019t the right choice.\u201dThe film had two producers: Deborah Snyder, the director\u2019s wife, and Charles Roven, a veteran of Warner\u2019s hugely successful Batman trilogy. But neither works for DC Entertainment. (Geoff Johns, DC\u2019s chief creative officer, was one of six executive producers, along with Christopher Nolan, who directed the Batman trilogy, and Steven Mnuchin, Donald Trump\u2019s national finance chairman.)In trying to emulate Marvel\u2019s approach, Warner may also have been trying to accomplish too much in one film. In addition to putting Batman and Superman into the same film, four other DC characters, all destined for starring roles in future movies, make at least cameo appearances: Wonder Woman, Aquaman, the Flash and Cyborg.Critics objected to the blatant product placement. Wonder Woman seems awkwardly gerrymandered into the plot. Batman delivers a ponderous final speech that could (and probably will) run as a trailer for the forthcoming \u201cJustice League: Part One.\u201dMarvel, too, teases future films (\u201cSpider-Man\u201d and \u201cBlack Panther\u201d in \u201cCivil War\u201d) but seems more adept at it.Marvel has invested many years and billions of dollars building its stable of characters. \u201cAudiences have been with these characters for eight to nine years,\u201d Mr. Nathanson said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been on a journey with them.\u201d\u201cMarvel,\u201d Mr. Creutz said, \u201cintroduced its characters in stand-alone movies. Then it did the big tie-in movie with multiple characters. Warner said, \u2018Let\u2019s start with the tie-in movie.\u2019 But multihero and multivillain movies are very hard to pull off.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve heard from the critics and the fans and the filmmakers who worked on this,\u201d said Dee Dee Myers, head of corporate communications at Warner Bros. \u201cWe try to learn from every film and make the best movie we can the next time out. We feel we\u2019re in a good position. We\u2019re very excited about \u2018Suicide Squad\u2019 coming out in August and \u2018Wonder Woman,\u2019\u201d which is scheduled for June 2017.\u201cBatman v Superman\u201d is just one film, and no one I spoke to faults Warner\u2019s DC strategy. \u201cWhat Warner is trying to do makes a ton of sense,\u201d Mr. Nathanson said. But execution is difficult. \u201cHopefully, the saga isn\u2019t over,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Many voters blame Ms. Rousseff and her leftist Workers\u2019 Party.\u201cEverything is so expensive now, we can barely afford to eat,\u201d said Juliana Santos, 29, a ticket-taker who works for a public bus company in Bras\u00edlia, the capital. \u201cThe Workers\u2019 Party promised they would change things, but they changed things for the worse.\u201d\u201cPlainly said, this is the worst crisis in our history, with its combination of economic calamity, discredited politics and the violation of the lowest ethical standards,\u201d Boris Fausto, a Brazilian historian, told reporters this month while summing up the country\u2019s grim mood.Ms. Rousseff, 68, is the second Brazilian president to face impeachment since democracy was re-established in the mid-1980s after a long dictatorship.Dilma Rousseff, Brazil\u2019s president, is facing removal from office. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the proceedings.After 20 hours of often-somnolent speechmaking, the Brazilian solicitor general, Jos\u00e9 Eduardo Cardozo, took to the dais just after dawn on Thursday and told lawmakers that history would judge them harshly if they voted to try Ms. Rousseff for a crime he said she had not committed. \u201cIf this impeachment goes forward, Brazil will become the world\u2019s largest banana republic,\u201d he said, emotion filling his voice.Throughout the day, the corrugated-metal enclosures that had been erected outside Congress to contain protesters remained mostly empty, a marked contrast to the thousands of people who flocked to the capital last month to express their support or opposition during the impeachment vote in the lower house.By evening on Wednesday, several hundred people had gathered in the pens, and at one point, police officers fired tear gas into a crowd of anti-impeachment protesters after firecrackers were lobbed in the officers\u2019 direction.Ms. Rousseff is a former Marxist guerrilla and a trained economist who spent years working in the nation\u2019s energy bureaucracies. She had not held elected office until former President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who was constitutionally barred from running for a third consecutive term, picked her to be his successor.In 2010, she won handily, and during her time in office, she largely continued the generous social welfare programs that had earned Mr. da Silva unswerving loyalty from the country\u2019s poorest citizens.\u201cOur greatest achievements were to raise 36 million people out of poverty and elevate 40 million others into the middle class,\u201d Mr. da Silva said in an email on Wednesday. \u201cWe remain a party that cares about the poor and about social justice.\u201dBut as the economy soured and scandal rocked the political establishment, Ms. Rousseff\u2019s popularity sank into the single digits, giving her adversaries in Congress an opening to seek her removal.It was the recent defection of Mr. Temer that helped seal her fate, providing opponents in the lower house the crucial bloc of votes they needed to push forward with impeachment.But Mr. Temer may be even less popular than Ms. Rousseff, with one recent poll finding that only 2 percent of Brazilians would vote for him. He also faces his own legal problems. An electoral court ordered him this month to pay a fine for violating campaign finance limits. The ruling could make him ineligible to run for elected office for eight years, creating an unusual situation in which a politician barred from campaigning ends up running the country.Fixing the economy, which may require adopting unpopular austerity measures, is just one of the challenges facing Mr. Temer, 75. Critics have expressed concern over some of his top advisers, several of whom are under investigation, including Romero Juc\u00e1, a senator from Roraima State in the Amazon, and Geddel Vieira Lima, a former executive at one of Brazil\u2019s largest public banks. Mr. Temer has insisted that those inquiries would not prevent him from naming the advisers to his cabinet.Many business leaders and economists have expressed hope that Mr. Temer will win congressional support for changes like reducing federal pensions, privatizing state-owned companies and amending labor laws that critics say hamper economic growth.Despite the charges against her, Ms. Rousseff is rare among top politicians in Brazil in that she has not faced accusations of illegally enriching herself.His replacement, Waldir Maranh\u00e3o, is accused of taking bribes in the enormous graft scheme surrounding the national oil company, Petrobras. And Renan Calheiros, the Senate leader, is under investigation over claims that he received bribes in the scandal, too. He has also been accused of tax evasion and of allowing a lobbyist to pay child support for a daughter from an extramarital affair.Though badly weakened, leaders from Ms. Rousseff\u2019s party are determined to remain a thorn in the side of the incoming government, which many believe is illegitimate. Speaking to reporters outside the Senate chamber on Wednesday, Senator Humberto Costa, leader of the Workers\u2019 Party caucus, said he was left with no choice but to embrace obstructionism.\u201cWe will treat them to the kind of stiff opposition they imposed on our government,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no other path for us.\u201dPaula Moura contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Energy Transfer Sees a Way Out of Its Williams Pipeline Deal", "Date": "2016-05-05", "News": "Supported bySo far, his tactics have merely gotten him and his company, Energy Transfer Equity, sued.Now, Mr. Warren thinks he has found a breakthrough.\u201cWe can\u2019t close. We don\u2019t have a transaction that can close,\u201d Mr. Warren said on Thursday in the Energy Transfer\u2019s conference call to discuss quarterly earnings. \u201cAbsent substantial restructuring of this transaction, which Energy Transfer has been very willing and actually desiring to do, absent that, we don\u2019t have a deal.\u201dRestructuring is certainly another option for Energy Transfer. Mr. Warren said in the call that he would like to pay for Williams with stock, rather than the agreed-upon mixture of stock and $6 billion in cash, which Energy Transfer would have to finance by taking on debt. An all-stock deal would also presumably enable Latham to grant the tax opinion, since the main reason it couldn\u2019t offer one was the cash involved in the transaction, according to tax experts.But the talk at this point may be just theater. Williams has not received a new proposal from Energy Transfer to restructure the deal, according to people briefed on those discussions. Williams has not gotten a termination notice either, said those people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Some experts say they are skeptical of the validity of Latham\u2019s decision not to grant the tax opinion. The questions arose after Energy Transfer amended a regulatory filing on April 18 to show that Latham would no longer be able to deliver a so-called 721 opinion if the transaction were closed that day. No reason was given. Williams, after consulting with its legal team, led by Cravath, Swaine & Moore, disagreed.Then, on Wednesday, the dueling law firms were able to make their cases in public by way of an amended regulatory filing on the deal. Because of the market declines in the energy sector since the deal was signed, Williams\u2019s assets are now valued at far less than the $6 billion in cash its shareholders would be receiving from Energy Transfer, according to Latham\u2019s argument. That could prompt the Internal Revenue Service to require them to recast the transaction, making the assets suddenly taxable.Cravath said in the filing on Wednesday, however, that it did not think recasting would be necessary.Robert Willens, an independent tax consultant said the I.R.S. would focus on the values that existed at the time the deal was signed, back in September, as opposed to now. While Latham was able to obtain an I.R.S. ruling for other parts of its opinion, the firm did not seek one related to this issue.\u201cNow that we\u2019re seeing such a dichotomy of opinion between the two law firms, people can\u2019t help but think Latham is bending over backward to help their client,\u201d said Mr. Willens in an interview, in regards to Energy Transfer\u2019s desire to get out of the deal. \u201cCertainly the issues Latham is raising are not just totally hogwash. There\u2019s some merit to them. Personally, I think Cravath has a better side of the argument.\u201dHowever, Energy Transfer\u2019s chief financial officer, Thomas E. Long, said in the earnings call Thursday that Latham \u201creally scrubbed this issue before reaching its conclusion\u201d and Energy Transfer also consulted with other legal advisers that reached the same conclusion as Latham.Representatives from Energy Transfer, Williams, and Cravath declined to comment. A representative from Latham & Watkins did not respond to requests for comment.The disagreement between the two law firms underscores the contentiousness that has permeated this deal almost from the beginning.Seven months ago, Energy Transfer announced its $38 billion acquisition of Williams, a capstone deal for Mr. Warren, giving him 71,000 miles of pipelines across the United States. Soon thereafter, the market for energy companies radically changed for the worse. For Williams, where the board was initially split on a transaction, the deal suddenly became a necessity. Energy Transfer, on the other hand, has scrambled frantically for a way out.By February, Energy Transfer fired the architect of the deal, Jamie Welch, who had been serving as its chief financial officer. The next month, Energy Transfer sharply cut its estimates for how much the merger would lift earnings, to $170 million from the original $2 billion projection. Energy Transfer, based in Dallas, also threatened thousands of job cuts for Williams employees in Tulsa and Oklahoma City, even though the initial agreement said a presence in Oklahoma would be maintained.Tension rose when Energy Transfer disclosed an arrangement that gave Mr. Warren and several other unit holders of the company priority over other investors in both Energy Transfer and Williams if the deal were to close. This transaction gave the select group protection if Energy Transfer\u2019s distributions \u2014 similar to dividends \u2014 were cut in a cash squeeze.That led Williams to sue Mr. Warren for breaching their merger agreement. Mr. Welch is also suing Energy Transfer for wrongful termination.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Penalty Against Bank of America Overturned in Mortgage Case", "Date": "2016-05-23", "News": "Supported byA three-judge panel ruled on Monday that federal prosecutors had failed to prove that Bank of America\u2019s Countrywide unit had defrauded Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-backed mortgage firms, when it sold them troubled loans.The judges said that while Countrywide employees may have sold loans in 2007 and 2008 that were not of the quality that was promised in the contracts with Fannie and Freddie, there was no evidence that these sales \u2014 an element of a loan program at Countrywide that was known informally as hustle \u2014 were part of a deliberate deception.\u201cThe trial evidence fails to demonstrate the contemporaneous fraudulent intent necessary to prove a scheme to defraud,\u201d Judge Richard C. Wesley wrote in a 31-page ruling.The ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is one of a few setbacks in the Justice Department\u2019s sprawling prosecution of Wall Street after the mortgage crisis. It is also a disappointment for Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, who brought the prosecution against Bank of America and called its practice of rubber-stamping risky loans and selling them to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u201cspectacularly brazen.\u201dThe bad lending ultimately required a taxpayer-financed bailout of the nation\u2019s biggest banks, including Bank of America.It also represented a departure for Bank of America, which settled most of its mortgage-related charges before they went to trial. But from the beginning, the bank\u2019s lawyers were betting they could win the hustle case.\u201cThe Second Circuit understood this was a massive government overreach from the beginning,\u2019\u2019 said Josh Rosenkranz of the law firm Orrick, who represents Ms. Mairone. \u201cThe message is that government should stop looking for fraud where it doesn\u2019t exist.\u201dThe case was called hustle because the government\u2019s case involved a program at Countrywide known as the High-Speed Swim Lane that the lender created to sell mortgages to Fannie and Freddie as the subprime mortgage market was imploding.During the trial, in October 2013, federal prosecutors accused Ms. Mairone of overseeing the high-speed lane program that pushed through loans to unqualified buyers and ultimately failed, causing more than $1 billion in losses. The faster that employees originated loans, the higher their bonuses, according to testimony.The appeals court ruled that Countrywide\u2019s contracts with Fannie and Freddie may have including false statements. But even \u201cintentional\u201d contract breaches did not constitute fraud on the part of the mortgage lender, the ruling said.The ruling is also a vindication for Ms. Mairone, who worked at JPMorgan Chase at the time of the trial and had to leave her job after the jury convicted her on one count of fraud, her lawyer said.Since then, she has worked as a consultant. The appeals court ruling means Ms. Mairone does not have to pay the $1 million penalty that the district court had ordered.The government\u2019s case was based on a whistle-blower complaint originally brought by Edward O\u2019Donnell, a former Countrywide executive.Mr. O'Donnell received $57 million from the government for his role in bringing the issues to light. His lawyer said the appeals court ruling would not affect that payout, which was tied more broadly to his work helping federal prosecutors reach a $16.65 billion settlement with Bank of America in August 2014.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Idea to Cut National Debt: Get Creditors to Accept Less", "Date": "2016-05-06", "News": "Supported byAsked on Thursday whether the United States needed to pay its debts in full, or whether he could negotiate a partial repayment, Mr. Trump told the cable network CNBC, \u201cI would borrow, knowing that if the economy crashed, you could make a deal.\u201dHe added, \u201cAnd if the economy was good, it was good. So, therefore, you can\u2019t lose.\u201dSuch remarks by a major presidential candidate have no modern precedent. The United States government is able to borrow money at very low interest rates because Treasury securities are regarded as a safe investment, and any cracks in investor confidence have a long history of costing American taxpayers a lot of money.Experts also described Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal as fanciful, saying there was no reason to think America\u2019s creditors would accept anything less than 100 cents on the dollar, regardless of Mr. Trump\u2019s deal-making prowess.\u201cNo one on the other side would pick up the phone if the secretary of the U.S. Treasury tried to make that call,\u201d said Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP. \u201cWhy should they? They have a contract\u201d requiring payment in full.Mr. Trump told CNBC that he was concerned about the impact of higher interest rates on the cost of servicing the federal debt. \u201cWe\u2019re paying a very low interest rate,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat happens if that interest rate goes two, three, four points up? We don\u2019t have a country. I mean, if you look at the numbers, they\u2019re staggering.\u201dCurrent polls show an uphill battle for Donald Trump should he and Hillary Clinton face off in the general election.Pressed to elaborate on his remarks, Mr. Trump did appear to step back. He said that he was not suggesting a default, but instead that the government could seek to repurchase debt for less than the face value of the securities. The government, in other words, would seek to repay less money than it borrowed.Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said that she shared Mr. Trump\u2019s concern about the size of the federal debt, but that the issue needed to be addressed through changes in fiscal policy \u2014 some combination of less spending and more revenue.\u201cIt\u2019s a policy problem, not a debt-management problem,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen it comes to fiscal responsibility, people are always looking for the easiest of answers. If there were low-hanging fruit here, the Treasury Department would already be on it.\u201dRepurchasing debt is a fairly common tactic in the corporate world, but it only works if the debt is trading at a discount. If creditors think they are going to get 80 cents for every dollar they are owed, they may be overjoyed to get 90 cents. Mr. Trump\u2019s companies had sometimes been able to retire debt at a discount because creditors feared they might default.But Mr. Trump\u2019s statement might show the limits of translating his business acumen into the world of government finance. The United States simply cannot pursue a similar strategy. The government runs an annual deficit, so it must borrow to retire existing debt. Any measures that would reduce the value of the existing debt, making it cheaper to repurchase, would increase the cost of issuing new debt. Such a threat also could undermine the stability of global financial markets.In 1979, for example, what the government described as \u201cbookkeeping problems\u201d temporarily delayed $120 million in interest payments. In the aftermath of the delay, investors pushed up interest rates on Treasuries by about 0.6 percentage point, according to a 1989 study by Terry L. Zivney of the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, and Richard D. Marcus of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. That cost taxpayers roughly $12 billion.In 2011, federal borrowing costs climbed as congressional Republicans refused for a time to increase the federal government\u2019s statutory borrowing limit, raising doubts about the government\u2019s ability to repay its debts. The Bipartisan Policy Center calculated that the higher rates will cost taxpayers about $19 billion.There is a limited opportunity for Mr. Trump to pursue bond buybacks without disrupting markets. He could seek to take advantage of the market\u2019s preference for brand-new Treasuries. In a longstanding quirk, older vintages of Treasuries trade at slightly lower prices than the latest issuance. Treasury officials have discussed issuing new debt to fund purchases of older debt, but they would do so because newer securities are easier for investors to buy and sell. That might improve the workings of financial markets. Any savings, however, would be small change.\u201cIt would not move the needle at all on the overall debt,\u201d Mr. Crandall, the economist, said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "New York Lenders Subpoenaed Over Seller-Financed Mortgage Alternatives", "Date": "2016-05-13", "News": "Supported byFinancial regulators in New York are scrutinizing a revival in seller-financed deals for marketing inexpensive homes to lower-income people who cannot get a mortgage.The New York State Department of Financial Services on Friday subpoenaed four investment firms that either are involved with seller-financed deals or provide financing for such deals, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter but spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is preliminary.The firms receiving subpoenas from New York regulators are Battery Point Financial, New York Mortgage Trust, Apollo Residential Mortgage and an affiliated entity of Apollo Global Management, the person said. All four are in Manhattan.The nation\u2019s top consumer regulator, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, recently began an informal inquiry into seller-financing arrangements, which are commonly referred to as contracts for deeds. The bureau has assigned two enforcement lawyers to research the seller-financing market and determine whether the terms of some deals violate federal truth-in-lending laws.Contracts for deeds and other forms of seller financing have been in resurgence after the financial crisis, which created a large supply of cheap foreclosed homes for investors to buy and left many potential homeowners unable to qualify for a mortgage. The high-interest, long-term contracts have proliferated because banks have retreated from lending to low-income families. Private investment firms have stepped in to fill the void.Proponents contend that a contract for deed can provide an alternative route for lower-income borrowers to buy a home. But the market has a long history of abuse, and contracts often favor the seller.Under a contract for deed, the title to a home does not pass officially to the buyer until the final payment is made. Homes are often sold \u201cas is\u201d and in need of repairs.The person with direct knowledge of the matter said the subpoenas from New York regulators were sent only to firms with close ties to New York to avoid any jurisdictional issues.Battery Point Financial confirmed that it had received a subpoena. The firm, which is backed by the private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, is buying rundown homes in several states and renovating them before selling them to borrowers through 20-year contracts with monthly installment payments.Apollo Residential, a publicly traded company, is providing financing to a firm in Louisiana that offers a variant of a contract for deed, called a bond for title.New York Mortgage Trust recently purchased some homes with contracts for deeds in place from a Dallas investment firm, Harbour Portfolio Advisors, which has been selling off some of its large portfolio of homes and contracts.The spokesman for Apollo Residential confirmed the subpoenas to both firms and said they \u201cintend to cooperate fully.\u201d Representatives for New York Mortgage Trust did not return a request for comment.Battery Point\u2019s founder, Jeremy Healey, has sought to differentiate his firm from other big players in the market, saying that unlike them, Battery Point has structured its 20-year contracts to comply with new federal guidelines for high-interest mortgages.Battery Point recently entered the contract-for-deed market, and has bought more than 300 homes in 16 states with the intention to resell the properties for around $72,000 apiece, according to an interview with Mr. Healey earlier this year. It does not own any properties in the state of New York, the company said on Friday.\u201cWe look forward to addressing our residential installment contract with the department, as it is designed to solve a number of longstanding regulatory and consumer issues with the traditional contract for deed,\u201d Mr. Healey said in a statement on Friday. \u201cWe support improving awareness of how nonmortgage financing products can create opportunities for consumers who are shut out of the mortgage market.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Chicago Poll Was Conducted", "Date": "2016-05-06", "News": "Supported bySSRS of Media, Pa., conducted sampling, interviewing and tabulation for the survey. Interviews were in English or Spanish.The Times and Kaiser both contributed financing for the survey, and teams from both organizations worked together to develop the questionnaire and analyze the data. Each organization is solely responsible for its own interpretation and conclusions.The sample of telephone exchanges called, both landline and cellphone, was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in Chicago, maintained by Marketing Systems Group of Horsham, Pa. Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to listed and unlisted numbers alike. Within each landline household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.For purposes of analysis, black and Hispanic respondents were oversampled. This involved random dialing in landline exchanges and cellphone areas with high proportions of minority residents, plus interviews with minority households previously interviewed in polls by SSRS. Oversampled groups were then adjusted to their proportion of the population.Interviewers made multiple attempts to reach every phone number in the survey, calling back unanswered numbers on different days at different times of both day and evening.The combined results have been weighted to adjust for variation in the sample of the Chicago population relating to age, sex, race and ethnicity, education, marital status, and landline versus cellphone service.In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, overall results based on such samples will differ by no more than four percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking to interview all Chicago adults. This margin of sampling error takes into account the effect of weighting procedures.For smaller subgroups, the margin of sampling error is larger. For example, it is plus or minus five percentage points for the 477 black respondents, seven points for the 263 Hispanics, and seven points for the 304 whites.In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of the public may introduce other sources of error. Variation in the wording, order and translation of questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Crop of Companies Reaping Profits From Wasted Food", "Date": "2016-05-24", "News": "Supported byJust as Rumpelstiltskin spun gold from straw, scores of new companies are trying to spin profits out of food waste.Several start-ups are chasing ways to use food waste to make other edibles. Some are aiming to quickly distribute food that is about to be thrown out. And yet others are working to use every last ounce of ingredients.Food waste, in other words, is now a platform for commerce.\u201cI\u2019m convinced there\u2019s a business that\u2019s a kind of Uber for refrigerated trucks,\u201d said Jesse Fink, a founder of the travel site Priceline who now calls himself a food waste evangelist.The business of food waste is not well tracked; most data available now is on funding for individual companies. But Back to the Roots, which is based in Oakland, Calif., and sells products like a mushroom-growing kit that uses coffee grounds, recently raised $5.8 million from individual investors like Michael Pollan and Blake Mycoskie. EcoScraps, which is based in Utah, and turns food waste into gardening products, has raised $13 million from Peterson Ventures and others, according to CB Insights, a research firm.\u201cOver the last year, we\u2019ve seen investors put millions of dollars into early-stage brands that appeal to consumers based on their sustainability and transparency,\u201d said Rory Eakin, chief operating officer of CircleUp, a marketplace for investors and early-stage consumer brands.He cited examples like the Forager Project, Misfit and Back to the Roots. \u201cMany of these emerging brands incorporate food waste and upcycling products\u201d \u2014 using once-discarded materials as components of new products \u2014 \u201cas part of their brand portfolio.\u201d Others, he said, are working to solve the unusual distribution and logistics challenges posed in using food scraps.Some of the new businesses can bootstrap their operations, since they are essentially taking inexpensive or free scraps from others. But many have taken outside investment.Take Cerplus, for instance, which raised a small amount from friends and family investors late last year and got $20,000 from Y Combinator in exchange for securities if Cerplus has a financing round or sells for more than $100 million. The company started in January as a sort of online go-between, linking farms and wholesalers with food on the verge of going to waste with restaurants and other businesses.\u201cWe let people know what\u2019s available and offer a pretty good discount,\u201d said Zoe Wong, the co-founder and chief executive.\u201cPlenty of these businesses need early-stage, venture capital type of investment,\u201d said Mr. Fink, who is a trustee of the Fink Family Foundation, which has focused on how to reduce food waste. But he said some other businesses related to food waste, like large-scale composting, require significant capital investment.CB Insights found that Kleiner Perkins, a venture capital firm, and others have put a total of $248 million into Harvest Power, a company based in Waltham, Mass., that processes organic waste into mulch and fertilizer. And Liquid Environmental Solutions, which is based in Irving, Tex., and processes waste water and used cooking oil, has raised $51.6 million from investors including ABS Capital Partners.The company was started in late 2013 when Jody Levy and Harlan Berger decided to do something about the hundreds of millions of pounds of watermelon that are wasted every year. The company does not disclose its sales but said it expects revenue to increase 385 percent this year.Its biggest challenge was creating a supply chain. Scuffed, sunburned or otherwise unwanted melons can be sold in a secondary market, but prices are volatile, so farmers may just plow them under because hauling them is expensive.Now, Wtrmln Wtr wants them.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely created a new opportunity for us,\u201d said Chandler Mack, whose family grows potatoes and watermelons in Central Florida.Retailers, wholesalers and food service companies may reject entire semitrailers of produce if they spot a single crushed box or carton, and then producers must scramble to figure out how to get rid of the produce to avoid extra transport costs.\u201cThere are typically 22 pallets on a truck, which is what helps keep food costs low in this country,\u201d said Roger Gordon, a food waste entrepreneur. \u201cBut if no one is going to pay the bill for all that, the easiest place to deliver it is a Dumpster.\u201d\u201cWe once had a situation early on where a church at the end of a one-lane road agreed to take a delivery from a 53-foot-plus tractor-trailer,\u201d Mr. Gordon said. \u201cThey thought the word truck meant something like an F-150.\u201dEven old-school food companies are finding gold in food waste. Baldor Specialty Foods, which supplies restaurants and institutional kitchens, is developing a sort of flour made from things like cabbage cores and pepper shoulders. Other scraps go to Flying Pigs Farm, one of its pork suppliers, for animal feed. \u201cWe now know what pigs like and what they don\u2019t like,\u201d said Michael Muzyk, president of Baldor. (They refuse to eat onion skins, apparently.)Baldor had to reroute its conveyor belt system and figure out how to ensure that waste held in bins for processing did not violate city health regulations, examples of the unusual challenges food waste entrepreneurs routinely face.Not every good idea for reducing waste pays off, though. Margaret Tung thought she had a great solution for the piles of day-old baked goods and almost-overripe produce she saw in trash bins and garbage cans in New York City.But the system, which began a couple of years ago, never really took off. \u201cI think there are certain times people are accustomed to eating things,\u201d Ms. Tung said. \u201cThey\u2019re not looking for a croissant at 5 p.m.\u201dThe app still exists, but PareUp is not actively maintaining it.

{"Headline": "Pressure to Close the Pay Gap", "Date": "2016-05-11", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe strong case for the rule requiring companies to report the gap between the pay of the chief executive and everyone else keeps getting stronger.The original rationale for the rule, mandated under the Dodd-Frank financial reforms of 2010, was that excessive executive pay encouraged corporate recklessness, fostered economic instability and deepened income inequality. Disclosure, which will begin in 2018, was intended to create public pressure on corporations to rein in executive pay.Pressure is now building in other ways. The chief executive of Norway\u2019s $870 billion oil fund \u2014 the world\u2019s largest sovereign wealth fund \u2014 told The Financial Times recently that excessive executive pay had become a fundamental issue and that the fund would soon set forth principles it expects the 9,000-plus companies in which it holds stakes to follow.In nine of the 10 sectors \u2014 encompassing technology, energy, consumer goods and services, health care, finance and industrial firms \u2014 large pay gaps and lower profits went hand in hand. The only sector in which profits were not hurt by big pay gaps was industrial materials, including chemicals, metals, mining and construction products.Why did large pay gaps hurt profitability? One answer the study gives is that the gaps generally reflect short-term, corporate get-rich-quick tactics and strategies that crash in the end, leaving employees and long-term investors worse off.Employees and labor activists will be able to use pay-gap information in pushing to trim executive pay packages as part of their efforts to raise worker pay. The disclosures may also influence consumers who prefer to do business with companies they perceive as fair.Among investors, however, the expectation has been that only labor-related pension funds are likely to pay much attention to pay-gap disclosures; other investors are expected to dismiss them as unrelated to corporate performance. They need to think again.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Boasts of Rapport With Wall St., but the Feeling Is Not Quite Mutual", "Date": "2016-05-23", "News": "Supported byBy Donald Trump\u2019s reckoning, his relationship with Wall Street could not be better.\u201cI am friends with all the major banks,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThey are dying to do business with me.\u201d\u201cI think we will have very broad support,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said of the financial community.Still, an examination of financial records and interviews with nearly two dozen executives at financial firms show that Mr. Trump\u2019s relationship with the financial industry is far more nuanced than he suggests.While some bankers said they had a personal relationship with Mr. Trump, a majority of those interviewed about him said they had never met him, and either had not done business with him or would not do so because of past dealings that did not end well.This month Mr. Trump submitted a financial disclosure report that was released by the Federal Election Commission. In that document there was no indication that entities associated with Mr. Trump had lending relationships with most of the country\u2019s biggest banks, including Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.One of his largest banking relationships is with Ladder Capital, a small New York firm that typically extends mortgages in amounts below what generally interests the big Wall Street banks.\u201cHis roots and connections on Wall Street are fairly shallow,\u201d said Roy C. Smith, a former partner at Goldman Sachs who teaches finance at New York University.Ivanka Trump, executive vice president for development and acquisitions at the Trump Organization, said the company was no longer interested in taking on huge amounts of debt.\u201cWe get a tremendous amount of calls from lenders across all the major banks looking to lend against our assets and pitch their firms for future acquisitions and development opportunities we\u2019re looking at,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cBut we have very little interest in borrowing at this point. So we have almost no leverage across our portfolio.\u201dCurrently, 14 entities with ties to Mr. Trump owe banks in excess of $315 million, according to the disclosures released by the Federal Election Commission. The actual amount of debt is not known and is higher \u2014 presidential candidates are required to reveal only debt of $50 million or above, without further specificity. For instance, a Ladder Capital loan secured by a lease at 40 Wall Street is for $160 million.Brian Harris, a founder and chief executive of Ladder Capital, said his firm also lent Mr. Trump $100 million in 2012 on Trump Tower, on Fifth Avenue. Both those loans are listed simply as being higher than $50 million on the documents released by the Federal Election Commission.Donald F. McGahn, a lawyer at Jones Day and former chairman of the Federal Election Commission who is representing Mr. Trump, said the construction loan was not initially disclosed because the Trump Organization had not drawn down on it as of the date listed on the 2015 Federal Election Commission filing. As a result, no liability then existed, he said.Another risk with dealing with Mr. Trump is his proclivity to sue. Deutsche Bank got a taste of his litigious side in 2008 when he sued it and a group of other financial institutions to avoid paying the $40 million that he had personally guaranteed on a $640 million construction loan connected to the Trump International Hotel & Tower in Chicago.Things went awry when Deutsche Bank asserted in late 2008 that part of the construction loan was due and payable.Deutsche Bank countersued Mr. Trump, demanding repayment of the loan. \u201cThis action is an attempt by Donald J. Trump \u2014 a self-proclaimed master of negotiation and deal making \u2014 to avoid living up to the deal he reached with Deutsche Bank in 2005,\u201d the bank said in a legal filing. \u201cThis suit is classic Trump.\u201dThe two sides ultimately reached an agreement, and the original construction loan has since been repaid in full. Dune Capital, Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s firm, was part of the lending group led by Deutsche Bank. \u201cWe were happy with the outcome, and it had no impact on our relationship,\u201d he said.Donald J. Trump has turned the campaign news conference, typically a dreary affair, into a spectacle of self-promotion.Mr. Trump does list an additional liability connected to the Chicago tower \u2014 this one in excess of $50 million \u2014 on his financial disclosure form.This loan, oddly, is not from a bank but is housed in a limited liability company controlled by Mr. Trump himself.In the interview with The New York Times, Mr. Trump said he bought this particular loan back from a group of banks several years ago. Instead of retiring it, he decided to keep it outstanding, and he pays interest on it to himself. The L.L.C. is valued on Mr. Trump\u2019s financial statements as practically worthless despite holding a multimillion-dollar loan.\u201cWe don\u2019t assess any value to it because we don\u2019t care,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI have the mortgage. That is all there is. Very simple. I am the bank.\u201dJason D. Greenblatt, chief legal officer for the Trump Organization, would not explain why the loan was not simply paid off after the company bought it.\u201cI am not sure it\u2019s appropriate for us to discuss our sort of internal financial reasoning behind transactions in the press,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really personal corporate trade secrets, if you will. Neither newsworthy or frankly anybody\u2019s business.\u201dAs for Mr. Harris of Ladder Capital, he had nothing but positive things to say about Mr. Trump as a borrower.\u201cI\u2019ve read all the stories you\u2019ve read, but I\u2019ve never had a default,\u201d Mr. Harris said. (Ladder Capital happens to employ Jack Weisselberg, the son of Allen Weisselberg, chief financial officer of the Trump Organization.)\u201cI\u2019ve never had to call him and say you missed a payment or you have a loan coming due \u2014 not at all,\u201d Mr. Harris added. \u201cHe borrows money. He gets a schedule to pay us back, and he does it. There\u2019s no additional concerns because he\u2019s Donald Trump.\u201dIf there were any prevailing doubts of his stature on Wall Street, Mr. Trump said the chief executive at Deutsche Bank could easily allay it.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you call the head of Deutsche Bank? Her name is Rosemary Vrablic,\u201d he said in the recent interview. \u201cShe is the boss.\u201dMs. Vrablic is a private wealth manager at Deutsche Bank in New York. She is not the company\u2019s chief executive; John Cryan holds that role. Both declined to comment on Mr. Trump.William D. Cohan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Sadly, it has not.In comparative terms, by the proportion of national income diverted to reducing budget deficits, Greece had absorbed austerity measures almost nine times the magnitude of those imposed in Italy and about three times Portugal\u2019s. The result? Between 2009 and 2014, Italy\u2019s economy grew by a paltry 2 percent and Portugal\u2019s contracted by 1 percent; in the same period, Greece\u2019s national income dwindled by a catastrophic 26.6 percent \u2014 about the same as for America in the depths of the Great Depression. The result was a humanitarian disaster only a 21st-century John Steinbeck could adequately describe.Against this background, Greek voters elected my then party, Syriza, in January 2015 to negotiate an end to self-defeating austerity in exchange for serious reforms. With the state now living within its means, I strove, as the country\u2019s new finance minister, to convince our European and institutional lenders that their interest and ours would best be served by reducing tax rates and avoiding further cuts to already much reduced pensions. As a compromise, I even promised a \u201cdeficit brake\u201d \u2014 automatic tax hikes that would kick in if government revenues did not pick up within an agreed period.Amid this endless suffering, have any lessons been learned?

{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": " PAID FOR AND POSTED BY Given the pace of globalization, urbanization and mobility, the world is increasingly susceptible to pandemics. Migration and urban expansion are bringing people into closer proximity to each other and animals, particularly in developing countries, increasing the likelihood of viruses spreading. And from Zika to Ebola, MERS to H1N1, more diseases are appearing about which we have little or no knowledge.New vaccines and treatments must be found, along with ways to speed up the research and development process. Additional tools are needed, too. Systems must be built that can quickly identify and contain outbreaks. These range from stronger primary health care networks to coordination tools such as emergency operations centers (EOCs), hubs where governments and their partner organizations can gather to review data and formulate strategies.\u201cThere\u2019s a shared vulnerability globally to these threats \u2014 and in that regard we have a collective responsibility in being prepared,\u201d says Tim Evans, senior director of health, nutrition and population at the World Bank Group.When experts talk about the public health response to pandemics, they cite several concerns: the continuing threat of an influenza pandemic, threats from existing diseases that mutate, and threats from diseases not yet encountered. All demand more investment in the research and development of diagnostics, vaccines and treatments.Not to be underestimated is tackling known threats. \u201cMore research is needed in order to understand the immune system and come up with a universal flu vaccine that would leave us prepared for any influenza virus,\u201d says Art Reingold, head of epidemiology at the University of California, Berkeley\u2019s School of Public Health. \u201cWe don\u2019t have that now, and a lot more biomedical research will be needed.\u201dOne factor limits the speed at which medical innovations can be brought to market: bureaucracy. While diseases can spread in a matter of weeks, regulatory practices can take years to revise. This must change, says Jeremy Farrar, director of the London-based Wellcome Trust, one of the world\u2019s largest medical charities. \u201cWe have to look at the regulatory pathway for drugs and vaccines and work out ways to streamline those so they are as efficient as possible without putting patients at risk,\u201d he says.The WHO is also exploring what financial models might stimulate investment, says Sylvie Briand, the organization\u2019s director of pandemic and epidemic diseases. \u201cThe current business model is driven by the market,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd for some pathogens, there is no market currently. There might be in the future, but if we wait for the market to emerge it will be too late.\u201dWhile medical research is critical, the causes and effects of pandemics extend far beyond the health sector. So whether building resilience against disease, fighting an emerging crisis, better understanding the links between human and animal health, or coping with the aftermath, tackling pandemics demands an approach that involves government, civil society and business. Most of all, a successful approach must facilitate the sharing of both resources and information.With governments still reeling from World War I, there was no coordinated response to the pandemic that claimed as many as 100 million lives. Communities that isolated the sick sooner reported fewer deaths than those that delayed action.Fear, discrimination and politics dominated the early years of the pandemic, which first became apparent in gay men and IV drug users. Research into the cause, control and potential treatments fell behind. To date, about 34 million people have died.The first cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome appeared in 2002, but they weren't quickly reported to global health authorities. The delay slowed efforts to control the pandemic, which spread to 37 countries and claimed 774 lives.The 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa caused weak health systems to collapse in several countries, triggering a humanitarian disaster. Though vaccines had been developed, none had been thoroughly tested. More than 11,000 people died.Yet if technology advances information sharing, the spirit of cooperation is often dampened by local concerns. Some countries have been reluctant to publicize outbreaks because of politics or the effects on tourism and trade. \u201cYou have to be willing to share information quickly, analyze it and then permit a response,\u201d says William Schaffner, professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University. \u201cChanging that mindset and culture around the world has a long way to go.\u201dIn the private sector, too, efforts have been made to create collaborative platforms. During the Ebola crisis, for example, ArcelorMittal, which has extensive mining operations in Liberia, established a series of regular conference calls. Any company in the region could exchange information on the spread of the disease and share best practices. Among other things, the Ebola crisis exposed the fact that much of the world is unprepared to deal with major disease outbreaks, particularly when it comes to public health and health care systems. Both provide important lines of defense against infectious diseases. Yet in many countries, these systems are woefully weak. Had the countries of West Africa been equipped with strong primary health care facilities, many argue, Ebola could have been contained more quickly and easily.Even in the U.S., public sector spending cuts have diminished the available resources, says Schaffner. \u201cYou can\u2019t put out fires unless you have a trained group of firefighters and they have the appropriate equipment,\u201d he says.Primary health care clinics are also important, since they are often where a new disease first shows up, says Evans of the World Bank Group. \u201cYou need community health workers and front-line clinics that are linked into early warning and surveillance systems that could identify a risk and set into motion investigation,\u201d he says.In addition to human and financial resources, health care systems also need the flexibility to move resources swiftly from one place to another when surges in demand for drugs and health care workers occur. As the Ebola outbreak demonstrated, non-health sectors of the humanitarian community can play a role in this. As the crisis unfolded and transport networks for the health sector broke down, the World Food Programme (WFP) \u2014 known globally for its expertise in logistics \u2014 was called in.Lessons were learned, according to Wolfgang Herbinger, WFP\u2019s special adviser on pandemic supply chain. \u201cNo doctor or health worker can go to the field without protective equipment,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd that supply was not well organized.\u201dThe WFP is now working with other agencies and the private sector to map out the location of medical supplies and suppliers around the world and to establish what can be stockpiled in strategic locations to speed up the response to any disease outbreak.The benefits of being prepared go beyond immediate crisis management. Accelerated regulatory approvals could, for example, be applied to non-emergencies, speeding the time it takes to bring lifesaving diagnostics, vaccines and medicines to the public.A similar principle applies to primary care. \u201cHaving a strong universally accessible health system that\u2019s prepared to manage whatever comes across the door is not only good for infectious threats,\u201d says Evans. \u201cIt\u2019s great for childhood immunization, antenatal care and the safe delivery of children.\u201d So while new science, financing mechanisms, flexible regulations and collaborative platforms provide the support needed to prevent or limit the next crisis, these tools have a beneficial side effect \u2014 improving the health and well-being of everyone. \u201cIn this interconnected world, it\u2019s important that everybody invests in health,\u201d says WHO\u2019s Briand. \u201cIt protects many other investments as well.\u201dThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}

Viewers, especially younger ones, were turning away from network TV and toward new entertainment options: video games, VCRs, outliers like MTV. An anything-goes mind-set was in the air, as networks looked for something new and exciting. And so it was that for 11 infamous episodes that fall, ABC offered up a police drama in which criminals rapped, officers sang, and jurors announced their verdict by bursting into a rousing gospel tune.The show was called \u201cCop Rock,\u201d a high-profile failure that has become the stuff of television legend. It was an effort to tell a cop-shop story with the tools of a Broadway musical, an idea that generated a smattering of admiration but a whole lot of ridicule that remains to this day. Some consider it one of the worst shows ever made.\u201cWhen I was making \u2018Hill Street Blues,\u2019 a Broadway producer talked to me about the possibility of doing \u2018Hill Street\u2019 as a Broadway musical,\u201d Mr. Bochco said in an email interview. \u201cFor all sorts of practical reasons, that wasn\u2019t possible, but the idea of a musical cop show stuck with me.\u201dHe called \u201cCop Rock\u201d the \u201cmost challenging show I\u2019ve ever done, and the most fun, despite its failure,\u201d but added, \u201cIn all candor, I haven\u2019t watched it since the days when we produced it, so I have no idea if it holds up or not.\u201d Were he to take in a few episodes, he might be impressed with his own prescience, because what immediately strikes a 2016 viewer is how current the story seems.A white officer named LaRusso (Peter Onorati) shoots and kills a defenseless black suspect, an event that sets the whole series in motion. Racial tension, both between the police and the community and within the police department, is a recurrent theme. \u201cScandal\u201d-like crisis management, shady campaign financing, celebrity stalking all turn up. It\u2019s not really that Mr. Bochco foresaw those present-day phenomena, of course; the series actually reminds us that many of the things we think of as specific to today have been around a long time.\u201cI always thought of it as a sort of glorious experiment,\u201d Ms. Bobby said in an interview. \u201c\u2018Cop Rock\u2019 was really breaking down these walls of perception, with not one mallet but two.\u201d The first wall said that stage musicals were one thing, television shows another. The second held that the best way to inject music into a scripted TV show was to use known songs (as was done in the well-regarded British show \u201cThe Singing Detective\u201d) rather than original ones.That proved to be too much innovation for 1990 viewers, and \u201cCop Rock\u201d still registers as an imperfect experiment, at best. But if nothing else, it\u2019s a noteworthy effort to try something different in an industry that, then and now, is often content to repeat the same successful formulas over and over.\u201cWhen people come up to me and talk to me about \u2018Cop Rock,\u2019\u201d Ms. Bobby said, \u201cthey\u2019re really coming up to me to talk because they got it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Donald Trump Seeks Republican Unity but Finds Rejection", "Date": "2016-05-06", "News": "Supported byA hasty effort to make peace between Donald J. Trump and Republican Party leaders veered toward the point of collapse on Friday as Jeb Bush announced he would not back Mr. Trump in the general election and Mr. Trump unleashed a caustic personal attack on a prominent senator who declined to endorse his campaign.Since a landslide victory in Indiana made him the presumptive Republican nominee, Mr. Trump has faced a shunning from party leaders that is unprecedented in modern politics. Mr. Trump has struggled to make peace with senior lawmakers and political donors whom he denounced during the Republican primaries, and upon whose largess he must now rely.In a new sign of the Republican Party\u2019s reservations about Mr. Trump, the top strategist in charge of defending Republican control of the Senate said in a briefing for lobbyists and donors on Thursday that the party\u2019s candidates should feel free to skip the nominating convention in Cleveland in July.The strategist, Ward Baker, the executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said conventions were a distracting spectacle every four years, according to two people who attended the briefing, and who spoke on the condition of anonymity about the private session. Mr. Baker, the attendees said, told Republican lawmakers that they would be better off talking to voters in their home states.Andrea Bozek, a spokeswoman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said it was up to \u201ceach individual campaign\u201d to decide whether to attend the convention.On Friday, Mr. Bush\u2019s disavowal of Mr. Trump landed as a bitter blow. The former Florida governor is revered among party veterans and has one of the most powerful fund-raising networks in Republican politics. In a statement, Mr. Bush said his former opponent lacked the \u201ctemperament or strength of character\u201d to serve as president.Mr. Bush\u2019s father and brother, George Bush and George W. Bush, announced earlier in the week that they would not endorse Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump said at a rally in Omaha that he was untroubled by the Bush family\u2019s opposition, and he repeated his past mockery of Jeb Bush as a \u201clow-energy person.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not surprised at the Bush family, in all fairness, because I\u2019ve been very critical of what happened,\u201d Mr. Trump said.He reacted with fury to another statement of rejection, from Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. Mr. Graham, a longtime Trump critic who briefly ran for president last year, said Friday that Mr. Trump was unfit to be commander in chief.The populist Manhattan businessman responded with a statement savaging Mr. Graham, a senior spokesman for the party on national security. Mr. Trump boasted that he had \u201cdestroyed his hapless run for president\u201d and consigned Mr. Graham to the political ash heap.\u201cWhile I will unify the party, Lindsey Graham has shown himself to be beyond rehabilitation,\u201d Mr. Trump said. In Omaha, Mr. Trump branded Mr. Graham \u201cnasty\u201d and called his campaign \u201ca disgrace.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s belittling attack poses a new challenge for a party already riven by frustration and indecision over his campaign. Having campaigned for the Republican nomination on a platform of cracking down on immigration and foreign trade, Mr. Trump now trails Hillary Clinton in general election polls and cannot afford an exodus of voters from the Republican base.While Mr. Trump\u2019s war on the Republican establishment has galvanized his supporters, it is likely to complicate his efforts to court a broader array of voters, including moderate Republicans, and political benefactors in order to compete in November.Mr. Trump has acknowledged he will need help from the party\u2019s traditional bankrollers during the general election, when he has said he will no longer finance his campaign from his personal fortune.He has appeared uncertain of how to respond to the prospect of mass defections from inside the Republican Party. He has said in recent weeks that he favors party unity as a practical matter, but that there are also Republicans whose support he does not believe he needs \u2014 and whose support he would not welcome.Dan Senor, a former adviser to Mitt Romney and Paul D. Ryan in the 2012 election, said Mr. Trump\u2019s dismissive attitude toward his critics could have crippling consequences in a general election.\u201cThey\u2019re still trying to project this mind-set that they\u2019re blowing up the place, blowing up the institution,\u201d Mr. Senor said. \u201cBut now they\u2019re talking to 120 or 130 million voters, not a few million in a few states.\u201dFor a transitory moment on Friday, Mr. Trump appeared determined to repair the breach between himself and the party establishment. After clashing sharply with Mr. Trump, Mr. Ryan, the speaker of the House, announced on Friday afternoon that Mr. Trump would visit Washington next week, to meet with congressional Republicans and with Mr. Ryan privately.Mr. Ryan said Thursday that he was not ready to endorse Mr. Trump, a statement widely interpreted as signaling to Republicans that they would face no pressure to close ranks around Mr. Trump. In a terse statement, Mr. Trump retorted that he did not support Mr. Ryan\u2019s policy agenda.Next week\u2019s meeting between the two men, Mr. Ryan\u2019s office said, will concern \u201cRepublican principles and ideas that can win the support of the American people this November.\u201dMr. Trump conceded in a television interview on Friday morning that he had been surprised by Mr. Ryan\u2019s rebuke, and he sounded exasperated by the party leadership\u2019s unwillingness to rally to his candidacy. \u201cYou talk about unity,\u201d Mr. Trump said, \u201cbut what is this?\u201dEven as he has earned a cold shoulder from much of the party establishment, Mr. Trump has also collected important endorsements from deep within the Republican elite. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, has committed to supporting him, and Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, hastened on Tuesday evening to declare Mr. Trump the party\u2019s presumptive nominee. Former Vice President Dick Cheney also said in a CNN interview that he would vote for Mr. Trump as the Republican nominee.Sheldon G. Adelson, the billionaire casino owner who is a major benefactor of the party, said at an event in Manhattan on Thursday that he would support Mr. Trump. Gov. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska, whose family financed millions of dollars\u2019 worth of ads attacking Mr. Trump in the primaries, introduced Mr. Trump in Omaha on Friday.Most Republican campaign contributors face less immediate pressure to count themselves as with or against Mr. Trump, but strategists expect Mr. Trump to face considerable skepticism. John McKager Stipanovich, a longtime Florida lobbyist and fund-raiser close to Jeb Bush, said Mr. Trump would face stiff resistance among the people the party has typically relied on for financial support.Mr. Stipanovich predicted that the stances taken by Mr. Ryan and the Bush family would hurt Mr. Trump with traditional party donors.\u201cObviously, Trump has spent an awful lot of time in the last year disparaging people like that,\u201d said Mr. Stipanovich, who has vowed to oppose Mr. Trump. \u201cIt will be some indication of how craven they are to see how quickly they crawl to him on their knees, or to the party to help him. I don\u2019t know that they will do that.\u201dNick Corasaniti contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Uhlmann, a former federal prosecutor of environmental crimes who teaches law at the University of Michigan. \u201cI have a hard time seeing the case succeeding in the Supreme Court, if it gets that far, and it may not even survive review in the Ninth Circuit.\u201dVictoria Barrett, one of the plaintiffs, from Westchester County, N.Y., said that older generations had ignored the threat to the planet even as the scientific evidence of warming became undeniable.The current plans and efforts to battle climate change are not enough, Ms. Barrett, 17, said, adding that her generation, with its passion and social media tools, would make a difference.\u201cWe want our children to look back in the textbooks and say, \u2018Oh, our parents\u2019 generation \u2014 they really fought for us,\u2019 \u201d she said.The lawsuit calls for the courts to order the government to stop the \u201cpermitting, authorizing and subsidizing of fossil fuels\u201d \u2014 by, for example, canceling plans for projects like a liquefied natural gas export terminal in Oregon \u2014 and \u201cto develop a national plan to restore Earth\u2019s energy balance, and implement that national plan so as to stabilize the climate system.\u201dIn an interview, Ms. Olson said the goal was to pursue action against climate change in the courts as a human rights issue, and in the name of young people. \u201cMost of them can\u2019t vote,\u201d she said, \u201cand they don\u2019t have the money to lobby.\u201dYouth-oriented climate groups put out calls for volunteers, and Ms. Olson found herself with more than enough enthusiastic young activists willing to be plaintiffs. The organization is financed in part by individual contributions and institutional funding from groups like the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, which contributes heavily to environmental causes.As for the federal case, Ms. Olson said, \u201cWe are optimistic that the decision will affirm the findings and the recommendations and put us on a track to a trial.\u201dThe Our Children\u2019s Trust suit is part of a wave of citizen actions to take on climate change.In November, the farmer in Peru, Saul Luciano Lliuya, sued the German utility RWE for its proportional contribution to global climate change. The effects of increasingly extreme weather such as drought can make farming a more precarious proposition, but Mr. Luciano\u2019s fears are focused on Palcacocha Lake, which sits above his town and farm and is being filled to overflowing, he said, by meltwater from nearby glaciers.\u201cWe could see the glaciers melting,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were disappearing year by year. Somebody has to be made responsible.\u201d\u201cIt would be quite difficult to sue in the U.S. or Saudi Arabia,\u201d he said.The German courts have accepted the case, but a representative of the company, Klaus-Peter Kress, said, \u201cRWE does not see a legal basis for this type of claim.\u201d\u201cHearing about those cases was a kick in the butt \u2014 they were just ordinary people, too \u2014 I felt that I really had no excuse,\u201d Ms. Thomson wrote in an email.Her lawsuit against the New Zealand government has been filed, but no hearing date has been set.Ms. Olson of Our Children\u2019s Trust said that the cases in the United States and abroad \u201cbuild on one another.\u201dXiuhtezcatl Martinez, a 16-year-old high school student and hip-hop artist from Boulder, Colo., who became a plaintiff in the Oregon case after getting involved in one of the state lawsuits sponsored by Our Children\u2019s Trust, said that because \u201cclimate change is really the defining issue of our time, there is no lawsuit of greater importance happening anywhere in the country.\u201dIf this suit fails, he said, he expects new ones will be filed. \u201cThe evidence will only get stronger,\u201d he added.But courts do blaze new paths, establishing rights to, for example, same-sex marriage.\u201cMost novel arguments crash and burn, but some soar,\u201d Professor Gerrard said. \u201cIt\u2019s often hard to predict in advance which is which.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Graduated from Penn StateSince I\u2019m taking a more untraditional route for a psychology degree and going into business rather than on to graduate school, I\u2019ve been in the process of searching for a job using online job boards and recruiting firms since last December. It\u2019s been quite a long journey. I\u2019ve had at least 40 interviews of varying types (from phone to Skype to in person), but hopefully all my hard work will pay off soon! I\u2019m looking to start a job within human resources in the next few months, preferably in New York City.CAMMI CLEMENT, 18, Piqua, Ohio.Graduating from Upper Valley Career Center\u2019s HVAC/R program My job search was a bit different than a lot of other high school students\u2019. I didn\u2019t have to do a lot of searching. In fact, the employers came to me. I was offered a job shadow for Emerson Climate Technologies based in Sidney, Ohio. After touring the facility for the day, I was given the opportunity to be an apprentice. I jumped on that offer as quick as I could. My first day was June 1, 2015. I mostly worked with the older employees so that I could get a feel of how the equipment ran and operated. Not too long after that, I was able to maintain, modify and tear down compressors all on my own.After almost a year of working at Emerson, I was offered a full-time position as a buildup technician after high school. Not only was I offered a full-time position, but they also offered to reimburse me for my college tuition. I can\u2019t even begin to explain the amount of weight that\u2019s been lifted off my shoulders. I\u2019ve always wondered how I was going to be able to pay for my college years, not to mention the amount of debt that would be staring me on the face. It is such a relief that I won\u2019t have to worry about what most 18-year-olds coming out of high school do, and for that I am grateful. Now I will be able to work full time while I attend school during the evening.JULIAN GILYARD, 22, New York.One of the truest statements is that there is no template to get a job out of college. At the beginning of junior year, I began to have an interest in finance. At my school, the business school, which I am not a part of, is separate from the school of arts and sciences. Through the grapevine, I heard that U.N.C. was holding a breakfast with UBS in Chapel Hill to meet with students, so I woke up at 4 a.m. and drove to Chapel Hill to meet with members of UBS. There I incidentally met UBS strategist Dylan Stamer. At the time, he basically taught me everything I knew about finance in 45 minutes. Following our encounter, he told me if I was ever in N.Y.C. to stop by the office.Like an eager student, three weeks later, I tagged along with the finance club to their \u201cWake on Wall Street\u201d trip and flew up to N.Y.C. When we stopped by UBS, Dylan greeted me and took me to the trading floor. From there, he asked me to step into a room and told me that people were going to meet me. For the next five hours, I sat down working on puzzlers, finance topics and math problems. My perception was that I was just meeting people; I didn\u2019t know I was being interviewed. By the end of the last conversation, I was offered an internship position for my junior year summer. After interning for UBS in the summer of my junior year, I was offered a full-time position in N.Y.C. to start upon graduation.JUNAID ABDUL KADER, 23, Staten Island, N.Y. Graduated with G.E.D.I started looking for my first job when I was 18 years old. I had trouble finding a job since I had no work experience, didn\u2019t have my high school diploma, and I was extremely shy and lacked self-esteem. When looking for a G.E.D. program online, I found Opportunities for a Better Tomorrow. I joined the program and it helped me prepare for the G.E.D. test, develop customer service and public speaking skills, and build my self-confidence. Through the program I got my G.E.D. and an internship at Burberry, and they ended up hiring me full time, which is how I got my first job. From that job, I ended up doing customer service for airlines at J.F.K. I currently work for Aircraft Service International Group and am stationed at Etihad Airways, where I greet and check in passengers and help passengers board their flights at the gate.MUQADDAS IBRAHIM, 22, Portland, Ore. Graduating from Wake Forest UniversityMy family immigrated from Afghanistan in 2002. For me the job process was much smoother than I expected. I attended the annual career fair at Wake Forest and had the opportunity to speak to companies I was interested in. Later that day, I was contacted by Dish Network and Abercrombie & Fitch recruiters. By mid-October, I had completed multiple in-person, phone and Skype interviews. I was flown to both headquarters for final in-person interviews with upper management. In November, I was given offers from both companies, but I chose to take the business analyst position with Abercrombie because of its reputable training program and it aligned with my career goals and interests. I\u2019ll be starting on June 27 in Columbus, Ohio.EDUARDO EVANGELISTA, 24, Brooklyn, N.Y. Graduated with G.E.D.\u201cI didn\u2019t finish high school and started looking for a job when I was 19 years old. I asked at all the businesses in my neighborhood if they were hiring, but nobody would give me a job. A friend told me that if I had trouble finding a job I should go to Opportunities for a Better Tomorrow, and they would help me find a job and get my G.E.D. Through the program I got my G.E.D., and they also taught me how to prepare for an interview, dress well and be on time for work. Having a G.E.D. definitely made the job search easier since nobody would ever consider hiring me before I got that. After I got my G.E.D., Opportunities for a Better Tomorrow helped me get my first job at Citarella supermarket and then helped me find my current job at Sims Municipal Recycling, where I work as a quality control specialist.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Weill, who built Citigroup into a too-big-to-fail colossus and dominated the New York charity and social circuit more than a decade ago, lately can be found relaxed in jeans attending local wine country social events or riding his John Deere farm utility vehicle across his property to visit the neighbors.Mr. Weill, a quintessential Brooklyn native, and his wife, Joan, have decamped for Sonoma, where the rolling sun-dappled hills are often compared to Italy\u2019s Tuscany region. The Weills spend more than half of their time here now, far from Wall Street\u2019s high-octane environment \u2014 and its critical onlookers.Of course, parts of Mr. Weill\u2019s new life still look similar to his old one back East.On the lawn of his 360-acre hilltop estate, named Casa Rosa, sit two stainless steel sculptures of roses, each more than 20 feet tall, by the New York artist Will Ryman. Mr. Weill bought them after noticing them in 2011, when they were part of a public art installation adorning Park Avenue.The couple\u2019s Manhattan-based interior designer, Mica Ertegun, updated the Sonoma estate\u2019s 11,600-square-foot mansion, which they bought in 2010 for $30 million. The property includes a vineyard that produces syrah under the \u201cWeill a Way\u201d label. And Mr. Weill arranged for Breguet, whose $23,600 wristwatches he wears, to become the official timepiece of a concert hall named after the Weills at nearby Sonoma State University, a project he helped finish with a $12 million donation in 2011.\u201cI think he kind of enjoys it out here. Probably he finds it a bit more of a quieter lifestyle than the hustle and bustle of the city,\u201d said Leslie Vadasz, a retired Intel executive whose 200-acre estate is next door to Casa Rosa. The two have become friendly, but there are some topics that are still off limits, it seems.\u201cIn a way, he was quite a pioneer on Wall Street,\u201d Mr. Vadasz said in a recent interview, seated in the spacious living room of his own hillside mansion. \u201cBut when I mentioned it, either Sandy or Joan said, \u2018Look what happened.\u2019 He was not particularly happy about it.\u201d Mr. Weill does not appear to enjoy discussing the topic, Mr. Vadasz added. \u201cThere are subjects that I don\u2019t poke at and he doesn\u2019t volunteer.\u201dIn an interview in an office he keeps in New York, where he still spends a quarter of his time, Mr. Weill acknowledged that the fate of Citigroup, and the role of giant banks in the financial crisis of 2008, do not get discussed much out West.Explaining the couple\u2019s move, Mr. Weill said, \u201cThe two most interesting places in the U.S. are New York City and the Bay Area, and we spent more than 50 years of our married life in New York.\u201d He added that the draws to the San Francisco Bay Area are the exciting innovation and entrepreneurship there, as well as the weather, the food and wine, and the lack of concrete.In recent years, the couple has retired from board leadership roles at three New York institutions they continue to back: Weill Cornell medical school, Carnegie Hall and the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. But until the latest gift was announced, few New Yorkers familiar with Mr. Weill\u2019s storied Wall Street history knew that they had moved.In his heyday in the 1990s, Mr. Weill was \u201ca Sun King \u2014 one of the most powerful and successful financial individuals in New York,\u201d said Roy Smith, a finance professor at New York University business school. Mr. Weill gained that status as a deal maker, with a series of ever-larger mergers culminating with Citicorp and the Travelers Group forming the behemoth Citigroup in 1998. The last deal helped knock down the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act, which separated banking from the riskier securities business.But then he and Citigroup suffered a series of setbacks. He stepped down as Citigroup\u2019s chief executive in 2003, a few months after a bruising regulatory probe of biased Wall Street research uncovered his personal efforts to get the star telecommunications analyst Jack Grubman to reconsider a tepid neutral rating on AT&T stock at a time when AT&T\u2019s chief executive was a Citigroup director; though Mr. Weill was not charged, Citigroup paid the largest fine of any Wall Street company.And he and Citigroup were cited as contributors to the 2008 financial crisis by Time magazine and the Oscar-winning documentary \u201cInside Job.\u201d Knocking down Glass-Steagall helped spawn \u201cswollen banks\u201d that \u201care now one of the country\u2019s major economic problems,\u201d Time said, noting that Citigroup itself required multiple government rescues costing $45 billion. In 2010 testimony before a congressional panel investigating the meltdown, Mr. Weill minimized the role of Glass-Steagall\u2019s repeal, saying it \u201chad nothing to do with the financial crisis.\u201dWhen he retired as Citigroup chairman in 2006, Mr. Weill held 16.6 million Citigroup shares, then worth $768 million. At his peak in 2007, Forbes listed his net worth at $1.8 billion. But the stock lost more than 90 percent of its value after his handpicked successor allowed Citigroup to build up a huge exposure to toxic subprime assets.Sensitive to his image, cultivated through business success, philanthropy and a penchant for putting the Weill name on buildings and institutions, Mr. Weill \u201cmay feel somewhat diminished,\u201d said Mr. Smith of N.Y.U. But Mr. Weill says New York \u201ccontinues to be very welcoming to us.\u201d And he disputed suggestions advanced by two friends in interviews that the move west was motivated partly to get away from \u201call the noise around Citi.\u201dMike Conway, Mr. Weill\u2019s chief of staff, said, \u201cThe Weills are not running away from anything. They are just trying to expand their horizons.\u201dMs. Weill said the couple often enjoyed time they spent on business trips to Carmel, Calif., and once considered buying \u201ca pink house\u201d there but decided it would be \u201ca pain in the neck\u201d to get back and forth while he was still working full time. The idea of the Bay Area came back in mid-2010 during a trip to Napa Valley. She recalls saying, \u201cGee, it\u2019s really nice here. Maybe we should think about this.\u201dIn 2011, Mr. Weill sold his 10-room apartment at 15 Central Park West for $88 million. In 2012, he sold a 200-foot yacht for about $50 million. He has held on to a 12-room mansion in Greenwich, Conn., plus spreads in the Adirondacks and Bahamas. But nowadays, friends say, when he spends the night in Manhattan, he usually stays at a hotel.Sonoma, population 11,000 and situated 40 miles north of San Francisco, stands apart from Silicon Valley to the south, which teems with venture capital investors, start-ups and technology juggernauts like Apple and Facebook. The Weill estate is a few miles to the west of town, reachable via roads dotted with rusting pickup trucks, a Jack in the Box fast-food franchise and a furniture consignment store.Going to California helped Mr. Weill \u201crestart the clock,\u201d said Mr. Banga, who hosted an informal 83rd birthday celebration for Mr. Weill in March at a New York restaurant. \u201cHe\u2019s a good guy.

{"Headline": "Open Spaces Bring Light to Downtown Columbus", "Date": "2016-05-31", "News": "Supported bySquare FeetCOLUMBUS, Ohio \u2014 The capital city of Ohio adopted a reconstruction plan for encouraging development 14 years ago that emphasized three unexpected ingredients: more grass, less water and targeted taxpayer spending.This year, those words on paper are fully coming to life in the southern blocks of the downtown area of Columbus, which is beckoning developers after decades of disinvestment.\u201cWhat happened here is that people chose the future,\u201d Mayor Andrew J. Ginther said. \u201cOur business leaders work closely with the public sector. We\u2019ve taken some big steps that worked.\u201dIn May, the Arshot Investment Corporation became the latest developer to embrace the formula. The company announced its plan for Millennial Tower, a 25-story, $90 million, 400,000-square foot mixed-use development that includes 180,000 square feet of office space, 40,000 square feet of retail space and 100 apartments.Construction of the tower is scheduled to start early next year on the corner of Rich and Front Streets, a short walk from the nine-acre Columbus Commons, which was completed in 2011. The tower will also be one block from the city\u2019s Scioto River shoreline promenade and park, which was completed last year.Within a few blocks of the coming tower are five other buildings that are under construction or just opened, totaling $241 million in private investment to construct 275,000 square feet of office space, about 800 residential units and 80,000 square feet of retail space.Preceding these changes was a challenging campaign for local lawmakers, who persuaded Columbus residents during the recession in 2009 to approve a city income tax increase to 2.5 percent, from 2 percent.The vote was close, but the measure passed. The added revenue helped prevent layoffs of city employees and enabled Columbus to begin investing in its reconstruction plan. The city spent $63 million from 2011 to 2015 to build three new parks. The total cost was $105 million, and the balance was raised from city businesses, most of them affiliated with the Columbus Downtown Development Corporation, a nonprofit organization founded in 2002 and directed by business and civic leaders.In 2011, the development group scraped away the last vestiges of the 1.2-million-square-foot City Center. The nearly empty shopping mall, which opened in 1989 but struggled as interest in downtown shopping declined, was replaced by Columbus Commons, a $25 million expanse of grass, gardens and a shaded food court inspired by Bryant Park in Midtown Manhattan.The same year, the city rebuilt its eastern Scioto River shoreline, shrinking a five-lane riverfront boulevard to three lanes, and adding a promenade and restaurants. The renamed Scioto Mile cost $44 million.Columbus then looked at the river itself, listless and muddy. In 2013, the city removed the Main Street Dam, which was completed in 1918 to control flooding but also doubled to 600 feet the distance between the river\u2019s banks. With the dam out of the way, and with the help of dredges to remove sediments, the river narrowed to 300 feet, and the city gained 33 acres of once-submerged shoreline that opened as the $36 million Scioto Greenways park last year. The projects were principally financed by public funds.Columbus\u2019s strategy of seeding anticipated private real estate investment with taxpayer money defied the tactics of low taxes and public spending austerity that gripped Ohio\u2019s state lawmakers through and since the recession. But city officials say their decisions have paid off, attracting developers into privately financing the replacement of cracked asphalt of parking lots with nearly $350 million in new and renovated market-rate buildings that house thousands of downtown residents, and helped generate 1,000 jobs.The newest completed project in the southern part of downtown is 250 High Street, a $55 million, 12-story building on the southwest corner of Columbus Commons. It is 320,000 square feet, and has about 120 rental units and retail and office space. Opened in November, it has 140,000 square feet of office space and 10,000 square feet of ground-floor retail space. Over all, it is 99 percent leased.The market response has been so strong that the builders \u2014 Robert White Jr., the president of the developer the Daimler Group, and Brett Kaufman, the chief executive of Kaufman Development \u2014 are preparing to construct a $60 million, mixed-use building of similar size on an empty parcel a block away.\u201cOur thought was that green space would change how people viewed this part of the city,\u201d Mr. White said. \u201cIt did just that.\u201dThe new project from Mr. White and Mr. Kaufman on Rich Street, called Two25 Commons, will be the final piece in a three-sided enclosure of buildings that surround the park. Other new structures are the Julian, a $21 million, seven-story apartment building with about 90 residential units, which opened last year; and Highpoint at Columbus Commons, a $51 million, 300-unit rental apartment project with ground-floor retail, which opened in 2013. Across High Street, a $30 million apartment project with about 250 units and 22,000 square feet of retail space is under construction.\u201cWe knew we needed to build the amenities to attract privately financed development,\u201d said Guy V. Worley, chief executive of the Columbus Downtown Development Corporation. \u201cWe had a lot of help from our major businesses here, which wrote seven- and eight-figure checks. At the same time, the public investment has been substantial.\u201dWith 836,000 residents, Columbus is the largest city in Ohio and one of the largest in the Midwest by population. Unlike its two big sister cities, Cincinnati and Cleveland, which have lost residents, Columbus has grown over the last few decades.Business executives and government leaders cite Columbus\u2019s long history as the state capital, its central location and huge pool of graduating students from Ohio State University and other colleges as competitive advantages in sustaining the city\u2019s economy.Similarly, in the late 1990s, Columbus recognized that a 75-acre industrial area and abandoned rail yard along the Scioto River, about a mile north of Columbus Commons, was a prime site for a new multiuse district. The city collaborated with Nationwide Realty Investors, an affiliate of Nationwide Mutual Insurance, which is based in the city. Together, at a cost of $750 million, they turned the area into the Arena District, now one of the city\u2019s most active areas for work and residences. The Blue Jackets, the National Hockey League team, play there, as do the Clippers, an affiliate of the Cleveland Indians baseball team.Since 2000, the number of people living in the city\u2019s center has doubled, to 7,500, according to the mayor\u2019s office. The $388 million in public infrastructure investment since 2011 in the Columbus Commons area and several more downtown projects has generated close to $2 billion in private investment in Columbus\u2019s downtown, the office said, and brought 1,600 new jobs into 2.5 million square feet of fresh office space.The next area for development, Mr. Ginther said, is Franklinton, one of the city\u2019s oldest neighborhoods and across the river from downtown in the 200-acre floodplain along the Scioto\u2019s western bank. Ignored for decades, Franklinton\u2019s turn-of-the-20th-century homes and mid-20th century light-industrial buildings are separated by many empty parcels. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the public investments in place to make that neighborhood really work,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. Policy Puts Iran Deal at Risk", "Date": "2016-05-06", "News": "Supported byPerhaps nothing is more important to President Obama\u2019s foreign policy legacy than the success of the Iran nuclear deal. It bears his personal imprimatur and will stand or fall on whether it prevents Iran from producing a bomb over the 15-year term of the agreement and beyond.If an Iranian hard-liner returns to power in the presidential election next year, replacing President Hassan Rouhani, the likelihood of the deal unraveling will increase. The balance between the reformist Rouhani and the hawkish Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei produced the political conditions in which the accord became possible.But today America is undermining that balance, reinforcing Iranian hawks and putting the hard-won deal that reversed Iran\u2019s steady advance to the nuclear threshold at risk. It\u2019s a shoot-yourself-in-the-foot policy after a major diplomatic achievement.The growing cry in Tehran is that Rouhani and his foreign minister Javad Zarif were had by Washington because Iranian concessions \u2014 the slashing of the number of centrifuges and its uranium stockpile \u2014 have not produced promised economic benefits. Hard-liners are baying: \u201cWhere\u2019s the beef?\u201dThe chief problem is that European banks are terrified that if they provide financing to Iran they will fall foul of United States sanctions that are still in place. Many of these banks \u2014 including BNP Paribas, Commerzbank and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u2013 have paid hefty fines in recent years. In all, European banks have handed over more than $15 billion since 2012 for infringement of U.S. financial sanctions on Iran. From a risk-reward standpoint no European bank can make enough revenue in Iran to offset the possibility of being slapped with a big fine.Secretary of State John Kerry attempted to break the logjam last month by saying that, \u201cWe have no objection and we do not stand in the way of foreign banks engaging with Iranian banks and companies, obviously as long as those banks and companies are not on our sanctions list for non-nuclear reasons.\u201dBut the ownership structure of Iranian corporations is often opaque, making it difficult for European companies to be sure there is not, for example, a Revolutionary Guard Corps interest. Knowing exactly who the customer is may be arduous.One international businessman based in Tehran told me he\u2019d received a letter from United Against Nuclear Iran, an American advocacy organization, warning him that he might be working with the Revolutionary Guards and could get into trouble. \u201cYou can be sure that letter is going to all the European banks,\u201d he said.Most international transactions are dollar-denominated, so they have to transit the U.S. banking system before being settled. Because the U.S. trade embargo on Iran remains in place, making it illegal, with limited exceptions, for Americans or American companies to deal with Iran or its government, this is very problematic. A bank may be located in Europe but unable to demonstrate that a proposed Iran contract does not involve its United States subsidiary at some level.In an e-mail, Hamid Biglari, an international financier and a former vice-chairman at Citigroup, wrote: \u201cWe\u2019ve turned what should have been a win-win opportunity for greater engagement into a lose-lose outcome where neither Iran can truly benefit nor American firms can compete on a level international playing field.\u201dIn an earlier conversation, Biglari told me, \u201cThe irony of the nuclear deal is that we did the heavy lifting in terms of the negotiation and then opened it up to European companies to do business with Iran\u201d while blocking American firms.Airbus has already concluded multi-billion dollar deal with Iran, but in general the Iranian market remains fraught with obstacles.Short of lifting the U.S. trade embargo \u2014 which would make political sense because nothing will undermine the Revolutionary Guards and the hard-liners faster than a more open and competitive Iranian economy where IRGC monopolies are eliminated \u2014 there are steps that should be taken as fast as possible. (Opposition in Congress makes an end to the embargo inconceivable.)On the American side, Kerry needs to keep pressing his message encouraging European banks. The Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) needs to be aggressive in granting licenses of the kind that has enabled Boeing to hold talks with Iran. Technocrats need to come up with a way to insulate from potential fines Iranian transactions by European banks that involve \u201cround-trip\u201d dollar clearing.Iran, in turn, must bring their banks up to international compliance standards when it comes to money laundering. Opaque ownership structures need to be cleared up so that European companies know whom they are dealing with. Iranian transparency is an oxymoron right now. That has to change.The next Iranian presidential election is in June 2017. If Rouhani has nothing to show by then for his nuclear diplomacy, his chances of gaining a second term will be slim. That in turn will put Obama\u2019s biggest foreign policy achievement at risk.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Proposal to Reduce Medicare Drug Payments Is Widely Criticized", "Date": "2016-05-22", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 An Obama administration proposal to reduce Medicare payments for many prescription drugs has run into sharp bipartisan criticism, suggesting that it is easier to diagnose the problem of high prices than to solve it.Patients\u2019 advocates have joined doctors and drug companies in warning that the federal plan could jeopardize access to important medications. Every member of the Senate Finance Committee \u2014 14 Republicans and 12 Democrats \u2014 and more than 300 House members have expressed concern.In a letter to Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services, the advocacy arm of the American Cancer Society said the proposal \u201cdoes not protect cancer patients\u2019 access to the lifesaving drugs needed to treat their disease.\u201d The plan \u201cfocuses more on the potential for cost savings\u201d than on how to preserve and enhance the quality of care, it said.The administration says Medicare\u2019s current payment formula rewards doctors for prescribing expensive drugs. Ms. Burwell has proposed a five-year nationwide test to encourage doctors to prescribe less expensive therapies under Part B of Medicare.In its proposal, the administration said \u201cwe intend to achieve savings,\u201d but did not estimate the amount.The first phase of the new \u201cpayment model\u201d could begin as early Aug. 1. In the second phase, which could start as soon as January 2017, Medicare would link payment to a drug\u2019s value. The government might, for example, pay more for drugs that it deemed more effective in treating or preventing a particular condition. Or it might pay the same amount for drugs that it judged to be \u201ctherapeutically similar.\u201dThese drugs \u2014 to treat various types of cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, macular degeneration and other conditions \u2014 are typically administered in doctors\u2019 offices or hospital clinics. They include drug products that are made from human or animal cells, as well as treatments that mobilize the body\u2019s immune system to fight cancer and other diseases.Medicare typically pays 80 percent of the cost, and beneficiaries are responsible for the other 20 percent, meaning that they have to pay thousands of dollars a year for some drugs and drug combinations.Whatever the merits of the proposal, the administration has to date been outmaneuvered on Capitol Hill. Republican lawmakers say President Obama should withdraw the proposal, a step that appears unlikely at the moment. Many Democrats, alarmed at high drug prices, said the administration was making a worthy effort, but should not move ahead without doing more to protect beneficiaries.Representative Lois Capps, Democrat of California and a nurse, said she was concerned about several aspects of the plan. She listed \u201cthe nationwide scope of the project, the possible impact on small medical practices in underserved areas, and the potential shifting of patients from provider offices to expensive hospital settings.\u201dTwo dozen House Democrats, including black and Hispanic lawmakers representing large numbers of poor people, said the proposal could disrupt care for their constituents. Doctors practicing in small groups and rural health care providers have less purchasing power, often must pay higher prices for drugs and will be unable to absorb the \u201creimbursement cuts,\u201d the lawmakers said.Another 60 House Democrats, including some of the most liberal members of Congress, signed a separate letter listing even more questions and concerns.It is not surprising that drug makers like Amgen, Genentech and Merck have asked the administration to withdraw its proposal. But some of their concerns seem to resonate with patients desperate for new treatments and cures.Bari Talente, executive vice president of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, said her group opposed the administration\u2019s plan in its current form. The National Alliance on Mental Illness, an advocacy group for patients, said the proposal \u201ccould limit access to long-acting injectable antipsychotic medications\u201d used to treat schizophrenia and other disorders.In a letter to Medicare officials, Dr. Laurie H. Glimcher, dean of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, said, \u201cThis experiment puts the care of patients at unnecessary risk.\u201dThe proposal comes at a time when consumers, politicians and many doctors are denouncing drug prices \u2014 some over $100,000 a year \u2014 as exorbitant and unsustainable.\u201cThis is not just a policy question anymore,\u201d said Jayson S. Slotnik, a consultant to drug and device companies. \u201cIt\u2019s a political issue: Does the White House want to make this policy change, despite all the objections, in the final months of the administration?\u201dDr. James L. Madara, chief executive of the American Medical Association, said officials should focus on the causes of high drug prices, which are set by manufacturers, not by doctors. Moreover, he said, the proposed cuts in payment for some drugs could undermine the president\u2019s \u201cmoonshot\u201d to cure cancer and his \u201cprecision medicine initiative,\u201d to devise treatments tailored to the genetic characteristics of individual patients. Medicare officials promised to address such concerns, but they declined to discuss the criticism in detail, saying they were still reviewing comments on the proposal.At a public forum last month, Dr. Patrick H. Conway, the No. 2 official at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said that \u201cpatient and consumer input into this model is critical,\u201d and that the administration might consider exempting some doctors.\u201cWe care deeply about independent physician practice and access to medications in various areas of the country,\u201d Dr. Conway said.Some Democrats and some consumer organizations have endorsed the proposal. \u201cWe are actively reforming every other aspect of our health care system to pay for value except pharmaceuticals,\u201d said Representative Jan Schakowsky, Democrat of Illinois. \u201cDrug manufacturers are the only entity that can charge Medicare anything they want.\u201dAARP, the lobby for older Americans, also supported the proposal, saying it could reduce out-of-pocket costs for beneficiaries, whose median income is less than $25,000 a year.Dr. Debra Patt, a breast cancer specialist at Texas Oncology, a group of more than 400 doctors, said: \u201cThis is bad medicine for patients. It\u2019s an experiment that is simply unworkable in cancer care.\u201d\u201cIn patients with certain types of advanced breast cancer,\u201d she said, \u201cmany specialized targeted treatments don\u2019t have low-cost alternatives. If patients are not able to get the more expensive therapy, they are more likely to die prematurely of their disease.\u201dDr. Conway, the Medicare official, said, \u201cNothing in this proposal will prevent doctors from prescribing the treatment their patient needs.\u201dIn the Affordable Care Act, Congress gave the health secretary power to waive federal Medicare law when necessary to test innovative ways of paying for health care. Citing this authority, the administration said it wanted to require \u201cmandatory participation\u201d for doctors and hospitals that provide Part B drugs to Medicare beneficiaries in about three-fourths of the country.Representative Brett Guthrie, Republican of Kentucky, said Mr. Obama and Ms. Burwell were going far beyond what Congress envisioned. \u201cThey are using this process to amend the statute,\u201d Mr. Guthrie said. \u201cOur legislative authority is being infringed upon.\u201dRepresentative Gene Green, Democrat of Texas, said he too had \u201csome concerns about the size and scope of the proposed demonstration and its potential impact on Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 access to physician-administered drugs.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Challenge to Health Law Could Raise Premiums, Administration Says", "Date": "2016-05-16", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Victory for House Republicans in federal court last week could mean significantly higher health insurance premiums for millions of people if the decision is upheld on appeal, the Obama administration said Monday.And much of the cost for those higher premiums could be passed on to the federal government and taxpayers, administration officials and health policy experts said.The ruling by Judge Rosemary M. Collyer of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia would block the administration from reimbursing insurers for discounts provided to millions of low-income people under the Affordable Care Act. Without that money, insurers would have to increase premiums for many people purchasing insurance through the health law\u2019s online marketplaces, the administration said.The disputed money compensates insurers for the discounts, which make health care more affordable to consumers by reducing co-payments, deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs. If insurers are not reimbursed for the discounts, the administration said, they will need to charge higher premiums to cover their expenses.A study by the Department of Health and Human Services estimated that premiums for midlevel \u201csilver plans\u201d could rise by nearly 30 percent without those reimbursements.Many consumers would be protected, since under the law, they would be entitled to larger tax credits to help pay the higher premiums, the administration said. However, taxpayers would bear some of the extra costs. The Urban Institute, a nonprofit research organization, estimated additional spending would total $3.6 billion in 2016 and $47 billion over the next decade.The administration plans to appeal the decision in the case, House of Representatives v. Burwell. The judge held off putting her decision into effect to allow for an appeal.Clare Krusing, a spokeswoman for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group, said: \u201cWe have a long judicial process ahead of us, so there\u2019ll be no immediate change to anyone\u2019s current benefit. But if you eliminate the cost-sharing subsidies, it would certainly increase the overall cost of coverage.\u201dFederal officials say the Affordable Care Act gave them permanent authority to help pay deductibles, co-payments and other out-of-pocket costs for certain low-income people who buy insurance through the new public marketplaces. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that these payments, known as cost-sharing reductions, would total $130 billion over the next 10 years.But if insurers must rely on Congress to provide the money through annual appropriations, that would cause uncertainty in insurance markets, the administration said, noting that Congress was often late in passing bills to finance operations of the federal government.In court papers, the Obama administration made this forecast: \u201cIf cost-sharing reduction payments were dependent on annual appropriations, insurers would be forced to set their premiums for the upcoming year in the face of uncertainty about the existence and amount of payments they would receive. That uncertainty would be inefficient and destabilizing. It would also inevitably lead to increased premiums.\u201dJosh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said he felt sure that the administration would ultimately prevail in court. Republicans will \u201cstop at nothing to try to tear this bill down,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I continue to be confident that they\u2019re going to continue to fail.\u201dAdministration officials said the ruling should not affect 2017 premiums.The White House contends that the health care law, signed by President Obama in 2010, provides all the authority he needs to pay insurance companies for the discounts they give consumers. But in April 2013, Mr. Obama sought explicit authority, asking Congress to provide the money in one of the annual appropriations bills for 2014. Congress did not act on the request.\u201cCongress authorized reduced cost-sharing but did not appropriate moneys for it, in the fiscal year 2014 budget or since,\u201d Judge Collyer said. \u201cCongress is the only source for such an appropriation, and no public money can be spent without one.\u201dNearly five million people, or 56 percent of those enrolled in health plans through federal and state marketplaces, were benefiting from cost-sharing reductions at the end of last year, the administration said.Researchers at the Urban Institute also predicted that insurers would increase premiums for silver plans if they were no longer reimbursed for cost-sharing reductions. Premiums for such plans, they said, would increase about $1,040 a year per person, or 29 percent.\u201cIf insurers have enough time to develop new rates, they could incorporate the increased costs into the premiums for silver plans,\u201d said Linda J. Blumberg, a health economist at the Urban Institute. \u201cBut this takes time. You can\u2019t change the rules in the middle of the year and adjust prices the next week.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I didn\u2019t inspect all of them but the first 50 were variants of Donald Trump complaining that the Republican primary process was tilted against him.That\u2019s beyond ironic. Mr. Trump and his family have been the beneficiaries of a great rigged system: the tax code, which bestows huge advantages on the real estate business. Throughout his career, Mr. Trump has not only grabbed for every loophole and legal lever he could find, he\u2019s boasted about it.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to learn from them,\u201d he said in the Associated Press interview.I\u2019ll bet there\u2019s plenty to learn. More likely, Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t want us to know how small his tax hit is, something that he bragged about earlier in the campaign, before realizing that it could come back to bite him.Real estate guys can take advantage of the best loopholes left in the tax code, thanks in part to some aggressive nudging of lawmakers. For starters, real estate investors can take deductions for the ostensible depreciation of the value of their buildings, even though the point of owning buildings is that they generally appreciate.For another, they often borrow against those properties, and because they hold these investments in partnerships or limited liability companies, the interest payments are tax-deductible.\u201cIf you get close to paying taxes, you just buy another building,\u201d a real estate friend told me.The tax benefits don\u2019t stop, even at death. If an investor dies holding appreciated properties, the heirs get a step up in basis, which means that they can sell the real estate and pay no taxes on the gain in value.Meanwhile, according to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, from 2010 to 2014, he \u201cdonated\u201d more than $102 million to charity \u2014 without giving away even $1 of his own money. More conservation easements constituted the biggest source of deductions, but the \u201cgifts\u201d included items like free rounds of golf for charity events. Many of these \u201ccharitable contributions,\u201d of course, gave rise to more tax deductions.Taxes are far from the only way that Mr. Trump has gamed the system. He\u2019s added materially to his net worth by pushing the edges of the bankruptcy laws.By arguing that his name had huge commercial value, for example, he managed to retain more ownership in his Atlantic City hotel and casino projects than is customary in an insolvency, thereby minimizing his losses while his creditors lost billions.Finally, by his own admission, Mr. Trump has used our broken campaign finance system to achieve private gain by giving generously to politicians of both parties (including to Hillary Clinton) in order to gain influence. Since 1989, he has donated more than $1.5 million to political causes, 62 percent of it going to Republicans, according to PolitiFact.Among the ways that politicians have been there for him and his brethren has been developing a tax system in which real estate moguls pay little or no taxes. \u201cThe Declaration of Independence tells us that all men are created equal, but the government definitely favors real estate investors!\u201d wrote one such investor, David Lindahl.

{"Headline": "Automakers Befriend Start-Ups Like Uber, Girding Against a Changing Car Culture", "Date": "2016-05-24", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Automakers are looking toward a technology-driven future, one where they increasingly acknowledge that getting around may not require owning a car.The alliances are the latest in a string of pairings between technology companies and traditional automakers that are scrambling to reposition themselves. For decades, automakers had abided by the well-worn formula of making bigger and more powerful cars to fuel their growth.But start-ups like Uber and Lyft and technology companies like Google and Tesla have disrupted that cadence. These companies, mostly located in Silicon Valley, have in the last few years sped the development of self-driving cars, electric vehicles and ride services.Automakers have become increasingly concerned about those technologies and their potential to help people travel easily and cheaply without owning a car \u2014 or even without knowing how to drive.In some American cities, small groups of people are already choosing not to own cars by relying on ride-hailing services like Uber, through which consumers can order a ride through their smartphone, and car-sharing companies like Zipcar, where they essentially pick up a car whenever they need to drive one. Eventually, self-driving cars will be a reality, which would let Uber and others field fleets of driverless vehicles that can operate around the clock and further cut the cost of ride services.Karl Brauer, an analyst at the research firm Kelley Blue Book, said there was no sign that car-sharing or ride-sharing \u2014 sometimes called \u201cmobility services\u201d \u2014 was slowing auto sales today. Auto sales in the United States hit a record high in 2015 and are on the rise this year, and China and other international markets will ensure the global auto market continues to grow.Nevertheless, auto companies are investing in companies like Uber \u201cto be ahead of the curve\u201d if they do shake up car ownership down the road, Mr. Brauer said. \u201cHistory has shown that if you wait for the market to decide, you\u2019re dead,\u201d he said.Last June, Uber said it had approximately 20,000 regular drivers in the Chinese city of Chengdu alone, on par with the approximately 22,000 drivers in San Francisco and 26,000 in New York at the time.Toyota said that in its work with Uber, the companies would also cooperate on trials in countries where ride-hailing is growing.The companies also plan to develop in-car apps that support Uber drivers, and to share their knowledge and research, they said.Next month, Volkswagen is supposed to detail a plan to buy back or repair about 500,000 diesel models that had the cheating software and were sold in the United States.About the same time, Volkswagen is also planning to unveil a \u201cStrategy 2025\u201d in which mobility initiatives will play major roles. In April, Volkswagen said it intended to set up a separate mobility company to oversee investments and initiatives on this front.\u201cWe aim to become a world leading mobility provider by 2025,\u201d Matthias M\u00fcller, chief executive of Volkswagen, said in a statement.Shahar Waiser, Gett\u2019s chief executive, stressed the synchronicity his company had with Volkswagen\u2019s European sales, and how the companies were focused on both consumer and business clients. Mr. Waiser said Gett had $500 million in revenue, 30 percent of which came from the company\u2019s 4,000 corporate and business clients, and that it was profitable in some markets.Gett, which is popular in more than 60 European cities, as well as Moscow and New York, said it planned to use the capital to continue expanding its European operations.\u201cBy now, people realize that the landscape is so big \u2014 and every market is so different \u2014 there will be more than a monopoly or a duopoly,\u201d Mr. Waiser said. \u201cYou will always see two, maybe three major players in this space, wherever you go.\u201dMike Isaac reported from San Francisco, and Neal E.

{"Headline": "The Making of an Ignoramus", "Date": "2016-05-09", "News": "Supported byTruly, Donald Trump knows nothing. He is more ignorant about policy than you can possibly imagine, even when you take into account the fact that he is more ignorant than you can possibly imagine. But his ignorance isn\u2019t as unique as it may seem: In many ways, he\u2019s just doing a clumsy job of channeling nonsense widely popular in his party, and to some extent in the chattering classes more generally.The Trump solution would, among other things, deprive the world economy of its most crucial safe asset, U.S. debt, at a time when safe assets are already in short supply.Of course, we can be sure that Mr. Trump knows none of this, and nobody in his entourage is likely to tell him. But before we simply ridicule him \u2014 or, actually, at the same time that we\u2019re ridiculing him \u2014 let\u2019s ask where his bad ideas really come from.These numbers mean both that the burden of the debt is fairly small and that even complete repudiation of that debt would have only a minor impact on the government\u2019s cash flow.A lot of this debt hysteria was really about trying to bully us into cutting Social Security and Medicare, which is why so many self-proclaimed fiscal hawks were also eager to cut taxes on the rich. But Mr. Trump apparently wasn\u2019t in on that particular con, and takes the phony debt scare seriously. Sad!Still, even if he misunderstands the fiscal situation, how can he imagine that it would be O.K. for America to default? One answer is that he\u2019s extrapolating from his own business career, in which he has done very well by running up debts, then walking away from them.But it\u2019s also true that much of the Republican Party shares his insouciance about default. Remember, the party\u2019s congressional wing deliberately set about extracting concessions from President Obama, using the threat of gratuitous default via a refusal to raise the debt ceiling.Given that history, it\u2019s not too hard to understand why candidate Trump thinks not paying debts in full makes sense.None of this should be taken as an excuse for Mr. Trump. He really is frighteningly uninformed; worse, he doesn\u2019t appear to know what he doesn\u2019t know. The point, instead, is that his blithe lack of knowledge largely follows from the know-nothing attitudes of the party he now leads.Oh, and just for the record: No, it\u2019s not the same on the other side of the aisle. You may dislike Hillary Clinton, you may disagree sharply with her policies, but she and the people around her do know their facts. Nobody has a monopoly on wisdom, but in this election, one party has largely cornered the market in raw ignorance.Advertisement"}

I\u2019m not a piece of paper. I\u2019m not the guy laundering money in London, in France, in Japan. I\u2019m not that,\u2019\u201d said Antonio Alfaro, the president of Panama\u2019s Chamber of Tourism, an industry association. \u201cThey have brought us together.\u201dSome Panamanians have viewed the leak and the resulting international news coverage as an attack on Panamanian sovereignty, or even as a plot by a foreign competitor to wrest banking business from Panama.Many have bridled at the catchy nickname for the scandal \u2014 the Panama Papers \u2014 saying it unfairly shamed an entire nation. They floated alternatives, like the uncatchy \u201cMossack Fonseca Papers.\u201dThe reaction has been widespread, crossing all socioeconomic lines.\u201cMost of the people who have been involved in these papers are foreigners, not Panamanians, so Panama is really the victim of this,\u201d said Fernando Arambur\u00fa Porras, a management consultant and former economics and finance minister of Panama. The national mood \u201cis a little beaten up,\u201d he said.While the reaction has flowed from a reservoir of national pride, some Panamanian commentators said it reflects a certain national fragility \u2014 revealing, perhaps, a lack of self-confidence about the country\u2019s place in the world.Miguel Antonio Bernal, a constitutional lawyer and self-described \u201cagitator of conscience,\u201d said that Panama was still in effect trying to find its footing as an independent democracy after years of living under military dictatorships and within the American sphere of influence during the United States stewardship of the canal, which ended in 1999.\u201cAnd now what are we?\u201d he asked, shrugging. He likened the country to an adolescent. \u201cWe are a 15-year-old little country in the world, but we don\u2019t know what we are. In the last 30 to 40 years we lost our soul. We\u2019re looking for our soul, our identity, what it means to be Panamanian.\u201dWith a stable, fast-growing economy that depends on a well-developed services sector, the country has become a regional trade hub and a popular place for foreign real estate investment. But it also suffers some of the worst income disparity in Latin America, with high rates of poverty among its nearly four million people, particularly in rural areas.The country has closely aligned its identity with the Panama Canal, which for years has been a kind of sacred cow here, immune from criticism. But even that institution has not been an unqualified source of pride for the nation.An ambitious project to expand the canal has run way over budget \u2014 costing about $5.3 billion \u2014 and its opening, now scheduled for June 26, has been delayed for nearly two years. Some Panamanians, albeit quietly, say they have been concerned about damage to the country\u2019s international reputation should the canal\u2019s opening be delayed further.But while Panamanians generally celebrate and embrace their canal, the same cannot be said for their relationship with the robust offshore banking industry. After the Mossack Fonseca leak, many were quick to distance themselves from the lawyers and bankers involved in that industry, and from the politicians who protect it.\u201cThe immense majority of the people of Panama are honest, hard-working people,\u201d Luis Gonz\u00e1lez Mar\u00edn, a top labor union official, said. \u201cWhen there\u2019s a fight between elephants, the thing that suffers is the grass.\u201d\u201cIt made all the Panamanians look bad,\u201d Roger Villarreal, a hotel employee in Panama City\u2019s banking district, said of the scandal. He, too, has participated in the pro-Panama social media campaign, unleashing several tweets pegged with the hashtag #PanamaEsMasQuePapeles, or #PanamaIsMoreThanPapers.He said Twitter had allowed Panamanians to express their sense of liberation after years of living under the thumb of dictators and, to an extent, the United States.\u201cYou know, when you have a weight lifted off of you?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou have the liberty of expressing yourself. You feel capable of defending what\u2019s yours.\u201dAccording to a recent national poll by the Panamanian research firm Dichter & Neira, 91 percent of respondents believed that the Panama Papers affair had \u201cgreatly\u201d affected the country\u2019s image, and 81 percent believed that it would affect the nation\u2019s economy. (The nationwide poll was conducted in face-to-face interviews with 1,200 adults at their homes and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.9 percentage points.)But some Panamanians see the leak and the resulting fallout as a potential watershed for the country, a test of its emotional constitution and its desire to earn the world\u2019s respect.\u201cWhat we need at this time is not crazy patriotism,\u201d said Mr. Bernal, who habitually wears a Panamanian flag pin on his jacket lapel.\u201cWe need to see the crisis as an opportunity to be better: to cure what is necessary inside Panama first, and then to be respected around the world.\u201dHe likened the Panama Papers crisis to a wave: The country catches it, like a surfer, or is crushed. \u201cWe need to surf to the top of the wave to recover the country,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good moment to think and reflect and act.\u201dIndeed, some tourism officials have been trying to figure out how to flip the negative attention to the country\u2019s advantage.Mr. Alfaro, of the Chamber of Tourism, said that a halt to government tourism advertising more than a year ago and delays in the construction of a new convention center have impeded the growth of the sector.But in recent weeks, the country has received more international publicity than it ever dreamed of \u2014 just not the kind it dreamed of, perhaps.Mr. Alfaro also reached for a surfing metaphor: Water is apparently never far from mind in a country squeezed between the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean.\u201cIf we can do it fast enough, then we can probably take a ride on the wave of everybody knowing where Panama is,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to ride that wave in, but we have to do it very carefully.\u201dThe tourism-promotion engines in his mind had started to turn.\u201cThey say we are a fiscal or financial paradise,\u201d he said, a pitch taking shape. \u201cBut we are a tourism paradise!

The country is starved to see its two major parties do big hard things together again. And getting a glimpse \u2014 even just a pretend one \u2014 of Obama and Boehner teaming up reminds you what\u2019s been lost.I think what\u2019s propelling Donald Trump\u2019s success more than anything is the feeling of many Americans that our politics are totally stuck. There is an overwhelming sense of \u201cstuckness\u201d \u2014 and the fantasy that Trump plays to, and plays up, is that he can pull the sword from the stone and do deals. No one was more responsible for this \u201cstuckness,\u201d though, than today\u2019s Republican Party. When Mitch McConnell, the G.O.P. leader in the Senate, said in October 2010 that \u201cthe single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president,\u201d he described the Republicans\u2019 dominant strategy since 2008. The party stopped thinking seriously about market-based alternatives. Into that emptiness entered Trump, like an invasive species.This was a really bad time for us to be stuck. I\u2019m just finishing writing a new book, which is partly about the inflection point we hit around 2007. In 2007, Apple came out with the iPhone, beginning the smartphone/apps revolution; in late 2006 Facebook opened its doors to anyone, not just college and high school students, and took off like a rocket; Google came out with the Android operating system in 2007; Hadoop launched in 2007, helping create the storage/processing power for the big data revolution; Github, launched in 2007, scaling open-source software; Twitter was spun off as its own separate platform in 2007. Amazon came out with the Kindle in 2007. Airbnb started in 2007.That was the real grand bargain we needed. Instead, we had the 2008 economic meltdown, which set off more polarization, and way too much gridlock, given how much rethinking, reimagining and retooling we needed to do. In this vortex a lot of the public got unmoored and disoriented, opening the way for populists with simple answers. Get rid of immigrants, end trade with China or eliminate big banks and all will be fine. It\u2019s nonsense.But if you\u2019re for these things only as they now exist, you\u2019re also wrong. Each one needs retooling. It\u2019s clear: Free trade with China has hurt more people than originally thought. It\u2019s clear: Low-skilled illegal immigration has hurt more American workers than we\u2019ve fully understood. (And more high-skilled immigration in a knowledge age would enhance our economy more than most people understand.) It\u2019s clear: Social Security, Medicare and Obamacare all need fixes to remain sustainable. It\u2019s clear: Capitalism driven more by machines and robots poses new challenges for both white-collar and blue-collar workers.Every one of these challenges can be met if we put our heads and hands together. For that to happen, though, this version of the Republican Party had to be destroyed, so a thinking center-right party can emerge. If that is what Trump has done, he\u2019s done the Lord\u2019s work. We also need Democrats to be a center-left party, though, and not let Bernie Sanders pull them to the far left. If both happen, maybe something good can actually emerge from this crazy election.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Service to Pay Off High-Interest Credit Cards, but a Bad Time to Start", "Date": "2016-05-19", "News": "Supported byYour MoneyTally could save plenty of people hundreds of dollars in interest and fees a year. But should consumers and others whom the company needs to succeed actually trust it?First, a question: If car loan rates for people with good credit are often below 5 percent and mortgage rates are below 4 percent, why do consumers generally pay 15 or 20 percent annually to borrow money from credit card issuers?Tally makes its credit lines available to customers with at least a 660 FICO credit score, though you will need one that\u2019s a lot higher to receive its best annual percentage rate, which is 7.9 percent. Most people will pay at least a bit more than that. For now, the highest rate is 19.9 percent.A loan from the company is like a credit card in that the rate is variable and it comes with a credit limit, which will also depend on the credit score. That line may or may not be high enough to pay off all your existing card debt.Tally is a convenience tool, too. You pay Tally once a month, no matter how many cards it is handling on your behalf. That payment, depending on its size, covers all of the minimum payments on your cards, plus new charges and any lingering Tally debt.Tally requires its own minimum payment, as a card company would. But you can pay as much on top of that as you want, which the company puts toward your highest-rate debt. Tally charges no origination, annual, prepayment, late or over-the-limit fees.This is no giveaway, though. Tally gets the money to pay off your cards by bundling the loans it has made to other customers and selling them to investors as asset-backed securities. (Credit card issuers have been doing this for decades now.) Mr. Brown boils it down like this: Tally gets money for one price (from the investors who buy that bundle) and sells it (to consumers) at a higher price. It keeps the difference, minus any losses that it has to cover and whatever it needs to run its business.The business model won\u2019t work, however, unless the loans Tally gives to consumers cost less than the interest rate their card companies are charging. Otherwise, why would anyone bother signing up?Mr. Brown contends that the two products are not comparable. Personal loans are generally for a fixed length of time, but Tally\u2019s line of credit is open-ended, like a credit card. He is at least partly right, but for people determined to get out of debt and stay out, a personal loan that lasts for a set period can provide a better form of discipline.Plenty of people with credit card debt may also simply move it from one card company to another every 12 to 18 months, taking advantage of zero percent balance transfer offers. This can work well, as long as the borrower doesn\u2019t miss any payments and the offers keep coming.I worry more about what may happen once people do sign up with Tally. Its user agreement makes a big deal of the fact that consumers are responsible for helping Tally maintain the links between its own software and the credit card issuers\u2019 websites.Anyone who has done business with the financial dashboard service Mint knows how often those connections mysteriously break down. Mint is mainly a tracking service. Tally has to actually make your payments or you get into trouble with your card companies.Mr. Brown said Tally built redundancy into its system by working with more than one aggregator, the third-party services that manage connections with bank sites. Moreover, Tally has a manual payment plan ready if all else fails. Given that it needs to pay your bank on your behalf only once a month, the company assumes that customers will help it resolve any issues before late payments become a problem. We\u2019ll see.The company also reserves the right to suspend payments to card companies and withdraw a line of credit after two months of missed or returned payments. You pay via a direct link from your bank account, though automatic payments are not required. That means you can choose when to transfer money to Tally each month.Mr. Adelson imagined himself as an analyst at an insurance company who helps figure out which asset-backed securities to buy. Then, he imagined his boss stopping by his cubicle for a word. \u201c\u2018We don\u2019t have any of that Lending Club paper, do we, son?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThe right answer is, \u2018No, sir, we don\u2019t.\u2019\u201dIf Tally can\u2019t eventually sell its securities, it will probably not last long. For now, Mr. Brown said, it has large financial commitments from both Silicon Valley Bank and a high-net-worth family that is an experienced purchaser of such securities.\u201cAll we\u2019re doing is shifting accounts from Chase\u201d \u2014 or another bank \u2014 \u201cinto a different pool that has the exact same risk profile, and giving institutional investors access to that,\u201d he said.The company, in a bid for transparency, plans to let investors log into its site and see how its loans are doing, in aggregate, at any given moment. When I asked Mr. Brown to promise to tell the truth about every loan that it packages into a security, he said the company would.As for thoughts on Lending Club, he put on a brave face, which is about the only thing you can do when a company a lot like yours gets into trouble just as you\u2019re opening for business. \u201cWe want there to be scrutiny,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more scrutiny there is, the more legitimacy there will be in the long term.\u201dWhile asset-backed securities peddled by a couple of guys who used to finance solar panels may seem dicey, Mr. Adelson said he was not concerned. \u201cIt\u2019s really about using credit cards better and smarter,\u201d he said. \u201cPay down the highest rates first. Don\u2019t pay late. Stay aware of what you owe by pooling things into one master account.\u201dSure, it would be best if people didn\u2019t carry any card debt. But we\u2019re a long way from that happening. \u201cAnything that helps people manage that debt better,\u201d Mr. Adelson said, \u201cis a good thing.\u201dTwitter: @ronlieberTwitter: @ronlieberAdvertisement"}

And Barkhad Abdi, an Oscar nominee for \u201cCaptain Phillips,\u201d has been shooting another Somali pirate story, \u201cWhere the White Man Runs Away.\u201dWhile early front-runners often falter \u2014 \u201cThe Revenant\u201d was once the leader for this year\u2019s Oscars, but \u201cSpotlight\u201d ultimately won best picture \u2014 Mr. Parker\u2019s film is expected to capture attention with a bold marketing campaign that may well stretch beyond the confines of Hollywood, to trade on the energy, and potentially the outrage, brought on by an already unpredictable presidential election. Fox Searchlight has scheduled an Oct. 7 release date.Other black-themed films are likely to be vying for awards votes, too. On Nov. 4, Focus Features, an art house rival to Fox Searchlight, will release the period drama \u201cLoving,\u201d about the interracial couple (played by Ruth Negga and Joel Edgerton) whose arrest for marrying in 1958 and subsequent legal battle led to the end of America\u2019s anti-miscegenation laws. Directed by Jeff Nichols, \u201cLoving\u201d will play in competition at this month\u2019s Cannes Film Festival.Paramount, which pushed Ava DuVernay\u2019s \u201cSelma,\u201d released in 2014, for the Oscars, has high hopes for \u201cFences,\u201d an adaptation of August Wilson\u2019s Pulitzer Prize- and Tony Award-winning play about the black experience in the 1950s. Denzel Washington, a two-time Oscar winner for his roles in \u201cTraining Day\u201d and \u201cGlory,\u201d is directing \u201cFences\u201d and playing a lead role. Mr. Washington won a Tony in 2010 for his performance in a Broadway revival of the play.\u201cIt\u2019s his passion project,\u201d said Aaron L. Gilbert, managing director of the Bron group of companies, which is backing the film, and who is an executive producer on a team that includes the producer Scott Rudin. (Mr. Rudin, of course, is an Oscar perennial, whose \u201cNo Country for Old Men\u201d won best picture in 2008.)If \u201cFences,\u201d currently shooting in Pittsburgh, is indeed finished in time for awards consideration, Mr. Gilbert may end up competing against himself. He also served as a backer of \u201cThe Birth of a Nation.\u201dA24 is also looking at an awards season release for \u201cMoonlight,\u201d a 1980s-era drama based on the play \u201cIn Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue.\u201d The movie, directed and written by Barry Jenkins, has production support from Brad Pitt\u2019s Plan B Entertainment, known for \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d and \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d which scored five Oscar nominations and won one, for adapted screenplay.The list goes on: Will Smith, snubbed by the academy this year for \u201cConcussion,\u201d though twice nominated in the past, will star as a depressed advertising executive in the drama \u201cCollateral Beauty,\u201d to be released in December. It is directed by David Frankel, a past Oscar winner for the 1996 short film \u201cDear Diary,\u201d and also stars Kate Winslet, who has been nominated for seven Oscars, and won one for \u201cThe Reader.\u201dBlack youth, and young black directors, may have their moment in Steven Caple Jr.\u2019s \u201cThe Land,\u201d a drama acquired by IFC about four impoverished friends in Cleveland, and in Mr. McMurray\u2019s \u201cUnderground,\u201d which counts the producer Reginald Hudlin (\u201cDjango Unchained\u201d) as a member of its creative team.Mr. Hudlin is just now resuming his work as the director of \u201cMarshall,\u201d an independent film in which Chadwick Boseman plays a young Thurgood Marshall in a quest for racial justice that predated Marshall\u2019s years on the Supreme Court.\u201cWe\u2019d love to get it out this year, but it has to be right,\u201d said Paula Wagner, a producer of the film. Mr. Hudlin, Ms. Wagner noted, had interrupted work on the film to help produce this year\u2019s Oscar ceremony.If \u201cMarshall\u201d indeed makes it to the screen soon, with its story of a black lawyer in a United States just emerging from its Jim Crow era, it will share the stage with \u201cHidden Figures,\u201d a tale of black women using math to rise in the same, often difficult milieu. Theodore Melfi (\u201cSt. Vincent\u201d) directed the adaptation of Ms. Shetterly\u2019s book.\u201cIt\u2019s been such a whirlwind,\u201d said Ms. Shetterly, who described her forthcoming book\u2019s part in the sudden eruption of the kind of films that only months ago were said to be on Hollywood\u2019s endangered list.\u201cIt\u2019s an African-American story,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a woman\u2019s story. Now it\u2019s part of the national narrative.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Minnesota Law School, Facing Waning Interest, Cuts Admissions", "Date": "2016-05-12", "News": "Supported byMINNEAPOLIS \u2014 On a recent rainy spring day, students and professors at the University of Minnesota Law School looked ahead to year-end exams and May 14 graduation as they bustled between classes. But behind the academic routine, Minnesota\u2019s administration, as at other law schools across the country, was striving to respond to the public\u2019s growing disinterest in law careers.The number of law school applicants nationwide has plummeted, to 51,000 as of April from 88,700 in 2006, according to the Law School Admissions Council. The Great Lakes region has been hit particularly hard, catching respected institutions like Minnesota by surprise when applicant numbers went into a tailspin.It is the reverse of a trend that began during the enrollment boom of the early 2000s, when law schools were doing so well that some began moving to become self-financing entities supported by tuition and private donations. Now, as student enthusiasm for the law wanes, financially pinched schools need to decide whether sagging applications are a temporary blip or a fundamental course correction.David Wippman took over as dean of Minnesota\u2019s law school in July 2008, when packed classrooms were the norm. But it was not long before newly minted lawyers in Minnesota and elsewhere, some of whom had fled to law school during the economic downturn, found that their hard-earned professional pedigree did not necessarily land them jobs that would cover the six-figure cost. \u201cWe really experienced a steep decline in 2010,\u201d Mr. Wippman said in an interview in his book-lined office.Resisting the temptation to admit more students to bolster tuition receipts, the University of Minnesota, which has one of the nation\u2019s highly ranked law schools, has gone in the opposite direction. It decided to shrink enrollment, and take in less tuition income, to preserve its national standing as a top law school. It did this even as some argued for broader inclusion of students who would fall outside the school\u2019s admissions parameters.During Mr. Wippman\u2019s tenure, Minnesota has gradually admitted fewer students, shrinking its first-year class to only 174 in the 2015 academic year from more than 250 a few years ago. It offset the sharp loss in tuition income with more public subsidies, which in Minnesota are decided by a Board of Regents.Minnesota\u2019s law school has closed its deficits with university money \u2014 expected to total $16.1 million through 2018 \u2014 according to university officials.\u201cThe law school is a crucial part of the university,\u201d said Karen Hanson, the university\u2019s provost. \u201cWe did not want to hurt the law school\u2019s standing.\u201dAs it revamped its enrollment, Minnesota\u2019s national ranking slid two places this year, to No. 22, a slot it shares with the law schools at Emory University and Notre Dame. Applications for the fall are flat. More worrisome is that Minnesota in recent years has had one of the largest declines in applicants among the top 20 law schools, but no one knows exactly why.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to figure that out,\u201d said Mr. Wippman, who is leaving for another job at the end of the academic year. He said the school was trying to identify potential students more precisely and to publicize its offerings more broadly.In the Great Lakes and Midwest region, the dire outlook for legal education has been magnified by the sheer number of accredited law schools. Minnesota has three, Indiana has four and Ohio has nine. The region\u2019s rapidly aging population and the loss of its traditional manufacturing activity have eroded an economic base that could support a \u201cstrongly upwardly mobile middle class of the kind that sustains high-level educational activity,\u201d David Barnhizer, a professor emeritus at Cleveland-Marshall College of Law, wrote in a March research paper.\u201cVirtually all law schools across the U.S. pumped too many lawyers into a system that was already filled to the brim and now is overflowing,\u201d Mr. Barnhizer said in an interview.He warned that the region\u2019s lesser-ranked law schools \u2013 he did not include Minnesota in that group \u2013 will \u201csimply wither away\u201d as fewer students seek admission.As the number of applications shrank, Mr. Wippman had to decide whether to admit those whose law school admission test scores and grade point averages were lower than Minnesota\u2019s traditional standards. The success of such students can be riskier. A surplus of graduates who do not find jobs can eviscerate a law school\u2019s reputation.Raising tuition was not much of an option in an era when students are wary of taking on high debt, Mr. Wippman said. Dismissing faculty, especially those who are tenured, is difficult. And Minnesota\u2019s law school has hometown competition, including the William Mitchell College of Law and the Hamline University School of Law, which recently merged. There is also St. Thomas Law School in Minneapolis-St. Paul.\u201cIt\u2019s been a question of fewer students or a larger number with slightly lesser qualifications,\u201d said Fred L. Morrison, a law professor who joined the Minnesota faculty 47 years ago and has had two stints as the law school\u2019s dean. \u201cMany that we would no longer admit have turned out to be successful lawyers,\u201d he added.As part of a major university system, Minnesota had some options not available to every law school. It has been able to tap into taxpayer funding, at least temporarily, to maintain its stature without altering its core admissions standards. A high ranking is an important factor for attracting students from around the country. Almost three-quarters of Minnesota\u2019s first-year students are from out of state and pay higher tuition and fees, $50,373 annually, $8,000 more than residents pay.Even with taxpayer money coming in the door, Minnesota has been offsetting its expenses by shedding staff and leaving faculty openings unfilled. It has also explored new ways to strengthen graduate employment rates, which are another factor in maintaining its national reputation. The law school is adding a Minnesota Law Public Interest Residency Program, in which third-year students work full time in public interest and government jobs and earn a full-time paid position with the same organization for a year after graduation.More than 50 percent of the school\u2019s graduates stay in Minnesota, typically working at a locally headquartered corporation like Target or General Mills. Another slice of graduates joins small firms with two to 10 lawyers, or large law firms, or enters the public interest sector. As law firms have merged, however, there are fewer jobs, said David B. Potter, a Minnesota law graduate who is active in raising money for the school.\u201cWe\u2019ve had consolidation in the job market here,\u201d said Mr. Potter, a partner at the law firm Fox Rothschild in Minneapolis. \u201cPerhaps we don\u2019t have the same variety of jobs that we once did.\u201dOther strong supporters in the local legal community include the former Vice President Walter Mondale, an alumnus and a senior counsel at Dorsey & Whitney, a major Minneapolis law firm. Mr. Mondale actively backs the school \u2013 the dean\u2019s office is in Mondale Hall \u2014 but even efforts like a recent $73 million fund-raising campaign cannot sustain a law school with a $54.8 million annual budget.Some $13 million of that campaign was slated for needy students because Minnesota, like most schools, has expanded its financial aid, giving varying amounts to 90 percent of its students so they do not pay full price.\u201cPeople are turned off on legal education because of a lack of suitable paying jobs,\u201d Mr. Mondale said. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can underestimate the havoc that these law school debts can cause.\u201dThe execution of Mr. Wippman\u2019s strategies will fall to his successor, who was named on Thursday. It will be Garry W. Jenkins, a law professor from Ohio State University Moritz College of Law. Mr. Jenkins, whose appointment is subject to university approval, brings business experience as a former chief operating officer and general counsel of the Goldman Sachs Foundation. This summer, Mr. Wippman will leave Minnesota to become president of New York\u2019s Hamilton College, a private liberal arts school \u2014 another area of higher education that has been buffeted by declining student interest and lower enrollment.\u201cThings seem to be going well there,\u201d Mr. Wippman said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s hard to predict the new normal.\u201dAn article on Friday about the University of Minnesota Law School\u2019s decision not to lower its admission standards despite declining enrollment misstated the number of law schools in Minnesota. There are three, not four.Advertisement"}
