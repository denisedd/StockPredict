{"Headline": "Letters to the Editor", "Date": "2016-05-04", "News": "Supported byA Painful TaskTo the Editor:PENELOPE JOHNSONHAYDENVILLE, MASS.*Eat a PeachTo the Editor:J. R. SOLONCHEBLOOMING GROVE, N.Y.*Existentialists in America To the Editor:My father, Dagobert D. Runes, who founded Philosophical Library in 1941, was instrumental in, if not the essential force behind, bringing the key texts of French existentialism to the English-speaking world. In September 1946, he and Gaston Gallimard agreed that Philosophical Library would have exclusive English translation rights to \u201cBeing and Nothingness.\u201d The exigencies of the postwar years delayed their signing the final contract until November 1947, and because of the book\u2019s complexity, as well as, apparently, Sartre\u2019s involvement, the English-language edition did not appear for a number of years.Philosophical Library also released Simone de Beauvoir\u2019s eloquent defense of existentialism against charges of nihilism and amorality, \u201cThe Ethics of Ambiguity,\u201d in addition to several other books by Sartre. Runes also issued two volumes by Sartre\u2019s contemporary Martin Heidegger: \u201cEssays in Metaphysics\u201d comprised two late lectures; \u201cGerman Existentialism\u201d collected statements with which Heidegger irrefutably indicted himself as a willing supporter of National Socialism.Clearly, the vision of \u00e9migr\u00e9 publishers like my father, Jacques and Andr\u00e9 Schiffrin, Kurt Enoch and George Weidenfeld is an essential legacy.REGEEN RUNES KIERNAN-NAJARNEW YORKThe writer is publisher of the Philosophical Library.*Underrepresented To the Editor:This is especially true of contemporary young adult fiction. Just look at the reading lists: stories filled with despair, mental illness and violence. I don\u2019t believe that young adults should be shielded from these elements of existence, but why don\u2019t we create a more balanced picture? It is as if moral courage, kindness and joy do not really exist, or worse, that they are not really interesting, not the stuff of real life.I recently reread Rebecca Solnit\u2019s essay \u201c9/11\u2019s Living Monuments,\u201d based on interviews with survivors. For some reason, it had never struck me before that although thousands of people were caught in crumbling smoke-filled stairwells of the towers, no one stampeded over others. They walked down hundreds of darkened stairs, with immeasurable horror all around, some carrying disabled co-workers on their backs. Why don\u2019t we write young adult books about this?It is almost as if we try to keep examples of heroic decency to ourselves. There is every indication that given the challenges of the coming century, we should tell these stories over and over again, to build a narrative that young and old may remember when confronted with difficult choices.ADELE BARUCHGORHAM, ME.The writer is an associate professor at the University of Southern Maine.*To the Editor:Two words: happy endings.People buy romance novels, sci-fi and other genres because they know they will encounter no unhappiness, no depression, no angst, no killings, no family conflict, etc., the way they will in all of modern fiction. They know what to expect from these books, many of which are formulaic, but many display really good writing, too.It\u2019s as if there were some rule that literature cannot have happy endings because those other genres do and it would taint a true work of literature to have them. And readers know this.Similarly, writers know that they must include racism and feminism and the evils of capitalism because without them their books would be politically incorrect. And readers know this as well.So readers don\u2019t buy too many books they suspect are \u201cliterature.\u201d Have you noticed that?WILLIAM F. WALLACEBRANDON, MISS.*To the Editor:One underrepresented subject in contemporary fiction is assisted suicide. A historical novelist need look no further than Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cJulius Caesar,\u201d in which Brutus, unable to take his own life, asks his servant Strato to assist him: \u201cHold then my sword, and turn away thy face\u2009/\u2009While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?\u201d (Act V, Scene 5). Strato obliges. Given what Hilary Mantel did with Thomas Cromwell, one could imagine how she would treat this minor but significant figure by giving him a back story and imagining what might have happened to him after Brutus\u2019 death. It would be fascinating to read.BERNARD F.

{"Headline": "You\u2019ve Canceled the Wedding, Now the Aftermath", "Date": "2016-05-19", "News": "Supported byField NotesThe only rite of passage more stressful than wedding planning may be canceling a wedding. When a couple decides to break up after the invitations have been sent, the space has been reserved and the honeymoon booked, they face two tasks that can be as horrifying as ending the relationship itself: telling the guests and trying to recoup cash.Even though his parents had already planned to fly to New York and to see Ms. Becker, he said he was homesick for California. Then, Ms. Becker said, he told her, \u201c\u2018Well, maybe I\u2019m not ready to be married.\u2019\u201d\u201cHe had not indicated up until that point that he wasn\u2019t interested in getting married,\u201d she said. He quickly backtracked, she said, telling her he was having a bad day.But the next month, he left for a business trip and came back saying he was still confused. Friends and family members urged her to get out of the relationship. Instead, they decided to stay together, but to postpone the wedding.Wedding-bell jitters have long been material for Hollywood: the runaway bride in \u201cThe Graduate\u201d or the instantly regretful groom in \u201cThe Heartbreak Kid.\u201d But while cancelers of the past had doubts about their partners, today\u2019s millennials focus on the symbolism of marriage.\u201cA lot of my clients grapple with the transition to adulthood when they get engaged,\u201d said Christina Curtis, a New York City psychotherapist who was one of the creators of a premarital-coaching practice, Brooklyn Premarital, this year.\u201cA pending marriage brings up issues of personal identity, a re-examination of dreams you had for yourself, and ideas you have about the kind of person you are,\u201d Ms. Curtis said. \u201cIt distills your life. And because millennials feel like marriage is more optional, they\u2019re really examining whether it\u2019s the right choice.\u201dWhen Ms. Becker canceled, her parents called most of the guests. \u201cI told a few of my immediate best friends,\u201d she said, \u201cand they let the word trickle out.\u201dHer father got the deposit back from the Hilton Westchester in Rye Brook, N.Y. The videographer and photographer also returned deposits. Ms. Becker\u2019s ex-fianc\u00e9 recouped the Hawaii honeymoon fees (less a transaction fee) because it was booked with travel miles.They canceled their Crate & Barrel and Macy\u2019s registries and returned the gifts they had received. She wrote checks to those who had given her money at their engagement party (but no one cashed them).Not every vendor was cooperative; her mother could not get back the dress deposit from Kleinfeld Bridal. Months later, when the dress came in, the store called to schedule a fitting, and Ms. Becker reminded it that she was not getting married. When the shop where the bridesmaids dresses were purchased also refused to return deposit money, Ms. Becker reimbursed her attendants.Though she had learned about contracts in law school, Ms. Becker had signed a very bad one with the band. It included an acceleration clause, meaning the balance came due at the time of a breach. She pleaded with the band manager. \u201cHe told me, \u2018I hope this will never happen to my daughter,\u2019\u201d she said, \u201cand he said he would make an exception.\u201d They lost only the deposit.The 90-day mark is a crucial turning point; that\u2019s when many reception spaces and wedding planners require 50 percent of their fees. A San Diego-based planner, Courtney Tibbets, had a couple cancel 91 days before the wedding. \u201cIt was clear that they looked at their contract,\u201d she said, \u201cand calculated that they couldn\u2019t wait any longer.\u201dEve Sturges, 36, a therapist and writer in Los Angeles, canceled her wedding eight weeks before the date. She and her fianc\u00e9 were to marry on their daughter\u2019s first birthday in Petaluma, Calif., before 150 guests. But they began to argue over whether to have more children; she wanted to, and he didn\u2019t. When he suggested they postpone, she was relieved.She gave her parents a list of all of the vendors and guests. \u201cYou have to have family or social support when you\u2019re dealing with hard emotions,\u201d she said. The photographer and the florist allowed them to turn their deposits into a credits. \u201cWe sent flowers to people for a year with our $500 floral nonrefundable deposit,\u201d she said, and they used the photographer credit for family photos.To notify the guests, her mother sent handwritten postcards that read: \u201cThe wedding of Eve and Jim is postponed indefinitely. Thank you for your love and support.\u201d Ms. Sturges was happy with the wording. \u201cSomebody else I know canceled a wedding, and they sent a postcard that described the wedding as \u2018not happening.\u2019 That felt more loaded to me.\u201dEventually they decided to break up. Ms. Sturges consigned her wedding dress. She used the leftover ribbon and vellum for birthday-party invitations. The parents kept the wine, and the family depleted it over several years.Though a canceled wedding has always been a social embarrassment, today\u2019s weddings are often very public affairs, from the engagement through the honeymoon. Couples announce their engagement on social media and chronicle their reception-space booking, band hiring and hotel selection on Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram, Snapchat and their own wedding websites. Because of the voyeurism, guests can feel a right to know the cancellation back story.Tina Weber, 28, a video producer who lives in Union City, N.J., had announced her 2009 engagement on Facebook, soon after it offered the option to list life events. After she decided to cancel, her mother sent out cards to guests, but Ms. Weber heard little response until the day she changed her Facebook relationship status from \u201cengaged\u201d to \u201csingle.\u201d \u201cI got all these \u2018likes,\u2019 comments and messages,\u201d she said. \u201cSome guests wanted to know the reason.\u201dBut a bombshell announcement can also lead to interesting conversations. Ms. Sturges\u2019s boss at the time told her that many years earlier, she had annulled her marriage two days after the wedding. And Ms. Weber received an email from a high school friend who had learned of the broken engagement on Facebook. \u201cShe said she was in the same situation,\u201d Ms. Weber said, \u201cand was looking for words of support and advice.\u201dShe added, \u201cShe wanted to hear how I did it.\u201dWhile friends and families may be shocked, wedding planners usually take cancellations in stride. Ms. Tibbets, the wedding planner, said: \u201cBrides will tell me in one-on-one meetings: \u2018I\u2019m freaking out. Is this just wedding jitters?\u2019 Or else they start crying.\u201dMs. Tibbets has had nine cancellations in eight years in business. Couples seldom share the reason, though two brides cited infidelity. The only time Ms. Tibbets has made an exception to her refund policy (she requires a nonrefundable retainer ranging from $500 to $3,000 to secure a date) was when a military groom had to deploy.Though wedding insurance can cover unforeseen events like deployment, weather events and the closing of the reception space, only Wedsure, based in Toluca Lake, Calif., offers \u201cchange of heart\u201d as an add-on to its cancellation-postponement insurance. The coverage is extremely narrow: The wedding must be canceled at least 365 days before the date, and only an \u201cinnocent party financier,\u201d such as a parent, can make a claim, not a bride or groom.Wedsure\u2019s owner, Rob Nuccio, said the policy is narrow because of past misuse, \u201cor, as you might call it, fraud.\u201d\u201cWhen we started covering it in 2007,\u201d he said, \u201cwe offered it up to 120 days before the wedding, and we were getting claims from mothers of the bride who bought the insurance because they knew in advance that there was a problem.\u201dIn the ensuing years, Wedsure increased the minimum to 180, 270 and, finally, 365 days. \u201cOne woman canceled because her fianc\u00e9 was having an affair with her bridesmaid,\u201d Mr. Nuccio said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t covered. If the hotel had burned down, it would have been another story.\u201dWhen it\u2019s over, for some there is the worry that a canceled wedding can signal commitment-phobia to future paramours.On the date of her own canceled wedding, Ms. Becker, who eventually broke up with her fianc\u00e9, had been invited to a wedding of a summer-camp friend. She didn\u2019t want to go because she was so emotional about the date, but another friend, who had recently gone through his own breakup, persuaded her that they should go together. He is now her husband and the father to their 2-year-old son.Ms. Weber met Mike Carmelich, who is now her husband, at a party a few weeks after her canceled wedding. After taking the relationship extremely slowly, they became engaged. She logged onto Macys.com to start her registry and got the message, \u201cCongratulations, Tina and Johnny!\u201d She typed in Mr. Carmelich\u2019s name, changed the date and began to pick new items.For the wedding itself, in April 2015, she wore her unworn and nonreturnable Kleinfeld dress. It still fit. When she asked Mr. Carmelich if he minded, he said: \u201c \u2018Who cares? You never took it out of the box.\u2019 \u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Are You Laughing?", "Date": "2016-05-14", "News": "Supported byOVER the past month, I have analyzed what is probably the most comprehensive data set ever compiled on when and how people seek out laughter: our Google searches. This allowed me to look into ancient questions. Do we turn to humor because we are happy or sad?I thought we used humor to deal with the horror of human existence. Many famous comedians have experienced trauma and depression. Personally, I turn to comedy when I am unhappy. Granted, I\u2019m almost always miserable and almost always looking to laugh, so that doesn\u2019t tell us much.I am not alone in thinking pain and humor are connected. Soren Kierkegaard wrote, \u201cThe more one suffers, the more, I believe, has one a sense for the comic.\u201d Or as Charlie Chaplin put it, \u201cLaughter is the tonic, the relief, the surcease from pain.\u201d Mark Twain felt the same way: \u201cThe secret source of humor itself is not joy but sorrow. There is no humor in heaven.\u201dOur collective Google searches can\u2019t tell us whether pain and sorrow drive professional comedians, but the database does give some clues about the rest of us.There are many potential humor-related searches you can make \u2014 \u201cDaily Show clips,\u201d \u201cLouis C. K. stand-up,\u201d \u201cKnicks highlights.\u201d To keep it simple, I counted any search that included the word \u201cjokes,\u201d though I also checked the results against a broader set of searches.There are more than 100 million searches every year in the United States that include the word \u201cjokes.\u201d Americans make more searches for \u201cjokes\u201d than they do for \u201csweaters,\u201d \u201cwhiskey\u201d or \u201cvitamins.\u201dI looked first at searches for jokes by day of the week. Monday, psychological and sociological evidence suggests, is the most miserable day of the week. If we seek humor to alleviate suffering, we should search for jokes most frequently on Mondays.But Monday is actually the day we are least likely to search for jokes. Searches for jokes climb through the week and are highest on Friday through Sunday. This isn\u2019t because people are too busy with work or school on Mondays. Searches for \u201cdepression,\u201d \u201canxiety\u201d and \u201cdoctor\u201d are all highest on Mondays.Second, I compared searches for jokes to the weather. I did this for all searches in the New York City area over the past five years. Rain was a wash, but there were 6 percent fewer searches for jokes when it was below freezing. There were also 3 percent fewer searches for jokes on foggy days.Sure, some other entertainment searches, like \u201cmusic\u201d and \u201cshopping,\u201d also dropped after the bombing. Declines in these searches, however, were smaller than declines in searches for jokes, and some entertainment searches, like \u201cgames,\u201d actually rose during the manhunt.Google searches can also give us new clues on the content of jokes. Do people look for jokes that relate to the darkness and void of human existence? Sometimes, but not that often. About 53 percent of searches Americans make for jokes are for light or corny jokes \u2014 searches like \u201cfun jokes,\u201d \u201ckids jokes\u201d or \u201cdad jokes.\u201dAbout 29 percent are for vicious jokes \u2014 those making fun of other people. In the United States, the most common target of vicious jokes is African-Americans.The remainder of jokes \u2014 18 percent \u2014 directly deal with taboo subjects. Popular joke topics include physical deformity (\u201cHelen Keller jokes\u201d), uncomfortable subjects (\u201cpoop jokes\u201d) and inappropriate topics (\u201cdirty jokes\u201d).Perhaps the clearest evidence that jokes can be used to deal with taboo subjects is the popularity of \u201cdead baby jokes.\u201d In the United States, \u201cdead baby jokes\u201d are now the 13th most popular joke topic, with about 600,000 Google searches every year. Searches for \u201cdead baby jokes\u201d have nearly caught up in popularity to \u201cblonde jokes\u201d and are within an order of magnitude of \u201cknock knock jokes.\u201dInterestingly, Americans do not seem to seek out dark jokes even when they are suffering. Searches for jokes on uncomfortable topics are also lowest on Mondays. They also fell sharply after the Boston Marathon bombing.There is more evidence that distance from trauma is a necessary condition for joking about trauma. Return to \u201cdead baby jokes,\u201d but this time consider search rates around the world. The higher a country\u2019s infant mortality rate, the less it searches for \u201cdead baby jokes.\u201d In countries with the lowest infant mortality rates, 1 in 180 jokes searches is for \u201cdead baby jokes.\u201d In countries with the highest infant mortality rates, about 1 in 1,300 jokes searches is for \u201cdead baby jokes.\u201dIt is not clear exactly how to interpret this relationship, since Internet users in developing countries are not a representative sample. But the relationship is so strong, it does at least suggest that some exposure to a horror can substantially curtail jokes about it.Another interesting data point on the relationship between trauma and jokes is a search unusually popular among Hebrew speakers about one of history\u2019s most horrific events, which wiped out nearly half of my family. In Israel, \u201cHolocaust jokes\u201d is the 12th most popular Hebrew-language search for jokes.Holocaust jokes are extremely crude. An example \u2014 and this joke will disturb many readers: \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between a ton of coal and a thousand Jews? Jews burn longer.\u201dThe Google data shows that Jews seek out these jokes far more than anybody else. This seems to support a view of humor as helping people deal with extreme suffering and fear. But the timing of these searches reveals a more nuanced story.Hebrew-language searches for Holocaust jokes tend to be lowest when threats to Israel are highest. In June 2014, after three Israeli teenagers were kidnapped by Hamas operatives, Israelis\u2019 searches for Holocaust jokes dropped to their lowest level in more than five years.Our Google searches represent a small slice of how we consume humor. We also get laughs from TV shows, Facebook posts and even, I am told, face-to-face interaction. Other researchers will undoubtedly extend, clarify or overturn some of my findings.Even though these results are preliminary and sometimes contradictory, much of the data clearly does not fit with some traditional views of humor. Twain claims that there is no humor in heaven, and it may well be true that most comedians end up in hell. But if that\u2019s where they\u2019re headed, the joke will be on them. There is probably a greater demand for comedy in heaven.Advertisement"}

Raising tuition was not an option with so many students wary of taking on high debt. The school was also facing competition from others in its hometown.So the school opted for fewer students.

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "There is one thing we do not see in a compelling 1982 self-portrait by Dean Wong: his face. Taken in Seattle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Chinatown, the photograph zeroes in on the back of a metal helmet, polished to a mirrorlike finish. In it is reflected a crowd of neighborhood residents \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a metaphor for the people and hometown community that have shaped and fascinated Mr. Wong. The image appears in Mr. Wong\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new book, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSeeing the Light: Four Decades in Chinatown\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Chin Music Press), which centers on Seattle but includes images from other cities, including San Francisco, New York and Vancouver, British Columbia. Juxtaposing photographs with short, anecdotal essays, the book serves as a powerful corrective to decades of one-dimensional and blinkered reporting on neighborhoods generally represented in the cultural mainstream as exotic, insular or irrelevant, as places to order a quick meal or marvel at the colorful rituals of the Chinese New Year.The photos remind us that despite the stubborn, stereotypical view of Chinatowns as places of vibrant exoticism, they continue to serve an important social function as gateways and homes to new immigrants, as guardians of art, history and heritage, and as a refuge from discrimination. Mr. Wong does so not by creating a visual and verbal gloss, but rather by meticulously documenting the rituals of everyday life and focusing on personal stories, ordinary and extraordinary, of people largely ignored in mainstream media.A continuing exploration of the relationship of race to photographic portrayals of race by the professor and curator Maurice Berger.Mr. Wong started photographing Seattle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Chinese-American community in the early 1970s, while working for the International District Emergency Center, a grassroots neighborhood services organization. Later, as a photojournalist for the International Examiner, a Seattle-based Asian-American newspaper, he continued to focus on Chinatown. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI photographed meetings, did portraits, went to community celebrations, and roamed the streets of Chinatown looking for anything that caught my eye,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he later recalled. Among the many contributions of \u00e2\u0080\u009cSeeing the Light\u00e2\u0080\u009d is its eloquent documentation of complex and evolving communities, neighborhoods that exist not for tourists, but as cultural, political, and historic sanctuaries for the Asian-American community. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor me, Chinatown has been a kind of compass by which to find where I belong in this country,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the writer Bonnie Tsui observed in her groundbreaking book, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmerican Chinatown: A People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s History of Five Neighborhoods.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cI haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always felt at ease in my identity as a Chinese-American, and as a young adult it was comforting to know that there was a place I could go in my city where everyone else looked like me.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIf \u00e2\u0080\u009cSeeing the Light\u00e2\u0080\u009d affirms the role of Chinese-American communities in empowering a people, their history has been fraught, complicated by racism, xenophobia and, more recently, the threats of urban renewal and gentrification. In the mid-19th century, Chinese migration to the United States began when natural catastrophes across China inspired some of its more intrepid citizens to go to Gum Shan, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGold Mountain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Chinese nickname for California, and the western regions of North America, stoked by news of gold-rich land and economic opportunity. But as the economy weakened in the United States, the Chinese labor force came to be viewed by white Californians as a threat. Racism and repressive legislation drove Chinese-Americans to self-segregate and form a sanctuary neighborhood in San Francisco: a so-called Chinatown, where close-knit families and benevolent associations sustained a spurned minority. As new businesses thrived within this community, however, the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s white residents continued to view Chinese-Americans as a danger to the region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fragile economy. It was not until the mid-20th century that Chinese-Americans began to enter the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mainstream, with Chinatowns in cities as diverse as New York, Seattle, Washington, Los Angeles and Boston flourishing. But in recent years, gentrification has encroached on some communities, outpricing many Asian-Americans from neighborhoods that had served as cultural havens for decades. At its peak, for example, Chinatown in the District of Columbia was once home to about 3,000 Chinese-Americans. That number has dwindled to 300. In light of this history, Mr. Wong\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vignettes and photographs \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including images of community activism, local businesses and organizations, political leaders, children playing, celebratory rituals and, on a more personal level, reminiscences about his family and student life \u00e2\u0080\u0094 speak to the cultural nuances, complexity and necessity of Chinatown, well beyond the touristic fascination with swirling paper dragons, countless restaurants and trinket shops. In a section titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople,\u00e2\u0080\u009d for example, Mr. Wong photographed and wrote about a range of Chinatown residents, some of them artists in their own right: the Japanese-American photographer Henry Takayoshi, for example, a reminder not only of Chinatown\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cultural diversity but also of the non-Chinese Asian-Americans who have gravitated to its precincts; Ryan Rhinehart, a gay Korean-born drag queen, who died of AIDS in the mid-1990s; Sun Yang, a Seattle artist whose early paintings were of landscapes near his hometown, Anhui, in central east China; Eun-Gyong Lee, legally blind since birth, who daily navigated the bustling metropolis of Seattle; and the sculptor Meng Huang, who transformed the detritus of daily life \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the things people had literally thrown away \u00e2\u0080\u0094 into dynamic assemblages.The overall effect of \u00e2\u0080\u009cSeeing the Light\u00e2\u0080\u009d is to illuminate the cultural uniqueness and social consequence of Chinatown, both historically and in recent years.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat I take away from Chinatown when I leave \u2026 is a sharpened sense of why Chinatown still matters,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Tsui observed in words relevant to Mr. Wong\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important book, adding: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter a century and a half of Chinese immigration, Chinatown can still be the first step for new immigrants into America, and for American-born Chinese into their Chinese heritage. Their personal stories are narrative epics; by reading them, we find out what Chinatown means to its people at present. And by looking behind, we also get a sense of what may lie ahead, beyond its borders.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMaurice Berger is a research professor and the chief curator at the Center for Art, Design and Visual Culture at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County."}

But its approach, said Julie Samuels, the executive director, will be to work early with city, state and federal officials on issues that affect tech companies, before laws are passed. Some broader issues like taxes, schools and affordable housing also help determine whether people want to work and live in a city.\u201cNew York is in a competition to be where start-ups are going to locate and bigger tech companies are going to grow second and third offices,\u201d Ms. Samuels said.The new organization arrives at a time when the path ahead for the local tech economy is uncertain. New York, it seems, has become fertile ground for start-ups, but has very few breakout winners.Silicon Valley venture firms suffered some of the biggest losses on those New York start-ups.Start-ups are inherently risky. That is why venture capital firms invest in a broad portfolio of companies, so a few winners can make up for the losers.In New York, it is not the setbacks that stand out as much as the scarcity of lucrative paydays \u2014 start-ups sold to the public or to other corporations for $1 billion or more.There have been a few over the years. In 2007, for example, Google paid $3.1 billion for DoubleClick, an online ad-serving service. In 2013, Yahoo bought Tumblr, a microblogging platform, for $1.1 billion. Last year, Etsy, an online marketplace for handmade and vintage goods, went public at a valuation of $1.8 billion, and traded above that for a while but has since retreated.Yet those are exceptions. \u201cBig exits really haven\u2019t happened yet in New York,\u201d said Fred Wilson, co-founder of Union Square Ventures, a New York venture capital firm. \u201cIt\u2019s a valid criticism.\u201dThat should gradually change, he argued, as the New York tech community matures. Mr. Wilson also said that New York entrepreneurs were influenced by the trading culture of Wall Street. They are more inclined, he said, to build a company, sell it, cash in and move to the next one than some Silicon Valley entrepreneurs who dream bigger and view their company as their life\u2019s work.New York ranked second over all, but was way behind by some measures. Compass estimated the value of all Bay Area start-ups \u2014 including sales to companies, public offerings and private valuations \u2014 at $264 billion to $323 billion. The comparable estimate for New York start-ups was $41 billion to $50 billion.Still, the New York tech economy has shown impressive job growth. An analysis by Jason Bram, a researcher at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, concluded that from 2007 to 2015 New York tech employment grew by more than 60 percent, to 126,170 workers. By contrast, tech employment in the Bay Area was more than 370,000 as of 2014, the most recent figure in the Fed analysis.The gap is hardly surprising, given Silicon Valley\u2019s decades-long head start and singular focus. \u201cTechnology innovation and entrepreneurship \u2014 that\u2019s our business in the Valley,\u201d said Steve Blank, an entrepreneur who lectures on technology and innovation at Stanford, Columbia and New York University.In New York, Mr. Blank said, \u201ctech start-ups have been layered on top of the city\u2019s existing industries,\u201d including advertising, media and finance.And tech giants like Facebook, Google and IBM have been aggressively hiring engineering talent for their New York outposts.Nathan Richardson, chief executive of Trade It, a financial technology start-up in New York, has worked in the Bay Area and in New York. Until recently, New York was regarded in Silicon Valley as a place to find business, advertising and web design talent.\u201cBut you didn\u2019t recruit engineers in New York,\u201d Mr. Richardson said. \u201cThat\u2019s changed dramatically.\u201dSprinklr works closely with the New York advertising and marketing community. \u201cWe\u2019re an ideal company to be here,\u201d said Ragy Thomas, its founder and chief executive. His start-up has raised $125 million in venture funding and is valued at $1 billion.So Infor was destined to relocate, and since it had hundreds of developers in the Bay Area, the board assumed the move would be there. \u201cThey thought I was crazy choosing New York, but they went along with it,\u201d recalled Mr. Phillips, once a senior executive at Oracle.New York, he figured, was closer to many of its corporate customers, making in-person meetings more convenient. And because Infor\u2019s software was being overhauled for ease of use, he has hired software developers from New York advertising companies and fashion houses as well as the Parsons School of Design and the Fashion Institute of Technology.\u201cWe\u2019ve picked up some great programmers who understand design,\u201d Mr. Phillips said. \u201cAnd I wanted my engineers to be around people who weren\u2019t all engineers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

We\u2019re fine with people who don\u2019t look like us, as long as they think like us.O.K., that\u2019s a little harsh. But consider George Yancey, a sociologist who is black and evangelical.\u201cOutside of academia I faced more problems as a black,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut inside academia I face more problems as a Christian, and it is not even close.\u201d\u201cMuch of the \u2018conservative\u2019 worldview consists of ideas that are known empirically to be false,\u201d said Carmi.\u201cThe truth has a liberal slant,\u201d wrote Michelle.\u201cWhy stop there?\u201d asked Steven. \u201cHow about we make faculties more diverse by hiring idiots?\u201dTo me, the conversation illuminated primarily liberal arrogance \u2014 the implication that conservatives don\u2019t have anything significant to add to the discussion. My Facebook followers have incredible compassion for war victims in South Sudan, for kids who have been trafficked, even for abused chickens, but no obvious empathy for conservative scholars facing discrimination.The stakes involve not just fairness to conservatives or evangelical Christians, not just whether progressives will be true to their own values, not just the benefits that come from diversity (and diversity of thought is arguably among the most important kinds), but also the quality of education itself. When perspectives are unrepresented in discussions, when some kinds of thinkers aren\u2019t at the table, classrooms become echo chambers rather than sounding boards \u2014 and we all lose.Four studies found that the proportion of professors in the humanities who are Republicans ranges between 6 and 11 percent, and in the social sciences between 7 and 9 percent.In contrast, some 18 percent of social scientists say they are Marxist. So it\u2019s easier to find a Marxist in some disciplines than a Republican.The discrimination becomes worse if the applicant is an evangelical Christian. According to Yancey\u2019s study, 59 percent of anthropologists and 53 percent of English professors would be less likely to hire someone they found out was an evangelical.\u201cOf course there are biases against evangelicals on campuses,\u201d notes Jonathan L. Walton, the Plummer Professor of Christian Morals at Harvard. Walton, a black evangelical, adds that the condescension toward evangelicals echoes the patronizing attitude toward racial minorities: \u201cThe same arguments I hear people make about evangelicals sound so familiar to the ways people often describe folk of color, i.e. politically unsophisticated, lacking education, angry, bitter, emotional, poor.\u201d\u201cI am the equivalent of someone who was gay in Mississippi in 1950,\u201d a conservative professor is quoted as saying in \u201cPassing on the Right,\u201d a new book about right-wing faculty members by Jon A. Shields and Joshua M. Dunn Sr. That\u2019s a metaphor that conservative scholars often use, with talk of remaining in the closet early in one\u2019s career and then \u201ccoming out\u201d after receiving tenure.This bias on campuses creates liberal privilege. A friend is studying for the Law School Admission Test, and the test preparation company she is using offers test-takers a tip: Reading comprehension questions will typically have a liberal slant and a liberal answer.Some liberals think that right-wingers self-select away from academic paths in part because they are money-grubbers who prefer more lucrative professions. But that doesn\u2019t explain why there are conservative math professors but not many right-wing anthropologists.\u201cUniversities are unlike other institutions in that they absolutely require that people challenge each other so that the truth can emerge from limited, biased, flawed individuals,\u201d he says. \u201cIf they lose intellectual diversity, or if they develop norms of \u2018safety\u2019 that trump challenge, they die. And this is what has been happening since the 1990s.\u201dShould universities offer affirmative action for conservatives and evangelicals? I don\u2019t think so, partly because surveys find that conservative scholars themselves oppose the idea. But it\u2019s important to have a frank discussion on campuses about ideological diversity. To me, this seems a liberal blind spot.Universities should be a hubbub of the full range of political perspectives from A to Z, not just from V to Z. So maybe we progressives could take a brief break from attacking the other side and more broadly incorporate values that we supposedly cherish \u2014 like diversity \u2014 in our own dominions.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "John McEnroe a Coach? You Cannot Be Serious!", "Date": "2016-05-29", "News": "Supported byOn TennisPARIS \u2014 Milos Raonic went down in straight sets at the French Open on Sunday to the Spanish outsider Albert Ramos-Vi\u00f1olas in the sort of cool, overcast and heavy conditions that attacking players have learned to rue on the red clay of Roland Garros.Bring on the grass-court season, and the big-hitting Raonic, already a contender, will be much more of a conversation piece than usual.Raonic, a Canadian, has hired John McEnroe as a coaching consultant, which means headlines and camera flashes galore before Raonic, ranked No. 9 in the world, so much as smacks one huge serve in anger at the All England Club in late June.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s been able to do as well as certainly someone with his game could do, and I think he could win it,\u201d McEnroe said of Raonic\u2019s chances at Wimbledon, where he reached the semifinals in 2014 but has never been past the third round otherwise. \u201cHopefully I can add that little bit and give him a little bit better understanding of how to take advantage of his attributes, his size. He\u2019s a big strong, great, dedicated and smart kid.\u201dAnd yet for a deeply rational young man like Raonic, who likes to be the boss, hiring McEnroe is a surprising move, all the more so because he already had two coaches in Riccardo Piatti, an Italian considered one of the game\u2019s better technicians, and Carlos Moy\u00e1, a Spaniard who, like McEnroe, was once No. 1.Could too many top chefs spoil the bouillabaisse?\u201cAt the end of the day, every coach I have is to some extent an adviser,\u201d Raonic said after his 6-2, 6-4, 6-4 defeat in the fourth round. \u201cAnd it\u2019s my job personally, out of everything I hear, to weigh what it\u2019s worth and weigh what is best for me. I\u2019m the C.E.O. of Milos Raonic Tennis. That\u2019s it.\u201dA former superstar who decides to coach is now on a well-blazed trail in tennis. It began with Jimmy Connors coaching Andy Roddick in the 2000s and began in earnest with Ivan Lendl helping Andy Murray end Britain\u2019s Wimbledon singles drought in 2013.Others have piled in, including Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo, Martina Navratilova (very briefly), Michael Chang, Goran Ivanisevic and McEnroe\u2019s former rivals Stefan Edberg and Boris Becker, with Becker helping Novak Djokovic strengthen his grip on the men\u2019s game.But none of these tennis luminaries has had quite the media footprint at the time of their appointment as McEnroe. He is the most prominent English-language voice in the sport as a commentator and is still, at 57, a bigger magnet than most of today\u2019s contenders, including Raonic. He announced his own hiring during his daily show on Eurosport at Roland Garros, delivering the news as a lyric while strumming a guitar.\u201cI thought that was a different way to announce it, because I don\u2019t do social media; don\u2019t tweet, do Facebook, any of it,\u201d he said when we spoke on Sunday. \u201cI actually prefer talking to people.\u201dBut can McEnroe really sublimate his ego and put himself at the service of a 25-year-old player?\u201cI think so; I mean I hope so,\u201d McEnroe said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we are going to find out. I\u2019m hoping this is not a one-shot thing. I think it would be incredibly difficult to make an impact that quickly. I think it\u2019s a process.\u201dMcEnroe remains a bundle of nervous energy: shifting in his chair and folding and unfolding his arms repeatedly in the sparsely decorated NBC office at the French Open. He does have recent coaching experience as the eponymous director of his academy on Randalls Island in New York and offering occasional counsel to young American prospects like Noah Rubin.His coaching r\u00e9sum\u00e9 on tour is not nearly so up-to-date. There was an informal arrangement with Becker in 1993 shortly after McEnroe retired. McEnroe was also the United States Davis Cup captain for one season in 2000.\u201cBoris asked me to work with him between Wimbledon and the U.S. Open in 1993, and it\u2019s a long story and pretty humorous, but basically, he didn\u2019t listen to a word I said,\u201d McEnroe said.\u201cI was going through a divorce; he was going through this fight with Tiriac,\u201d McEnroe said, referring to Becker\u2019s former agent Ion Tiriac. \u201cSo the tennis part suddenly seemed to become secondary. But the idea was good.\u201dFor most of the last 20 years, the timing seemed wrong to McEnroe (or his personality seemed too strong for contemporary stars to bring him on board), but he sounded genuinely eager now for at least a part-time role.\u201cOnly one of my six kids is still at the house, and I\u2019m not getting any younger,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the former players coming in has been great for the sport and especially for some of the players like Boris. I think it was a great move, and it turned out to be a win-win.\u201dMcEnroe also praised Moya\u2019s work with Raonic.\u201cThe best I\u2019ve ever seen Milos play was this year at the Australian,\u201d he said of Raonic\u2019s attack-minded run to the Australian Open semifinals in January. \u201cI really felt he was playing the style of play in order to get into these top guys\u2019 heads and potentially take it to that next level.\u201dMcEnroe and Raonic have mutual friends in the family of Jann Wenner, the founder of Rolling Stone, and have gotten to know each other away from the courts.\u201cI was sort of just looking for another set of eyes to be a bit more efficient on grass,\u201d said Raonic, who emphasized that it was also about \u201cgenerally improving.\u201dMcEnroe was one of the game\u2019s great volleyers and won three Wimbledon singles titles. Moya never got past the fourth round, and Ivan Ljubicic, who had previously helped coach Raonic, never got past the third.Perhaps that consulting fee will be money well-spent, after all, even if the odds of a long-term gig have to be viewed as long with all the alpha males involved.\u201cThey just need clarity of roles and responsibilities, and John can be a tremendous added value; the message just has to be unified to Milos,\u201d said Paul Annacone, the former coach of Pete Sampras and Roger Federer. \u201cJohn can help Milos get more comfortable coming forward and finishing at net.\u201dMcEnroe got a head start in Paris: attending practice on Saturday and sitting next to Moya in the players box on the Suzanne Lenglen Court on Sunday for the first two sets as Raonic was gradually enmeshed in the unseeded Ramos-Vi\u00f1olas\u2019s web.\u201cBelieve me, I know what it\u2019s like to get sucked into playing the type of game you don\u2019t want to play and proving something you don\u2019t need to prove, so I really felt for him,\u201d McEnroe said.The results did not improve after McEnroe left to fulfill his television duties. There will be more such multitasking during Wimbledon along with plenty of camera flashes. But first come the practice court and the grass court tournament at Queen\u2019s Club. Let the cross-border consulting project begin.\u201cIf not an American, a Canadian, a North American brother,\u201d said McEnroe, arms folded, with a slightly nervous chuckle.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Search for Family\u2019s Lost History Leads to Mass Grave in Poland", "Date": "2016-05-04", "News": "Supported byWhen Michael Pomeranc was growing up in the mid-1960s in Rego Park, Queens, his parents and their friends spent countless evenings discussing their harrowing experiences in World War II. All were survivors of the Holocaust, and Mr. Pomeranc often saw them chain-smoking and crying late into the night. The absence of anything tangible from their histories plagued him most.\u201cNot having the ability to understand where everybody went was very, very traumatizing,\u201d Mr. Pomeranc, 58, a prominent New York City hotelier, said recently as he sat in the lobby of his hotel, Sixty SoHo. \u201cWhat happened to the cemeteries of my great-grandparents? Where are my grandparents and my aunts? Can you go there? Would you see anything? It was like they were talking in an abyss.\u201dIn January, Dr. Sturdy Colls, an associate professor of forensic archaeology and genocide investigation at Staffordshire University in England, published the first full-scale investigation of Adampol. According to her findings, as many as 1,000 Jewish victims are buried there in mass graves, beneath farmland, woodland, rubbish heaps and a shooting range. Because of Mr. Pomeranc, efforts are now underway to erect a monument and protect the site from development.\u201cAdampol is significant,\u201d said Paul Shapiro, the director of the Jack, Joseph and Morton Mandel Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington. \u201cTo really know \u2014 not to guess \u2014 where these sites are is huge. And of course that poses the question: Once we know, what will the world do about it?\u201d\u201cThe reality is that today, in some little town, someone decides to build a supermarket and when they go to dig, they find human remains,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. \u201cUnless something is done, you have the prospect of the remains of the victims of the Holocaust simply strewn across the European continent, and ultimately, built on top of.\u201dPreserving an area for remembrance can be a complex process that necessitates cooperation from local authorities and the Polish government. The chief rabbi of Poland, Michael Schudrich, who must also sign off, is currently reviewing the Adampol findings.\u201cAdampol was a horrible catastrophe, and yet no one has ever heard of it,\u201d said Helen Maryles Shankman, who lives in Teaneck, N.J.For Arie Hochberg, who was born just after the war in Lublin, a town to the south of Adampol, the discovery offers a flicker of hope. \u201cIt is very possible that my grandmother and aunts and uncles were buried there,\u201d said Mr. Hochberg, who lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.Adampol featured a landed estate owned by a Polish prince, which was converted during the war into a slave labor camp. Jews worked the estate\u2019s fields and slept in its barns and stables. At first, Jews from the surrounding areas flocked to Adampol, driven by the mistaken notion that it would be safer than staying in the towns and ghettos where executions and deportation to the nearby Sobibor death camp were increasingly common. Like many others, the Pomeranc family, including Jack, his parents and five of his siblings, sought refuge there (an older sister, Chaja, had earlier fled to Belarus).Adampol turned out to be far from the safe haven the Pomeranc family had hoped. The conditions of the camp were undeniably harsh, with endless hours of manual labor and meager food rations. The constant threat of mass shootings was most terrifying.\u201cWe were afraid every minute of every day,\u201d Jack Pomeranc said. \u201cEvery few months there were shootings. We never knew when. They would suddenly appear and everyone would try running and hiding. We were lucky the woods were nearby.\u201dIn those woods, which were large and deep and still border the town of Adampol, hid a ragtag group of Jewish partisan fighters. The young men and women, starving and poorly armed, raided farmhouses in search of food and supplies and conducted missions to free fellow Jews. Jack and his older brother Jurek often sneaked out of the camp and stayed with the partisans.In September 1943, Jurek and his cousin returned to Adampol for Abram, Jack\u2019s 8-year-old brother. Before the boys could return to the woods, another mass shooting began. They scrambled to safety but their parents and two youngest sisters, who were probably ages 3 and 4, were shot and thrown into shallow graves.Jack survived the war, but those he lost were never far from his mind. \u201cWe were not the typical American family,\u201d said Michael Pomeranc, who recounted the family stories Jack had told him. \u201cWhen my father came home from work and would see all of us around the dinner table, he would get very emotional. We lived two lives \u2014 the public life and the private one.\u201dTo provide a modicum of healing for his father and some resolution for himself, Mr. Pomeranc set out to uncover as much as he could about the family. He searched for birth certificates, school papers and other personal documents. He hired researchers to interview townspeople in Adampol and villages where his family lived before the war. He offered rewards \u2014 no questions asked \u2014 if they returned items that had once belonged to Jews. He unearthed a few photographs, but nothing more.Then Mr. Pomeranc hired Dr. Sturdy Colls, who had conducted similar research at Treblinka, a Nazi extermination camp in Poland. Because Jewish law forbids disturbing the dead, archaeological excavations of Holocaust sites is not possible. Instead, she combed through thousands of pages of postwar trials, witness testimonies and government papers, unearthing stories of camp life and the murders that occurred there.She visited Adampol, hoping to spot evidence with her naked eye, and was successful: \u201cNext to one of the buildings someone had dug a pit for a drain pipe and in the soil there were burned bone fragments that were quite easy to see, and you could see there were additional bones, so it was likely they were scattered,\u201d she said.Dr. Sturdy Colls also employed advanced technologies like light detection and ranging, or lidar, which shoots pulsed-laser beams from sensors mounted on aircraft or satellites to measure the height of the ground surface, and produced detailed three-dimensional maps. She uncovered several large depressions indicating mass graves and one area where the graves were perfectly aligned in straight rows. \u201cI think there could be in the region of 800 to 1,000 mass graves, but it could be more,\u201d she said.While Dr. Sturdy Colls has finished her report, Mr. Pomeranc would like her to go back to Adampol to uncover more definitive proof of the grave sites. But first they must obtain Rabbi Schudrich\u2019s approval.\u201cPeople wonder, why dig so deep into this past?\u201d Mr. Pomeranc said. \u201cThe truth is, we never left the past. We\u2019ve never entirely been able to leave the death camps, and the partisans and the forests behind.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Roger Federer Withdraws From French Open Because of Injury", "Date": "2016-05-19", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 Roger Federer withdrew from this year\u2019s French Open on Thursday, putting an end to one of tennis\u2019s most remarkable streaks.The last time Federer, 34, did not take part in the main draw in singles at a Grand Slam event was in the last millennium. That was in August 1999, when he lost in the second round of the qualifying tournament at the United States Open to a fellow Swiss, Ivo Heuberger.\u201cI have been making steady progress with my overall fitness, but I am still not 100 percent and feel I might be taking an unnecessary risk by playing in this event before I am really ready,\u201d Federer, who is ranked third, said in a statement Thursday. \u201cThe decision was not easy to make, but I took it to ensure I could play the remainder of the season and help to extend the rest of my career. I remain as motivated and excited as ever.\u201dFederer did not cite a specific injury in his withdrawal statement. His remarkable longevity has been grounded in sound technique, serious preparation, intelligent scheduling and an attacking mind-set and skill set that have allowed him to keep rallies shorter than most of his rivals have been able to.But his health has become a major concern during a deflating season in which he has played in only four tournaments and won 11 of 15 matches.\u201cThis is sad, but it\u2019s also smart,\u201d Paul Annacone, Federer\u2019s former coach, said of the decision to withdraw. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a really busy next few months.\u201dAnnacone added: \u201cHe\u2019s wrestled Father Time to a stalemate so far, and I hope he can keep Father Time in check a little while longer. But we all know who\u2019s undefeated.\u201dFederer had surgery on his left knee on Feb. 3 \u2014 the first operation of his career \u2014 after tearing the meniscus while running a bath for his twin daughters shortly after losing in the semifinals of the Australian Open. His back problems \u2014 long-running but long manageable \u2014 also have flared up, forcing him to withdraw from the Madrid tournament this month.\u201cI saw a lot of it in 2013,\u201d Annacone said. \u201cWhen Roger\u2019s back is not right, I can see when he\u2019s going out for wide balls and trying to protect it a little bit. It\u2019s hard to play like that, just really hard, and I think more times than not you end up hurting yourself more.\u201dAfter the loss to Thiem, Federer said he was not certain he would play at Roland Garros. As it turned out, he was only able to practice, traveling to Paris and training briefly on the red clay at the stadium on Wednesday.Guy Forget, the new French Open tournament director, said Ivan Ljubicic, Federer\u2019s coach, had made a preliminary request for Federer not to play his first-round match until Tuesday, which is the last day reserved for first-round singles play at Roland Garros.\u201cI told him, of course, we\u2019d try to do the most we could, depending where he ended up in the draw,\u201d Forget said. \u201cWhen a player asks for this kind of thing, it shows that each day counts.\u201dDarren Cahill, the ESPN analyst who is coaching Simona Halep, said the cool and clammy weather in Paris this week had probably not helped Federer\u2019s chances.\u201cBeen coming here many years, never felt it so cold on court like it was today,\u201d Cahill said Thursday. \u201cThe weather makes it tough for anyone with a back issue, or any issue, for that matter. Roger\u2019s made a career of making smart, educated decisions, so I\u2019m sure he\u2019s doing the right thing.\u201cWatching him in Rome, he was always going to be iffy here, considering it now means five-set battles. He knows his body. He knows the risk and potential setbacks to the grass-court season if there\u2019s a hiccup in Paris. It seems like the right move if he\u2019s not near 100 percent.\u201dWhile his rivals focus on clay, Federer will shift his attention to grass and the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, where he plans to chase his first gold medal in singles.\u201cGiven his chances at Wimbledon are far greater than Roland Garros, this would seem to be a wise choice,\u201d said Jim Courier, the United States Davis Cup captain and two-time French Open champion. \u201cIt\u2019s a busy summer, with the Olympics added to the mix this year, so there is a lot of meaningful tennis ahead for him.\u201dIn preparation for Wimbledon, which he has won seven times, Federer has entered the grass-court event in Stuttgart, Germany, for the first time and is also expected to play, as usual, at the tournament in Halle, Germany. But respecting that schedule depends on Federer\u2019s ability to recover.\u201cMy plan is to achieve the highest level of fitness before returning to the ATP World Tour for the upcoming grass-court season,\u201d he said in his statement.It has been nearly 17 years. Federer\u2019s record, like many tennis records, is difficult to compare across eras. The greats of the pre-Open era rarely stayed amateurs for long and were thus ineligible to play in the Grand Slam tournaments for long. The greats of the early Open era often skipped the Australian Open. But Federer\u2019s mark still merits an exclamation point in a period during which the game has become faster and more physical.\u201cPeople go, \u2018Great, 65 in a row,\u2019 but if you really want to know how good that is, think about how much tennis Roger has played in those 65,\u201d Annacone said. \u201cHow many times has he been in the quarters, semis and finals?\u201dFederer is three ahead of Ai Sugiyama, the women\u2019s leader, who played in 62 straight major singles tournaments from 1994 to 2009. Federer is nine ahead of the closest men: Wayne Ferreira and Feliciano L\u00f3pez, who are tied at 56.Ferreira, the former South African star, is long retired, but L\u00f3pez, a flashy Spanish left-hander, is ranked No. 23 and entered in the French Open. If he plays, he will break his tie with Ferreira, but he would need to play singles in every major tournament through Wimbledon in 2018 to break Federer\u2019s record.That is far from a sure thing. L\u00f3pez, like Federer, is 34. The threat to Federer\u2019s mark is more likely to come from younger players, including the 30-year-old Tomas Berdych, who is about to play in his 51st straight major, or Djokovic, who will turn 29 on Sunday and is about to play in his 46th in a row.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Letter of Recommendation: B.F.F. Tattoos", "Date": "2016-05-25", "News": "Supported byLetter of RecommendationThe story of my first tattoo goes like this: One night in middle school, my friend Stephanie spent the night at my house. We were camped out in my bedroom and bored. We had watched \u201cClueless\u201d so many times that we could recite all the best lines. Food had been ordered, delivered and devoured. We prank-\u00adcalled all the cute boys in our class and even some of the not-so-cute ones. One of us suggested, half-\u00adjokingly, that we give each other matching tattoos, something discreet enough to hide from our parents but accessible enough to show off at school come Monday.I was scared, but as the youngest of five girls, I was familiar with the power of rituals \u2014 the way a shared secret between women can be its own kind of power. Abstinence was not an option. I watched as Stephanie used a Bic lighter to heat up and \u2014 theoretically \u2014 sterilize a safety pin before dipping it in ink. I stuck out my chubby ankle and closed my eyes as she began poking the tender meat of my leg in an uneven staccato pattern.When she was done, I leaned over to admire her handiwork: a patchy approximation of a heart, fashioned out of eight or nine dots, seared into my left ankle. Then I did the same to her. Afterward, I felt giddy, buoyed by a new realization: My body was mine to do with what I liked. The thought was instantly addicting, as was the way the tattoo tightened the bond between me and Stephanie. We had matching tattoos, which basically meant we were sisters.A few years later, I got another one. And another. In all, I\u2019ve gotten six best-friend tattoos, always in pairs, always with someone whose relationship I wanted to commemorate at a particular moment. There\u2019s the pair of triangles on my wrist that I share with a friend, intended to symbolize \u2014 perhaps paradoxically \u2014 the inevitability of change. There\u2019s the wreath I paid a tattoo artist $60 to lay on my inner arm \u2014 a tribute to the flowers I\u2019m rarely able to leave by my father\u2019s gravestone. I got that one with a friend who had recently lost his grandmother; his was a series of boxes in the same spot on his body, a coded tribute to her. Another friend I knew from college in Virginia decided that we needed matching sets of daggers on our outer ribs, both because they would look good peeking out from a tank top that summer and because they would serve as protective amulets against the unrelenting crush of the city we\u2019d moved to after graduation.Getting a tattoo is arguably one of the most insane decisions a sensible human can make. A sharp needle made up of much smaller needles hammers into your skin up to 3,000 times a minute, punching through skin, blood and collagen fibers, in order to deposit enough ink to leave a permanent mark. But not too permanent; tattoos inevitably deteriorate over the years, as the ink migrates or breaks down and the skin loses some of its tautness, slowly melting the design into a smeared photocopy of the original. Over each tattoo hovers a cloud of doubt.All of these elements \u2014 the danger, the fear, the foolishness, even the pain \u2014 contribute to the thrill, which doubles when you persuade someone to do it with you. There\u2019s nothing that reinforces a bad choice like doing it in the company of another. It makes the deed easier to rationalize, both in the moment and in the seconds, hours, years to come after it is done.And best-friend tattoos require so much prep work, which adds to their legitimacy. First, a friendship must be deep enough to warrant the rite; then the perfect symbol must be found to forge the bond. Instagram and Pinterest are awash in ideas: Beavis and Butt-Head, two halves of an avocado, yins and yangs that nestle when two arms are pressed together. A guy I know from Arizona recently texted me a photo of a ruffled roaring cougar\u2019s head stamped on his upper thigh, something he got with his friends the last time he was home. Another told me about the Venn-\u00addiagram tattoo that she shares with her closest friend. During a rough patch in their relationship, she caught sight of the overlapping circles and remembered the love that had led her to permanently alter her body, easing the friction.Matching tattoos don\u2019t ensure the longevity of a friendship, any more than any other mutual hardship. I\u2019ve since grown more distant from all of the people I\u2019ve been inked with over the past two decades. Nothing catastrophic happened. There were no unforgivable betrayals. It was simply the natural tectonic shifts that occur as people move through life and drift apart. I\u2019m not even in touch with the girl who gave me that first lopsided heart tattoo, though I get occasional glimpses of her life on Facebook. As for the pinpricks she gave me, they\u2019re still visible \u2014 but just barely.I don\u2019t regret any of the ink. When I look at it, I smile and think about the feverish throes of friend-love and how lucky I was to have felt it more than once. Recently a friend asked me to get a tattoo with her \u2014 a lightning bolt, or something similar, to symbolize how we invigorate each other with a neon-white energy. I hesitated at first: What if the same thing happens? What if we ultimately go through with it, only to move apart? But it feels worse to let a love go unrecognized. Instead, I choose to paint a time capsule onto my body that represents the ferocity of a feeling \u2014 one too rare to go unacknowledged.Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s easier for constructors sometimes, and if you have an otherwise lively and high-quality sector, it\u2019s sometimes worth the tradeoff.\u2013 40A\u2019s \u201cMate 4 life?\u201d looks like an odd clue for two reasons: There\u2019s that number 4 and the use of the word \u201cmate.\u201d Some species mate for life, but that\u2019s not where this clue is going. In this case, the word \u201cmate\u201d is meant to indicate a friend or pal and using the number 4 indicates that we should be thinking in terms of \u2018textspeak.\u2019 The answer today is BFF, or Best Friend Forever.A very nice start to our solving weekend, Mr. House. Let\u2019s hear what he has to say about his puzzle:I had a lot of fun making this puzzle. I love the string of consonants in EGG MCMUFFIN, so I put that in the center and worked in the two long down answers. From there, it was a matter of seeding the bigger corners with interesting entries and building it out. My favorite part of the puzzle is the upper left corner, and I love the (accidental) placement of AROMARAMA next to ACHOO. I imagine a lot of sneezing going on as the different scents were sent wafting through the movie theater. I hope everyone enjoys the puzzle!Your thoughts?FollowAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Jersey Manhunt Continues for Prison Escapee", "Date": "2016-05-05", "News": "Supported byAn inmate on the verge of parole eligibility was on the run on Thursday after escaping from a prison in southern New Jersey, prompting residents to stay in their homes, local schools to lock down and dozens of law enforcement officers to fan out in a manhunt, the authorities said.The inmate, Arthur W. Buckel, 38, was last seen on Tuesday during a 6 a.m. bed check at a minimum security satellite unit of Bayside State Prison on the grounds of Ancora Psychiatric Hospital in Hammonton, officials said. Mr. Buckel is serving a three-year sentence on charges that included aggravated assault and burglary, and would have been eligible for parole on May 21, officials said.The State Corrections Department said it was investigating how Mr. Buckel had escaped.Mr. Buckel was previously convicted of aggravated manslaughter in 1996 in the beating death of his girlfriend\u2019s 10-month-old daughter in Jersey City. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison, without the possibility of parole for 12 \u00bd years, and was released in June 2010.On Wednesday, a man the police said was Mr. Buckel could be seen on surveillance video entering a CVS store in Barnegat, a township on the Jersey Shore about an hour\u2019s drive northeast of the prison unit from which he escaped.A stolen Chevrolet Silverado was found outside the CVS, and officials said they believed Mr. Buckel had used it during his escape.Mayor Jon Novak of Barnegat, speaking at a news conference on Thursday, cautioned township residents to keep their doors locked and their eyes open for anything unusual.Mr. Buckel was 18 when he admitted to hitting his girlfriend\u2019s baby when she would not stop crying at a Labor Day party in 1995, according to news accounts from the trial.Later that day, the girl\u2019s mother realized that her daughter had stopped breathing and brought her to Jersey City Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead. An autopsy showed that the girl\u2019s skull had been fractured.Mr. Buckel is thought to have at least one relative who lives in the Barnegat area, the police said. The woman whose child he killed lives in the township.\u201cWe have hard links, and we have speculation,\u201d Arthur P. Drexler, the Barnegat police chief, said.Mr. Buckel is 5-feet-9 inches tall and has light blue eyes, a mustache and beard and a small tattoo under his left eye, according to the Corrections Department. It was not clear what he was wearing when he escaped, but the CVS video shows him in a bright yellow jacket and khaki pants.Mr. Novak noted that Mr. Buckel looked considerably different in the CVS surveillance video than he did in other available photographs, including those from the State Motor Vehicle Commission. Mr. Buckel appears to be a good deal heavier in the video than he does in earlier pictures.Mr. Novak said large numbers of law enforcement officers would be assigned to local schools and along bus routes while chasing down every lead.A earlier version of this article misstated the age of Arthur W. Buckel. He is 38, not 39.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Coral vs. Coal", "Date": "2016-05-26", "News": "Supported byMELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 Tim Flannery, a scientist and environmentalist who was named Australian of the Year in 2007, lost his job in 2013. The right-wing government of then-Prime Minister Tony Abbott shut down the Climate Commission that Flannery headed in a peremptory move designed to demonstrate its contempt for climate change. The commission had been established two years earlier to provide \u201cauthoritative information\u201d to the Australian public.Abbott, of the conservative Liberal Party, had no time for such information. Climate change, he argued in his autobiography, was bunk. It had been \u201chappening since the earth\u2019s beginning.\u201d Therefore it made no sense to \u201cimpose certain and substantial costs on the economy now in order to avoid unknown and perhaps even benign changes in the future.\u201d\u201cTo Abbott, I was the devil incarnate,\u201d Flannery told me. Throughout the developed world \u2014 from the \u201cDrill, baby, drill!\u201d crowd in the United States to Abbott\u2019s \u201cax-the-tax\u201d attack on clean-energy legislation in Australia \u2014 denial of climate change has become a tribal, almost masonic badge of the coal and fossil-fuel loving right. In today\u2019s culture wars it\u2019s as much of a wedge issue as any.Through crowdfunding, Flannery raised enough money in short order to turn the state-funded commission into the Climate Council, an independent nonprofit organization with the same role. Earlier this month, he headed for the Great Barrier Reef to see what \u201cbenign changes,\u201d as Abbott would have it, global warming has produced in the world\u2019s largest coral reef. He found what he saw northeast of Port Douglas on the outer rim of the reef devastating.The reef, one of the largest living things on earth, has started to fail. Whether it can recover is unclear. An organism roughly the size of Germany is bleaching to death. More than 90 percent of the reef that Flannery saw had suffered. Bleaching occurs when excessive heat and sunlight cause the algae that give coral reefs their shimmering colors to create toxins.The toxins repel the tiny animals called polyps essential to the ecosystem of the corals. As my colleague Michelle Innis put it, \u201cWhen heat stress continues, they starve to death.\u201d Because the coral reefs support vast fish stocks, the livelihoods \u2014 sometimes the very survival \u2014 of countless people depend on them.The causes of this disaster are clear enough. The impact of rising water temperatures caused by climate change was compounded by the El Ni\u00f1o cycle and by an underwater heat wave. This year, in a survey of 520 reefs that form the northern section of the Great Barrier Reef, scientists found only four free of bleaching. About 620 miles of previously pristine reef had been affected.\u201cI knew there was bleaching but not to this degree,\u201d Flannery told me. \u201cFor me, it was almost like watching my father die, seeing his organism slowly shut down.\u201dSo it\u2019s coral versus coal, the earth\u2019s health against a big industry, and science versus the Abbott-inspired denial gang. As if to illustrate Australia\u2019s divisions, Queensland\u2019s environment minister, alluding to climate change, warned last month of the need to \u201creduce as many pressures\u201d as possible on the Great Barrier Reef just after the state approved leases for what would be Australia\u2019s largest coal mine.Malcolm Turnbull, the Liberal Party prime minister who replaced Abbott and faces a tight election in early July, knows exactly what\u2019s at stake. In 2010, he called for moving to a situation \u201cwhere all or almost all of our energy comes from zero or very near zero emissions sources.\u201d He described forecasts of the devastating effects of climate change as likely erring \u201con the conservative side.\u201d He called for \u201cexpenditures today so as to safeguard our children.\u201d He advocated concentrated solar thermal power, calling it \u201ca more proven technology than clean coal.\u201d Global warming, he declared, would lead, if unchecked, to \u201ctruly catastrophic consequences.\u201dThe state of the Great Barrier Reef is one such consequence. Yet, Turnbull, beholden to Abbott\u2019s right wing of the Liberal Party, has, as leader, done his best to forget what he said six years ago. Climate change? What climate change? \u201cI\u2019ve known Turnbull for 30 years, I know what he believes, but he\u2019s fallen victim to his tribe,\u201d Flannery told me.That\u2019s a great pity. The reef is as irreplaceable as this planet. Australia has overcapacity in electricity generation. It should close several of its old coal-fired plants. Rich in renewable and clean-energy sources, Australia should be a leader, not a laggard, on climate change. Reputations, like the reef, are easily bleached.Advertisement"}

And the New York billionaire was clearly in need of new buttling, after his former butler at Mar-a-Lago, Anthony Senecal, got caught last week with past Facebook posts about how President Obama should be dragged from the \u201cwhite mosque\u201d and hanged.So, with the soul of the party at stake, the two most powerful \u2014 and polar opposite \u2014 men in the G.O.P. got down to it.What were Speaker Ryan\u2019s demands?\u201cWe talked about the success I\u2019ve had,\u201d Trump replied. \u201cPaul said to me that he has never seen anything like it because I\u2019m a nonpolitician and I beat very successful politicians. He was really fascinated by how I won. I said, it\u2019s just like I have good ideas and I\u2019ve bonded with the people and my people are very loyal. They will stay through thick and thin, whereas the people that support Marco and Cruz wouldn\u2019t. If Jeb sneezed, they\u2019d leave.\u201dNo doubt Ryan was furiously taking notes for 2020, in case Trump loses big, which is a nearly unanimous expectation in the nation\u2019s capital.So Ryan didn\u2019t ask Trump to stop making remarks that alienate women? \u201cNo,\u201d Trump said, \u201che wants me to be me.\u201d So much for the showdown.When I asked if he had been chided by any Republicans for his Twitter feud with Elizabeth Warren, he replied, \u201cYou mean Pocahontas?\u201d So much for reining it in.I noted that John Cornyn said he gave Trump some tips on how to discuss illegal immigration more sensitively to woo Hispanic voters. \u201cI love getting advice,\u201d Trump deadpanned. \u201cIt\u2019s just what I need, just what I need is more advice. The 17 people I beat are still giving me advice.\u201dTrump also briefly saw Poppy Bush\u2019s guru, James Baker. \u201cI was more interested in asking him about Ronald and Nancy Reagan and the whole Reagan era than I was in terms of getting advice currently,\u201d Trump said.As usual in Trumpworld, there was good news. Trump enjoys the status that comes with a Secret Service code name: \u201cMogul.\u201d Ryan was friendly, if noncommital; Lindsey Graham called to talk ISIS and Syria; nine House committee chairmen endorsed Trump; and a Quinnipiac poll popped up showing Trump effectively tied with Clinton in the swing states of Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania. \u201cIt means I\u2019m going to win the election,\u201d Trump said. The man with no pollster mused, \u201cI think I\u2019ve increased the value of polls.\u201dAnd, as is usual in Trumpworld, there was swarming craziness and chaos. When ABC News\u2019s George Stephanopoulos quizzed Trump about why he hasn\u2019t released his tax returns yet, pointing out that Richard Nixon released his while under audit, Trump shot back, \u201cIt\u2019s none of your business.\u201dThe candidate who\u2019s under fire for his own tone told me he was offended by Stephanopoulos\u2019s tone. Trump said he\u2019s not afraid that people will find out he\u2019s not as rich as he says. \u201cTax returns don\u2019t show that,\u201d he said. \u201cThey would show, do I use Cayman Islands stuff? And the answer is no, I can tell you right now. Am I ensconced in some of the crazy countries where you keep money and avoid taxes? The answer is no, I don\u2019t do that.\u201dThe Washington Post revived a story, with a new damning audio, about how Trump had masqueraded as his own publicist, named either John Barron or John Miller, to boast about himself back in the \u201970s, \u201980s and \u201990s. Trump admitted in court testimony in 1990 that he had used the name John Barron as an alias. Former Times editor Joe Sexton told me that he thought he interviewed Trump-as-Barron in 1985 while working as a sportswriter with UPI and chasing a story about the New Jersey Generals. The Post audio on \u201cJohn Miller\u201d contained classic Trumpisms like \u201cThat I can tell you.\u201d CNN interviewed a forensic audio specialist who believed that Trump was posing as Miller. But Trump insisted to me that the Post recording was not his voice. \u201c Do you know how many people I have imitating my voice now? It\u2019s like everybody.\u201dI asked how voters could trust him when he has been shifting positions so much lately, even saying that the temporary Muslim ban was just a \u201csuggestion.\u201d (In \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d he called his technique of self-promotion \u201ctruthful hyperbole.\u201d) \u201cI didn\u2019t shift on that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we have to talk about problems, and if we don\u2019t talk about the problems we\u2019re never going to solve the problems, and that is a real problem, in case you haven\u2019t noticed.\u201dWhile many Republicans are expressing how scared they are to be handcuffed to someone so erratic, Trump is almost feral in savoring his victory. \u201cThey say it was the roughest primary in memory, in history,\u201d he said proudly. Recalling trouncing Jeb Bush, he noted, \u201cLow energy, that term just hit. That thing, that was a one-day kill. Words are beautiful.\u201dNo one marvels more at his success than Trump. \u201cDon\u2019t analyze it,\u201d he said. \u201cJust do it. The other players would come up to Babe Ruth and say, \u2018Babe, how do you hit the long ball?\u2019 And he said, \u2018I don\u2019t know, man. I just hit it.\u2019 There\u2019s a little bit of truth in that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Family That Runs Together", "Date": "2016-05-06", "News": "Want to start a new running habit? We make it easy to get started, get inspired and stay on track. Are you ready? Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s go!When I started running 10 years ago, my family thought it was a funny thing to do. This was in 2006, two years before a running boom took hold in the United States and put a race in my small corner of New Jersey just about every fall and spring weekend. I did my first 5K because a magazine asked me to run it and report back on what was then still a somewhat novel fitness activity. I continued to run because it helped me deal with a romantic breakup, work stress and the ups and downs of being a human being. My mother, who wasn\u2019t allowed to run in high school because she was a girl, came with me to some of those first races. She was there to cheer, but after a while, she got bored with watching. She also complained that she was overweight and out of shape. \u201cI saw you running and everybody else running, and I thought, I can do that too,\u201d she told me. I took her to buy her first pair of running shoes. She ran her first 5K at age 58, and for her second, I walked/ran beside her, my foot in an air cast, during her town\u2019s Fourth of July race. It wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t long after that my brother and sister-in-law started to run, completing half marathons. My sister and her husband joined the family bandwagon, finishing a 5K, then a half-marathon, then a full marathon. My dad, who is divorced from my mom but remains on friendly terms, kept track of all of our Facebook posts about running and listened in on our conversations about running. This past December, I took him to buy his first pair of running shoes, too. My thing had become their thing. At family parties and holidays and even a recent extended family vacation to Walt Disney World, running shoes and fuel and race schedules entered the rotation of safe discussion topics, along with the Philadelphia Phillies, Eagles and the Jersey Shore.So when I decided to run the 2016 New Jersey Marathon, on May 1, I was happy when my sister told me she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be joining me, and my mom said she\u2019d run the half that would be held on the same course on the same day. I thought it would be a fun family activity, especially the week before Mother\u2019s Day. But I\u2019d forgotten that I become a basket of nervous energy and stress before a race, a trait that my family appears to share. On the car ride to the starting line, my dad, who was driving, got mad about traffic. Then my sister got mad at him for being mad about traffic. Then I got mad at her for getting mad at my dad for being mad about traffic. Then she yelled at me for \u201cflipping out.\u201d As the starting time grew nearer, our car barely inched ahead. After my sister\u2019s snap, no one talked. My brain was stuck on the foot injury I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d sustained three weeks before, wondering if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d finish the race. My mother sat quietly beside me, knowing better than to step in.And that\u2019s when I asked myself: Why didn\u2019t I just run my marathon alone?By the time my dad inched the car to within a half-mile of the starting line, I asked him to pull over, and my sister, mom and I shuffled out into a light drizzle. I didn\u2019t want to talk to anyone, not to my mom about my nerves or the ache in my foot, or to my sister about her lost headphones. Nothing. No one. I wanted to be left alone with my dread.But when the race started, that feeling receded with every mile crossed. My foot didn\u2019t hurt so much anymore. The downpour they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d been forecasting never came. My corral started ahead of my sister\u2019s, but I knew she\u2019d beat me because of my interrupted training. I was grateful around mile six when she checked in on me and asked how my foot was doing as she passed by. Seeing my usually mellow dad jumping up and down and screaming at mile 9.5, while my brother yelled at me that I was losing the race and to run faster, gave me a jolt of energy. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s when I knew I\u2019d run the full thing instead of bailing at the half-marathon mark. My boyfriend greeted me with a cowbell at mile 18, another boost that helped me press on.At mile 19, runners turn around to head to the finish line, and when I saw my sister running south as I still ran north, I screamed at her that she\u2019d better keep up that pace and beat me. At mile 20, my boyfriend met me again, and I told him I\u2019d make the last 6.2 miles. When I came through the final yards of the marathon to break my previous personal record \u00e2\u0080\u0094 one that I\u2019d set on that course in 2013 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 my dad was there and ready with his camera. My mom had finished her own half-marathon and was waiting for me just beyond the finish line, a medal draped around her neck.  No one had come to my first two marathons. Before my third, my dad told me that if I died, he\u2019d be the one to bury me, and all had been pretty solitary affairs. So for this marathon, my sixth, I felt honored to have my mom and sister on the course with me, and my dad and brother and his wife and my boyfriend there cheering me on. And though I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be taking a break from marathons while I recover, I can\u2019t wait to cheer them on at their next running events.

{"Headline": "Vegans Whip Up a Secret Weapon: Aquafaba", "Date": "2016-05-09", "News": "Supported byVegans are, by necessity, a creative bunch. They grind almonds for milk and spin soy into cheese, ice cream and even some passable meat substitutes.But replacing the egg, in particular the egg white, has proved especially tricky. The egg is a natural miracle, a combination of water and proteins that has proved all but impossible to mimic without turning to a chemistry set of industrial powders.As a result, many vegans lived for years without the culinary wonders that egg whites produce. No pretty pastel macarons. No meringues. No angel food cake.Vegan meringues were not only possible, but a cinch. And the secret was something that cooks often pour down the drain. Mr. Wohlt named his magic ingredient aquafaba, combining the Latin words for water and bean.The white is about 90 percent water and 10 percent protein. When whipped, those proteins unfold and bond together, trapping the air bubbles created by the whisk. This is what allows for relatively long-lived foams and, ultimately, delights like meringues, souffl\u00e9s and angel food cakes.Before aquafaba, the most prominent egg-foam replacers were bubble-making agents such as baking powder or a mixture of baking soda and vinegar, or thick bubble-retaining whole foods like applesauce, mashed bananas and ground chia seeds. The problem was that none of these substitutes could do everything an egg could. You can\u2019t make a meringue out of mashed bananas.How aquafaba works isn\u2019t precisely understood. Mr. McGee said the key is its viscous mixture of protein and dissolved starch, which slows down the collapse of a foam, as well as chemicals called saponins.Saponins \u2014 the name comes from the Latin for soap \u2014 have long been known for their ability to stabilize bubbles much as emulsifiers do, gathering at the water-air interface in the bubble walls and holding them together. The Lebanese meringuelike dessert natef is made with saponaria officinalis, a saponin-rich root that is used for carpet cleaning as well as cooking.Whatever the reason, aquafaba delivers. Dump a can of chickpea water into a mixer, and it froths instantly, like bubbles in a bath, and whips into stiff, glossy peaks. It retains a slight beany aroma in the bowl, but that disappears when cooked. There is no residual flavor, and few calories.For Sir Kensington\u2019s, aquafaba was a miracle. The market for vegan mayonnaise is booming. Sales have jumped in the last year to $34 million from $25 million, while remaining flat in the $1.8 billion traditional mayonnaise market, according to Spins, a retail sales data company. But the company couldn\u2019t find a way to make one without resorting to protein powders, starches or gums.\u201cOur kitchen looked more like a lab than a kitchen,\u201d recalled Mark Ramadan, a founder.Over several months, testers worked up more than 200 formulas, but none tasted quite right. Pea proteins left a vegetal aftertaste, while a soy base tasted like emulsified edamame.\u201cIt immediately worked so much better,\u201d Ms. Villevieille said. \u201cIt was much closer to our idea of what a mayonnaise should taste like, whether it was vegan or not vegan.\u201dThe discovery solved one problem but created another. Unlike a home cook, Sir Kensington\u2019s couldn\u2019t start opening cans of chickpeas. It needed an industrial supply.With the American market for hummus reaching $800 million annually, there\u2019s a lot of aquafaba floating around, or more precisely down the drain. Many vegans, including Mr. Wohlt, predict that it is only a matter of time before new commercial products hit the market.That could be a boon for vegans, though Mr. Wohlt said he hoped that product development continues to be an open and inclusive process, like the one that brought the world aquafaba in the first place. (No one appears to have secured patents related to aquafaba, but Sir Kensington\u2019s has filed for three related to its mayonnaise and its methods for producing aquafaba.)Right now, Mr. Wohlt said, he and other enthusiasts are hard at work figuring out how to make an aquafaba angel food cake.\u201cI made one the other day that separated from the pan,\u201d he said. \u201cWith every experiment, we\u2019re getting closer.\u201dJack Begg contributed reporting.cookingcookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders Says Superdelegates Should Follow Voters\u2019 Will in Landslide States", "Date": "2016-05-01", "News": "In a news conference on Sunday, Senator Bernie Sanders said he was in a strong position to win many remaining primary contests, including California.Bernie Sanders said on Sunday that he and Hillary Clinton were heading to a \u201ccontested\u201d convention this summer because she will need superdelegates to secure the nomination, a claim that clashes with the accepted definition of a contested convention. He also said that superdelegates who have supported her should switch to him instead.At a news conference in Washington, Mr. Sanders said that the Democratic convention in July would be contested because \u201cit is virtually impossible for Secretary Clinton to reach the majority of convention delegates by June 14 with pledged delegates alone,\u201d and that she \u201cwill need superdelegates to take her over the top.\u201d He added: \u201cIn other words, the convention will be a contested convention.\u00e2\u0080\u009dA convention is typically understood as contested when a candidate cannot reach the necessary delegate count using both pledged delegates and superdelegates, typically party officials and state leaders who are not bound to any candidate.Mr. Sanders urged superdelegates in states that he has won and those who came out in support of Mrs. Clinton before he declared his candidacy to switch their support to him. He also said other superdelegates should consider supporting him because in many polls he beats Donald J. Trump by more than points Mrs. Clinton does, and that they would be more likely to do so if he won further primaries.He acknowledged that his strategy to persuade the superdelegates to switch would be difficult.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have an uphill climb, no questions about it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not going to be easy. Nothing I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m telling you today suggests that this is going to be an easy fight.\u201dMr. Sanders\u2019s push for superdelegates comes as he fights to remain viable after a string of losses last week and a sharp drop in fundraising in April. Mr. Sanders has the support of 39 superdelegates, while 520 have said they will support Mrs. Clinton. She also leads him in pledged delegates, 1,663 to 1,367, giving her a total lead of 2,183 to 1,406. It takes 2,383 total delegates to secure the nomination.Mr. Sanders expressed frustration that Mrs. Clinton had won superdelegates even in states where he won the primary. In Washington State, where he won almost 73 percent of the vote, Mrs. Clinton has 10 superdelegates while he has none. In Colorado, Mr. Sanders won 59 percent of the vote, but again Mrs. Clinton has 10 superdelegates from that state and he has none. Sanders aides handed out a list showing similar situations in states like New Hampshire, Kansas and Maine where he won more votes but has fewer superdelegates than his rival.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I win a state with 70 percent of the vote, you know what? I think I am entitled to those superdelegates,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cI think the superdelegates should reflect what the people of the state want, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true for Hillary Clinton as well.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAccording to Democratic Party rules, pledged delegates must follow the wishes of voters while superdelegates can support whichever candidate they want. In 2008, Barack Obama won the party\u2019s nomination against Mrs. Clinton using pledged and superdelegates.Still, Mr. Sanders was adamant about his strategy. He called Mrs. Clinton the party\u2019s \u201csecond strongest candidate,\u201d and said he hoped superdelegates would focus on his strength among independents and young people.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think the real struggle will be in the hearts and the minds of superdelegates who came onboard the Clinton campaign a long, long time ago,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is admittedly a tough road to climb, but it is not an impossible road to climb, and we intend to fight for every vote in front of us and for every delegate remaining.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Romney Fund-Raiser Says He Had Met With Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-05-12", "News": "Spencer Zwick, the Republican fund-raiser who is deeply close to the former presidential nominee Mitt Romney and who raises money for the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, has periodically met with Donald J. Trump, including around the time he began his winning streak of nominating contests in February. The meetings are noteworthy at a moment when the Republican Party has been divided between those supporting Mr. Trump and those who are opposing him as the party\u2019s standard-bearer. Mr. Romney has been highly critical of Mr. Trump, and Mr. Ryan, with whom Mr. Trump will meet on Thursday, has said he is not ready to endorse Mr. Trump for the party\u2019s presidential nomination.Mr. Zwick, who is often described as Mr. Romney\u2019s \u201csixth son\u201d and who was a co-founder of the private equity firm Solamere Capital with Mr. Romney\u2019s son Tagg, said in an interview that he had made clear before the primaries began that he was available to meet with anyone interested in discussing the fund-raising process. Mr. Zwick was credited with snatching for Mr. Romney portions of the networks established by Senator John McCain of Arizona and Rudolph W. Giuliani during the 2008 presidential campaign. Mr. Zwick said he had also met with Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio before he suspended his campaign.Mr. Zwick said he could not remember precisely when he last saw Mr. Trump, though he conceded that it might have been after he won the New Hampshire primary, the first victory that Mr. Trump scored and the one that snowballed into wins in South Carolina and Nevada soon after. In early February, right before Mr. Trump won the New Hampshire primary, Mr. Zwick praised Mr. Trump as a brilliant political mind. Less than four weeks later, Mr. Romney gave a speech in Salt Lake City, condemning Mr. Trump\u2019s caustic comments, which he had grown concerned about over many months. Mr. Zwick\u2019s conversations with Mr. Trump\u2019s aides included sit-downs earlier in the process.Mr. Zwick insisted that the more recent meetings were not about gaining proximity to the potential nominee and emphasized that he was trying to spread his fund-raising expertise. \u201cI am committed to Paul Ryan,\u201d he said, adding he has \u201cno plans to work\u201d on the presidential race.

{"Headline": "North Korea Linked to Digital Attacks on Global Banks", "Date": "2016-05-26", "News": "Supported bySecurity researchers have tied the recent spate of digital breaches on Asian banks to North Korea, in what they say appears to be the first known case of a nation using digital attacks for financial gain.In three recent attacks on banks, researchers working for the digital security firm Symantec said, the thieves deployed a rare piece of code that had been seen in only two previous cases: the hacking attack at Sony Pictures in December 2014 and attacks on banks and media companies in South Korea in 2013. Government officials in the United States and South Korea have blamed those attacks on North Korea, though they have not provided independent verification.On Thursday, the Symantec researchers said they had uncovered evidence linking an attack at a bank in the Philippines last October with attacks on Tien Phong Bank in Vietnam in December and one in February on the central bank of Bangladesh that resulted in the theft of more than $81 million.\u201cIf you believe North Korea was behind those attacks, then the bank attacks were also the work of North Korea,\u201d said Eric Chien, a security researcher at Symantec, who found that identical code was used across all three attacks.\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen an attack where a nation-state has gone in and stolen money,\u201d Mr. Chien added. \u201cThis is a first.\u201dThe attacks have raised alarms in the global banking industry because the thieves gained access to Swift, a Brussels-based banking consortium that runs what is considered the world\u2019s most secure payment messaging system. Swift\u2019s system is used by 11,000 banks and companies to move money from one country to another \u2014 one reason that it is a tempting target for criminals.Swift has warned publicly that the attacks are part of a broad coordinated assault on banks, though it has not assigned blame. It has also emphasized that it was the banks\u2019 connection points to its network \u2014 and not the core Swift messaging network itself \u2014 that the attackers were able to breach. Also, American bankers have noted that the security lapses all occurred at banks in third-world countries, which may give some comfort to banking customers in the United States.Security researchers and American government officials have tied thousands of attacks to nations in the past. They have linked the United States and Israel to an attack that destroyed Iranian centrifuges, and the Chinese military and contractors to attacks that stole military and trade secrets from thousands of foreign entities.But the latest spate of attacks on banks in Bangladesh and Southeast Asia would be the first time, security researchers say, that a nation has used malicious code to steal purely for financial profit.The idea that Pyongyang had turned to digital theft would not be surprising. North Korea\u2019s economy has been ravaged by sanctions, food shortages and other deprivations. Pyongyang does not publish economic data, but estimates have put North Korea\u2019s gross domestic product between $12 billion and $40 billion, tiny when compared with South Korea\u2019s economic output of more than $1.4 trillion.In the attack at Bangladesh\u2019s central bank in February, the thieves tried to transfer $1 billion in funds from an account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Fed officials became suspicious of the some of requested transfers and released only $81 million to accounts in the Philippines.\u201cIf you presume it\u2019s North Korea, $1 billion is almost 10 percent of their G.D.P.,\u201d Mr. Chien said. \u201cThis is not small change for them.\u201dSymantec researchers said it was possible that the bank in the Philippines containing the North Korean code was also involved in the Bangladesh bank scheme and the attempted breach on the Vietnamese bank. The researchers would not identify the Philippines bank and did not say whether the thieves had been successful in transferring funds. Researchers were able to confirm only that the attackers had managed to breach the bank and install identical code strings on the bank\u2019s computer systems \u2014 the same code that they discovered in Bangladesh, Vietnam and the two previous attacks at Sony in 2014 and South Korea in 2013.Mr. Chien noted that the attackers not only used identical numbers but wrote the code in the same, unusual sequence across all three attacks.Mr. Chien said the evidence pointed to all three attacks being the work of the \u201cLazarus Group,\u201d a name his team gave to the attackers behind the Sony and South Korean attacks.Officials have pointed to North Korea\u2019s threat of \u201cmerciless countermeasures\u201d against Sony if the studio released \u201cThe Interview,\u201d a movie by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg that made fun of North Korea and includes a fictional assassination of its leader. F.B.I. analysts also note critical mistakes North Korean hackers made, such as logging into their attack servers from known North Korean Internet addresses and even logging into both their Facebook account and Sony\u2019s servers from the same computers.In the months since evidence of the attacks involving the Swift network started to emerge, investigators have been looking for commonalities at numerous other potential breaches. It remains unclear whether these breaches are connected to the ones in Bangladesh and Vietnam, but they too have occurred in or around Southeast Asia.There is no evidence to date that the thieves have gone after large American or European banks, though new possible attacks are being reported weekly. Last week, evidence emerged that Banco del Austro, an Ecuadorean bank, was infiltrated by hackers who were also able to sneak onto the Swift network. The thieves transferred several million dollars to accounts around the world, according to a lawsuit the bank filed in federal court in the United States against Wells Fargo, which facilitated one of the transfers.Researchers have yet to unearth any of the code used in the Ecuador attack, but banking analysts say it is probably no coincidence that these attacks are happening in the developing world, where security measures tend not to be as tight as they are in financial hubs like New York and London.Swift has issued numerous warnings in recent weeks urging banks to step up their security protocols. Analysts worry that the breaches could have a chilling effect on global finance; larger banks may become reluctant or even refuse to transact with smaller banks in the developing world unless they can have assurances that their networks have not been compromised by thieves and malware.At a conference on Tuesday in Brussels, Swift\u2019s chief executive, Gottfried Leibbrandt, said the recent attacks could do far more damage than breaches on retailers and telephone companies, which he said suffer largely reputational and legal hits.\u201cBanks that are compromised like this can be put out of business,\u201d Mr. Leibbrandt said.\u201cNorth Korea is hurting for money,\u201d said Herb Lin, the senior research scholar for cyberpolicy and security at Stanford University\u2019s Center for International Security and Cooperation and a fellow at Stanford\u2019s Hoover Institution. \u201cThey\u2019ve been cut out of the financial system because of sanctions. They had been among the best counterfeiters in the world, and only recently have they been stymied in the counterfeiting of superdollars. If it\u2019s true that we\u2019ve cut them off from that, then it\u2019s not at all surprising that they would turn to something else.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Keep the outsider down or out. In the 1850s, at another moment of American unease, the Know-Nothings swept Massachusetts and won mayoral elections in Philadelphia and Washington on a nativist platform to \u201cpurify\u201d national politics by stopping the influx of Irish and German Catholics.Papist influence was then the perceived scourge through which the Know-Nothing movement, as the Native American Party (later the American Party) was commonly known, built its following. Today the supposed threat is Muslim and Mexican infiltration. Or so Donald Trump, the de facto Republican presidential candidate, would have us believe in his \u201cAmerica First\u201d program.A know-nothing tide is upon us. Tribal politics, anchored in tribal media, has made knowing nothing a badge of honor. Ignorance, loudly declaimed, is an attribute, especially if allied to celebrity. Facts are dispensable baggage. To display knowledge, the acquisition of which takes time, is tantamount to showing too much respect for the opposition tribe, who know nothing anyway.Any slogan can be reworked, I guess. America First has a long, unhappy history, the America First Committee having pressed the view that the United States should stay out of the war to defeat Fascism in World War II. Its most famous advocate was Charles Lindbergh, the aviator, who undermined the movement when he revealed that he blamed Jews for prodding America toward war. That was in 1941, not a good year for Jews anywhere, particularly in Europe, where, while Lindbergh opined, the annihilation of Jewry had begun.Well, America First is back, tweaked as Trump\u2019s we-won\u2019t-be-suckers-anymore ideology. In his favor, it cannot be said that Trump has a stranglehold on political stupidity. Britain is seriously debating leaving the European Union, the greatest force for peace and stability in Europe since the carnage of the 1940s.One is put in mind of the remark of James L. Petigru, a prominent jurist and politician, upon the secession of South Carolina from the Union in 1860: \u201cSouth Carolina is too small for a republic and too large for an insane asylum.\u201dBritain\u2019s pathologies resemble South Carolina\u2019s.Now where was I? Ah, yes, Trump, naturally. Trump, who has declared \u2014 or perhaps it was only a suggestion \u2014 that \u201cOur moments of greatest strength came when politics ended at water\u2019s edge.\u201d Totally, he said that. Absolutely, he said that. Really, really, he said that. To deny it would be \u201cabsolutely a total lie.\u201dI suppose Trump was thinking of the Normandy landings, or perhaps the Marshall Plan, or Ronald Reagan\u2019s \u201ctear down this wall,\u201d or the freeing of hundreds of millions of people from the totalitarian Soviet imperium, or the opening to China.American isolationism is an oxymoron because America is a universal idea. That does not change however far short of its ideals the nation may fall.On China, Trump has said: \u201cWe can both benefit or we can both go our separate ways.\u201d Go our separate ways! Let\u2019s unpack that. Right now America buys everything China makes, and China buys the American debt incurred for all the spending sprees on stuff from Guangzhou. Just because there may be separate ways into the gutter does not make the gutter any more alluring. Chinese-American symbiosis is an existential issue.As for Egypt, Trump believes America ousted \u201ca friendly regime\u201d (of the former dictator, Hosni Mubarak) \u201cthat had a longstanding peace treaty with Israel.\u201d No, Egypt has a peace treaty with Israel. Mr. Mubarak did not.Speaking of Israel, Trump says, \u201cPresident Obama has not been a friend to Israel.\u201d Right, he has not been a friend to the tune of over $20.5 billion in foreign military financing since 2009. He has not been a friend by providing over $1.3 billion for the Iron Dome defense system alone since 2011. He has not been a friend by, in 2014, opposing 18 resolutions in the United Nations General Assembly that were biased against Israel; by helping to organize in 2015 the first U.N. General Assembly session on anti-Semitism in the history of the body; and by working tirelessly on a two-state peace, not least on the security arrangements for Israel that are among its preconditions. He has not been a friend by turning the other cheek in the face of what Nancy Pelosi once called \u201cthe insult to the intelligence of the United States\u201d from Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.The know-nothings are on the march. But of course they must know something. Millions of people who vote for Trump cannot be wrong. Perhaps their core idea, along with the unchanging appeal of ethnocentrism, is that politics no longer really matter. Celebrity matters.Power centers are elsewhere \u2014 in financial systems, corporations, technology, networks \u2014 that long since dispensed with borders. That being the case, loudmouthed, isolationist trumpery may just be a sideshow, an American exercise in apr\u00e8s-moi-le-d\u00e9luge escapism.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Australia\u2019s Offshore Cruelty", "Date": "2016-05-23", "News": "Supported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 The Australian treatment of refugees trying to reach this vast, thinly populated country by boat follows textbook rules for the administering of cruelty. It begins with the anodyne name for the procedures \u2014 \u201coffshore processing\u201d \u2014 as if these desperate human beings were just an accumulation of data.It continues with the secrecy shrouding what goes on \u201coffshore\u201d in the tiny Pacific island nation of Nauru and on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea, where a total of more than 1,350 people languish with no notion of how their limbo will end, where they will go or how to get answers to their predicament. Under the Australian Border Force Act of last year, disclosure by any current or former worker of \u201cprotected information\u201d is punishable by up to two years in prison.It goes further with the progressive dehumanization of people \u2014 dubbed \u201cillegals\u201d without cause \u2014 who are caught in this Australian web under a policy now dating back almost four years. They are rarely visible. They are often nameless, merely given identification numbers. Women and children are vulnerable in squalid conditions where idleness and violence go hand in hand.The refugees are consistently demeaned, as when the conservative immigration minister, Peter Dutton, said this month that they could not read and would somehow contrive at once to steal Australian jobs and \u201clanguish in unemployment queues\u201d \u2014 a statement that prompted Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to call Dutton \u201coutstanding,\u201d no less.Turnbull, who came to office with a reputation for being from the more progressive wing of the conservative Liberal Party but has proved beholden to the hard-line right, faces an election in early July. Clearly both he and Dutton reckon casting the marooned of Nauru and Manus Island as threats to Australia will play well with voters.Beyond electoral calculations, people are dying. Last month, a young Iranian refugee, Omid Masoumali, self-immolated on Nauru and died in a Brisbane hospital. Soon after, a 21-year-old Somali refugee, identified only as Hodan, set herself on fire and was taken in critical condition to Brisbane. Their acts were reflections of the desperation and exhaustion inflicted by Australia under a policy that was supposed to be temporary, has not been thought through, and places people in conditions of hopelessness.Perhaps \u201coffshore processing\u201d was supposed to afford the government plausible deniability. Australia would pay billions of dollars to poor Nauru and poor Papua New Guinea to take a big problem off its hands. But in reality there can be no plausible deniability. On the contrary, by any ethical standard, the policy engages Australian responsibility for cruelty.Dutton even suggested that human rights advocates bore responsibility for the self-immolations by giving asylum seekers \u201cfalse hope.\u201d He said the government was \u201cnot going to stand for\u201d people trying to twist its arm. Well, a dead person cannot do that, of course.\u201cWe don\u2019t see the boats, we rarely see a human face and there is a black hole of accountability,\u201d said Madeline Gleeson, a human rights lawyer and the author of the recently published book \u201cOffshore.\u201d She told me, \u201cThe international community does not understand how outrageous this policy is, how far from basic human standards and how shot through with violence and sexual abuse.\u201dThe government argues it is keeping the country safe from terrorism, preventing a proliferation of Australia-bound boats that could result in deaths on a scale seen in the Mediterranean, and ensuring its immigration policy remains orderly. In the current fiscal year, the country has offered to take in 13,750 people under its Humanitarian Program, and committed, exceptionally, to a further 12,000 from the Syrian and Iraqi conflicts (a handful of them have been processed). But it has vowed that nobody in Nauru or on Manus Island will gain admission to Australia.Australia\u2019s \u201coffshore processing\u201d is falling apart and must end. The Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea ruled in April that the Australian-funded detention center on Manus Island was illegal. In Australia, only retroactive legislation enacted after a lawsuit was filed provided legal support for a policy that was in effect pursued illegally since 2012.A nation of immigrants, short of agricultural labor, Australia has benefited when it has overcome its fears, as with the admission of Vietnamese \u201cboat people\u201d in the 1970s. As Steven Glass, an international lawyer, observed in introducing Eva Orner\u2019s new movie, \u201cChasing Asylum,\u201d \u201cWhat, exactly, are we scared of?\u201d Even women raped and impregnated on Nauru have been treated as if they are security threats.Bring those stranded in Nauru and on Manus Island, many of whose refugee claims have already been deemed legitimate, to Australia. Treat them with humanity as their demands for permanent settlement are assessed. Scrap a policy that shames a nation with its pointless cruelty.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pricing a Year of Life", "Date": "2016-05-05", "News": "Susan Gubar writes about life with ovarian cancer.A radio producer investigating cancer costs once asked me, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is another year of your life worth?\u00e2\u0080\u009d During my flummoxed silence, she informed me that experts mention the figure $50,000. Can patients like me \u00e2\u0080\u0094 older people with recurrent disease \u00e2\u0080\u0094 estimate the expense of a future year of cancer treatment to decide whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth it? Used by economists, the QALY calculates quality and quantity of life to judge the monetary worth of medical inventions. Since my cancer was diagnosed in 2008, I have wondered how to make this reckoning within our for-profit health system. So with misgivings I set aside the plight of the uninsured and began considering not generic measurements of cost-effectiveness but how much I \u2014 as an insured patient \u2014 had paid for one year of cancer treatment.  It turned out to be impossible. Never \u2014 during four years of operations, radiological interventions, and cycles of chemotherapy \u2014 had I been informed beforehand about the cost of any consultation, procedure, equipment or drug.  Nor did I understand what would be covered by insurers and (when I got older) Medicare or what would have to be paid out-of-pocket. After the consultation or procedure, I received impenetrable statements from providers, stamped in large letters, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis Is Not a Bill.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They were followed by cryptic printouts from the hospital that clearly were bills, although next to many entries the word \u00e2\u0080\u009cpending\u00e2\u0080\u009d appeared.   Now, given my erratic bookkeeping, I cannot calculate what I ended up spending.  The camouflaging of cancer costs poses an unprecedented problem. There is no analogue in life \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including the approach of death \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in which I remain so ignorant of expenditures. Although I have ascertained what cremation, a grave site, and a marker cost, I have no idea what the costs of my treatments amounted to.  During those same years, I could not predict treatment complications that required subsequent procedures and outlays. When an operation necessitated another, the bills multiplied. Humbled by my own unknowingness, I took to heart Kierkegaard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s insight that we must live life forward, even though it can only be understood backward.Obviously, I was in neither the physical nor the psychological state needed to adjudicate the paperwork. Dazed, frightened and depleted by the alarming threat to my mortality and the debilitation of treatment, I demoted the bills to a nasty irritant. An excellent job with good benefits buffeted me from facing what less lucky people confront:  a financial crisis triggered by cancer treatment.    Stints in the hospital enlighten many patients about prohibitive co-pays and costs above coverage ceilings for the large sums charged by surgeons, anesthesiologists, radiologists and oncologists; for operating and hospital rooms, tests and scans, medicine and equipment as well as a box of tissues. The title of an article in The Oncologist about the financial distress of insured patients speaks volumes: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Financial Toxicity of Cancer Treatments.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAdd to these expenditures exorbitant out-of-network fees, the loss of wages resulting from treatment-related appointments and disabilities, the cost of travel to and from the hospital, and the need to hire child care or housekeeping or elder care assistance. All these combined payments can be staggering.    No wonder, then, that people with cancer are more likely to go bankrupt than other Americans. The authors of The New England Journal of Medicine article conclude that the QALY has been underestimated. For a single threshold now, they would suggest either $100,000 or $150,000 per QALY.Whatever the estimate, a crude ratio of cost effectiveness, like the QALY, seems presumptuous. How can qualitative factors (nausea, fatigue) be converted into quantitative numbers? How can general calculations account for individual variations (my preference for fatigue over nausea) or overriding personal beliefs and principles about what constitutes a valuable existence?      Yet it would help patients like me to participate in sober public conversations on these issues since many of us are aware that individual decisions about medical costs sidestep vexing social questions of why they are inflated and how they will tax our children and grandchildren. At the least, more transparent communications would alleviate widespread fears that living life forward could trip us backward into penury. For the past three years, the clinical trial in which I participate has covered most cancer-related expenses. When the drug in my trial fails, I want to have some say about whether another year of my life is worth the cost of treatment. But it will take a change in the current way of doing medical business to make that possible.

Trump on Wednesday declared himself open to raising the minimum wage, a flip-flop from his statement during the primaries that the rate was already too high. Mr. Trump made the comment in an interview with Wolf Blitzer on CNN, in which he said he was \u201copen to doing something with\u201d the minimum wage. During the primary battle, however, Mr. Trump described the minimum wage as too high. Republicans in general have opposed raising the current federal minimum wage, which is $7.25 an hour.

{"Headline": "The Arab Withering", "Date": "2016-05-12", "News": "Supported byA little over five years ago I was with my colleague Robert F. Worth in Pierre Sioufi\u2019s rambling apartment overlooking Tahrir Square in Cairo. We watched as the Egyptian people rose to overthrow the 30-year-old dictatorship of Hosni Mubarak and stake its claim to citizenship, representation, dignity and the rule of law.Bearded members of the Muslim Brotherhood, their skin scarred by the torture of Mubarak\u2019s security state, embraced secular Egyptian liberals and declared common cause. Young men and women, their eyes burning with conviction, proclaimed that the 18 days in Tahrir had given their lives meaning for the first time by demonstrating the power to effect change. They had discovered agency; they would build a better Egypt. Alaa Al Aswany, an Egyptian novelist, told the crowd: \u201cThe revolution is a new birth, not just for Egypt but on an individual level. It\u2019s like falling in love: you become a better person.\u201dThose were heady days. It was impossible not to suspend one\u2019s disbelief. The army was impassive, the Brotherhood restrained and Twitter-empowered Arab youth ascendant. Liberation unfurled in a wave unseen since 1989.After the fall less than a month earlier of the Tunisian dictator, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, it seemed the frozen, decades-long Arab confrontation of cynical dictators and repressed Islamists \u2014 fecund in the incubation of jihadi terrorists \u2014 had given way to the possibility of more inclusive societies. If Egypt, home to about a quarter of the world\u2019s Arab population, could see the birth of meaningful citizenship, festering Arab humiliation would be replaced by empowering dignity. The West might escape its conspiracy-fueled place in the Arab mind as the hypocritical enabler of every iniquity. That would be a more powerful boost to its security than any far-flung war in Muslim lands.It was not to be. Five years on, Tahrir has the quality of a dream. Read Worth\u2019s remarkable new book, \u201cA Rage for Order: The Middle East in Turmoil, From Tahrir Square to ISIS,\u201d and weep. The chasm between the civic spirit of the square and the brutal theocracy of the Islamic State reveals the extent of the failure.The book is a beautifully written chronicle, told through the struggles of ordinary people, of shattered hopes, lives, families and societies. Worth excavates the personal wounds revelatory of larger betrayals. Everywhere outside Tunisia, sect, tribe and the Mukhabarat (secret police) prove stronger than the aspiration for institutions capable of mediating differences and bringing the elusive \u201ckarama,\u201d or dignity, that, as Worth notes, was the \u201crallying cry of all the uprisings.\u201dWho should be blamed for this epic failure? The Muslim Brotherhood for reneging on its promise not to contest Egypt\u2019s first post-uprising presidential election? The Egyptian army and corrupt \u201cdeep state\u201d for never giving the Brotherhood\u2019s Mohamed Morsi (\u201cthe country\u2019s first democratically elected president in six thousand years of history\u201d) the means to govern? Morsi himself for his foolish power grabs, inept rigidity and inability to realize that he had to demonstrate he was everyone\u2019s president, not merely the Brotherhood\u2019s? Egyptian liberals for so quickly abandoning the idea of democracy to side with the military strongman Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and his bloody coup that the United States never called by its name?Or was it Syria\u2019s Bashar al-Assad for burying the Syrian uprising in rivers of blood? Or Saudi money cynically deployed against every agent of liberalizing transformation? Or a wavering Obama administration that, as in Iran in 2009, and Syria since 2011, has wrapped itself in righteous caution as the winds of change coursed through the Middle East? Or the feckless West that intervened in Libya only to abandon it? Or, simply, the impossibility of delivering more liberal, representative societies to a region where political Islam invokes not the power of the people but the all-pervasive authority of God?Worth does not judge. He reveals. He notes the remarkable compromises in Tunisia between the Islamist party, Ennahda, and the old secular guard that has enabled this small country, alone, to realize something of the hopes of 2011.Leadership counts; Tunisia found a leader in Rached Ghannouchi, an Islamist whose long exile in Britain taught him the life-saving wisdom of democratic give and take. Elsewhere in the Arab world, there has been nothing resembling leadership.But, with equal force, Worth demonstrates how the failure of 2011 led many who had sought but not found dignity to seek it anew in a border-straddling land controlled by the Islamic State. When the dream of the uprisings evaporated, he writes, \u201cmany gave way to apathy or despair, or even nostalgia for the old regimes they had assailed. But some ran headlong into the seventh century in search of the same prize\u201d \u2014 a place \u201cthey could call their own, a state that shielded its subjects from humiliation and despair.\u201dThis shocking last sentence of \u201cA Rage for Order\u201d is the measure of the world\u2019s dilemma in the bloodstained ruins of the Arab Spring. How, after all, can anyone see the barbaric practices of ISIS in those terms?Advertisement"}

The order was issued on May 10.The decision means that Koh Tachai, which stopped receiving visitors on Sunday, will not reopen as is customary in October.Koh Tachai is part of Mu Koh Similan National Park, about 45 miles off Thailand\u2019s southwest coast. The park is normally closed to tourists from mid-May to mid-October because of safety concerns during the monsoon season.Thanya Netithammakun, the department\u2019s general director, said the park had become increasingly popular with Thai and foreign visitors as word of its beauty spread.\u201cPeople are visiting this island, and it\u2019s too overcrowded,\u201d he told Prachachat Turakij, a Thai-language newspaper. \u201cIt\u2019s too much for the island to take.

{"Headline": "Fewer Americans Strike Out for New Jobs, Crimping the Recovery", "Date": "2016-05-24", "News": "Supported byBy covered wagon and jetliner, from East Coast to West, Rust Belt to Sun Belt, Americans\u2019 propensity to be on the move \u2013 to new jobs and new places \u2013 has historically provided the economy with a critical dose of oomph.But as fewer and fewer Americans are loading up the moving van in search of opportunity, that advantage may be slipping away. In recent years, economists have become increasingly worried that a slide in job turnover and relocation rates is undermining the economy\u2019s dynamism, damping productivity and wages while making it more difficult for sidelined workers to find their way back into the labor force.Staying put can mean that workers are not moving to jobs where they would be more productive. At the same time, many are forgoing the raises and ascents on the career ladder that often come with a job switch. Fewer openings can also have a ripple effect, shrinking the bargaining power of workers in general, making it tougher to ask for a bump up in pay.\u201cIt also stinks if you lose your job,\u201d Ms. Stevenson said of reduced turnover. \u201cIt\u2019s like a game of musical chairs where only half the people get up.\u201dSuch road-testing of jobs was once very common, particularly for young workers. But now, \u201cquick turnover jobs are declining across the board,\u201d Ms. Wozniak said. \u201cIt\u2019s not as easy to try things out.\u201dWhat they found was a drop of 10 to 15 percent between 1980 and 2013. Some individual measures showed starker declines: The proportion of workers who jumped from one job to another plunged by nearly a quarter.Mobility normally drops during downturns, and that was the case during the Great Recession. Millions of jobs vanished, and those fortunate enough to be working were less inclined to give up the one they had.But even as much of the wreckage wrought by the crash has been cleared, fluidity has not bounced back to prerecession levels. Although there was a common perception that the mortgage crisis had stranded many Americans in place, economists found scant evidence to support that notion. Moving declined similarly among both renters and homeowners. Something else appears to be going on.Moreover, when it comes to mobility, figuring out which is the chicken and which is the egg is not so easy. Is a less fluid labor market causing the economy to be more sluggish or is a sluggish economy causing the labor market to be less fluid?Certainly, movement has declined as the population ages. Older people are less likely to switch jobs and resettle than younger people. The addition of career-minded women into the work force may also make it harder for couples and families to move if only one spouse can find a new job. In addition, fewer new companies are being created over all, and the ones that exist are growing more slowly on average.Still, those explanations don\u2019t account for the steep drops in mobility and job turnover found across every age group, educational level and industry.One of the more intriguing findings was the role of declining social trust and what is known as social capital \u2014 the web of family, friends and professional contacts. For example, the proportion of people who agree with the statement, \u201cMost people can be trusted,\u201d has been shrinking for more than three decades. Researchers found that states with larger declines in social trust also had larger declines in labor market fluidity. The lack of trust may increase the cost of job-hunting and make both employees and employers more risk-averse.Ms. Wozniak added that the benefits of LinkedIn and Facebook friends may not replace the personal connections that still remain the best way to find a job.For some, the information revolution has a decided downside. Employers can use easily accessible information about criminal records and credit histories, not to mention embarrassing tweets, photos, social media postings and more to screen out a wider range of candidates.\u201cYou get fewer second chances now,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cIf you screwed up in a way that\u2019s out there, it follows you around for life.\u201dMr. Davis also argued that an increase in government regulations, including varying licensing requirements that prevent workers from setting up shop in another state, have made the labor market more static, though the evidence is mixed.Fluidity rates varied widely throughout the country, but the Brookings paper found that they declined in every state. Most of the largest drops occurred in the West: Oregon, Wyoming, Washington, Oregon, South Dakota, Montana, Idaho and Alaska were all in the bottom 10.States with the most activity included North Carolina, South Carolina, New York, New Jersey and Illinois \u2013 but even these were not as fluid as they used to be.Of course, high rates of job turnover are not necessarily good. Some states have tumult in the labor market because thousands of workers lost manufacturing, clerical or construction jobs. They might have found new positions at lower levels that don\u2019t pay as much.On the flip side, rootedness can also have other types of payoffs, including stronger communities and support, help with a babysitting emergency, a shared beer after work or a loan when a job is lost. As social trust diminishes, people may feel more comfortable sticking closer to home where the faces are familiar even if job opportunities are scarcer, researchers suggested.Over all, \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone has a good answer yet\u201d to the decline in mobility, Ms. Stevenson of the University of Michigan said. \u201cIt\u2019s a puzzle and it\u2019s the one I wish politicians and policy makers were more concerned about.\u201dFollow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTAdvertisement"}

Bollea, after Gawker published a video of Mr. Bollea having sex with the wife of the radio host Bubba the Love Sponge (who legally changed his birth name, Todd Clem, in 1999).The tech press gets plenty of criticism \u2014 much of it deserved \u2014 for being too cozy with the people it writes about.

{"Headline": "How High School Students See the Transgender Bathroom Issue", "Date": "2016-05-18", "News": "Supported byHigh school students from around the country shared their thoughts with The New York Times on Facebook. Their opinions ranged from anger to joy, and they offered a glimpse into how students are experiencing the issue in their schools and neighborhoods.The Obama administration has taken significant steps in the right direction in social reform throughout its almost eight-year tenure, and this is just adding to its legacy. The United States was built on \u201cfreedom and justice for all,\u201d and discriminatory laws against transgender students simply disregard not just the Constitution, but the well-being of U.S. citizens. We live in 2016, and acceptance of everyone of every creed, race, sexuality, gender and background is not only a reflection of the time that we live in, but a necessity in American society.\u2212Zoe Allen, 16, DallasIt\u2019s a decision that should be left for the school\u2019s administration and board to decide. Also, it shouldn\u2019t be a reason to pull out federal funding if schools choose not to follow this law.It\u2019s also up to Congress to write the laws, not the executive department.\u2014 Josh Booher, 18, Columbia, Pa.1) I don\u2019t think it is the federal government\u2019s job to dictate what each school district does with its students. That is extreme government overreach, and it sets a bad precedent for the future.2) I think that it is endangering females by opening the doors for any man who wants to enter locker rooms and restrooms where females are. I am not saying that transgender people will be the ones committing crimes; however, these laws and orders will allow any guy who wants to to enter these previously all-female spaces without being restricted by law. If schools want to provide a gender neutral restroom or space where transgender people can go, that is one thing, but eliminating any place where girls can go and have privacy from men is a very bad policy.\u2014 Grace Driggers, 17, South CarolinaIt is first of all not the federal government\u2019s job to determine this for every school, and to be 100 percent honest, this makes me as a female very uncomfortable. This liberal push for equality in virtually EVERYTHING is beyond ridiculous. You are given a gender, and whether you agree with it or not, you go to the bathroom you are assigned \u2014 not the one you determine. Mr. Obama, this is terrible, and for everyone out there that says this is a step for a safer environment, you are very, very mistaken.While I agree with the Obama administration in general and am an advocate for transgender rights, I\u2019m pessimistic about the outcome. Schools that oppose challenging the gender binary will continue to do so, as they probably already resent the fast pace of social change and left-leaning federal government. In fact, schools with conservative administrations may be even more anti-trans in defiance. More open-minded, progressive schools probably have listened to student input in allowing transgender students to use the appropriate bathrooms and don\u2019t need the federal government\u2019s advice. All in all, this decision seemed like it was made for show; however, I agree with it and its significance is in its empowerment of and official solidarity with transgender students. It gives them a voice.\u2014 Jenny Xu, 16, New YorkAs a high schooler, I honestly couldn\u2019t care less which bathroom somebody uses if they\u2019re using whichever one matches their gender identification. I believe that the whole freakout on this issue is a ploy to distract people from the real issues that face us, like childhood poverty, undue corporate influence in politics and income inequality.I\u2019m a high schooler and the co-president of the Gay Straight Alliance at my school. I 100 percent think that this is a step in the right direction. We have been fighting for this right at my school for years and are very pleased that it is being addressed federally. We are thrilled that this will make our school a safer and more comfortable place for students to learn (and relieve themselves) regardless of their gender identity.\u2014 Robbie Goldberg, 16, Framingham, Mass.This is long overdue and especially appropriate. Being friends with many trans people myself, I find it nonsensical that conservatives will make up any excuse to oppose these laws, because in reality, they do not understand trans people, they do not want to and, as the word conservative implies, they are afraid of any kind of social progress. It is so easy to forget that there was extreme backlash to desegregation as well as women attending class, but the right for transgender people to use whichever bathroom they associate their identity with does indeed align with civil rights and social progress. There will be clamor, but the noise will die down eventually as people will realize this is a non-problem.\u2014 Christian Mixson, 18, Gulf Shores, Ala.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Aspiring Novelist Who Became Obama\u2019s Foreign-Policy Guru", "Date": "2016-05-05", "News": "FeatureHow Ben Rhodes rewrote the rules of diplomacy for the digital age.Supported byEverything changed that day. But the way it changed Ben Rhodes\u2019s life is still unique, and perhaps not strictly believable, even as fiction. He was in the second year of the M.F.A. program at N.Y.U., writing short stories about losers in garden apartments and imagining that soon he would be published in literary magazines, acquire an agent and produce a novel by the time he turned 26. He saw the first tower go down, and after that he walked around for a while, until he ran into someone he knew, and they went back to her shared Williamsburg apartment and tried to find a television that worked, and when he came back outside, everyone was taking pictures of the towers in flames. He saw an Arab guy sobbing on the subway. \u201cThat image has always stayed with me,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause I think he knew more than we did about what was going to happen.\u201d Writing Frederick Barthelme knockoffs suddenly seemed like a waste of time.\u201cI immediately developed this idea that, you know, maybe I want to try to write about international affairs,\u201d he explained. \u201cIn retrospect, I had no idea what that meant.\u201d His mother\u2019s closest friend growing up ran the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, which then published Foreign Policy. He sent her a letter and included what would wind up being his only piece of published fiction, a short story that appeared in The Beloit Fiction Journal. It was titled \u201cThe Goldfish Smiles, You Smile Back.\u201d The story still haunts him, he says, because \u201cit foreshadowed my entire life.\u201d\u201cBlitzer!\u201d a man calls out. A small figure in a long navy cashmere overcoat turns around, in mock surprise.\u201cYou don\u2019t write, you don\u2019t call,\u201d Wolf Blitzer, the CNN anchorman, parries.Unnoticed by the reporters, Ben Rhodes walks through the room, a half-beat behind a woman in leopard-print heels. He is holding a phone to his ear, repeating his mantra: \u201cI\u2019m not important. You\u2019re important.\u201dThe Boy Wonder of the Obama White House is now 38. He heads downstairs to his windowless basement office, which is divided into two parts. In the front office, his assistant, Rumana Ahmed, and his deputy, Ned Price, are squeezed behind desks, which face a large television screen, from which CNN blares nonstop. Large pictures of Obama adorn the walls. Here is the president adjusting Rhodes\u2019s tie; presenting his darling baby daughter, Ella, with a flower; and smiling wide while playing with Ella on a giant rug that says \u201cE Pluribus Unum.\u201dAs the deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, Rhodes writes the president\u2019s speeches, plans his trips abroad and runs communications strategy across the White House, tasks that, taken individually, give little sense of the importance of his role. He is, according to the consensus of the two dozen current and former White House insiders I talked to, the single most influential voice shaping American foreign policy aside from Potus himself. The president and Rhodes communicate \u201cregularly, several times a day,\u201d according to Denis McDonough, Obama\u2019s chief of staff, who is known for captaining a tight ship. \u201cI see it throughout the day in person,\u201d he says, adding that he is sure that in addition to the two to three hours that Rhodes might spend with Obama daily, the two men communicate remotely throughout the day via email and phone calls. Rhodes strategized and ran the successful Iran-deal messaging campaign, helped negotiate the opening of American relations with Cuba after a hiatus of more than 50 years and has been a co-writer of all of Obama\u2019s major foreign-policy speeches. \u201cEvery day he does 12 jobs, and he does them better than the other people who have those jobs,\u201d Terry Szuplat, the longest-tenured member of the National Security Council speechwriting corps, told me. On the largest and smallest questions alike, the voice in which America speaks to the world is that of Ben Rhodes.Like Obama, Rhodes is a storyteller who uses a writer\u2019s tools to advance an agenda that is packaged as politics but is often quite personal. He is adept at constructing overarching plotlines with heroes and villains, their conflicts and motivations supported by flurries of carefully chosen adjectives, quotations and leaks from named and unnamed senior officials. He is the master shaper and retailer of Obama\u2019s foreign-policy narratives, at a time when the killer wave of social media has washed away the sand castles of the traditional press. His ability to navigate and shape this new environment makes him a more effective and powerful extension of the president\u2019s will than any number of policy advisers or diplomats or spies. His lack of conventional real-world experience of the kind that normally precedes responsibility for the fate of nations \u2014 like military or diplomatic service, or even a master\u2019s degree in international relations, rather than creative writing \u2014 is still startling.Part of what accounts for Rhodes\u2019s influence is his \u201cmind meld\u201d with the president. Nearly everyone I spoke to about Rhodes used the phrase \u201cmind meld\u201d verbatim, some with casual assurance and others in the hushed tones that are usually reserved for special insights. He doesn\u2019t think for the president, but he knows what the president is thinking, which is a source of tremendous power. One day, when Rhodes and I were sitting in his boiler-room office, he confessed, with a touch of bafflement, \u201cI don\u2019t know anymore where I begin and Obama ends.\u201dStanding in his front office before the State of the Union, Rhodes quickly does the political math on the breaking Iran story. \u201cNow they\u2019ll show scary pictures of people praying to the supreme leader,\u201d he predicts, looking at the screen. Three beats more, and his brain has spun a story line to stanch the bleeding. He turns to Price. \u201cWe\u2019re resolving this, because we have relationships,\u201d he says.Price turns to his computer and begins tapping away at the administration\u2019s well-cultivated network of officials, talking heads, columnists and newspaper reporters, web jockeys and outside advocates who can tweet at critics and tweak their stories backed up by quotations from \u201csenior White House officials\u201d and \u201cspokespeople.\u201d I watch the message bounce from Rhodes\u2019s brain to Price\u2019s keyboard to the three big briefing podiums \u2014 the White House, the State Department and the Pentagon \u2014 and across the Twitterverse, where it springs to life in dozens of insta-stories, which over the next five hours don formal dress for mainstream outlets. It\u2019s a tutorial in the making of a digital news microclimate \u2014 a storm that is easy to mistake these days for a fact of nature, but whose author is sitting next to me right now.Rhodes logs into his computer. \u201cIt\u2019s the middle of the [expletive] night in Iran,\u201d he grumbles. Price looks up from his keyboard to provide a messaging update: \u201cConsidering that they have 10 of our guys in custody, we\u2019re doing O.K.\u201dWith three hours to go until the president\u2019s address to Congress, Rhodes grabs a big Gatorade and starts combing through the text of the State of the Union address. I peek over his shoulder, to get a sense of the meta-narrative that will shape dozens of thumb-suckers in the days and weeks to follow. One sentence reads: \u201cBut as we focus on destroying ISIL, over-the-top claims that this is World War III just play into their hands.\u201d He retypes a word, then changes it back, before continuing with his edit. \u201cMasses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks, twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages \u2014 they pose an enormous danger to civilians; they have to be stopped. But they do not threaten our national existence.\u201dWatching Rhodes work, I remember that he is still, chiefly, a writer, who is using a new set of tools \u2014 along with the traditional arts of narrative and spin \u2014 to create stories of great consequence on the biggest page imaginable. The narratives he frames, the voices of senior officials, the columnists and reporters whose work he skillfully shapes and ventriloquizes, and even the president\u2019s own speeches and talking points, are the only dots of color in a much larger vision about who Americans are and where we are going that Rhodes and the president have been formulating together over the past seven years. When I asked Jon Favreau, Obama\u2019s lead speechwriter in the 2008 campaign, and a close friend of Rhodes\u2019s, whether he or Rhodes or the president had ever thought of their individual speeches and bits of policy making as part of some larger restructuring of the American narrative, he replied, \u201cWe saw that as our entire job.\u201dHaving recently spent time working in Hollywood, I realize during our conversations that the role Rhodes plays in the White House bears less resemblance to any specific character on Beltway-insider TV shows like \u201cThe West Wing\u201d or \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d than it does to the people who create those shows. And like most TV writers, Rhodes clearly prefers to imagine himself in the company of novelists.\u201cWhat novel is this that you are living in now and will exit from in eight months and be like, \u2018Oh, my God\u2019?\u201d I ask him.\u201cWho would be the author of this novel?\u201d he asks.\u201cThe one you are a character in now?\u201d\u201cDon DeLillo, I think,\u201d Rhodes answers. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you feel about Don DeLillo.\u201d\u201cI love Don DeLillo,\u201d I answer.\u201cYeah,\u201d Rhodes answers. \u201cThat\u2019s the only person I can think of who has confronted these questions of, you know, the individual who finds himself negotiating both vast currents of history and a very specific kind of power dynamics. That\u2019s his milieu. And that\u2019s what it\u2019s like to work in the U.S. foreign-policy apparatus in 2016.\u201dRhodes\u2019s mother and father are not interested in talking about Rhodes. Neither is his older brother, David, who is president of CBS News, an organization that recently revived the effort to declassify the contents of the redacted 28 pages of the Sept. 11 report on the eve of Obama\u2019s visit to Saudi Arabia, on which Rhodes, as usual, accompanied the president. The brothers are close, but they often go months without seeing each other. \u201cHe was like the kid who carried the briefcase to school,\u201d Ben says of his brother, who worked at Fox News and Bloomberg before moving to CBS. \u201cI actually didn\u2019t do that great in high school because I was drinking and smoking pot and hanging out in Central Park.\u201dRhodes\u2019s impassioned yet depressive vibe, which I feel in his stray remarks and in the strangeness of his decision to allow me to roam around the White House, stems in part from feeling overloaded; he wishes he had more time to think and write. His mother is Jewish from the Upper East Side, and worships John Updike, and reads The New Yorker. His father is a Texan lawyer who took his sons to St. Thomas Episcopal Church once a month, where Rhodes felt like the Jewish kid in church, the same way he felt like a \u201cJewish Christian\u201d at Passover Seders. His New York City prep-school-kid combination of vulnerability, brattiness and passionate hatred for phonies suggests an only slightly updated version of what Holden Caulfield might have been like if he grew up to work in the West Wing.Rhodes\u2019s windowless back office, which doesn\u2019t have a TV screen, is an oasis of late-night calm in a building devoted to the performance of power. The walls are painted a soft creamy color, which gives it the feel of an upscale hotel room with the drapes closed. He arrives here every morning between 8 and 9 from a modest two-bedroom apartment in a grad-student-type building in an unpretentious Washington neighborhood around the corner from his favorite post-collegiate bar. Before coming to work, he walks his 1-year-old daughter to day care. Then he drives to work in his Beamer, which appears to be the one grown-up luxury he and his wife, Ann Norris, who works in the State Department and longs to return to her childhood home of California, can afford. When his wife takes the car, he rides the bus, which offers him a touch of the anonymity he craves. His days at the White House start with the president\u2019s daily briefing, which usually includes the vice president, National Security Adviser Susan Rice, Deputy National Security Adviser Avril Haines and Homeland Security Adviser Lisa Monaco.The books on his shelves are a mix of DeLillo novels, history books, recondite tomes on Cuba and Burma and adventure-wonk stuff like Mark Mazzetti\u2019s \u201cThe Way of the Knife.\u201d C. S. Lewis makes an appearance here, alongside a volume of Lincoln speeches (Obama tells all his speechwriters to read Lincoln) and George Orwell\u2019s \u201cAll Art Is Propaganda.\u201d I have seen the same books on the shelves of plenty of Brooklyn apartments. Yet some large part of the recent history of America and its role in the world turns on the fact that the entirely familiar person sitting at the desk in front of me, who seems not unlike other weed-smokers I know who write Frederick Barthelme-type short stories, has achieved a \u201cmind meld\u201d with President Obama and used his skills to help execute a radical shift in American foreign policy.So I wonder: How did he get from there to here?The editor at Foreign Policy who read \u201cGoldfish,\u201d which Rhodes attached with his query letter, said that the young M.F.A. would be bored with fact-checking. Instead, he suggested that he apply for a job with Lee Hamilton, the onetime congressman from Indiana, who was looking for a speechwriter.\u201cI was surprised,\u201d Hamilton remembered. \u201cWhat the hell does a guy who wanted to write fiction come to me for?\u201d But he had always found writers useful, and Rhodes\u2019s writing sample was the best in the pile. So he hired him on at the Wilson Center, a nonpartisan think tank. Though Rhodes never said a word in meetings, Hamilton says, he had a keen understanding of what was going on and a talent for putting the positions of distinguished participants down on paper. \u201cI immediately understood that it\u2019s a very important quality for a staffer,\u201d Hamilton explained, \u201cthat he could come into a meeting and decide what was decided.\u201d I suggested that the phrase \u201cdecide what was decided\u201d is suggestive of the enormous power that might accrue to someone with Rhodes\u2019s gifts. Hamilton nodded. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he said.The notes go on and on. They have ideas with subsets of ideas and reactions to ideas indented beneath the original ideas. The handwriting is perfect. The representation of what happened in the meetings immaculate, like a mirror\u2019s reflection after it has been scrubbed clean. I have a reputation for my notes.Rhodes served as Hamilton\u2019s staff member on the 9/11 Commission, where he met Denis McDonough, another Hamilton prot\u00e9g\u00e9, who had gone on to work for Tom Daschle in the Senate. Rhodes then became the chief note-taker for the Iraq Study Group, the bipartisan commission that excoriated George Bush\u2019s war in Iraq. He accompanied Hamilton and his Republican counterpart on the group, former secretary of state and Bush family intimate James Baker, to their meetings with Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice, Stephen Hadley, David Petraeus and many others (Vice President Dick Cheney met with the group but didn\u2019t say a word). According to both Hamilton and Edward Djerejian, Baker\u2019s second on the I.S.G., Rhodes\u2019s opinions were helpful in shaping the group\u2019s conclusions \u2014 a scathing indictment of the policy makers responsible for invading Iraq. For Rhodes, who wrote much of the I.S.G. report, the Iraq war was proof, in black and white, not of the complexity of international affairs or the many perils attendant on political decision-making but of the fact that the decision-makers were morons.One result of this experience was that when Rhodes joined the Obama campaign in 2007, he arguably knew more about the Iraq war than the candidate himself, or any of his advisers. He had also developed a healthy contempt for the American foreign-policy establishment, including editors and reporters at The New York Times, The Washington Post, The New Yorker and elsewhere, who at first applauded the Iraq war and then sought to pin all the blame on Bush and his merry band of neocons when it quickly turned sour. If anything, that anger has grown fiercer during Rhodes\u2019s time in the White House. He referred to the American foreign-policy establishment as the Blob. According to Rhodes, the Blob includes Hillary Clinton, Robert Gates and other Iraq-war promoters from both parties who now whine incessantly about the collapse of the American security order in Europe and the Middle East.Boost thinks very highly of me. My notes are so impressive that they have taken on the form of ideas, he feels. I capture other people\u2019s words in a manner that not only organizes them, but inserts a clarity and purpose that was not present in the original idea. Connections are made between two opposing ideas that were not apparent in the meeting. I have gotten at not only the representation of things, but the way that the mind actually works.Jon Favreau, then the campaign\u2019s lead speechwriter, felt as if he could use a foreign-affairs expert who could write. \u201cForeign-policy advisers kept changing all the language that made Obama sound like he wasn\u2019t part of the Democratic foreign-policy establishment,\u201d he remembers. \u201cThe idea of someone with a masters in fiction who had also co-authored the Iraq Study Group and 9/11 Commission reports seemed perfect for a candidate who put so much emphasis on storytelling.\u201d The two young speechwriters quickly found themselves to be in sync. \u201cHe truly gives zero [expletive] about what most people in Washington think,\u201d Favreau says admiringly of Rhodes. \u201cI think he\u2019s always seen his time there as temporary and won\u2019t care if he\u2019s never again invited to a cocktail party, or asked to appear on \u2018Morning Joe,\u2019 or inducted into the Council on Foreign Relations hall of fame or whatever the hell they do there.\u201dI sit next to Boost in the meetings. The ideas fly like radio waves. I am silent in these meetings, taking notes.\u201cHe was easily underestimatable,\u201d Samantha Power recalls, of Rhodes\u2019s arrival on the Obama campaign in 2007. Herself a writer, whose history of America\u2019s responses to genocide, \u201cA Problem From Hell,\u201d won the Pulitzer Prize, Power went to work in Obama\u2019s Senate office in 2005. Power is now the American ambassador to the United Nations. Her attire suggests a disingenuous ambivalence about her role in government that appears to be common among her cohort in the Obama administration, with a cardigan made of thick, expensive-looking cashmere worn over a simple frock, along with silver spray-painted rock \u2019n\u2019 roll sneakers. See, I\u2019m sympatico, the sneakers proclaim.Early on, what struck her about Rhodes was how strategic he was. \u201cHe was leading quietly, initially, and mainly just through track changes, like what to accept and reject,\u201d she says. When I ask her where Rhodes\u2019s control over drafts of the candidate\u2019s speeches came from, she immediately answers, \u201cObama,\u201d but then qualifies her answer. \u201cBut it was Hobbesian,\u201d she adds. \u201cHe had the pen. And he understood intuitively that having the pen gave him that control.\u201d His judgment was superior to that of his rivals, and he refused to ever back down. \u201cHe was just defiant,\u201d she recalls. \u201cHe was like: \u2018No, I\u2019m not. That\u2019s bad. Obama wouldn\u2019t want that.\u2019\u2009\u201dObama relies on Rhodes for \u201can unvarnished take,\u201d in part, she says, because \u201cBen just has no poker face,\u201d and so it\u2019s easy to see when he is feeling uncomfortable. \u201cThe president will be like, \u2018Ben, something on your mind?\u2019 And then Ben will have this incredibly precise lay-down of why the previous half-hour has been an utter waste of time, because there\u2019s a structural flaw to the entire direction of the conversation.\u201dThe literary character that Rhodes most closely resembles, Power volunteers, is Holden Caulfield. \u201cHe hates the idea of being phony, and he\u2019s impetuous, and he has very strong views.\u201dIn Afghanistan the Taliban dynamites enormous statues of Buddha, the ancient material imploding and crumbling to the ground, small specks of men can be seen watching in the foreground. This is somewhere else. Far away.The job he was hired to do, namely to help the president of the United States communicate with the public, was changing in equally significant ways, thanks to the impact of digital technologies that people in Washington were just beginning to wrap their minds around. It is hard for many to absorb the true magnitude of the change in the news business \u2014 40 percent of newspaper-industry professionals have lost their jobs over the past decade \u2014 in part because readers can absorb all the news they want from social-media platforms like Facebook, which are valued in the tens and hundreds of billions of dollars and pay nothing for the \u201ccontent\u201d they provide to their readers. You have to have skin in the game \u2014 to be in the news business, or depend in a life-or-death way on its products \u2014 to understand the radical and qualitative ways in which words that appear in familiar typefaces have changed. Rhodes singled out a key example to me one day, laced with the brutal contempt that is a hallmark of his private utterances. \u201cAll these newspapers used to have foreign bureaus,\u201d he said. \u201cNow they don\u2019t. They call us to explain to them what\u2019s happening in Moscow and Cairo. Most of the outlets are reporting on world events from Washington. The average reporter we talk to is 27 years old, and their only reporting experience consists of being around political campaigns. That\u2019s a sea change. They literally know nothing.\u201dIn this environment, Rhodes has become adept at ventriloquizing many people at once. Ned Price, Rhodes\u2019s assistant, gave me a primer on how it\u2019s done. The easiest way for the White House to shape the news, he explained, is from the briefing podiums, each of which has its own dedicated press corps. \u201cBut then there are sort of these force multipliers,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe have our compadres, I will reach out to a couple people, and you know I wouldn\u2019t want to name them \u2014 \u201d\u201cI can name them,\u201d I said, ticking off a few names of prominent Washington reporters and columnists who often tweet in sync with White House messaging.Price laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll say, \u2018Hey, look, some people are spinning this narrative that this is a sign of American weakness,\u2019\u2009\u201d he continued, \u201cbut \u2014 \u201d\u201cIn fact it\u2019s a sign of strength!\u201d I said, chuckling.\u201cAnd I\u2019ll give them some color,\u201d Price continued, \u201cand the next thing I know, lots of these guys are in the dot-com publishing space, and have huge Twitter followings, and they\u2019ll be putting this message out on their own.\u201dThis is something different from old-fashioned spin, which tended to be an art best practiced in person. In a world where experienced reporters competed for scoops and where carrying water for the White House was a cause for shame, no matter which party was in power, it was much harder to sustain a \u201cnarrative\u201d over any serious period of time. Now the most effectively weaponized 140-character idea or quote will almost always carry the day, and it is very difficult for even good reporters to necessarily know where the spin is coming from or why.When I later visited Obama\u2019s former campaign mastermind David Axelrod in Chicago, I brought up the soft Orwellian vibe of an information space where old media structures and hierarchies have been erased by Silicon Valley billionaires who convinced the suckers that information was \u201cfree\u201d and everyone with access to Google was now a reporter. Axelrod, a former newspaperman, sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s not as easy as standing in front of a press conference and speaking to 70 million people like past presidents have been able to do,\u201d he said. The bully pulpit by and large doesn\u2019t exist anymore, he explained. \u201cSo more and more, over the last couple of years, there\u2019s been an investment in alternative means of communication: using digital more effectively, going to nontraditional sources, understanding where on each issue your constituencies are going to be found,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they\u2019ve approached these major foreign-policy challenges as campaign challenges, and they\u2019ve run campaigns, and those campaigns have been very sophisticated.\u201dIn the narrative that Rhodes shaped, the \u201cstory\u201d of the Iran deal began in 2013, when a \u201cmoderate\u201d faction inside the Iranian regime led by Hassan Rouhani beat regime \u201chard-liners\u201d in an election and then began to pursue a policy of \u201copenness,\u201d which included a newfound willingness to negotiate the dismantling of its illicit nuclear-weapons program. The president set out the timeline himself in his speech announcing the nuclear deal on July 14, 2015: \u201cToday, after two years of negotiations, the United States, together with our international partners, has achieved something that decades of animosity has not.\u201d While the president\u2019s statement was technically accurate \u2014 there had in fact been two years of formal negotiations leading up to the signing of the J.C.P.O.A. \u2014 it was also actively misleading, because the most meaningful part of the negotiations with Iran had begun in mid-2012, many months before Rouhani and the \u201cmoderate\u201d camp were chosen in an election among candidates handpicked by Iran\u2019s supreme leader, the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The idea that there was a new reality in Iran was politically useful to the Obama administration. By obtaining broad public currency for the thought that there was a significant split in the regime, and that the administration was reaching out to moderate-minded Iranians who wanted peaceful relations with their neighbors and with America, Obama was able to evade what might have otherwise been a divisive but clarifying debate over the actual policy choices that his administration was making. By eliminating the fuss about Iran\u2019s nuclear program, the administration hoped to eliminate a source of structural tension between the two countries, which would create the space for America to disentangle itself from its established system of alliances with countries like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Israel and Turkey. With one bold move, the administration would effectively begin the process of a large-scale disengagement from the Middle East.The nerve center for the selling of the Iran deal to Congress, which took place in a concentrated three-month period between July and September of last year, was located inside the White House, and is referred to by its former denizens as \u201cthe war room.\u201d Chad Kreikemeier, a Nebraskan who had worked in the White House Office of Legislative Affairs, helped run the team, which included three to six people from each of several agencies, he says, which were the State Department, Treasury, the American delegation to the United Nations (i.e., Samantha Power), \u201cat times D.O.D.\u201d (the Department of Defense) and also the Department of Energy and the National Security Council. Rhodes \u201cwas kind of like the quarterback,\u201d running the daily video conferences and coming up with lines of attack and parry. \u201cHe was extremely good about immediately getting to a phrase or a way of getting the message out that just made more sense,\u201d Kreikemeier remembers. Framing the deal as a choice between peace and war was Rhodes\u2019s go-to move \u2014 and proved to be a winning argument.The person whom Kreikemeier credits with running the digital side of the campaign was Tanya Somanader, 31, the director of digital response for the White House Office of Digital Strategy, who became known in the war room and on Twitter as @TheIranDeal. Early on, Rhodes asked her to create a rapid-response account that fact-checked everything related to the Iran deal. \u201cSo, we developed a plan that was like: The Iran deal is literally going to be the tip of everything that we stand up online,\u201d Somanader says. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to map it onto what we know about the different audiences we\u2019re dealing with: the public, pundits, experts, the right wing, Congress.\u201d By applying 21st-century data and networking tools to the white-glove world of foreign affairs, the White House was able to track what United States senators and the people who worked for them, and influenced them, were seeing online \u2014 and make sure that no potential negative comment passed without a tweet.As she explained how the process worked, I was struck by how na\u00efve the assumption of a \u201cstate of nature\u201d must seem in an information environment that is mediated less and less by experienced editors and reporters with any real prior knowledge of the subjects they write about. \u201cPeople construct their own sense of source and credibility now,\u201d she said. \u201cThey elect who they\u2019re going to believe.\u201d For those in need of more traditional-seeming forms of validation, handpicked Beltway insiders like Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic and Laura Rozen of Al-Monitor helped retail the administration\u2019s narrative. \u201cLaura Rozen was my RSS feed,\u201d Somanader offered. \u201cShe would just find everything and retweet it.\u201dRhodes\u2019s messaging campaign was so effective not simply because it was a perfectly planned and executed example of digital strategy, but also because he was personally involved in guiding the deal itself. In July 2012, Jake Sullivan, a close aide to Hillary Clinton, traveled to Muscat, Oman, for the first meeting with the Iranians, taking a message from the White House. \u201cIt was, \u2018We\u2019re prepared to open a direct channel to resolve the nuclear agreement if you are prepared to do the same thing and authorize it at the highest levels and engage in a serious discussion on these issues,\u2019\u2009\u201d Sullivan remembers. \u201cOnce that was agreed to, it was quickly decided that we resolve the nuclear agreement in two steps, the interim agreement and the final agreement.\u201d Subsequent meetings with the Iranians followed, during which he was joined by Deputy Secretary of State Bill Burns. \u201cBill and I had a huge amount of license to explore what the terms would look like, within the negotiating parameters,\u201d Sullivan says. \u201cWhat the precise trade-offs would be, between forms of sanctions relief and forms of restraints on their programs, that was left to us to feel out.\u201dThe fact that the president largely let his surrogates do the talking and the selling of the Iran deal \u2014 and even now, rarely talks about it in public \u2014 does not reflect his level of direct engagement. Sullivan and Burns spent hours before and after every session in Oman with the president and his closest advisers in the White House. When the president wasn\u2019t present, Rhodes always was. \u201cBen and I, in particular, the two of us, spent a lot of time thinking through all the angles,\u201d Sullivan says. \u201cWe spent three, four, five hours together in Washington talking things through before the meetings.\u201d In March 2013, a full three months before the elections that elevated Hassan Rouhani to the office of president, Sullivan and Burns finalized their proposal for an interim agreement, which became the basis for the J.C.P.O.A.The White House point person during the later stage of the negotiations was Rob Malley, a favored troubleshooter who is currently running negotiations that could keep the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in power. During the course of the Iran talks, Malley told me, he always kept in close contact with Rhodes. \u201cI would often just call him and say, \u2018Give me a reality check,\u2019\u2009\u201d Malley explained. \u201cHe could say, \u2018Here is where I think the president is, and here is where I think he will be.\u2019\u2009\u201d He continued, \u201cBen would try to anticipate: Does it make sense policywise? But then he would also ask himself: How do we sell it to Congress? How do we sell it to the public? What is it going to do to our narrative?\u201dMalley is a particularly keen observer of the changing art of political communication; his father, Simon Malley, who was born in Cairo, edited the politics magazine Afrique Asie and proudly provided a platform for Fidel Castro and Yasir Arafat, in the days when the leaders\u2019 words might take weeks to travel from Cuba or Cairo to Paris. \u201cThe Iran experience was the place where I saw firsthand how policy, politics and messaging all had to be brought together, and I think that Ben is really at the intersection of all three,\u201d Malley says. \u201cHe reflects and he shapes at the same time.\u201dAs Malley and representatives of the State Department, including Wendy Sherman and Secretary of State John Kerry, engaged in formal negotiations with the Iranians, to ratify details of a framework that had already been agreed upon, Rhodes\u2019s war room did its work on Capitol Hill and with reporters. In the spring of last year, legions of arms-control experts began popping up at think tanks and on social media, and then became key sources for hundreds of often-clueless reporters. \u201cWe created an echo chamber,\u201d he admitted, when I asked him to explain the onslaught of freshly minted experts cheerleading for the deal. \u201cThey were saying things that validated what we had given them to say.\u201dWhen I suggested that all this dark metafictional play seemed a bit removed from rational debate over America\u2019s future role in the world, Rhodes nodded. \u201cIn the absence of rational discourse, we are going to discourse the [expletive] out of this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had test drives to know who was going to be able to carry our message effectively, and how to use outside groups like Ploughshares, the Iran Project and whomever else. So we knew the tactics that worked.\u201d He is proud of the way he sold the Iran deal. \u201cWe drove them crazy,\u201d he said of the deal\u2019s opponents.Yet Rhodes bridled at the suggestion that there has been anything deceptive about the way that the agreement itself was sold. \u201cLook, with Iran, in a weird way, these are state-to-state issues. They\u2019re agreements between governments. Yes, I would prefer that it turns out that Rouhani and Zarif\u201d \u2014 Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran\u2019s foreign minister \u2014 \u201care real reformers who are going to be steering this country into the direction that I believe it can go in, because their public is educated and, in some respects, pro-American. But we are not betting on that.\u201dIn fact, Rhodes\u2019s passion seems to derive not from any investment in the technical specifics of sanctions or centrifuge arrays, or any particular optimism about the future course of Iranian politics and society. Those are matters for the negotiators and area specialists. Rather, it derived from his own sense of the urgency of radically reorienting American policy in the Middle East in order to make the prospect of American involvement in the region\u2019s future wars a lot less likely. When I asked whether the prospect of this same kind of far-reaching spin campaign being run by a different administration is something that scares him, he admitted that it does. \u201cI mean, I\u2019d prefer a sober, reasoned public debate, after which members of Congress reflect and take a vote,\u201d he said, shrugging. \u201cBut that\u2019s impossible.\u201dObama\u2019s particular revulsion against a certain kind of global power politics is a product, Rhodes suggests, of his having been raised in Southeast Asia. \u201cIndonesia was a place where your interaction at that time with power was very intimate, right?\u201d Rhodes asks. \u201cTens or hundreds of thousands of people had just been killed. Power was not some abstract thing,\u201d he muses. \u201cWhen we sit in Washington and debate foreign policy, it\u2019s like a Risk game, or it\u2019s all about us, or the human beings disappear from the decisions. But he lived in a place where he was surrounded by people who had either perpetrated those acts \u2014 and by the way, may not have felt great about that \u2014 or else knew someone who was a victim. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been an American president who had an experience like that at a young age of what power is.\u201dThe parts of Obama\u2019s foreign policy that disturb some of his friends on the left, like drone strikes, Rhodes says, are a result of Obama\u2019s particular kind of globalism, which understands the hard and at times absolute necessity of killing. Yet, at the same time, they are also ways of avoiding more deadly uses of force \u2014 a kind of low-body-count spin move.He leans back and opens a drawer in the file cabinet behind his desk, and removes a folder. \u201cI was going to show you something,\u201d he says, removing a sheaf of yellow legal paper covered in longhand. \u201cJust to confirm for you that he really is a writer.\u201d He shows me the president\u2019s copy of his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech, a revision of an original draft by Favreau and Rhodes whose defining tension was accepting a prize awarded before he had actually accomplished anything. In his longhand notes, Obama relocated the speech\u2019s tension in the fact that he was accepting a peace prize a week after ordering 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan. King and Gandhi were the author\u2019s heroes, yet he couldn\u2019t act as they did, because he runs a state. The reason that the author had to exercise power was because not everyone in the world is rational.We sit for a while, and I examine the president\u2019s thoughts unfolding on the page, and the lawyerly, abstract nature of his writing process. \u201cMoral imagination, spheres of identity, but also move beyond cheap lazy pronouncements,\u201d one note reads. Here was the new American self \u2014 rational, moral, not self-indulgent. No longer one thing but multiple overlapping spheres or circles. Who is described here? As usual, the author is describing himself.Valerie Jarrett has been called the president\u2019s work wife and is the only member of the West Wing staff who knew Obama before he began contemplating a run for the presidency. What I want to understand better, I tell her, are the swirls of the president\u2019s emotional fingerprint, which I saw in the longhand draft of his Nobel speech. We talk for a while about being American and at the same time being from somewhere else, and the split-screen experience of reality that experience allows. Jarrett was born in Iran and spent her early childhood there.\u201cWas it a point of connection between you and the president that you had each spent some substantial part of your childhoods living in another country?\u201d I ask. Her face lights up.\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she answers. The question is important to her. \u201cThe first conversation we had over dinner, when we first met, was about what it was like for both of us to live in countries that were predominantly Muslim countries at formative parts of our childhood and the perspective it gave us about the United States and how uniquely excellent it is,\u201d she says. \u201cWe talked about what it was like to be children, and how we played with children who had totally different backgrounds than our own but you would find something in common.\u201d She recalls her very first dinner together with the new fianc\u00e9 of her prot\u00e9g\u00e9e Michelle Robinson. \u201cI remember him asking me questions that I felt like no one else has ever asked me before,\u201d she says, \u201cand he asked me from a perspective of someone who knew the same experience that I had. So it felt really good. I was like, \u2018Oh, finally someone who gets it.\u2019\u2009\u201d\u201cHe is a brilliant guy, but he has a real problem with what I call the assignment of bad faith,\u201d one former senior official told me of the president. \u201cHe regards everyone on the other side at this point as being a bunch of bloodthirsty know-nothings from a different era who play by the old book. He hears arguments like, \u2018We should be punching Iran in the nose on its shipments of arms, and do it publicly,\u2019 or \u2018We should sanction the crap out of them for their ballistic-missile test and tell them that if they do it again we\u2019re going to do this or we\u2019re going to do that,\u2019 and he hears Dick Cheney in those arguments.\u201dAnother official I spoke to put the same point more succinctly: \u201cClearly the world has disappointed him.\u201d When I asked whether he believed that the Oval Office debate over Syria policy in 2012 \u2014 resulting in a decision not to support the uprising against Assad in any meaningful way \u2014 had been an honest and open one, he said that he had believed that it was, but has since changed his mind. \u201cInstead of adjusting his policies to the reality, and adjusting his perception of reality to the changing realities on the ground, the conclusions he draws are exactly the same, no matter what the costs have been to our strategic interests,\u201d he says. \u201cIn an odd way, he reminds me of Bush.\u201d The comparison is a startling one \u2014 and yet, questions of tone aside, it is uncomfortably easy to see the similarities between the two men, American presidents who projected their own ideas of the good onto an indifferent world.One of the few charter members of the Blob willing to speak on the record is Leon Panetta, who was Obama\u2019s head of the C.I.A. and secretary of defense and also enough of a product of a different culture to give honest answers to what he understands to be questions of consequence. At his institute at the old Fort Ord in Seaside, Calif., where, in the days before he wore Mr. Rogers sweaters, he served as a young Army intelligence officer, I ask him about a crucial component of the administration\u2019s public narrative on Iran: whether it was ever a salient feature of the C.I.A.\u2019s analysis when he ran the agency that the Iranian regime was meaningfully divided between \u201chard-line\u201d and \u201cmoderate\u201d camps.\u201cNo,\u201d Panetta answers. \u201cThere was not much question that the Quds Force and the supreme leader ran that country with a strong arm, and there was not much question that this kind of opposing view could somehow gain any traction.\u201dI ask Panetta whether, as head of the C.I.A., or later on, as secretary of defense, he ever saw the letters that Obama covertly sent to Khamenei, in 2009 and in 2012, which were only reported on by the press weeks later.\u201cNo,\u201d he answers, before saying he would \u201clike to believe\u201d that Tom Donilon, national security adviser since 2010, and Hillary Clinton, then secretary of state, had a chance to work on the offer they presented.As secretary of defense, he tells me, one of his most important jobs was keeping Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his defense minister, Ehud Barak, from launching a pre-emptive attack on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities. \u201cThey were both interested in the answer to the question, \u2018Is the president serious?\u2019\u2009\u201d Panetta recalls. \u201cAnd you know my view, talking with the president, was: If brought to the point where we had evidence that they\u2019re developing an atomic weapon, I think the president is serious that he is not going to allow that to happen.\u201dPanetta stops.\u201cBut would you make that same assessment now?\u201d I ask him.\u201cWould I make that same assessment now?\u201d he asks. \u201cProbably not.\u201dHe understands the president\u2019s pivot toward Iran as the logical result of a deeply held premise about the negative effects of use of American military force on a scale much larger than drone strikes or Special Forces raids. \u201cI think the whole legacy that he was working on was, \u2018I\u2019m the guy who\u2019s going to bring these wars to an end, and the last goddamn thing I need is to start another war,\u2019\u2009\u201d he explains of Obama. \u201cIf you ratchet up sanctions, it could cause a war. If you start opposing their interest in Syria, well, that could start a war, too.\u201dIn Panetta\u2019s telling, his own experience at the Pentagon under Obama sometimes resembled being installed in the driver\u2019s seat of a car and finding that the steering wheel and brakes had been disconnected from the engine. Obama and his aides used political elders like him, Robert Gates and Hillary Clinton as cover to end the Iraq war, and then decided to steer their own course, he suggests. While Panetta pointedly never mentions Rhodes\u2019s name, it is clear whom he is talking about.\u201cThere were staff people who put themselves in a position where they kind of assumed where the president\u2019s head was on a particular issue, and they thought their job was not to go through this open process of having people present all these different options, but to try to force the process to where they thought the president wanted to be,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019d say, \u2018Well, this is where we want you to come out.\u2019 And I\u2019d say \u2018[expletive], that\u2019s not the way it works. We\u2019ll present a plan, and then the president can make a decision.\u2019 I mean, Jesus Christ, it is the president of the United States, you\u2019re making some big decisions here, he ought to be entitled to hear all of those viewpoints and not to be driven down a certain path.\u201dBut that can\u2019t be true, I tell Panetta, because the aides he is talking about had no independent power aside from the authority that the president himself gave them.\u201cWell, that\u2019s a good question,\u201d Panetta allows. \u201cHe\u2019s a smart guy, he\u2019s not dumb.\u201d It\u2019s all part of the Washington blame game. Just as Panetta can blame young aides in order to avoid blaming the president for his actual choices, the president used his aides to tell Panetta to take a hike. Perhaps the president and his aides were continually unable to predict the consequences of their actions in Syria, and made mistake after mistake, while imagining that it was going to come out right the next time. \u201cAnother read, which isn\u2019t necessarily opposed to that,\u201d I continue, \u201cis that their actual picture is entirely coherent. But if they put it in blunt, unnuanced terms \u2014 \u201dPanetta completes my sentence: \u201c \u2014 they\u2019d get the [expletive] kicked out of them.\u201d He looks at me curiously. \u201cLet me ask you something,\u201d he says. \u201cDid you present this theory to Ben Rhodes?\u201dThere is something dangerously na\u00efve about this kind of talk, in which words like \u201cbalance,\u201d \u201cstakeholders\u201d and \u201cinterests\u201d are endlessly reshuffled like word tiles in a magnetic-poetry set, with little regard for the immutable contingencies that shaped America\u2019s role in the world. But that\u2019s hardly fair. Ben Rhodes wanted to do right, and maybe, when the arc of history lands, it will turn out that he did. At least, he tried. Something scared him, and made him feel as if the grown-ups in Washington didn\u2019t know what they were talking about, and it\u2019s hard to argue that he was wrong.What has interested me most about watching him and his cohort in the White House over the past seven years, I tell him, is the evolution of their ability to get comfortable with tragedy. I am thinking specifically about Syria, I add, where more than 450,000 people have been slaughtered.\u201cYeah, I admit very much to that reality,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a numbing element to Syria in particular. But I will tell you this,\u201d he continues. \u201cI profoundly do not believe that the United States could make things better in Syria by being there. And we have an evidentiary record of what happens when we\u2019re there \u2014 nearly a decade in Iraq.\u201dIraq is his one-word answer to any and all criticism. I was against the Iraq war from the beginning, I tell Rhodes, so I understand why he perpetually returns to it. I also understand why Obama pulled the plug on America\u2019s engagement with the Middle East, I say, but it was also true as a result that more people are dying there on his watch than died during the Bush presidency, even if very few of them are Americans. What I don\u2019t understand is why, if America is getting out of the Middle East, we are apparently spending so much time and energy trying to strong-arm Syrian rebels into surrendering to the dictator who murdered their families, or why it is so important for Iran to maintain its supply lines to Hezbollah. He mutters something about John Kerry, and then goes off the record, to suggest, in effect, that the world of the Sunni Arabs that the American establishment built has collapsed. The buck stops with the establishment, not with Obama, who was left to clean up their mess.It is clearly time for me to go. Rhodes walks me out into the sunlight of the West Wing parking lot, where we are treated to the sight of the aged Henry Kissinger, who has come to pay a visit. I ask Rhodes if he has ever met the famous diplomat before, and he tells me about the time they were seated together at a state dinner for the president of China. It was an interesting encounter to imagine, between Kissinger, who made peace with Mao\u2019s China while bombing Laos to bits, and Rhodes, who helped effect a similar diplomatic volte-face with Iran but kept the United States out of a civil war in Syria, which has caused more than four million people to become refugees. I ask Rhodes how it felt being seated next to the embodiment of American realpolitik. \u201cIt was surreal,\u201d he says, looking off into the middle distance. \u201cI told him I was going to Laos,\u201d he continues. \u201cHe got a weird look in his eye.\u201dThere is nothing snarky about his delivery. Rhodes just was bothered by seeing legless kids and unexploded cluster bombs in the jungle. He is not Henry Kissinger, or so his logic runs, even as the underlying realist suspicion \u2014 or contempt \u2014 for the idea of America as a moral actor is eerily similar. He is torn. As the president himself once asked, how are we supposed to weigh the tens of thousands who have died in Syria against the tens of thousands who have died in Congo?

As an adult, I don\u2019t subscribe to any religion. My immediate family, however, continues to be deeply religious and very much adheres to what I now believe are extreme views. They are, of course, free to worship as they please. I, however, take issue with the hypocrisy in their own lives. For example, they are strongly anti-choice, yet one had an abortion during a complicated pregnancy. They are \u201cpro-family,\u201d yet gave up an adopted child that became \u201ctoo difficult.\u201d They boycotted a parental wedding because the bride and groom were each previously married; participating would have \u201cblessed the sin.\u201d There is also a personal aspect for me in that they openly oppose L.G.B.T. rights, support politicians and groups that are extremely anti-gay, attend schools that require opposition to gay civil liberties in their codes of conduct and belong to anti-gay churches. I\u2019m openly gay. I have been told that I am not welcome in certain family members\u2019 homes because of my \u201clifestyle choice.\u201d While all of this is certainly confounding and hurtful, I\u2019ve come to terms with it and have limited nearly all of my interaction with my family, living a happy, successful life with friends I consider my chosen family. My relatives know why I no longer speak to them or attend functions, but they think this is entirely my fault. I could stop there, but your account of your family situation invites a response. It\u2019s sad when these sort of disagreements break up a family and natural, when hostility is directed at you, to be both resentful and highly critical. Yet your family\u2019s inconstancy in matters of sexual ethics may not be as unforgivable as you obviously feel it is. We all regularly fall short of our own standards. That\u2019s distinct from true hypocrisy, where you judge others publicly by certain standards and pretend to live by them yourself, while actually ignoring them when it suits you. For all you say, people of your family may well admit, in their own social circle, that they have sinned, because sinfulness is the normal condition of everyone, according to the traditions to which they belong. After all, you\u2019re not around to see how they handle the issue.The part of their behavior that\u2019s most morally worrisome, as you recount it, isn\u2019t their hypocrisy, it\u2019s their heartlessness. Boycotting a parent\u2019s wedding sounds unkind. It\u2019s hard to tell, on the basis of what you\u2019ve said, whether giving up their adopted child was also unkind, but it must surely have been difficult for the child. Finally, many people accept, indeed cherish, family members who are gay, even if they think homosexual acts are wrong. That\u2019s the response of a loving family, evangelical or not. After all, Christ, whom they seek to follow, hung out with tax collectors (who were even more unpopular then than now), and, when asked if it was permissible to stone a woman \u201ctaken in adultery,\u201d told the Pharisees that whoever among them was without sin should \u201ccast the first stone.\u201d That didn\u2019t require him to approve of taxation or infidelity.The heart of the matter is that you can maintain relationships with those who conscientiously disagree with you, even if they are living in ways you disapprove of. That would be my message to them. But also to you.Last weekend I was at a big dog park near downtown St. Paul. As I was leaving with my dog, I heard an agitated woman ahead of me tell her daughter: \u201cHe has to realize he can\u2019t pull this stuff anymore. Let\u2019s go!\u201d I assumed they were talking about a misbehaving dog, but they had a dog with them. And when the daughter (maybe 12) complained that \u201csomeone might take him away if he says he can\u2019t find his mom,\u201d I realized they were talking about a child. Against the daughter\u2019s protests, they got in their car and drove off, the mother assuring her daughter that she was \u201cnot going to leave him in a dog park.\u201d Curious, I stayed in my car and sure enough, eventually a boy, maybe 10, emerged from the gate looking very confused. He looked around but saw no mother, no sister, no car. I felt for the boy, but I also didn\u2019t want to ruin the mother\u2019s plan, which I assumed involved driving out of sight and then returning, just to send a message. I got out of my car, asked the boy if he was looking for his mother and sister (he nodded) and simply assured him that they were coming back. I thought about telling him more, but that seemed like an overstep. He went back into the park. I went back to my car and drove off. And sure enough, I passed the mother\u2019s car about 200 yards away from the park. I posted this dilemma on Facebook and got responses ranging from \u201cthat\u2019s child abuse, you should have called the police\u201d to \u201cthere\u2019s nothing wrong with leaving a child in a park for five minutes, we protect our kids too much and need to calm down.\u201d A few people also pointed out that merely by approaching the boy and trying to help him, I could be perceived as a sex offender (even though I was never closer than 10 feet). I wonder about the appropriateness of the mother\u2019s actions, as well as my own. This felt like a lose-lose situation. I\u2019m not the type to get involved in these kinds of incidents, but my instinct was that I needed to intervene just enough to remove the child\u2019s biggest potential anxiety: that his family had abandoned him.The truth is, we don\u2019t know very much about this boy\u2019s relationship with his family, except that it was going badly on the day you met. But leaving a 10-year-old to think that he might have been abandoned sounds cruel. You, very thoughtfully, went out of your way to reduce a child\u2019s distress, while not undermining the authority of his parent. I hope I would have done what you did. Given the current climate, though, I suppose I might have alerted a police officer instead.Kwame Anthony Appiah teaches philosophy at N.Y.U.

Gary next finds a document in an S.E.C. database and hits the \u201cDownload Later button.\u201d Then, as unattended men at subterranean computers are wont to do, Gary searches for \u201cbeautiful, nude and blond\u201d and is treated to a series of lewd images.E-weary and e-headache? Word search? Download Later? Fortunately for Franzen, these fin-de-millennium terms have not dimmed the reputation of his pre-9/11 novel, planted squarely in The Way We Live Now territory (or, as his critics might charge, The Way White Upper-\u00adMiddle-Class Midwesterners Live Now).Social-realist writers like Franzen who target the bull\u2019s-eye of contemporaneity, of course, still seek artistic timelessness. \u201cUlysses\u201d is an ultraprecise document of life in Dublin on June 16, 1904, but Bloom and Stephen\u2019s peregrinations are intended to reverberate outward in space and time. Joyce had it easier than Franzen, however, in bridging the chasm from the here and now to eternity. For starters, he began \u201cUlysses\u201d nearly a decade after the events described, essentially making it a work of historical fiction; he was already aware of what had gone extinct in its ecosystem.Also advantageous to Joyce was the epoch in which he wrote. Even for a modernist attuned to, well, what was modern, everyday technology wasn\u2019t that hard to keep up with, evolving at a much slower clip in 1904 than in 2001, which had dial-up velocity compared with the 4G bandwidth of 2016. In Joyce\u2019s era, paradigms shifted once in a long while (the light bulb, the automobile, the radio) and then remained generally the same, with incremental improvements. Now entire industries are disrupted overnight.Silicon Valley-era fiction writers are in a bind. To ignore the latest quotidian technology today (at least when concerning the middle and upper classes of developed nations, as most published fiction here tends to be) is to imagine some screenless 19th-century world in which people may as well still be riding in horse-drawn buggies instead of hailing Ubers and Lyfts and, not long from now, self-driving cars. Incorporating up-to-date devices and applications, on the other hand, risks mayfly ephemerality by the time the book has been printed (or, indeed, sent to Kindles). Consider how preposterous a novel composed in 2003 would look today \u2014 or even by 2005 \u2014 if a character logged in to the now-defunct social media site Friendster to check whether he had any new \u201ctestimonials.\u201d Movies, bearing the burden of actually showing graphics and interfaces, suffer more acute retrospective \u00adembarrassment.So what\u2019s a chronicler of the present to do? One tactic is to determine which technologies best represent the decade and also stand the greatest chance of outlasting the book\u2019s shelf life. Facebook and Twitter, for instance, seem like safer bets to me than Snapchat and Seamless. Alternatively, one can anonymize the technology, lest it soon be replaced. Instead of having a character watching a show on Netflix or HBO Go, it might be more prudent to talk of generically \u201cstreaming\u201d it (a term that may someday look as needlessly silly as \u201cword search\u201d). Many post-Pynchon writers invent their own \u00adfuturistic-sounding tech companies and products, too, as a workaround for imminent \u00adoldfangledness and, perhaps, legal repercussions. But such evasions can come off as coy or phony, the same way that made-up celebrity names in fiction typically sound overdetermined and absurd \u2014 although no more overdetermined and absurd than Tom Cruise or Ke$ha.The most radical approach, though, is to put the technology directly under one\u2019s writerly microscope. Analyze it, situate it in a historical context, dissect and reassemble it before our eyes to make us see it \u2014 and our tech-besotted culture \u2014 anew. The result may someday look like the antiquated \u201ce-weary,\u201d but it\u2019s an earnest assessment of current conditions with restricted foresight. A Gchat transcription without any attempt to understand the medium\u2019s message is merely typo-riddled dialogue.Or do the exact opposite. Don\u2019t write about the newest gadget as if it\u2019s a marvel; simply treat it as part of the backdrop, like the landline. We send texts now, a form of communication I expect will seem quaint not too far into the future. \u201cHe texted that he was running late\u201d is sufficient. \u201cHe opened up the text-messaging application on his Apple iPhone 6 Plus and keyed into the 5.5-inch screen that he was running late\u201d is in advertorial thrall and aesthetically ugly.That\u2019s a hyperbolic example, but I nearly fell into a similar trap with my new novel. I had initially written that the protagonist was watching \u201cInternet porn.\u201d Then I realized that few young men these days find their pornography offline and deleted \u201cInternet.\u201d I figure this will provide a little more durability until virtual reality repaves the pornographic landscape and the notion of someone\u2019s being passively \u00adtitillated by a 2-D, low-definition video is risible.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Students at Fake University Say They Were Collateral Damage in Sting Operation", "Date": "2016-05-05", "News": "Supported byFor foreign-born students desperate to stay in the United States, the University of Northern New Jersey seemed like the perfect solution: They did not have to go to class, but they could get coveted student visas and still work at their dream jobs.They just needed to pay a broker anywhere from $3,000 to $12,000. Over the last three and a half years, more than a thousand agreed.That was their mistake.Twenty-five students were listed as anonymous co-conspirators, but officials say all of them knew they were committing fraud by not going to class. Within days, 1,076 of them were ordered to appear in immigration court, facing deportation or even a lifetime ban from the United States.\u201cThey were 100 percent fully aware,\u201d said Alvin Phillips, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security. \u201cAll purported students are recorded at some point or another fully going along with the pay-to-stay scheme.\u201dThere are both audio and video recordings from the president\u2019s office in New Jersey, when students called or visited, Mr. Phillips said. He personally witnessed some of these exchanges, and heard students admit they knew the university would not have classes.But in interviews, more than a dozen students insisted that they were collateral damage in the sting operation, duped by both the brokers and the government.In some cases, their efforts to verify the university or even transfer were rebuffed by the brokers, they say. In other instances, the students point to what they say was active deception by the government: in-person meetings with the university\u2019s supposed president, letters confirming they could work instead of go to class, and Twitter messages about classes canceled because of bad weather.In October, A., a young man from Shanghai living in New York City, was so frustrated when the university had not sent a needed eligibility form that he rented a car and drove to the campus. (A., like most of the students, insisted on being identified only by an initial because their immigration cases were still pending or their families back home did not know their situation.)At the university\u2019s office in a nondescript building off the Garden State Parkway in Cranford, a man presenting himself as the institution\u2019s president, Steve Brunetti, signed the form. He told A. how proud he was of all \u201chis students\u201d and gave him a souvenir.It was a slick T-shirt with the letters UNNJ on the front. On the left sleeve was an American flag.A. said he did not think the experience was odd. \u201cI just figured that was the way it was done,\u201d he said.Winona Sun, an art therapist in Brooklyn, learned of the sting operation while she was in China visiting her parents, when her visa to re-enter the United States was revoked. \u201cI feel it\u2019s over-punishment,\u201d she said in a telephone interview from China. \u201cIf the target is for the brokers, why do they want to tear people down and lie to me?\u201dThe federal government accredits 8,687 educational institutions in the United States to enroll international students; 1.18 million are currently studying here. The students enrolled at the University of Northern New Jersey had all come to the United States legally and had earned degrees from schools including the University of Chicago, the University of Michigan and Fordham.A number of the students failed to get an H-1B and seemed out of options \u2014 with jobs at Facebook, Google and Morgan Stanley on the line. Others were seeking to transfer from colleges they heard were under investigation to stay one step ahead of immigration officials.That is when the University of Northern New Jersey beckoned.According to some students, brokers assured them that they could immediately earn credit hours for their work experience in a program called Curricular Practical Training, without taking classes.Most of the students were from China and India, where working with brokers is a familiar way of doing business. But in retrospect, they seem to have ignored what should have been red flags, whether because they were overly trusting, willfully ignorant or willing participants in visa fraud.Ms. Sun, 29, earned a master\u2019s degree in art therapy at a Massachusetts college and moved to New York to work for a nonprofit social services agency. (She declined to name the college or the organization because she did not want to endanger her application for a waiver to return to the United States.)Her employer applied for an H-1B visa for her, but she faced a gap of several months before it would come through.Ms. Sun said her broker told her she could work instead of taking classes, but referred her to the university. In February 2015, after she enrolled, Ms. Sun said she called there approximately 20 times; no one responded.\u201cIf one person called me back and told me it was fake, I would not have gone to the University of Northern New Jersey,\u201d Ms. Sun said. \u201cWhat else can I do? I don\u2019t know the American system.\u201dZ., who is 27 and also from China, did not win the H-1B lottery. He found the University of Northern New Jersey online without a broker. \u201cHow risky will it be for obtaining full-time C.P.T. without attending any classes?\u201d he wrote to the university in an email he showed to The New York Times, referring to Curricular Practical Training.Without a direct answer, Z. said he fell back on the university\u2019s government accreditation. A year passed.When he asked how he would provide evidence for another H-1B application, the university suggested making up classes from a template, and to send it in with $620.That was the final flag. Unlike students who were listed as co-conspirators, Z. did not fabricate school transcripts. Instead, he transferred.But on April 5, his student status was terminated because he had been enrolled at the fake university for more than 45 days.K., a 30-year-old from China who earned an M.B.A. in New England, began to suspect something about the university after he had worked for a year and did not hear about the start of classes. \u201cI was wondering if there was a lecture or something I could attend,\u201d he said. His broker told him online classes were coming soon.K. said that he, too, relied on the university\u2019s accreditations. \u201cIf the government is not trustworthy, who should we trust?\u201d he said.His girlfriend, S., 26, whom he met at business school, was accepted to the university the next year, in January 2016. But she said the broker told her that her authorization form and the school schedule would be delayed while the university expanded to two more campuses.The couple went to the campus in Cranford in March, only to find the doors locked, supposedly because it was spring break.Then at 8:20 a.m. on April 5, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents knocked on the door of their rural New England home.K. and S. were detained in separate cells for several hours. The next day, K. resigned from his job at a local company. They are both waiting for hearing dates.Like the other students, they were notified that they needed to leave the country or apply for reinstatement of their student visas. But students have said that few colleges, if any, have been willing to sponsor them after they were tainted by the University of Northern New Jersey. Reinstatement ultimately depends on the government\u2019s approval.The students say they have been put in an untenable position financially. They paid thousands of dollars either to brokers or directly to the university. Eight students alone said they spent a combined $46,000. Some paid the university via PayPal or cash, with the money going to a holding company listed on some students\u2019 invoices: Waterfall Properties.As they wait for a hearing in immigration court that could take a year or longer, they cannot legally work.\u201cTypically in any fraud investigation, it is our policy that we do not refund any money,\u201d Mr. Phillips, the Homeland Security spokesman, said.\u201cAbsolutely there was a message,\u201d Mr. Phillips added. \u201cWe welcome international students in America, but they must do so according to the standards, the right way.\u201dThe brokers may have recognized the University of Northern New Jersey as a visa mill, Mr. Nassirian said, but he could see how some students could be deceived by its certifications. \u201cCan you really blame a student,\u201d he said, \u201ceven if they are a little greedy, a little gullible, or a little too hopeful?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump and Paul Ryan Speak Warmly and Air Their Differences", "Date": "2016-05-13", "News": "There was harmony, if not unity, after a series of meetings on Thursday between Donald J. Trump and the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan; the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky; and other members of Congress. Both Mr. Ryan and Mr. Trump had warm words about their meeting, though neither of them suggested that all their differences had been resolved. The issue of conservative judges came up in the meeting. Mr. Trump said that he would soon release a list of his potential nominees for federal courts and that he had be working on it with the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society, according to an attendee at the closed meeting with House members. Mr. Trump asked the members of Congress to send suggestions. But Mr. Ryan, armed with charts to show the budget process and why he believes cuts to entitlement programs are necessary, made clear to Mr. Trump that while he respected what Mr. Trump had accomplished, there were many voters in the Republican primaries who did not vote for him.

{"Headline": "Ted Cruz Backers Seek to Control Convention Platform", "Date": "2016-05-09", "News": "Senator Ted Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supporters are mounting an effort to seize control of the Republican platform and the rules governing the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s July convention, the first indication that Mr. Cruz will not simply hand his delegates over to Donald J. Trump.In an email sent Sunday to pro-Cruz convention delegates, a top aide to the Texas senator wrote that it was \u00e2\u0080\u009cstill possible to advance a conservative agenda at the convention.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo do that, it is imperative that we fill the Rules and Platform Committees with strong conservative voices like yours,\u00e2\u0080\u009d wrote Ken Cuccinelli, who was the campaign\u00e2\u0080\u0099s former delegate wrangler and a former attorney general of Virginia. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat means you need to come to the national convention and support others in coming, too!\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Cruz is planning a Monday evening conference call where, as Mr. Cuccinelli writes, Mr. Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s former officials plan to \u00e2\u0080\u009cdiscuss what we can do at the convention to protect against liberal changes to our platform, and how we can right the wrongs in the rules from 2012!\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe \u00e2\u0080\u009cwrongs\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cuccinelli was referring to are the changes pushed through at the last convention by supporters of Mitt Romney that would have made it harder for a candidate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name to be placed in nomination.But Mr. Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supporters and other conservative activists are also deeply concerned about Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s general election agenda, and want to ensure that he does not alter the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s platform.   Since locking up the nomination last week, Mr. Trump has made clear he intends to run a populist campaign against Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, indicating he is open to higher taxes and an increase in the minimum wage.The party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s convention rules and policy platform are determined every four years by temporary committees comprised of a select group of convention delegates.  The rules and platform are then ratified or rejected by all the delegates at the convention. With the assumption that the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nomination would not be decided on the first convention ballot, Mr. Cruz spent considerable time this spring electing delegates favorable to him to the July convention in Cleveland.   So while he is out of the race, many of his supporters will still be delegates.  And while many convention delegates are bound to support Mr. Trump on the first ballot, they are free to vote their conscience on matters relating to convention rules and the platform. The email, which carries the \u00e2\u0080\u009cCruz-Fiorina\u00e2\u0080\u009d logo, was forwarded to The New York Times by a convention delegate.  Reached by telephone, Mr. Cuccinelli authenticated the message.  As for Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rhetorical shifts in recent days, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnothing I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen since a week ago has been surprising to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut Mr. Cuccinelli said Mr. Cruz, who has been silent since withdrawing from the race last Tuesday, had no intention of trying to rewrite convention rules in an effort to deny Mr. Trump the nomination.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important that this not appear as though we are pulling a stunt at this convention,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, adding that the goal is to advocate for policies preferred by the sort of hard-line conservatives who backed Mr. Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is about protecting movement conservatism,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, pointing to party planks on abortion and saying the delegates should consider language regarding transgender bathroom access.\u201cWe want to have girls go in girls\u2019 bathrooms,\u201d he said, highlighting an issue on which Mr. Trump has broken with social conservatives by supporting the rights of transgender people to use the bathroom of their choice.A top adviser to Mr. Trump, Paul Manafort, downplayed Mr. Cruz\u2019s effort to take control of the convention panels.\u201cIf there wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t interest and activity around the platform that would be a  surprise,\u201d said Mr. Manafort, noting that debate around the party\u2019s policies is almost always a feature of Republican conventions.  He said they would work with \u201cthe various campaigns\u201d to find consensus on the platform.Mr. Cuccinelli\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plea to the delegates comes as Mr. Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own supporters appear divided over whether to get behind Mr. Trump.  Some of his most forceful backers \u00e2\u0080\u0093 such as Rick Perry, the former Texas governor, and the pollster Kellyanne Conway, who ran a pro-Cruz super PAC \u00e2\u0080\u0093 have come out for the presumptive nominee they spent months deriding.  But some of Mr. Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top aides remain bitter about a campaign that saw Mr. Trump mock the senator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife and float conspiracy theories about his father. Even if Mr. Cruz had not intervened, platform-related tension between Mr. Trump and social conservatives was likely inevitable.   Many Christian conservatives harbor deep suspicions about Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true beliefs and how compatible they are with the long-held, hard-line stances espoused in the platform.His supportive comments about aspects of Planned Parenthood\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work and his previous support for abortion rights are among the red flags that were been making social conservatives nervous, even before he professed support for letting transgender people use whichever bathroom they choose. Tony Perkins, one of the platform committee members from Louisiana and the president of the influential Family Research Council, said that delegates like him will need to feel more reassured than they do now. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne of the things that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be required for people like me to be supportive of his candidacy is the platform,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Perkins said, insisting that he and others on the committee who would have preferred to see Mr. Cruz become the nominee will not tolerate any watering down in the language. Mr. Perkins said that the platform is one way that Cruz delegates hope to still exert influence, despite having lost the battle for the nomination. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is where the Cruz factor comes in,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTed Cruz has been vigilant and methodical in selecting and identifying conservative delegates who are not aligned with the party, per se, but aligned with the conservative ideology.

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "Once upon a time, there was a city where people looked at each other or their surroundings instead of their cellphones. Where they spoke to one another, rather than making some clever online comment. Back then, in the 1970s, Manhattan was still rough, and not just on the edges, but through and through, it seemed. And so it was a time when street photographers could roam the streets and find inspiration all around, engaging with their subjects to capture moments of subtlety, beauty and serendipity. This was the New York that Carrie Boretz discovered when she started working in 1975 as a photo intern at The Village Voice.  There was enough to be found on the street that she did not have to make a living doing still lifes or fashion. She wanted real life.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI just wanted to be on the street and shoot normal people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI saw things clearly. Things just bombarded my vision. It was so easy, it often didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem like work, to be honest.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHer images through the decades show a photographer engaged with the city, finding unexpected moments, often with a sly sense of humor. Many of them also have something that can only be called heart, evoking in the viewer a feeling that connects them to what is happening in these carefully composed frames.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI never shoot with my eye,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Boretz said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my heart that leads. I feel too much, that heart on the sleeve thing. I tried to be an intellectual person, but that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fly.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMs. Boretz was born and raised on Long Island, surrounded by images from the Farm Security Administration. Her father, Alvin, was a television writer and playwright who was friends with the F.S.A. photographer Russell Lee. She still recalls how her parents would sit down with her and go through Library of Congress prints by the great F.S.A. photographers.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was mesmerized by images from the 1940s,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt seemed natural to want to be one, I was always comfortable with a camera. I was shy, too, and this was a way to get out there.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Lee proved to be an early supporter, after she wrote to him asking for advice. About to graduate from Washington University in St. Louis, where she had worked for the student paper, she wondered if she should do something that would be of direct benefit to people, like becoming a doctor.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wanted him to write back and say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Do what your heart tells you,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u200a\u00e2\u0080\u009d she recalled. \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u200a  \u00e2\u0080\u0098That photography could affect people in a more indirect way, and that being a photojournalist was just as important.\u2019 And he did just that.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWith that encouragement, she set off for New York, working under Fred McDarrah at The Voice. After a few months, she was on her own, landing assignments for magazines and newspapers. At the same time, she also knew that she wanted a family. That meant she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to go off to war zones or spend days on end wandering city streets. She recalled being aghast early in her career when she heard a famous female photographer talk about sacrificing having children in order to pursue her career. Ms. Boretz knew that was not for her.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wanted this normal life,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to be out all night. Compared to other photographers I knew, it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t everything to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn that regard, the 1990s were good to her. While she was raising her two daughters, she could drop them off at school and still have a good four hours to do day pictures for The New York Times (where her husband, Ed Keating, was a staff photographer at the time).\u00e2\u0080\u009cThose were the best years of my career,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI had a real reverence for the people I shot. I was never harsh as a shooter. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d go to neighborhoods I had no business being in and try to blend. Then I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d go back, and back and back. I was given an opportunity to shoot a slice of New York every day.\u00e2\u0080\u009dShe switched to photo editing after a while, working at a magazine until 2013. The year before, when her father died, something told her she should start scanning her negatives, which led to her decision to publish \u00e2\u0080\u009cStreet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That process helped her reconnect with the rush of being a street photographer.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are really touching,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why I became a photographer. Of course we all think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to change the world. I just wanted to touch someone with one image.\u00e2\u0080\u009dShe sounds happy, with no regrets.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI chose to have it all, and I think I really did,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy kids are fabulous. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re amazing. I feel complete.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}

A number of current and former members of the military said the raised fists were an inappropriate and divisive sign of allegiance with the Black Lives Matter movement. Some called for the cadets\u2019 punishment or dismissal.\u201cI find that, based upon available evidence, none of the participants, through their actions, intended to show support for a political movement,\u201d said the investigator, whose name was redacted in a public copy of the inquiry finding released by West Point.\u201cAs members of the Profession of Arms, we are held to a high standard, where our actions are constantly observed and scrutinized in the public domain,\u201d the letter said. \u201cWe all must understand that a symbol or gesture that one group of people may find harmless may offend others. As Army officers, we are not afforded the luxury of a lack of awareness of how we are perceived.\u201dIn deciding its response, West Point, which is 80 percent male and 70 percent white, had to balance its desire to increase diversity with its need for uniformity among leaders, said Mary Tobin, a 2003 graduate active in minority recruiting.\u201cIt\u2019s hard; these young cadets have a lot of demands put on them,\u201d Ms. Tobin said. \u201cYou have to manage perception and be very careful in ways other students their age don\u2019t.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not fair, but when you are a leader, you have to make challenges that others don\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cI am more than confident there will be a lot of cultural training on this issue because of the photo.\u201dThe photograph was one of three poses the women took in dress uniforms, the inquiry said, adding that the women said their intent was to \u201cshowcase the awesome black women in our class.\u201d After taking a serious photograph, and one making silly faces, two cadets proposed raising fists.Other women were hesitant, the investigator found. They said, \u201cAre we really doing this?\u201d But one cadet assured them, \u201cWe won\u2019t get in trouble,\u201d according to the inquiry\u2019s findings.The photograph, which circulated via Facebook and Twitter, angered some at West Point who found the raised fist \u2014 long associated with black power movements \u2014 offensive and divisive. Several members of the military alerted military newspapers and bloggers, saying the women had violated Army regulations.Many West Point graduates responded that they had raised fists as part of chants at football games and other celebrations without scrutiny, and questioned whether the women were being held to a different standard.In his letter, General Caslen echoed this sentiment, saying: \u201cLast December, on the night before the Army-Navy game, I joined hundreds of staff and graduates in raising our fist in support of the Army football team during the Army-Navy pep rally video. The time, place and manner of a symbol can also hold significant meaning and influence perception.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "Sometimes I wonder if my parents will ever understand why I make pictures.They came to Massachusetts 25 years ago from Central America. My father, Rubio, was from El Salvador and had grown up during its civil war. My mother, Katy, immigrated to the United States from Guatemala when she was 16 years old. They both wanted to escape the violence and have better lives.I was born soon after they got here, although they separated when I was 3. I lived with my dad until I was 7, then moved in with my mom. They and all of my relatives worked at restaurants, factories, those kinds of jobs. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a weird contrast \u00e2\u0080\u0094 they said they had been unable to have real careers in their country and would rather be working here. Even though they got tired and were sick of working 12-hour shifts, six days a week, they said they were happy with the life they had. But I sensed sadness.When I started making these pictures, I was looking at how my generation tried to fit into both cultures, how we were in situations where we had to help our parents with different tasks, from translating for them at the hospital to taking them to work and other things. In a way, there was always pressure on my cousins and me to do well, as if our successes would justify our parents\u2019 sacrifices. So the pictures weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t so much for a larger project, but more about me, so I included myself in a lot of the pictures.But when I showed them at school, everyone was very interested in my family and how I portrayed them. There was one photo of my aunt, a single mother of three kids, that showed her walking to the bus stop at 5 in the morning. She would drop off her kids at day care, then go to Dunkin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Donuts for a 10-hour shift and then go home to take care of the kids. Another aunt had lost her home and worked 12 hours a day at a factory.Still, this project didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t click until last January. The summer before, the pressure had built up: I had graduated from college, was living at home, trying to find my identity and figure out what to do with my life. I tried escaping reality and went to Mexico. But I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t escape reality. One day, I sat down and started looking through my pictures and reading the things I had written in college.And then it hit me.I had done all of this because of the pressure my parents put on me to graduate. Just trying to find my own path in life made me realize what I had been trying to say. I needed to honor them and their work, their sacrifices. And you know what? Looking through my old photos, I found many that connected to this new idea. It was a feeling I always had.My mom never understood what I do, but she tried. I know she cares and believes in me. But she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a very traditional Latina who thought I should find the perfect man, get married and have children she could take care of while I go take pictures. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want that for myself, not yet. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an emotional thing I still haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been able to confront her about. There is a fear inside me that maybe she and my relatives won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand what I do and never appreciate it. But that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why I took these pictures: I did this for my mom. Maybe I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the guts to tell her how I really feel, so this is a way to talk about it without talking about it.It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just my mom, but my family. Their sacrifices were worthwhile, for my cousins and for me. To this day, everything we have done and continue to do is with the hope we can one day buy them that house they want.As told to David Gonzalez."}

Photographs, he said, have to connect with the community where they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re made, not just to be exhibited there but to engage residents in discussions.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not an artist,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told Lens in 2011, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a messenger.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Rosenthal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s images sometimes show empty lots and abandoned buildings, but the photos are about the people, who always have dignity. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s partly because he talked with everyone, no matter their station in life, on the same level and with compassion. Perhaps it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because he, too, was born in the Bronx and mostly grew up there. For a few years his family lived in South Carolina, where he said they encountered anti-Semitism. They returned to the Bronx.   Mr. Rosenthal graduated from City College and became involved in the civil rights movement. After teaching English at Vassar College for a couple of years, he found photography, which he said fit perfectly with his social activism. In 1975 he started teaching photography at SUNY Empire State College, and he urged his students to get close to their subjects. When he started to photograph his old Bronx neighborhood, he held himself to that same standard. The South Bronx was awash in social activism at the time, and Mr. Rosenthal photographed many demonstrations there. He participated in a few of those protests himself. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI had shows in local bars,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI photographed everyone on Bathgate Avenue. I always gave pictures back to the people. I always told my students, \u00e2\u0080\u0098You lose points if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give pictures back to your subjects.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u200a\u00e2\u0080\u009dOne of those students was Ricky Flores, who is now a staff photographer for The Journal News in Westchester. He grew up in the Longwood section of the Bronx and knew many of the people Mr. Rosenthal photographed.\u00e2\u0080\u009cMel was not parachuting in and documenting a foreign place,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Flores said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe always talked about showing people in a compassionate way. Other photographers don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always get that. Their work is done just for themselves, instead of raising questions of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on and how do we change that.\u00e2\u0080\u009dOver the more than 35 years that Mr. Rosenthal was at Empire State, he taught and mentored generations of young documentarians including Andrew Lichtenstein, Catherine McGann and Meg Handler. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMel\u2019s influence had to do with how one approached making and looking at pictures,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ms. Handler, a photographer who is also editor at large of Reading the Pictures. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was about being humanistic, empathic and really feeling a connection \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a commitment \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to what one was photographing, and the story one was attempting to tell. For a certain group of photographers in N.Y.C. in the early \u00e2\u0080\u009990s, I feel like Mel encouraged us to be progressive, socially aware and, at the same time, as objective as we could be.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Michael Kamber, was living in the South Bronx in the 1980s when Mr. Rosenthal let him sit in on classes even though he couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afford the tuition.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere was all of the things you got other places, like composition and technique, but Mel was completely focused on social change for the community where you were photographing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Kamber said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMel planted the idea that you can do good with your camera.\u00e2\u0080\u009dLike starting the Bronx Documentary Center, which Mr. Kamber did in 2011 to showcase photojournalism and train new generations of Bronx residents.

{"Headline": "A Drumbeat of Multiple Shootings, but America Isn\u2019t Listening", "Date": "2016-05-22", "News": "The Daily TollMost shootings with four deaths or injuries are invisible outside their communities. And most of the lives they scar are black.Supported byCINCINNATI \u2014 After the slaughter of nine worshipers at a South Carolina church last June, but before the massacre of eight students and a teacher at an Oregon community college in October, there was a shooting that the police here have labeled Incident 159022597.01. It happened on a clear Friday night at an Elks Lodge, on a modest block of clapboard houses northeast of this city\u2019s hilly downtown. Unlike the butchery that bookended it, it merited no presidential statements, no saturation television coverage.But what took place at 6101 Prentice Street on Aug. 21 may say more about the nature of gun violence in the United States than any of those far more famous rampages. It is a snapshot of a different sort of mass violence \u2014 one that erupts with such anesthetic regularity that it is rendered almost invisible, except to the mostly black victims, survivors and attackers.According to the police account, more than 30 people had gathered in the paneled basement bar of the lodge to mark the 39th birthday of a man named Greg Wallace when a former neighbor, Timothy Murphy, showed up, drunk. Fists flew. Mr. Murphy ducked out the door, burst back in with a handgun, and opened fire.As partygoers scrambled for the door, he chased Greg Wallace\u2019s younger brother Dawaun to a tiny black-and-white-tiled bathroom, where he shot him nine times before the violence spilled out onto the street. There, another Wallace relative, also armed with a handgun, fired back at him.By the end, 27 bullets had flown, hitting seven people: Mr. Murphy, who died; Dawaun Wallace, who was grievously wounded; four bystanders, one of whom was hit in the genitals, another in the leg.And Barry Washington.A seasonal packer for Amazon.com, Mr. Washington, 56, had stopped at the lodge on his way to the store for cigarettes, said his sister, Jaci Washington. He was in the bathroom when Mr. Murphy cornered Dawaun Wallace there. A single bullet pierced Mr. Washington\u2019s arm, then his heart.He left behind a son, a daughter, a brother, a sister, a mother and four grandchildren.\u201cMy brother died on the floor of a bathroom for no reason,\u201d Ms. Washington said. \u201cHe had nothing to do with the whole situation. I can\u2019t believe I lost my brother like this.\u201dYet many in the neighborhood where they grew up, she said, responded with a shrug. \u201cThe reality is, this happens quite frequently,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s kind of, \u2018Oh, well, this guy was killed today. Somebody else will be killed tomorrow.\u2019 \u201dIn some cities, law enforcement officials say a growing share of shootings involve more than one victim, possibly driven by increased violence between street gangs. But data are scarce.Seeking deeper insight into the phenomenon, The New York Times identified and analyzed these 358 shootings with four or more casualties, drawing on two databases assembled from news reports and citizen contributors, and then verifying details with law enforcement agencies.They chronicle how easily lives are shattered when a firearm is readily available \u2014 in a waistband, a glove compartment, a mailbox or garbage can that serves as a gang\u2019s gun locker. They document the mayhem spawned by the most banal of offenses: a push in a bar, a Facebook taunt, the wrong choice of music at a house party. They tally scores of unfortunates in the wrong place at the wrong time: an 11-month-old clinging to his mother\u2019s hip, shot as she prepared to load him into a car; a 77-year-old church deacon, killed by a stray bullet while watching television on his couch.The shootings took place everywhere, but mostly outdoors: at neighborhood barbecues, family reunions, music festivals, basketball tournaments, movie theaters, housing project courtyards, Sweet 16 parties, public parks. Where motives could be gleaned, roughly half involved or suggested crime or gang activity. Arguments that spun out of control accounted for most other shootings, followed by acts of domestic violence.The typical victim was a man between 18 and 30, but more than 1 in 10 were 17 or younger. Less is known about those who pulled the triggers because nearly half of the cases remain unsolved. But of those arrested or identified as suspects, the average age was 27.Most of the shootings occurred in economically downtrodden neighborhoods. These shootings, by and large, are not a middle-class phenomenon.The divide is racial as well. Among the cases examined by The Times were 39 domestic violence shootings, and they largely involved white attackers and victims. So did many of the high-profile massacres, including a wild shootout between Texas biker gangs that left nine people dead and 18 wounded.Over all, though, nearly three-fourths of victims and suspected assailants whose race could be identified were black. Some experts suggest that helps explain why the drumbeat of dead and wounded does not inspire more outrage.\u201cClearly, if it\u2019s black-on-black, we don\u2019t get the same attention because most people don\u2019t identify with that. Most Americans are white,\u201d said James Alan Fox, a professor of criminology at Northeastern University in Boston. \u201cPeople think, \u2018That\u2019s not my world. That\u2019s not going to happen to me.\u2019 \u201dMichael Nutter, a former Philadelphia mayor, who is black, said that society would not be so complacent if whites were dying from gun violence at the same rate as blacks.\u201cThe general view is it\u2019s one bad black guy who has shot another bad black guy,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so, one less person to worry about.\u201dDroves of experts study high-profile massacres by so-called lone-wolf assailants, usually driven by mental disorders, at schools, workplaces and other public spaces. Academics regularly crunch data on single homicides and assaults. But the near-daily shootings that wound or kill several victims \u2014 a relatively small subset of the shootings that kill nearly 11,000 people and wound roughly 60,000 more each year \u2014 are uncharted territory for researchers, said Richard B. Rosenfeld, a professor of criminology at the University of Missouri-St. Louis.Four or more casualties is a far broader measure than \u201cmass shootings,\u201d which are commonly defined as the killing of at least four people, not including the attacker. But it captures many victims who some criminologists say are too often ignored: people who might have died given a slightly different trajectory of a bullet, or less-sophisticated medical care.Counting assailants among casualties increased the total number of cases by fewer than three dozen, most of them domestic violence shootings that ended in suicide. Hispanics were not separately identified, because police reports do not systematically identify victims and suspects by ethnicity, only by race.There are 358 reasons for those 358 shootings, though some remain a mystery; in about a fourth of the cases, investigators have discerned no motive.As for the rest, some patterns stand out. The fewest occurred while another felony, such as a burglary, was underway. Domestic violence shootings were nearly as infrequent, but were among the deadliest.About a third were provoked by arguments, typically drug- or alcohol-fueled, often over petty grievances.A sampling:Outside a crowded bar in Decatur, Ill., a customer found an expensive watch. When another man insisted it was his, the customer pulled out a semiautomatic handgun, shot the man in the face and wounded four people near him.After a day of drinking, singing karaoke and watching football, four middle-aged friends in a small town north of Baton Rouge, La., got into a fight \u2014 some said over the choice of music. One shot the other three, then killed himself.Outside an Orlando, Fla., housing project, lewd comments about a young man\u2019s pregnant girlfriend resulted in 15 to 20 gunshots. A 10-year-old boy who peered out his window at the fracas was struck directly in one eye. One of three wounded adults later acknowledged that \u201ca one-on-one fist fight would have settled the issue,\u201d the police report said.Another third of the 358 cases \u2014 and the most common in cities with more than 250,000 residents \u2014 were either gang-related or were drive-by shootings typical of gangs.But the police and prosecutors say many of those were not directly linked to criminal activity, such as a dispute over a drug deal. More often, a minor dust-up \u2014 a boast, an insult, a decision to play basketball on another gang\u2019s favorite court \u2014 was taken as a sign of disrespect and answered with a bullet, said Andrew V. Papachristos, a Yale University professor who studies gang behavior.Over all, two-thirds of shootings took place outdoors, endangering innocent people. More than 100 bystanders, from toddlers to grandparents, were injured or killed.Among them: eight family members shot as they bade one another goodbye after a reunion in Philadelphia; a soldier struck by a stray bullet during a shootout in a public square in Savannah, Ga.; a 19-year-old college sophomore killed when a gunman sprayed a crowd outside an Ocala, Fla., club.In Cincinnati, where last year\u2019s toll of 479 gun deaths and injuries was the highest in nine years, a growing share of shootings involves more than one victim \u2014 1 in 8 attacks with guns in the first half of last year compared with 1 in 12 over the same span in 2010.Police officials in some other cities have noted a similar trend, though others say they have not. What is behind the upticks, they said, is a matter of speculation.In Rochester, multiple-victim shootings accounted for fewer than 15 percent of victims in 2006; so far this year, they make up 38 percent. Police Chief Michael Ciminelli said that he suspected that social media was playing a role by simultaneously catalyzing minor disputes into deadly standoffs and drawing more people into them.Larry C. Smith, interim chief of police in Durham, N.C., and a 28-year veteran of the force, said, \u201cAre we starting to reap the video-game age? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cBut five, or certainly 10 years ago,\u201d he added, \u201cit wasn\u2019t like this.\u201dThe Elks Lodge shooting was one of five last year in Cincinnati that resulted in at least four casualties. The others took place on street corners, on a front porch and at a cookout in a parking lot.Police officials say they suspect that as many as half of the 24 victims were not the intended targets; community workers blame self-taught gunmen who are often high on drugs or are drunk. \u201cThey are not marksmen,\u201d said Aaron Pullins, an anti-violence worker. \u201cThey don\u2019t know how to hold the gun. They just shoot.\u201dInvestigators have linked three of those shootings to gangs, although like many of their counterparts in other cities, they say the word gang conjures up a false image of a tight-knit, hierarchical criminal organization. Instead, they describe fluid, sometimes tiny bands of teenagers and young adults bound by illegal activity. \u201cThey are groups of friends who rob and shoot each other,\u201d Detective Greg Gehring said. \u201cThat\u2019s just what they do.\u201dAnd they do it all too well. Last year such groups accounted for 40 of Cincinnati\u2019s 58 gun homicides and more than half of its 421 nonfatal shootings.Two of the five shootings with four or more casualties occurred just 300 feet apart in East Westwood, an impoverished neighborhood with high unemployment and dropout rates, on a block that averaged a shooting nearly every other month. A third occurred a mile away. That pattern is typical: Urban gun violence tends to spread around specific blocks or intersections, like a contagious disease.Rival gang members, seeking revenge for an earlier shooting, had already tried to run Jonathan Austin, 24, off the road when they caught up to him in early December outside the Schwarz Market in East Westwood, the police said. They chased him and his friends for an entire block, firing up to 50 shots.Mr. Austin was killed. Three of his friends were injured, including an 18-year-old who was shot repeatedly in the back, damaging his spine. Detective Gehring said that when he talked to the teenager last month, he was bedridden in his mother\u2019s apartment, worried he would never move his legs again.With the help of the market\u2019s surveillance video and one witness, the police arrested a 31-year-old felon on charges of murder and illegal possession of a weapon. But as many as five other gunmen got away. A few weeks ago, one of the suspects was shot 11 times, possibly in retaliation, the detective said.Street violence is self-perpetuating that way: Shootings beget shootings that beget more gunmen. Professor Papachristos, the gang expert, said the more violent the neighborhood, the more teenagers and young men seek safety in numbers.\u201cThe No. 1 reason people join gangs is for protection,\u201d he said. \u201cThe perverse irony is they are then more at risk.\u201dAli-Rashid Abdullah, 67 and broad-shouldered with a neatly trimmed gray beard, is an ex-convict turned outreach worker for Cincinnati\u2019s Human Relations Commission. He or his co-workers were at the scenes of all five of Cincinnati\u2019s shootings with four or more casualties last year, working the crowds outside the yellow police tape, trying to defuse the potential for further gunfire.They see themselves as stop signs for young black men bound for self-destruction. They also see themselves as truth-tellers about the intersection of race and gun violence \u2014 a topic that neither the city\u2019s mayor, who is white, nor its police chief, who is black, publicly addresses.\u201cWhite folks don\u2019t want to say it because it\u2019s politically incorrect, and black folks don\u2019t know how to deal with it because it is their children pulling the trigger as well as being shot,\u201d said Mr. Abdullah, who is black.Most parents Mr. Abdullah meets are desperate to protect their children but are trapped in unsafe neighborhoods, he said, \u201cjust trying to survive.\u201d And some are in denial, refusing to believe that their sons are carrying or using pistols, even in the face of clear evidence.\u201c \u2018Not my child,\u2019 \u201d he said, adopting the resentful tone of a defensive mother. \u201c \u2018It may be his friends, but not my child, because I know how I raised my child.\u2019 \u201dHis reply, he said, is blunt: \u201cThese are our children killing our children, slaughtering our children, robbing our children. It\u2019s our responsibility first.\u201dAfrican-Americans make up 44 percent of Cincinnati\u2019s nearly 300,000 residents. But last year they accounted for 91 percent of shooting victims, and very likely the same share of suspects arrested in shootings, according to the city\u2019s assistant police chief, Lt. Col. Paul Neudigate.Nationally, reliable racial breakdowns exist only for victims and offenders in gun homicides, not assaults, but those show a huge disparity.The gun homicide rate peaked in 1993, in tandem with a nationwide crack epidemic, and then plummeted over the next seven years. But blacks still die from gun attacks at six to 10 times the rate of whites, depending on whether the data is drawn from medical sources or the police. F.B.I. statistics show that African-Americans, who constitute about 13 percent of the population, make up about half of both gun homicide victims and their known or suspected attackers.\u201cEvery time we look at the numbers, we are pretty discouraged, I have to tell you,\u201d said Gary LaFree, a professor of criminology at the University of Maryland.Some researchers say the single strongest predictor of gun homicide rates is the proportion of an area\u2019s population that is black. But race, they say, is merely a proxy for poverty, joblessness and other socio-economic disadvantages that help breed violence.Mr. Nutter, now an urban policy professor at Columbia University, spoke out repeatedly about the disparity during his eight years as Philadelphia\u2019s mayor \u2014 and was accused of casting African-Americans in a bad light. \u201cSome people got upset,\u201d he said. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019ll stop talking about it when you stop killing each other.\u2019 \u201dCloaking the issue, he said, only makes it easier for the country to tune out what amounts to \u201cmass murder occurring in slow motion every day.\u201d Both he and Mr. Abdullah say they wish some of the outrage over police killings of unarmed African-Americans would spill over to victims who die in anonymity in routine gun violence.After a white University of Cincinnati police officer fatally shot an unarmed black driver in July, street protests erupted here, Mr. Abdullah noted. But \u201cwhen we kill each other,\u201d he said, \u201cit seems an acceptable way of life.\u201dEvery month, the outreach workers attend more ceremonies, outpourings of grief marked by teddy bears, high school photos, candles and scrawled tributes to the victim of the day.\u201cI feel so burned out,\u201d said Steve Sherman, one of the workers. \u201cWe go to vigil, after vigil, after vigil, after vigil.\u201dFrom his hospital bed, one of four young men shot last May at one of Cincinnati\u2019s most violent intersections pointed a police officer to a suspect. He gave the man\u2019s first name. And he suggested that he had been shot in retaliation for an earlier shooting in the same area.Officers were able to identify the suspect and confirm that his car had been shot up a few days earlier, said Police Specialist Mark Longworth, who headed the inquiry.But \u201cthat\u2019s where this case died,\u201d he said. The injured victim attributed his information purely to \u201cstreet talk,\u201d not to direct knowledge that would stand in court. Hints are not evidence.\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating because if people would do the right thing, we could probably prevent some of these shootings from happening,\u201d Specialist Longworth said. \u201cBut in that world, very few things are worse than being labeled a snitch.\u201dNationally, nearly half of last year\u2019s shootings with four or more casualties ended in the same way: no arrest; often, not even a suspect. At least 160 assailants, responsible for 102 murders and 635 gun injuries, were still on the streets at year\u2019s end.A case was more likely to be solved if one or more victims died \u2014 the situation in about half the cases. But even some double, triple and quadruple murders continue to stump investigators.The national clearance rate for homicides has fallen from nearly three in four in 1980 to fewer than two in three today. That is partly because public attention has driven down the share of domestic violence killings, which are routinely solved, Professor Rosenfeld said.Much of what remains are killings involving gangs, drugs and witnesses with criminal backgrounds who are wary of talking to the police. \u201cYou are left with a larger percentage of homicides that are more difficult for police to clear,\u201d he said.A shift in law enforcement from solving crimes to preventing them has also contributed, as has rising distrust of the police in some cities, said Charles F. Wellford, emeritus professor of criminology at the University of Maryland. Still, he said, some law enforcement agencies are much worse at closing murder cases than others. Some of those same departments are worse at closing shootings with four or more casualties, too.In Baltimore, the police have not solved any of 11 shootings last year. New Orleans made arrests in only one of eight cases; Chicago, two of 16.Cincinnati was more typical, solving two of its five cases, at least in part.Detective Charles Zopfi had real hopes of arresting the gunmen behind a drive-by shooting here last September. About 20 people had gathered on a warm Monday night for a cookout in a parking lot beside an apartment building. \u201cThere were kids and older people, not your usual crowd of 16- to 23-year-old guys,\u201d the detective said.As a car sped down the street, someone fired at least 10 bullets out a window. Detective Zopfi said he knew from experience how people respond in such situations: They look in the direction of the gunfire, and only then dive for cover.But eight months later, he said, he has been unable even to nail down whether the vehicle was black or green. He heard that of the five victims, a 30-year-old African-American man was left paralyzed from the waist down. But that man refused to take his phone calls, then changed his telephone number.A wounded 3-year-old named Jabarri seemed the best hope of persuading witnesses to come forward, the detective said. Sometimes, the moral outrage over a child victim overwhelms the code of silence. And Jabarri, he said, was \u201cthe cutest little boy\u201d who had smiled beguilingly at him from a hospital gurney even after being shot in the leg.At the detective\u2019s request, Jabarri\u2019s mother agreed to meet with a reporter. But when the reporter showed up at her home, she backed out, pleading a haircut appointment. \u201cThe code of silence is strictly enforced,\u201d the detective said.Mr. Abdullah, the anti-violence worker, talks to some of the victims and witnesses who will not give information to the police. \u201cThey are scared,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have had cases where people found out who talked and that person wound up dead. \u2018So if the police cannot protect me, why would I jeopardize my life and my family?\u2019 \u201d\u201cIt\u2019s so much bigger than the idea of \u2018no snitching,\u2019 \u201d he said.Barry Washington was a neighborhood fixture in Madisonville, a racially mixed community of small, neat homes in northeastern Cincinnati where he grew up. Slim, handsome and barely 5-foot-3, he had an infectious smile and a weakness for hats, from jaunty duckbills to baseball caps worn backward.He helped out hard-up families at the Presbyterian church, and brought household goods to the two-bedroom apartment he shared with his 77-year-old mother, Amanda. He was getting to know a son, then 37, whose existence he had only recently discovered.\u201cAn all-around good guy,\u201d said his sister, Jaci. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a woman who didn\u2019t love him, or a man who didn\u2019t want to hang out with him.\u201dA jack-of-all-trades, Mr. Washington could landscape a yard, operate a forklift, mend a torn basketball. He had to revert to odd jobs after the bus stopped running last year to Amazon.com\u2019s northern Kentucky warehouse, where he had packed shipments. But his sister said he had planned to share an apartment near the warehouse so he could resume work there.Madisonville is neither Cincinnati\u2019s safest nor its most dangerous neighborhood. The Washingtons had avoided brushes with gunmen, but Mr. Washington was wary even around ninth graders. \u201c \u2018Be careful,\u2019 \u201d his sister recalled him saying. \u201c \u2018The little young kids are getting crazy.\u2019 \u201dSometime before 11 p.m. on Aug. 21, Mr. Washington left his apartment in a green pullover, telling his niece he needed cigarettes. His mother was in bed, watching a police drama.The next morning, Jaci Washington awoke to a blizzard of text messages about a shooting. She called her mother, who said her brother had not come home.Soon Amanda Washington\u2019s phone rang: a detective, asking repeatedly whether she was alone.\u201cWhy? What happened to my son?\u201d she demanded. \u201cIs he dead?\u201dMr. Washington had stopped at the Elks Lodge, a narrow, single-story building clad in pale green siding a 15-minute walk from their apartment. Greg Wallace\u2019s party was underway in the basement bar, a \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d banner and blue and yellow balloons on the walls. Tins of muffins and rolls sat on tables covered with plastic tablecloths.Mr. Wallace and his brother Dawaun had recently been feuding with Timothy Murphy. The three men had grown up together in the neighborhood, and as adults had each been convicted of drug trafficking, court records show. Mr. Murphy\u2019s mother, Christine Poindexter, said her son was upset because the Wallaces were selling drugs out of his father\u2019s house.The argument resumed when Mr. Murphy showed up at the party, and ended only when Mr. Murphy was dead and Dawaun Wallace had been peppered with nine bullets. Tests later showed that Mr. Murphy\u2019s blood alcohol level was nearly three times the legal driving limit, and that there was evidence of recent marijuana use.Mr. Murphy\u2019s killer was not prosecuted, Detective David Gregory said, because he appeared to have fired in self-defense. Barry Washington\u2019s death was collateral damage \u2014 a stray bullet, meant for Dawaun.Nine months later, Mr. Washington\u2019s family is still reeling. His mother, a cancer survivor, is virtually a shut-in. \u201cWe loved him dearly, and with a pull of the trigger, he was gone,\u201d she said. \u201cThat I cannot accept.\u201dJaci Washington\u2019s 10-year-old son is withdrawn and angry. Her 14-year-old daughter has nightmares. Her brother, she said, probably would have counseled her to forgive his killer. \u201cHe kept telling me, \u2018You have to look for the good in everybody, \u2019\u201d she said.But she says she cannot forgive. She grasps for metaphors to capture the family\u2019s loss. \u201cIt\u2019s like the world crashing in. It\u2019s like a nuclear bomb went off on my couch,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like someone hit \u2018pause\u2019 in my life. I just saw him, and I will never see him again.\u201dMr. Murphy\u2019s mother is not seeking forgiveness. In an interview, she said she did not believe her son had fired a gun at anyone, insisting that the police had botched the investigation and let the real culprits go free. And she is angry with Jaci Washington for characterizing her son as a murderer at community meetings on gun violence.Ms. Washington and her mother no longer go to those meetings. They seemed futile, they said \u2014 more broken people, describing more senseless deaths.\u201cI don\u2019t want pity. I want results,\u201d Jaci Washington said. \u201cOne more black shooting in a black neighborhood. \u2018Let\u2019s rally around.\u2019 It\u2019s a facade. When all is said and done, we\u2019re still left with the grief.\u201dSusan Beachy contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The End of the Office Dress Code", "Date": "2016-05-25", "News": "Supported byUnbuttonedOver the weekend an exhibition opened at the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. Entitled \u201cUniformity,\u201d it displays 71 pieces from the museum\u2019s collection of (surprise) uniforms, divided into four categories \u2014 military, work, school, sports \u2014 as well as a select group of the fashion looks they influenced, like Geoffrey Beene\u2019s 1967 sequined football jersey gown and Rei Kawakubo\u2019s 1998 military vest and pleated skirt for Comme des Gar\u00e7ons.\u201cI was interested in the inherent dichotomy between uniforms and fashion,\u201d said Emma McClendon, assistant curator of costume, and the organizer of the exhibition, \u201cbecause while they should be antithetical to one another \u2014 the first is about conformity, the second about creativity \u2014 they are also deeply interrelated. It\u2019s ironic.\u201dBut not as ironic as the fact that the show opens just as a number of recent disputes have underscored a somewhat different, and disruptive, reality. We live in a moment in which the notion of a uniform is increasingly out of fashion, at least when it comes to the implicit codes of professional and public life. Indeed, the museum may be the only place they now make sense.If once upon a time Melanie Griffith\u2019s character in \u201cWorking Girl\u201d could manipulate viewers\u2019 assumptions about her job and background simply by swapping leather jackets and minidresses for greige suits, today it would be impossible. \u201cWe are in a very murky period,\u201d Ms. McClendon said.Just before the museum\u2019s show opened, for example, Britain was momentarily distracted from discussions over Brexit (leaving the European Union) by the news that Nicola Thorp, a temp worker, had been sent home from her receptionist job at PricewaterhouseCoopers for refusing to wear heels, as dictated by the dress code of her agency, Portico.Then there was the \u201cflat shoe\u201d uproar of 2015, when two women were supposedly barred from the red carpet in Cannes for not wearing heels. (The festival director denied the report on Twitter.)\u201cI have decided to retract the conferee guidelines,\u201d he said later in a statement, which also noted, \u201cMy failure to clearly specify that all conferees, regardless of gender, should strive to present themselves professionally is unacceptable.\u201dThe slippery slope may have started as a gentle incline way back in the 1970s, and become a bit steeper during the Casual Friday movement of the 1990s and the success of the Facebook I.P.O. in 2012 with its hoodie-wearing billionaires. But today, we are speeding down it at breakneck pace, partly thanks to the hot-button conversation around gender equality, and fluidity.\u201cThere has been a dramatic change very recently,\u201d said Susan Scafidi, a law professor at Fordham University and founder of the Fashion Law Institute.As a result, no employer may require men to wear ties unless they also require women to wear ties, or ask that heels be worn unless both sexes have to wear them. And though this applies only to \u201cofficial\u201d dress codes, the trickle-down effect is inevitable.\u201cDress is now open to the interpretation of the individual, rather than an institution,\u201d Professor Scafidi said.This has created an even greater tension in the more ambiguous areas of office dress, especially as the boundaries between home and work become ever blurrier.\u201cThere\u2019s a strain of thought that says an employee represents a company, and thus dress is not about personal expression, but company expression,\u201d Professor Scafidi said. \u201cBut there\u2019s a counterargument that believes because we identify so much with our careers, we should be able to be ourselves at work.\u201dAnd that has led to all sorts of complications. One person\u2019s \u201cappropriate\u201d can easily be another\u2019s \u201cdisgraceful,\u201d and words like \u201cprofessional,\u201d when used to describe dress requirements, can seem so vague as to be almost meaningless. Kanye West wearing ripped jeans and a jeweled Balmain jacket at the Met Gala: cool or rude? Julia Roberts at the premiere of \u201cMoney Monster\u201d at Cannes this year in bare feet: red carpet pioneer or a step too far?At The New York Times, Michael Golden, the vice chairman, told me: \u201cWe have customer-facing jobs and those that are principally internal. We ask employees to dress appropriately for the interactions planned for their day.\u201d But that can have broad interpretations. In the newsroom, people show up in everything from double-breasted suits to shorts; from sneakers and Birkenstocks to platform heels.All of which leaves us where? Confused, mostly. And fast trying to create our own codes, or parse those of the offices around us. Mark Zuckerberg, for example, is on the record as saying he wears the same gray T-shirt every day so that he can focus his energy on other decisions.Ms. McClendon acknowledges that she tends to wear \u201call black, pretty much every day, and sculptural shapes \u2014 it\u2019s the museum uniform.\u201d Professor Scafidi said, \u201cMy business uniform is a black jacket with a fitted, knee-length sheath, classic 100-millimeter single-sole pumps, and usually our logo pin \u2014 my equivalent of armor, arms and insignia, respectively.\u201dIndeed, according to Ms. McClendon, uniforms evolved for a reason: \u201cThey fulfill a need to identify your place in the world,\u201d for the wearer and the observer. At least when they are easy to read. And part of the idea behind the F.I.T. show, she said, was to \u201cput visitors in the mind-set to consider uniform dressing more broadly, and how it impacts their own lives.\u201dIn other words, to live an examined life when it comes to your wardrobe and your workplace. Because these issues are only going to get more complicated.\u201cWe are moving into an era where personal expression is going to trump the desire to create a corporate identity,\u201d Professor Scafidi said. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge power shift.\u201d And it has already begun.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ask Well: Can Nightmares Cause a Heart Attack?", "Date": "2016-05-20", "News": "Reader Question \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 248 votesNo studies have been done to determine just how rare nightmare-induced heart attacks might be, and experts do not know whether they may result from the pulse-racing effects of the frightening dream itself. Nightmares are more commonly seen in the rapid eye movement, or REM, phase of sleep, which gets longer as the night progresses. Therefore, nightmares are more likely to occur in the early morning hours. Heart attacks, too, are most common in the early morning hours, when internal body clocks start secreting stress hormones and blood pressure tends to rise, said Dr. Mary Ann McLaughlin, a cardiologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. If someone is at risk for a heart attack \u00e2\u0080\u0094 because of high blood pressure, diabetes, sleep apnea, smoking or other factors \u00e2\u0080\u0094  that attack is more likely to occur in the early morning.But \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rare for an otherwise healthy person to have a nightmare that causes a heart attack,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. McLaughlin.Nightmares can be triggered by alcohol, lack of sleep and medications, including some antidepressants and blood pressure medications, she said. Anxiety and depression have also been linked to increased risk of nightmares. On the flip side, patients with heart disease often have sleep apnea, a form of disordered breathing that can lead to fragmented sleep, and potentially more nightmares, said Dr. Neomi Shah, a sleep specialist, also at Mount Sinai.The bottom line: Nightmares are potentially life-threatening, though this appears to be very rare. And there are ways to reduce risks of both nightmares, by addressing underlying conditions like sleep apnea, alcohol use and lack of sleep, as well as heart disease.Related:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "For almost as long as she could remember, Sharon Castellanos took pictures. Her father, a radio operator on a merchant ship, would send photos from all over the world, then give her his cameras when he returned home, to Lima, Peru. Ms. Castellanos treated her cameras like toys. She played behind the lens, capturing what she wanted how she wanted. It didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t occur to her to take photography seriously until two courses she took in college \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for fun \u00e2\u0080\u0094 rekindled her interest. Not long after, on a newspaper internship, she journeyed to the center of the earth and found her muse.Cusco, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnavel of the world\u00e2\u0080\u009d in Quechua, captivated her, as it does most people, with its relentless wonders. Seat of the Inca empire, site of mysterious stone structures, marvel of Spanish colonial architecture, pathway to Machu Picchu \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the superlatives can fill a book. Even the rarefied air, at 11,200 feet above sea level, casts a spell, altering mind and body. Ms. Castellanos was particularly struck by its Old World ways. Just beyond the bustle of the cosmopolitan global city, people maintained age-old traditions, farming, ranching and living much like their ancestors. This inspired Ms. Castellanos\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first long-term documentary project, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDuro de Morir.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn \u00e2\u0080\u009cDuro de Morir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cHard to Die\u00e2\u0080\u009d (the title comes from the sign on the back of a transport van in one of her images and defines the spirit of the people), Ms. Castellanos prefers to evoke the magic of a timeless culture rather than present a straightforward narrative. From a distance, a woman in traditional indigenous outfit \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a brimmed hat, layers of sweaters, long skirt and thick socks \u00e2\u0080\u0094 stands with one knee raised on what looks like the top of the world (Slide 12). The backdrop is fuzzy, maybe clouds, fog or even crashing waves. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRain Dance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Castellanos calls the image, playfully. The woman was actually leaving her spot after watching a soccer game from a mound overlooking a stadium, to avoid having to buy a ticket. A brimmed hat stars in another image (Slide 4), where it floats in the foreground, larger than life, above the landscape. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to tell whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a photograph or a painting, reminiscent of her major influence, the surrealist Ren\u00c3\u00a9 Magritte. The image, Ms. Castellanos said, shows a friend throwing his hat in the air. In another image (Slide 2), silhouetted children frolic as a man who seems to be radiating bursts of light moves behind them \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in reality, he was a man dressed as a guinea pig, Ms. Castellanos said, holding fireworks as part of a cultural celebration. Portraits, landscapes, ceremonies, details of street life, all transform reality into something different, something more. Most of her images were made in several communities in Cusco, where Ms. Castellanos plans to set down roots. Others, given her theme of transfiguring rural life amid the clamorous city, were taken in other communities in the Sierras of Peru and in the periphery of her native Lima.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u2019t pretend to talk about specific issues or show how people live in an Andean community,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Castellanos said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pretend to represent the culture of a community.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rather, she said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m trying to transfigure the daily rural life through documentary images. For me, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of surrealism through documentary photography.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAt 26, Ms. Castellanos is already comfortable pushing conventions. Most of her images are intentionally shadowy, with backgrounds, even the Andes, muted and softened. If you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know better, you might think the images, like the rural traditions she is exploring, were taken 50 years ago. Or 30. Or 20.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI work this project in black-and-white, because when I see my own images in color, I see physical distractions,\u201d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd for me, \u00e2\u0080\u0098black-and-white\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is like a vision filter, like infrared or ultraviolet vision, in order to read the images at a specific level. I mean, to be able to interpret the essence of each image.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHer fondness for her subjects is obvious. A shepherd, holding his rod and staff, bears a regal dignity standing smack in the middle of a frame against a backdrop of smudgy mountains and fuzzy clouds. In another image (Slide 17), a man overlooking chiaroscuro mountains and sky looks like a royal figure draped in a flowing cape. (In reality, the drape was a net used to catch fog so that it becomes water.) \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor me, Magritte didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t paint,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe illustrated ideas through painting. And I would like to do the same: illustrate ideas through documentary photography.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}

{"Headline": "Women in Tech Band Together to Track Diversity, After Hours", "Date": "2016-05-03", "News": "Supported byThe group\u2019s push is one of the more visible diversity efforts to come from women in Silicon Valley as tech companies grapple with criticism over the makeup of their work forces, which skew white and male. Over the last few years, tech entrepreneurs like Kimberly Bryant of Black Girls Code and Laura Weidman Powers of Code 2040 have promoted the inclusion of young women and minorities in early computer science education programs with their start-ups.All of them are working on Project Include outside of their respective workplaces, on their own time.As part of Project Include, the group plans to extract commitments from tech companies to track the diversity of their work forces over time and eventually share that data with other start-ups. The effort will focus on start-ups that employ 25 to 1,000 workers, in the hope of spurring the companies to think about equality sooner rather than later. The project will also ask for participation from venture capital firms that advise and mentor the start-ups.Project Include aims to have 18 companies as part of its first cohort; a few have already signed up. The group will meet regularly for seven months to define and track specific metrics. At the end of that period, the group will publish an anonymized set of results to show the progress \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 that the start-ups have made around diversity.\u201cIf companies start early with diversity and inclusion, they don\u2019t have to bolt it on later, which is much harder,\u201d said Ms. Baker, the former Google engineer, who now works at Slack, a workplace collaboration software start-up.\u201cIt is this incredibly self-serving mythology that we are the best and the brightest, and that the best ideas rise to the top and will get funded,\u201d said Ms. Kapor Klein, noting there is plenty of data to show that minority access to tech programs and networks is worse than that of white males. \u201cDespite an avalanche of rigorous data to the contrary, the belief in pure meritocracy persists.\u201dMany of the women involved in Project Include were already leading diversity efforts before they decided to collaborate. Last year, for example, Ms. Pao became something of a magnet for women who were disenfranchised with inequality issues in tech after her case against Kleiner Perkins.So when Ms. Pao had the seeds of the idea for what would become Project Include, it was easy to find others to join forces. She reached out over Twitter\u2019s private message system to Ms. Baker, who is known in Silicon Valley for raising awareness around diversity issues. Ms. Baker in turn introduced Ms. Pao to Ms. Hutchinson; Ms. Pao already knew Ms. Blount through their time working together at Reddit. Eventually, over a dinner, they settled on a group of eight, with a number of outside supporters.Kate Mitchell, managing director at the venture capital firm Scale Venture Partners and a co-chairwoman of a National Venture Capital Association task force on diversity, said her group was working with Project Include because of its tech-centric, start-up approach to sharing data and information with other participants.\u201cIt\u2019s taking a page out of open-source software,\u201d Ms. Mitchell said. \u201cYou measure, you try things, you iterate and then you build on top of each other\u2019s ideas and make your companies even better.\u201dThe hope, over time, is for members of Project Include to form a community open to discussing inclusion issues among one another. \u201cA lot of these conversations are very uncomfortable for people,\u201d Ms. Pao said. \u201cThese are exactly the types of uncomfortable conversations that we need to have.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. AMC plans to make the clip exclusive to Snapchat for a period of 24 hours before broadcasting it more widely on other platforms.

(Snapchat says it has 100 million active daily users.)\u201cObviously it\u2019s a terrific platform for this younger audience,\u201d Linda Schupack, executive vice president of marketing for AMC and SundanceTV, said in an interview. \u201cThe audience we think will sync up perfectly with \u2018Preacher\u2019 is already on Snapchat.\u201dIt is also the network\u2019s effort to turn \u201cPreacher,\u201d a darkly comedic drama based on a cult-hit comic series, into another flagship show like \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d and its spinoff series, \u201cFear The Walking Dead,\u201d which regularly have sizable audiences in the 18-to-49-year-old demographic most attractive to advertisers.With \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d in particular, AMC has tried to capitalize on the show\u2019s young fan base, much of which regularly takes to social sites like Twitter, Facebook and Reddit to talk about the show in the hours after episodes air on television. \u201cTalking Dead,\u201d the network\u2019s hourlong live discussion in which different members of the cast and creative team chat with celebrities about the week\u2019s most recent episode, was a direct result of the series\u2019 enthusiastic following.AMC has spread its advertising clout across nearly all of these new media platforms thus far, though the network hopes this particular ad buy will pay off in a swath of cheerleading young fans for the new series.\u201cFor millennials, the thrill of discovery is really important,\u201d Ms. Schupack said. \u201cOur hope is to turn our fans into evangelists by getting \u2018Preacher\u2019 to them ahead of the premiere.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Effort to Expose Russia\u2019s \u2018Troll Army\u2019 Draws Vicious Retaliation", "Date": "2016-05-30", "News": "Supported byHELSINKI, Finland \u2014 Seeking to shine some light into the dark world of Internet trolls, a journalist with Finland\u2019s national broadcaster asked members of her audience to share their experience of encounters with Russia\u2019s \u201ctroll army,\u201d a raucous and often venomous force of online agitators.The response was overwhelming, though not in the direction that the journalist, Jessikka Aro, had hoped.As she expected, she received some feedback from people who had clashed with aggressively pro-Russian voices online. But she was taken aback, and shaken, by a vicious retaliatory campaign of harassment and insults against her and her work by those same pro-Russian voices.\u201cEverything in my life went to hell thanks to the trolls,\u201d said Ms. Aro, a 35-year-old investigative reporter with the social media division of Finland\u2019s state broadcaster, Yle Kioski.Abusive online harassment is hardly limited to pro-Russian Internet trolls. Ukraine and other countries at odds with the Kremlin also have legions of aggressive avengers on social media.But pro-Russian voices have become such a noisy and disruptive presence that both NATO and the European Union have set up special units to combat what they see as a growing threat not only to civil discourse but to the well-being of Europe\u2019s democratic order and even to its security.This \u201cinformation war,\u201d said Rastislav Kacer, a veteran diplomat who served as Slovakia\u2019s ambassador to Washington and at NATO\u2019s headquarters in Brussels, \u201cis just part of a bigger struggle.\u201d While not involving bloodshed, he added, it \u201cis equally as dangerous as more conventional hostile action.\u201dFor Ms. Aro, the abuse increased sharply last year when, following up on reports in the opposition Russian news media, she visited St. Petersburg to investigate the workings of a Russian \u201ctroll factory.\u201d The big office churns out fake news and comment, particularly on Ukraine, and floods websites and social media with denunciations of Russia\u2019s critics.In response to her reporting, pro-Russian activists in Helsinki organized a protest outside the headquarters of Yle, accusing it of being a troll factory itself. Only a handful of people showed up.\u201cThere are so many layers of fakery you get lost,\u201d said Ms. Aro, who was awarded the Finnish Grand Prize for Journalism in March.As Ms. Aro\u2019s experiences illustrate, Finland, a country at the center of Russia\u2019s concerns about NATO\u2019s expansion toward its borders, has emerged as a particularly active front in the information wars. A member of the European Union with an 830-mile-long border with Russia, Finland has stayed outside the United States-led military alliance but, unnerved by Russian military actions in Ukraine and its saber-rattling in the Baltic Sea, has expanded cooperation with NATO and debated whether to apply for full membership.Public opinion is deeply divided, making Finland a prime target for a campaign by Russia.\u201cTheir big thing is to keep Finland out of NATO,\u201d said Saara Jantunen, a researcher at the Finnish Defense Forces in Helsinki, who last year published a book in Finland entitled \u201cInfo-War.\u201d She said that she, too, had been savaged on social media, sometimes by the same and apparently fake commentators who have hounded Ms. Aro.\u201cThey fill the information space with so much abuse and conspiracy talk that even sane people start to lose their minds,\u201d she added.But facts have been powerless against a torrent of abuse and ridicule targeted at European journalists, researchers and others labeled NATO stooges.Pro-Russian activists insist that they are merely exercising their right to free speech, and that they do not take money or instructions from Moscow.The most abusive messages against Ms. Aro were mostly sent anonymously or from accounts set up under fake names on Facebook and other social media.One of her most vocal critics in Finland, however, has openly declared his identity. He is Johan Backman, a tireless supporter of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia who highlights the blurred lines between state-sponsored harassment and the expression of strongly held personal views.Mr. Backman, who also represents the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic, the breakaway state set up with Russian support in eastern Ukraine, denied targeting Ms. Aro as part of any \u201cinformation war.\u201d Rather, he insisted that Russia was itself the victim of a campaign of disinformation and distortion conducted by the West.In a recent interview in Moscow, he said that Ms. Aro was part of this campaign and that she had tried to curtail the freedom of speech of Russia\u2019s supporters in Finland by labeling them as \u201cRussian trolls.\u201d All the same, Mr. Backman added, her complaints about being targeted for abuse \u201chave been very beneficial for Russia\u201d because they have made others think twice about criticizing Moscow.\u201cShe says she is a victim, and nobody wants to be a victim,\u201d he said. \u201cThis changed the atmosphere in the journalistic community.\u201dMr. Backman said he used his own private means to fund his activities in support of what he described as an \u201centirely defensive\u201d campaign by Russia to counter Western propaganda. His activities, however, invariably follow Moscow\u2019s political and geopolitical script, particularly on NATO, which he regularly denounces as a tool for United States military occupation.Aside from NATO, Mr. Backman\u2019s biggest bugbear of late has been Ms. Aro and the \u201cRusso-phobic\u201d tendencies that she, in his view, represents.Around the same time, she received a call late at night on her cellphone from a number in Ukraine. Nobody spoke, and all she could hear was gunfire. This was followed by text and email messages denouncing her as a \u201cNATO whore\u201d and a message purporting to come from her father \u2014 who died 20 years ago \u2014 saying he was \u201cwatching her.\u201dThe hardest blow, Ms. Aro said, came early this year when a Finnish-language news site, MVLehti.net, which is based in Spain and mostly focuses on vilifying immigrants, dug up and published court records that showed she had been convicted of using illegal amphetamines in 2004. She had been fined 300 euros.The website\u2019s headline: \u201cNATO\u2019s information expert Jessikka Aro turned out to be a convicted drug dealer.\u201d It also posted photographs of Ms. Aro dancing in a slinky outfit at a nightclub in Bangkok.Mr. Backman requested and received Ms. Aro\u2019s old case file from the court shortly before the website published the documents. He denied passing them on to the site.\u201cI don\u2019t know if these people are acting on orders from Russia, but they are clearly what Lenin called \u2018useful idiots,\u2019\u201d said Mika Pettersson, the editor of Finland\u2019s national news agency and an organizer of the editors\u2019 open letter. \u201cThey are playing into Putin\u2019s pocket. Nationalist movements in Finland and other European countries want to destabilize the European Union and NATO, and this goes straight into Putin\u2019s narrative.\u201dIlja Janitskin, the founder and head of MVLehti, who is based in Barcelona, Spain, said in response to emailed questions that he had no connection with Russia other than his surname. His political views, he said, are closer to those of Donald J. Trump, not Mr. Putin.He added that he had become interested in Ms. Aro only after she accused his website of \u201cdistributing Russian propaganda.\u201dLike Mr. Backman, he denied receiving any money from Russian sources, insisting that his website, which in just 18 months has become one of Finland\u2019s most widely read online news sources, finances itself from advertising and donations by readers.Ms. Aro acknowledged that she had used amphetamines regularly in her early 20s but dismissed as a \u201ctotal lie\u201d claims that she had been or is a drug dealer.\u201cThey get inside your head, and you start thinking: If I do this, what will the trolls do next?\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When a Robot Books Your Airline Ticket", "Date": "2016-05-30", "News": "Supported byItinerariesJay Baer, a digital marketing consultant in Bloomington, Ind., spends half his time traveling on business. That means he also has to spend hours each week coordinating that travel.Help has arrived with the Pana app, which employs artificial intelligence to aid customers.Many of the virtual assistant services use artificial intelligence, a branch of computer science that simulates intelligent human behavior. Some respond to questions posed by travelers, either in live speech or digitally, while some, like Pana, rely on additional input by humans to provide answers.Although many services are now in their infancy, they are expected to change the way travel is planned in the not-too-distant future.The Pana app lets users chat, in conversational language, about booking travel and helps if they encounter a delay or cancellation. Responses are provided by a team of travel agents who are on duty round the clock and have access to artificial intelligence to gather information customized for the traveler.Mr. Baer, who has been a Pana devotee since last year and recently signed a contract for his staff of 11 to use it, relies on it primarily for tips on places he visits and to rebook when his schedule changes or he encounters an unexpected delay.Like many in the travel industry, Miriam Moscovici, director of emerging technologies for BCD Travel, a travel management company, predicts that within a year \u201clower-priority tasks will be handled by self-service artificial intelligence, which will free up human travel agents to do more of the intense work required.\u201dWayBlazer and Watson\u2019s cognitive technology are the brains behind Connie, a robot being tested at the Hilton in McLean, Va., outside Washington. Connie answers guests\u2019 questions about amenities and services, and also suggests local attractions.Norm Rose, an analyst for Phocuswright, a travel research company, predicted that artificial intelligence would help simplify and automate travel planning by providing quicker responses and more relevant content.But noting that artificial intelligence is not yet capable of completely replacing human interactions, he warned it could also alienate travelers if a travel company used it but was unable to answer their questions.He said artificial intelligence systems need to understand the vocabulary used in travel to be successful, but still may have difficulty helping travelers if their requests are complex. He also said some emerging systems are arranging complex itineraries that contain multiple flights or involve flights and hotels, and predicted many will eventually be able to handle both.Expedia is among a few dozen companies and organizations that Facebook recently said would use a new chatbot on the social network\u2019s Messenger platform. This lets users pose questions in digital chats and employs artificial intelligence-powered systems to provide answers. Expedia is testing responding to hotel booking requests via Messenger.Passengers of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, an earlier partner on Messenger, can now use the platform to confirm bookings and get flight status updates. The airline also plans to offer bookings through Messenger. And since 2011, the airline has been testing a 6-foot-3 robot, Spencer, at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, its home base. In its most recent trial, which ended in March, Spencer escorted travelers to their gates.Robots are also being used at select Starwood, InterContinental and Marriott hotels in the United States and are being tested in Europe by SNCF, the French railway, and on cruise ships operated by Costa and Aida.Skyscanner, a travel search engine, this year developed a voice-enabled app for Alexa, the cloud-based voice service for the Echo from Amazon, to search for flights. Alexa also recently began working with Kayak to help users search for flights, hotels, rental cars and destinations, though no booking is done through it.HelloGBye will begin testing an app this summer that lets users type or speak into their phone and create an itinerary with flights and hotel accommodations. The app can book travel for as many as nine people at once.In November, Hipmunk, which has helped travelers research and book travel online since 2010, began testing a free, personalized virtual travel-planning assistant, Hello Hipmunk, powered by artificial intelligence. It provides help via email. Users can also give Hello Hipmunk permission to access their Google calendar, which it then periodically scans for events requiring travel and proactively provides booking options.The Pana app answers many users\u2019 questions in less than a minute, said Devon Tivona, the company\u2019s chief executive, and agents notify customers if more time is required. Pana is geared toward people who frequently travel for business. Its monthly fees range from $19 for one person to $449 for companies with fewer than 200 employees.

{"Headline": "Austrian Far-Right Candidate Norbert Hofer Narrowly Loses Presidential Vote", "Date": "2016-05-23", "News": "Supported byAustria had to wait almost 24 hours after polls closed on Sunday for the authorities to count almost 700,000 valid mail-in ballots. In the end, Mr. Van der Bellen won 50.3 percent of the vote, and his far-right rival, Norbert Hofer, 49.7 percent, a difference of just over 30,000 votes, the Interior Ministry said.The narrowness of the victory also reflected the big strides into the mainstream the far right has made not only in Austria, but in much of Europe \u2014 from neighboring Hungary and Poland, where it already holds sway, to France and Germany, where rightist movements are polling strongly before national elections next year.In Britain, voters are scheduled to decide next month whether their country will stay in the European Union. That vote could turn on issues like migrants and a rejection of European unity and the Continent\u2019s centrist elites \u2014 issues that also figured significantly in Austria\u2019s vote.In his first speech as president-elect, Mr. Van der Bellen emphasized his pro-European stance, welcoming foreign reporters in English, and promised Mr. Hofer\u2019s voters that their grievances and views would be heard.\u201cWe have quite clearly got a lot of work to do,\u201d Mr. Van der Bellen said. \u201cObviously, people do not feel sufficiently seen or heard, or both,\u201d even if the five-month campaign proved that Austrians were ready to discuss politics at length \u2014 something their new president said was \u201ca good sign.\u201dRight-wing parties have been achieving electoral success in a growing number of nations.Polling experts said Mr. Van der Bellen had won the election with support from city dwellers \u2014 particularly in Vienna, which voted 61 percent for him \u2014 women and the highly educated. He promised on Sunday night that he would try to heal the rifts that had opened along these and other lines as establishment politics stagnated.Mr. Hofer\u2019s showing is the first time the Freedom Party, which has its roots in the 1950s, when it was founded by former Nazis and Teutonic nationalists, has gained close to 50 percent of the popular vote. That alone signals that it is a factor to be reckoned with as Austria, a generally prosperous country of 8.4 million, grapples to find its place in a globalized world, and in a Europe whose unity is under question.The disruptions of globalization and last year\u2019s wave of one million migrants \u2014 most of whom only passed through Austria en route to Germany or Sweden \u2014 were central themes of the election.Despite Austria\u2019s outward prosperity, wrote Rainer Nowak, the editor of Die Presse, the leading center-right daily, \u201cpeople fear that it won\u2019t go so well for much longer.\u201dThe parties of the center left and center right that governed for most of the past 30 years in ever-duller grand coalitions were trounced in the first round of the presidential elections last month, when Mr. Hofer stunned rivals by reaping 35.1 percent, well ahead of Mr. Van der Bellen with 21 percent.Sunday\u2019s runoff turned into a cliffhanger as the popular vote was counted and showed an ever-narrowing lead for Mr. Hofer. The Austrian public broadcaster ORF projected that Mr. Van der Bellen would win by just 3,000 votes when the record number of requested mail-in ballots was counted on Monday.That projection \u2014 and the tone of some of the ORF reporting on the election \u2014 was heavily criticized by the Freedom Party. It was not clear if there would be legal consequences, but the party\u2019s attitude illustrated the country\u2019s deep divisions.Doron Rabinovici, a writer who was among several prominent intellectuals supporting Mr. Van der Bellen, noted that \u201cthe 50-50 vote is not in itself a split; that\u2019s democracy.\u201d But how one proceeds is what matters.\u201cWe do have a problem in this country, that politics has been conducted not in discussing substance but at the level of the tabloid press,\u201d he said.The Freedom Party, which has for decades campaigned to keep out foreigners, saw its support soar, with opinion polls consistently showing that it would win a nationwide election.That apparently prompted Mr. Faymann and his center-right partners in government to reverse course on its approach to migrants, shutting Austria\u2019s borders and persuading Balkan nations along the refugee trail to Central Europe from Greece to do the same.Hopes are now pinned on his successor as chancellor, the leader of the Social Democrats: Christian Kern, 50, the former head of Austria\u2019s state rail system, got off to a vigorous start last week, talking of a \u201cNew Deal\u201d that would allay people\u2019s worries and overhaul Austria\u2019s moribund state structures.The last time the outside world paid such attention to the election of an Austrian president was in 1986, when Austrians defied international fears and elected Kurt Waldheim, a former United Nations secretary general, as president, despite revelations that he had served in the Wehrmacht close to the site of Nazi atrocities in the Balkans.Mr. Waldheim\u2019s six-year tenure was scarred by almost complete diplomatic isolation.\u201cVery little will change in the real world\u201d as a result of Sunday\u2019s vote, said Charles Grant of the Center for European Reform, a London think tank.Nevertheless, he said, it was clearly a protest vote, cast as \u201ctrade, migrants and globalization are increasingly unpopular\u201d and \u201cinequality is growing\u201d across Europe and the United States.Mr. Grant compared the outcome to the showing of the U.K. Independence Party, which received almost 28 percent in European elections in 2014 but just 12.6 percent in Britain\u2019s general election last year.In France, the center-right daily Le Figaro wrote on Monday that \u201cEurope\u2019s leaders should not be too pleased if Alexander Van der Bellen spares them the shock of an anti-European president in Vienna.\u201dThe very narrow vote contains a lesson, the French daily added: \u201cAcross the whole Continent, people are expressing more or less the same rejection of a Europe that lacks both a plan, and a head.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The photographs, and their placement, had a clear message: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have a history, you have a legacy and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something to look up to and live up to as a part of this family,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn a way it was a counternarrative to the media images of black bodies in the \u00e2\u0080\u009980s and \u00e2\u0080\u009990s,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe photos on my grandfather\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wall were propaganda meant to counter all the other negative propaganda I was bombarded with every day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The homes of many African-American families have portraits similar to the ones Ms. Jackson saw growing up. But the visual narratives most often told of black people don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t reflect that tradition. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe beauty of these family portraits,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis that when we stepped into that portrait studio, even with a white photographer, we decided how to present ourselves.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Jackson is now using her body as her visual instrument, exploring how photography shaped the narratives of African-Americans and Africans. In her most recent images she assumes the role of historic black women from the 19th century, including her own relatives. She relies on extensive research and often bases her images on historic photographs \u00e2\u0080\u0094 some of which had been used to subjugate or stereotype black people. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am fighting photography with photography,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.  Among the most prominent portraits in her grandfather\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home is a hand-painted photo of his parents, Katie and Ellerson Jackson. Katie Jackson was born around 1885 in Georgia, went to college and became a schoolteacher. She married and moved to New Jersey with five children, including her son J. Garfield Jackson, who became Essex County\u2019s first African-American principal and is Ayana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grandfather.  A school in East Orange is named for him.Although Ms. Jackson never met her great-grandmother, she become intrigued with \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis post-emancipation, educated, bourgeois black woman\u00e2\u0080\u009d who died in 1937. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a character that I want to spend time with, because I think she and many women like her are lost in history,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.In the image \u00e2\u0080\u009cPrototype/Phenotype\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Slide 12) Ms. Jackson portrays her great-grandmother with references to the archaic ethnographic photographs used by pseudo-scientists to support spurious theories of racial inferiority.In another series (Slides 1 through 4), Ms. Jackson invokes the \u00e2\u0080\u009cTignon laws\u00e2\u0080\u009d of Spanish-controlled New Orleans in the 1790s, which forced women of African descent to cover their hair and dress less elegantly. But those rules were subverted by women who created beautiful head coverings of exceptional material that at times resembled West African turbans. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe law was aimed at mixed-race Creole people to reinforce their station in life and suppress their beauty, their freedom and their elegance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Jackson said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile it was intended to put them down, it ultimately made them even more beautiful, and that speaks to the resilience of black womanhood, or womanhood in general.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMs. Jackson referenced Dutch master paintings and used Photoshop to make her images look more painterly and less photographic.She also portrays Lady Sarah Forbes Bonetta (Slides 6 through 10), a West African Yoruba of royal background who was captured by the king of Dahomey in 1848 and given to Queen Victoria, who adopted her as a goddaughter. Ms. Jackson presents herself  in Bonetta\u00e2\u0080\u0099s likeness \u00e2\u0080\u009cwith eyes closed, looking inward towards her interior world,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, as a way of rejecting the notion of her being \u201cgiven like an inanimate object.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAnother photo (Slide 11) recreated an image of a Spelman College graduating class from the 1890s. Its title refers to the brown paper bag test that was used to determine whether an individual could have certain privileges based on skin color. Ms. Jackson, who graduated from Spelman in 1999, plays all of the women in the photo.  While Katie Jackson is not a character in many of these photographs, she remains the wellspring of Ms. Jackson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exploration of black middle-class women of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Ms. Jackson knows her homage is among the many African-American narratives that have rarely been of interest to the wider world. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI just want to put Katie in front of the world and allow her dignity to be considered and seen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.

{"Headline": "Attack on West Virginia State Senate Candidate Overshadows Vote", "Date": "2016-05-09", "News": "Supported byA Democratic candidate for West Virginia\u2019s State Senate who was beaten up at a barbecue last weekend said that he suspected the attack had been politically motivated but that he still hoped to leave the hospital in time to publicly watch the results of the state primary election on Tuesday.The candidate, Richard Ojeda, said by phone from his hospital bed in Charleston that he had been kicked in the head until he passed out at an outdoors campaign event by a man he had known as a child, leaving him with fractured bones in eight places \u2014 including his eye socket and jaw \u2014 and stitches, bruises and swelling.A suspect, Jonathan Porter, turned himself in to state troopers late Sunday and was booked on felony charges, including malicious assault and destruction of property, according to a law enforcement official.Mr. Ojeda said he believed the attack was politically motivated because he had been \u201cquestioning leaders\u201d and publicly calling out entrenched nepotism that he said had resulted in favoritism in jobs and salaries.\u201cI have become public enemy No. 1,\u201d he said, adding that people had called his house and threatened him.Mr. Ojeda, 45, a military veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, has been campaigning for a State Senate seat that includes parts of the large coal mining region in the state\u2019s southwest. His platform opposes what he describes as the state government\u2019s political nepotism, corruption and misuse of government funds.\u201cWe don\u2019t have transparency in Logan County,\u201d Mr. Ojeda said. \u201cIf you work in the coal industry and you asked a question to any of these people, you would find yourself laid off.\u201dIn the telephone interview, Mr. Ojeda said he was at a barbecue campaign event on Sunday in a mountainous region about 50 miles southwest of Charleston, the capital, when Mr. Porter asked him for a campaign sticker for the rear bumper of his pickup truck. Mr. Ojeda complied, providing one that said, \u201cOjeda for Senate.\u201dWhen Mr. Porter asked for one for the front, Mr. Ojeda said, he knelt down to affix it there.\u201cHe was behind me,\u201d Mr. Ojeda said. \u201cHe kicked me with steel-toed boots in the back of the head.\u201d He said he blacked out. \u201cWhen I woke up my face was on a tree stump covered in blood.\u201dSenior State Trooper J. E. Garren said that as other people at the event tried to intervene, Mr. Porter, 41, got into his truck and drove toward Mr. Ojeda, who was on the ground. One person stood in front of him to block the truck.Mr. Porter backed up, hitting all-terrain vehicles that had been positioned to try to prevent him from leaving the scene, the trooper said. Mr. Porter then fled, the trooper said.Witnesses told the authorities that Mr. Porter had used brass knuckles to strike Mr. Ojeda, but the trooper said the authorities did not find any. The motive was unclear because Mr. Porter has declined to speak, Trooper Garren said.The beating soon took on political overtones, reverberating into other campaigns as Mr. Ojeda\u2019s Democratic opponent, State Senator Arthur Kirkendoll, and the brother of the suspect reacted to it online.Mr. Ojeda urged his supporters not to assume that Harold Porter had any role in the attack, writing on a Facebook account that he uses for campaign news, \u201cWe may not see eye to eye politically on everything, but I know he is a good person that would never be a part of anything like this.\u201d\u201cThese are usually things that the elected officials don\u2019t want the citizens to see!\u201d Mr. Ojeda wrote. \u201cWell ... come Tuesday, remember how my opponent has been charging the Logan County commission a consulting fee for years to the tune of $2,500.00 a month.\u201dAfter the attack, Mr. Ojeda wrote that he was brushing his teeth \u201cwith a sponge\u201d but was still committed to the race. \u201cIf you thought this would shut me up you are mistaken,\u201d he said.\u201cI am not scared of those of you who think you can intimidate me,\u201d he said, noting that he had dealt with the Taliban and Al Qaeda while on deployment.Mr. Ojeda said he wanted to leave the hospital in time to watch the voting on Tuesday with friends, then go to the courthouse where results of the election will be announced.

In 1988, ethnic Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh voted to secede from Azerbaijan, and fighting broke out between the mostly Muslim Azerbaijanis and Christian Armenians. More than 20,000 people were killed and about a million people were displaced before a cease-fire in 1994.   Since then, Nagorno-Karabakh has been governed independently with significant support from Armenia. Fighting over the territory broke out again last month between Azerbaijan and Armenia, and 20 people were killed in a few days of battles. There have been minor skirmishes since.Ms. Hayrapetyan was born near Khtsaberd but grew up mostly in Abovyan, Armenia. She spent summers and school vacations at her grandmother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house, listening to her stories, wandering the fields and milking the sheep. It was an idyllic time.She had been in the village during the 1988 war, which included massacres on both sides and left about a million people, mostly Azeris, displaced. Many houses were destroyed and seven of Khtsaberd\u00e2\u0080\u0099s young men were killed. The villagers were consumed by grief. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor five years nobody played music, even during a wedding,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Hayrapetyan said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEvery Saturday, all of the village would go to the graveyard and all you could hear was the sound of women wailing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Hayrapetyan started photographing Khtsaberd and a few surrounding villages in 2006 while studying at a World Press Photo workshop in Yerevan, the Armenian capital.

Her three children are with her most everywhere she goes.She made an open-air gallery in Khtsaberd to show her images to the villagers. It was her first solo exhibition, and people enjoyed seeing photographs of themselves. Unfortunately, the show ended early. That evening some cows wandered over and started to eat the photographs.If she had her choice, Ms Hayrapetyan said she would live in Khtsaberd, where she knows the names and stories of relatives going back seven generations.For example, her grandmother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grandfather Hambardzum was widely known as the biggest and strongest man in Khtsaberd, although someone claimed another man from a neighboring village was even tougher. Once, they were both cutting wood in the forest and ran into each other.

In India and Indonesia \u2014 two of the world\u2019s fastest-growing Internet markets \u2014 that figure is almost two-thirds of smartphone users, according to the report.\u201cWe found the results surprising because in the West we don\u2019t often consider what\u2019s going on in developing countries,\u201d said Sean Blanchfield, chief executive of PageFair. \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time until mobile ad blocking comes to the West.\u201dMost of the data on the mobile homepages of the top 50 news websites comes from advertising, demonstrating the appeal of ad blockers.Still, only 4.3 million Americans, or 2.2 percent of smartphone owners, used ad blockers \u2014 through browsers or other services \u2014 on their smartphones as of March. By comparison, 159 million people in China have installed ad-blocking software on their cellphones, the report said.But as people in Western markets increasingly rely on smartphones to reach the Internet, the use of mobile ad blocking is expected to rise.Despite this legal uncertainty, people\u2019s interest in blocking ads, particularly on their cellphones, is unlikely to wane.\u201cIt\u2019s already used by hundreds of millions of people,\u201d Mr. Blanchfield, of PageFair, said. \u201cYou can\u2019t put the cat back in the bag.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump on His Tax Rate: \u2018It\u2019s None of Your Business\u2019", "Date": "2016-05-13", "News": "The remarks from Mr. Trump signal that he has little intention of disclosing verifiable details of his income or what fuels his wealth, a matter of endless speculation for a candidate who boasts of being a billionaire many times over despite his past brushes with bankruptcy and increasing reliance on celebrity-oriented income and licensing deals that use his name.While not required to release their tax returns, all the major party presidential nominees have done so for roughly the past four decades, including President Richard M. Nixon, who released them despite undergoing an Internal Revenue Service audit. Mr. Trump has cited continuing I.R.S. audits of his taxes in refusing to release his returns.When Mr. Trump was asked on ABC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood Morning America\u00e2\u0080\u009d whether he thought voters had a right to see his returns, he replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think they do.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Trump added of his taxes: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s under routine audit. When the audit ends, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to present them. That should be before the election. I hope it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s before the election.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut when asked by the interviewer, George Stephanopoulos, what effective tax rate he pays, Mr. Trump said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s none of your business.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see it when I release, but I fight very hard to pay as little tax as possible.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe release of tax returns bedeviled Republicans during the 2012 presidential election, when Mitt Romney delayed releasing his until September. His effective tax rate, which was below 20 percent, was used by President Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team to lampoon him as a wealthy corporate raider who was out for himself and who could not understand how regular people lived. Mr. Trump has said that Mr. Romney erred in waiting so long to release his taxes and should have done so sooner.For many years, Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wealth has been a moving target, subject to much estimation, debate and even litigation.Last summer, when Mr. Trump filed the personal financial disclosures required of presidential candidates, his campaign released a statement saying that he was worth more than \u00e2\u0080\u009cTEN BILLION DOLLARS,\u00e2\u0080\u009d capitalizing the outsize figure. When the 92-page document became public, the disclosures by Mr. Trump indicated that he had at least $1.4 billion in assets, including his real estate developments and golf clubs.Fortune recently pegged his worth at $3.72 billion. Forbes calculated it at $4.5 billion, as of September 2015.Mr. Trump disputed both numbers, just as he objected to an estimate a decade earlier when Timothy L. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Brien, a reporter for The New York Times, wrote a book that placed the businessman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s net worth at $150 million to $250 million, based on three confidential sources. During a well-publicized episode, he sued Mr. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Brien for defamation, but Mr. Trump ultimately failed to prove his case.While his tax returns would not show Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s net worth, they would show investment income and where those investments are held, liens and the scope and type of his charitable contributions.Kenneth A. Gross, a lawyer with Skadden who deals regularly with tax issues, suggested that the contents of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tax returns were certainly of public interest because they would provide insight into his finances that his previously disclosed financial documents do not.\u00e2\u0080\u009cObviously it could raise issues about deductions, reporting of income, all sorts of things that we worry about when we file our tax returns,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Gross said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obviously something of interest because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being audited. It would be, I think, important to see what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in these returns before he becomes the nominee of the Republican Party.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut Mr. Trump was adamant in his interview on Friday that \u00e2\u0080\u009cpeople will learn nothing\u00e2\u0080\u009d from his returns, noting how he had released his financial disclosure statement.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI put in financials, 100 pages worth of financials, that show that I built a company that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth more than $10 billion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt shows cash. It shows cash flows. It shows everything. You learn very little from tax returns, but nevertheless, when the audit is complete, I will release. I have no problem with it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He added that he has no offshore accounts.As the issue of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s returns bubbled up over the past week, Democrats treaded relatively lightly on the matter, particularly since Hillary Clinton faces pressure to release transcripts of her paid speeches to Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs. But on Wednesday Mrs. Clinton seized on Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reluctance to release his returns.\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to ask yourself, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Why doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t he want to release them?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton said on Wednesday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah, well, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to find out.\u00e2\u0080\u009dShe and Bill Clinton have released their tax returns going back to 1977, when he first entered political life.The I.R.S. will not confirm if a person is being audited or discuss their returns, but Eric Smith, a spokesman for the agency, said taxpayers are free to publicize their own financial documents at any time.\u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing prevents individuals from sharing their own tax information,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Smith said.In a letter on his campaign website, Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tax counsels wrote in March that his returns have been under \u00e2\u0080\u009ccontinuous examination\u00e2\u0080\u009d by the I.R.S. since 2002 because he has a big business. The audits from those returns from 2002 to 2008 have been completed, they wrote, but lingering questions about those returns remain, an apparent explanation as to why he will not release years no longer under \u00e2\u0080\u009cexamination.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe public interest group Common Cause put out a statement calling on Mr. Trump to release the tax returns, pointing out that he released returns from the early 2000s that were under audit to gambling commissions in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.Mr. Trump has given different explanations for why he will not release his taxes over the years. In 2011, when he contemplated running for president, Mr. Trump said he would release his tax returns when President Obama released his birth certificate. Mr. Obama made the birth certificate public in April 2011, and Mr. Trump announced a few weeks later that he would not run for president.Last year, Mr. Trump said he was still considering whether to release the returns, but he made no mention of the audits until this year.Tax experts remain divided on the wisdom of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s releasing his returns, with some arguing that it would be malpractice to advise a client to make such information public during an audit and others saying that he should have nothing to hide.Robert J. Kovacev, a tax lawyer with Steptoe & Johnson who previously worked at the Department of Justice, said the scrutiny that Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s returns would face could add years to the audit because the I.R.S. would be pressured to examine details that critics of Mr. Trump seized upon. That could impose additional costs on Mr. Trump and disrupt his negotiations with the agency.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you put it out in public, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost like you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re crowdsourcing the audit,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Kovacev said.While Mr. Trump has said that he strives to pay as little tax as possible, Mr. Kovacev suggested that his returns could have information about offshore holdings or legal tax maneuvers that his accountants use that make his income appear lower or show losses.Some tax specialists see no legitimate reason for Mr. Trump to hold back. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen you file your return with the I.R.S. or any taxation authority you are filing your returns under penalty of perjury that what you are filing is true and correct,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Laurie B. Kazenoff, a former I.R.S. tax lawyer now with the firm Meltzer Lippe. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou should be standing by what you filed regardless of any audit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "How \u2018Everything\u2019 Became the Highest Form of Praise", "Date": "2016-05-24", "News": "Supported byFirst WordsIs it an exaggeration to claim that Americans have a genius for overstatement? You can hear it in the high-\u00adminded bombast of our country\u2019s founding documents. It echoes in the boasts of poets, from Walt Whitman (\u201cI contain multitudes\u201d) to Jay Z (\u201cI\u2019m not a businessman/I\u2019m a business, man\u201d). It resounds in the carnival \u00adbarks of entrepreneurs, from P.T. Barnum to a certain real-\u00adestate-\u00adand-\u00adreality-\u00adTV magnate, who these days can be heard booming his sales pitch across the presidential trail. As Donald Trump himself put it in his book \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d: \u201cPeople want to believe that something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular. I call it truthful hyperbole.\u201dThe word \u201ceverything\u201d entered English in the 14th century. It is a pronoun denoting all that exists; more colloquially, it describes the current situation, the general thrust of things. (\u201cHow\u2019s everything?\u201d) But the ontological puzzle of everything \u2014 its nature, what it means \u2014 has preoccupied humankind for millenniums. A conviction shared by all theorists of everything, from the authors of the Hindu scriptures to Baruch Spinoza to astrophysicists, is that everything is a very big thing indeed \u2014 so vast and multifarious that it can never be fully described or inventoried. \u201cEverything\u201d is a fudge, a word we apply to the unknowable.It is also, nearly always, an exaggeration. The self-help guru instructs \u201cEverything happens for a reason,\u201d the how-to book promises \u201cEverything You Need to Know About Gardening,\u201d the devoted wife intones \u201cMy husband is everything to me\u201d \u2014 and in all cases the truth is politely stretched. Little wonder that \u201ceverything\u201d thrives on the Internet, where the math is so often fuzzy. The \u201ceverything\u201d that holds sway online exaggerates the exaggeration, by eliminating any notion of uncertainty, any qualification. The formulation is not \u201cPumpkin spice latte is everything you want in a seasonal novelty beverage.\u201d It\u2019s \u201cPumpkin spice latte is everything,\u201d full stop, no questions asked, no doubt countenanced.Internet one-\u00adupsmanship is a definitively 21st-\u00adcentury art form, but \u201ceverything\u201d carries a hint of yesteryear \u2014 a whiff of the hot air that once swirled through medicine-\u00adshow tents and carnival grounds. It harks back to Barnum, who promoted his traveling circus not with the modestly hedged hucksterism that was previously the norm but with reckless, outrageous claims: \u201cThe Greatest Show on Earth, Without a Rival, Recognizing No Equal, and Regarding No Opposition ... A Perfect Exhibition! Vast in Its Proportions! ... The Acme of Refined Elegance and Best in All Things.\u201d\u201cEverything\u201d is a hawker\u2019s cry, a hard sell. Which makes perfect sense. The Internet is the most dizzying marketplace in human history, a seething bazaar that barrages us relentlessly and from all angles. We recoil at the crudity of click bait, but in this atmosphere, it\u2019s unfair to begrudge anyone his desperation. The Internet has a way of placing all of us \u2014 you, me, the online peddler of counterfeit Viagra, the editor of The Paris Review \u2014 in the undignified position of those touts who haunt the sidewalks outside bad restaurants in tourist-\u00adtrap neighborhoods, thrusting menus in the faces of passers-\u00adby.We\u2019re not just click-\u00ad\u00adbait addicts, after all. We\u2019re adepts. Nearly everyone with a Facebook account, 1.65 billion active members and counting, has learned how to trawl \u2014 and occasionally troll \u2014 for page views, and every day, with every post, we refine our skills. In so doing, we\u2019ve formed the largest volunteer work force the corporate world has known, an army of unpaid interns, doing the jobs formerly left to flacks, shilling for Starbucks and Universal Pictures and Jennifer Lawrence and other multinational brands.Of course, the brands we promote most diligently are our own: We curate and spit-\u00adpolish our online presences in pursuit of followers and faves. \u201cEverything\u201d is ubiquitous because it\u2019s unusually effective, delivering the social-\u00admedia dividends we covet. It\u2019s a clever ploy, a word vague enough to appeal to all comers and too forceful for many to ignore. If a thing is really everything, surely it merits a click-\u00adthrough?Leave it to Kanye West to take \u201ceverything\u201d to an unexpected place. The most surprising sound in \u201cUltralight Beam,\u201d the opening track on West\u2019s recent album, \u201cThe Life of Pablo,\u201d is not the music \u2014 the gospel-\u00adchoir vocals that flare up over a shuddering beat \u2014 but the words in the song\u2019s refrain. \u201cWe on an ultralight beam,\u201d West croons, \u201cThis is a God dream/This is everything/This is everything.\u201d It\u2019s fitting that West \u2014 who has spent years writing songs about the tussle between God and mammon, while maintaining the world\u2019s most reliably bonkers Twitter feed \u2014 would be the one to transform an Internet-\u00adspeak banality into a howl of spiritual ecstasy.Or maybe West has hit upon the secret essence of \u201ceverything,\u201d the depths that hide in plain sight? We\u2019ve all experienced the sensation: Someone or something arrests your attention so completely that the surrounding scenery dissolves, the contours of the universe seem to collapse inward, until all you see is the object of your fascination \u2014 a lover, or a great book, or a sumptuous rack of lamb, or Stephen Curry sinking a three-\u00adpointer.These days, the sublime can ambush you at unlikely moments, in odd places: when you find yourself staring at YouTube, say, watching a squirrel slalom across a swimming pool on a pair of miniature water skis. The inescapable mantra \u201cThis is everything!\u201d may strike us as glib, puerile, an assault on our sanity and intelligence. But every now and then, there\u2019s truth in it. Sometimes, click bait can be a God dream. This Vine, that GIF, those tiny pigs dancing in the grass: They may have the power to obliterate the world for a minute or two. That might not be EVERYTHING \u2014 but it\u2019s not nothing.Jody Rosen is a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}

Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, denounced what he called the \u201cdemagoguery\u201d in the Republican and Democratic Parties in a commencement speech delivered on Saturday at the University of Michigan.While Mr. Bloomberg did not denounce any candidates by name, his remarks, which faulted the demonizing of immigrants and the wealthy and criticized Washington gridlock, appeared directed at Donald J. Trump and Senators Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders. Mr. Bloomberg compared the leading contenders from both parties, as a group, to a list of divisive figures from the 20th century, including Patrick J. Buchanan, Senator Joseph R. McCarthy and Gov. George C. Wallace.An interactive delegate calculator that lets you simulate how the 2016 Republican nomination process could unfold.Like those demagogues of years past, he said, candidates in both political parties focus on blaming \u201ceasy targets who breed resentment\u201d for the country\u2019s problems instead of offering workable solutions.\u201cFor Republicans, it\u2019s Mexicans here illegally and Muslims,\u201d he said, \u201cand for Democrats, it\u2019s the wealthy and Wall Street. The truth is, we cannot solve the problems we face by blaming anyone.\u201d\u201cEvery generation has had to confront its own demagogues, and every generation has stood up and kept them away from the White House, at least so far,\u201d he told the graduates and their guests at the ceremony in Ann Arbor, Mich. \u201cNow it\u2019s your turn.\u201dMr. Bloomberg, a political independent who was New York\u2019s mayor from 2002 to 2013 and flirted with a White House bid this year, lamented what he called \u201ca disturbing change in the nature of American politics: a rise in extreme partisanship and intolerance for other views.\u201d\u201cNeither party has a monopoly on good ideas; each demonizes the other unfairly and dishonestly,\u201d he said.

{"Headline": "Andrew Sullivan on Trump and Tyranny", "Date": "2016-05-02", "News": "This rainbow-flag polity, Plato argues, is, for many people, the fairest of regimes. The freedom in that democracy has to be experienced to be believed \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with shame and privilege in particular emerging over time as anathema. But it is inherently unstable. As the authority of elites fades, as Establishment values cede to popular ones, views and identities can become so magnificently diverse as to be mutually uncomprehending. And when all the barriers to equality, formal and informal, have been removed; when everyone is equal; when elites are despised and full license is established to do \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhatever one wants,\u00e2\u0080\u009d you arrive at what might be called late-stage democracy \u2026\u00c2\u00a0And it is when a democracy has ripened as fully as this, Plato argues, that a would-be tyrant will often seize his moment.He is usually of the elite but has a nature in tune with the time \u00e2\u0080\u0094 given over to random pleasures and whims, feasting on plenty of food and sex, and reveling in the nonjudgment that is democracy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s civil religion. He makes his move by \u00e2\u0080\u009ctaking over a particularly obedient mob\u00e2\u0080\u009d and attacking his wealthy peers as corrupt. If not stopped quickly, his appetite for attacking the rich on behalf of the people swells further. He is a traitor to his class \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and soon, his elite enemies, shorn of popular legitimacy, find a way to appease him or are forced to flee. Eventually, he stands alone, promising to cut through the paralysis of democratic incoherence. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as if he were offering the addled, distracted, and self-indulgent citizens a kind of relief from democracy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s endless choices and insecurities. He rides a backlash to excess\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009ctoo much freedom seems to change into nothing but too much slavery\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and offers himself as the personified answer to the internal conflicts of the democratic mess. He pledges, above all, to take on the increasingly despised elites. And as the people thrill to him as a kind of solution, a democracy willingly, even impetuously, repeals itself.Maybe none of this matters; maybe the insurrectionary potential of mass democracy is sufficient to propel a demagogue\u00c2\u00a0forward against a largely unified elite. But\u00c2\u00a0I think Sullivan inadvertently puts his finger on what a Trumpish figure would actually need in order to complete his conquest, when he compares Trump with Barack Obama circa 2008:Obama would never have been nominated for the presidency, let alone elected, if he hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t harnessed the power of the web and the charisma of his media celebrity. But he was also, paradoxically, a very elite figure, a former state and U.S. senator, a product of Harvard Law School, and, as it turned out, blessed with a preternaturally rational and calm disposition. So he has masked, temporarily, the real risks in the system that his pioneering campaign revealed \u2026The climate Obama thrived in, however, was also ripe for far less restrained opportunists. In 2008, Sarah Palin emerged as proof that an ardent Republican, branded as an outsider, tailor-made for reality TV, proud of her own ignorance about the world, and reaching an audience directly through online media, could also triumph in this new era. She was, it turned out, a John the Baptist for the true messiah of conservative populism, waiting patiently and strategically for his time to come.So if we\u2019re worried about the risks of tyranny, what we should fear is a Trump-like figure who could also get the kind of media coverage from allegedly neutral journalists that Obama earned in 2008, who could have every A-list celebrity\u00c2\u00a0in his corner and not just the National Enquirer and Bobby Knight and Mike Tyson, who could have all the brightest minds in tech clamoring to be on his team and not just rely on free media (as powerful as that can be), who could be endorsed by\u00c2\u00a0Oprah and Colin Powell and Michael Bloomberg and not just a parade of has-been hacks, and who could enter office with a compliant establishment\u00c2\u00a0ready to back him even to an extra-constitutional hilt.Now let\u2019s just hope I\u2019m right.FollowAdvertisement"}

One measure calls for Internet companies to remove content deemed critical of politicians within 48 hours, while another calls for imprisonment for violating an Internet\u2019s site\u2019s terms of use. The proposals worry many Internet privacy advocates, including the authors of Brazil\u2019s widely respected Internet bill of rights or Marco Civil.The full Congress is considering several of these proposals and could vote on them this week.On Monday, Brazilians took to Twitter to lament the loss of WhatsApp, which is used there as much by professionals as by students. But some appreciated the respite. @IZATLEITE, a Twitter user, wrote, \u201cnow without WhatsApp, I\u2019ll finally be able to read without being disturbed or interrupted.\u201dMike Isaac contributed reporting from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In China, Government Workers Push Rosy, Diverting Views Online", "Date": "2016-05-19", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 China heavily censors its Internet, limiting what its people can see or say online to channels that the government can control.But China\u2019s managing of its message does not end there. It also taps untold masses of people to cheer for its side on online message boards and social media. The common belief that they are paid 50 cents per post leads people in China to call them the Fifty Cent Party.A new study says those people are closer to the government than previously thought.They are also incredibly prolific. The study, released by Gary King, Jennifer Pan and Margaret E. Roberts, estimates that the Chinese government each year fabricates and posts around 488 million social media posts in China, or about one for every 178 social media posts on Chinese commercial sites. Posts are usually written in bursts around politically sensitive events, like protests or key national political events, and are often intended to distract the public from bad news.The study could shed light on an active but shadowy part of China\u2019s complex system of tools used to guide online public opinion at home. Its best-known tool is the Great Firewall, the sophisticated system of Internet filters and blocks that prevents people in China from accessing Facebook, Twitter and Google, as well as foreign media sources such as The New York Times.But it has others that depend on China\u2019s manpower and spending to manage. Prodding people to write comments online represents the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s longstanding effort to channel public opinion, said David Bandurski, editor of the China Media Project at the University of Hong Kong. \u201cThe whole premise being that the party needs to be more savvy and clever in directing the agenda,\u201d he said.China\u2019s top Internet monitor, the Cyberspace Administration of China, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Domestically, the report found that Beijing primarily sought to guide public opinion by having commenters write posts designed to \u201cregularly distract the public and change the subject\u201d rather than rebut arguments against the government line.\u201cDistraction is a clever strategy in information control in that an argument in almost any human discussion is rarely an effective way to put an end to an opposing argument,\u201d it said.The effects of this strategy are amplified by highly coordinated campaigns in which bursts of messages are posted around news or events as they go viral, according to the report.Based on a trove of leaked emails from a local Internet propaganda office in the eastern Chinese province of Jiangxi in 2013 and 2014, the report examined 43,000 confirmed government-sponsored posts and cited a number of examples of government-backed comment campaigns.The study also tracked the sources of almost all of the 43,000 posts back to groups and individuals from 200 different government agencies. While 20 percent came from the district Internet propaganda office, other comments came from local township governments and even further afield, from people in the district sports bureau and the district human resources bureau. The fact that most commenters are employed by the government likely allows for quick and efficient coordination, according to the report.To determine the total number of posts in China, the researchers used their knowledge of the number of government-fabricated posts in a single county in 2013 and extrapolated how many government-sponsored posts there were per Internet user there.Tracking government activity has become trickier, as Chinese users shift away from social-media services that are broadly accessible to anybody. They increasingly use mobile-chat apps, like China\u2019s WeChat, where only friends connected over the app can see one another\u2019s posts.An article on Monday about online commenters in China who are paid to post messages favorable to the government misstated the university affiliations of two of the three authors of a study showing that most commenters are government employees. The study was not by \u201cresearchers at Harvard\u201d; while Gary King is a professor there, Jennifer Pan is an assistant professor at Stanford, and Margaret E. Roberts is an assistant professor at the University of California, San Diego.Advertisement"}

Trump has turned Republican congressional leaders into a punch line on the stump.But that has changed in the last few days, as Mr. Trump has struggled to make peace with Republicans in Washington \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and Hillary Clinton has made an aggressive bid to win over party elders aghast at Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s emergence as the presumptive Republican nominee.Suddenly, these dreaded insiders are the most sought-after people in politics.Mr. Trump is headed to Washington on Thursday to huddle with Paul D.

It could take a command performance on Capitol Hill for Mr. Trump to turn around his listing candidacy, at least with the elite groups that have rounded on him since last week.His impatience in demanding their support has irked them only further: Mr. Trump huffed at a campaign stop over the weekend that Mr. Ryan was being \u00e2\u0080\u009ccute\u00e2\u0080\u009d about his endorsement.

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "Marcel Sternberger and his wife, Ilse, traveled to Mexico in 1951 to photograph President Miguel Alem\u00c3\u00a1n Vald\u00c3\u00a9s and other prominent politicians and businessmen. But the highlight of the trip came when they befriended two Communist radicals: Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo. Mr. Sternberger eventually photographed them using his portrait approach, which was a unique blend of psychological and photographic techniques.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile Sternberger generally developed good relations with all of his sitters and went on to correspond with some of the most famous personalities of the day, a special bond developed with Frida and Diego,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jacob Loewentheil, author of \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Psychological Portrait,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a new monograph published by Rizzoli with 206 photographs of notable figures, including Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud and George Bernard Shaw. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Sternbergers spent approximately the next five years traveling from New York, where they lived, to la Casa Azul.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIt was important to Mr. Sternberger to develop a close rapport with his subjects, many of whom were, like himself, Jewish. According to Mr. Loewentheil, this (and some Communist theory) may have been part of the instant connection between Mr. Sternberger, his wife, Ms. Kahlo and Mr. Rivera, who both claimed Jewish heritage, even though that was later disproved. In Mr. Sternberger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s portraits, Mr. Rivera is often making funny faces. According to a 1952 taped conversation between Mr. Rivera and Mr. Sternberger, obtained by Mr. Loewentheil, he often made these faces in front of the mirror to study facial muscles and features. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDiego mimics many different faces and personas in his pictures,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Loewentheil said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSome show him with his eyes rolled back in his head; in one he attempts to portray Buddha; in another he remarks that he sees some of the Mexican wind god in the portrait.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Kahlo appears more poised. Despite her serious back injuries, which she sustained in 1925, she is seated upright, almost forcefully so, with dangling earrings and her crown of flowers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe wanted herself presented with a royal bearing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Loewentheil said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cKeeping in mind that her back was terribly injured in a childhood trolley car accident, which left her bedridden for much of her life, I think she always wanted to show herself as straight-backed, as being able to hold herself up.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThere is no record of how Ms. Kahlo felt about the portraits, but the taped conversation reveals Mr. Rivera\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opinion. \u201cFirst of all, these photographs, I think never have been done such good photographs of me and by the first time I have seen the real me, that part of me in photographs, most of the part of my psychology, my dreamy way to be in behind the mask I have all the time, in everyday life,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told Mr. Sternberger. Though Mr. Sternberger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s project was abandoned after he died in a 1956 car accident while returning to New York from Mexico, his psychological and photographic methods were detailed in a subsequent manuscript that was never published. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Psychological Portrait\u00e2\u0080\u009d includes excerpts from that manuscript covering the photographer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s precise instructions: There are 10 traits that he believed every good portraitist should have, including \u00e2\u0080\u009ca good educational background, so that you may share a maximum number of interests with your sitters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cSharing knowledge of topics of importance to his subjects was the means through which he engaged them in conversation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Loewentheil said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOnce the sitters were occupied with a conversation, Sternberger used their resulting engagement in the discussion to elicit internal emotions and produce the unique portraits that were his hallmark.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to know exactly the conversations among Ms. Kahlo, Mr. Rivera and Mr. Sternberger. But Mr. Loewentheil says he believes that Mr. Sternberger was able to capture an emotional bond between the famous couple that has long been overshadowed by the narrative of their tumultuous relationship. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think you can see from the portraits of Diego and Frida that \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to the Sternbergers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the couple was a loving one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are some quite beautiful intimate moments between the two detailed in the book. The historical narrative we have handed down to us is usually narrowed by the need for brevity. Biographers of the couple may emphasize one side of their relationship, but the truth was more complicated.\u00e2\u0080\u009d "}
{"Headline": "Paula Broadwell, David Petraeus and the Afterlife of a Scandal", "Date": "2016-05-28", "News": "Supported byWEST POINT, N.Y. \u2014 It was 6:30 a.m. at the United States Military Academy, the sun was rising over the Hudson River, and Paula Broadwell was in athletic gear. With a half-dozen women, she rotated between sprints and burpees. Sweating onto the pavement, the group was perched atop an overlook called Trophy Point, in the shadow of a 46-foot battle monument memorializing those killed in the Civil War. There is a female statue in bronze at the top, arms outstretched regally, who is said to represent \u201cfame.\u201dMs. Broadwell was here in April for a 40th anniversary celebration for the academy\u2019s first class of women, who enrolled two decades before she would graduate near the top of her class, with multiple varsity letters. It was also the first time she had been back to campus since 2012, when she achieved her own kind of unwanted fame.She was the younger, equally ambitious overachiever: Olympic-distance triathlete; two master\u2019s degrees; deputy director of the center on counterterrorism at Tufts University; a research associate at Harvard, where she had first met the general six years before. \u201cShe was a standout,\u201d said Sue Fulton, a former military captain and member of the first class of women at West Point, who later became a friend.There was hubris: the man tasked with guarding the nation\u2019s secrets revealing them; a woman who had achieved incredible journalistic access committing the ultimate journalistic sin. Another friend of the general\u2019s, Jill Kelley, also became tangled up in the coverage after she reported to the F.B.I. that she was getting harassing emails. Investigators later learned they were sent by Ms. Broadwell under a pseudonym. (Ms. Broadwell, now 43, declined to comment on the emails, other than to say that she regretted sending them; Ms. Kelley said the two have never spoken directly.)\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be the least bit surprised to see him in some senior role in the next administration, Democratic or Republican,\u201d said Vernon Loeb, the managing editor at The Houston Chronicle, with whom Ms. Broadwell wrote her biography of Mr. Petraeus.Ms. Broadwell has struggled to find her footing. For weeks, reporters camped outside her home in Charlotte, N.C., where she was trying to restore her marriage. Friends sent over groceries and hot meals for her family \u2014 her husband, Scott, and sons, 8 and 10 \u2014 and staged interference so Ms. Broadwell could cut across her neighbors\u2019 lawns, climbing over fences, to escape for a morning run.She lost her military security clearance; her promotion from major to lieutenant colonel was revoked when the news broke. The F.B.I. still has her computers \u2014 including her dissertation research \u2014 and she withdrew from her Ph.D. program. She said she was told in more than one job interview that, while she was qualified, hiring her would be a public-relations nightmare.\u201cI\u2019m the first to admit I screwed up,\u201d Ms. Broadwell said. \u201cReally badly, I know that. But how long does a person pay for their mistake?\u201d\u201cThat may be, in part, an unfair standard between men and women caught in an affair,\u201d said David Bradley, the chairman of Atlantic Media, who knew Mr. Petraeus and Ms. Broadwell and once sat down with Ms. Broadwell to offer professional advice. In the aftermath, he reached out to both by email to offer sympathy and support. \u201cBut, I think it\u2019s equally the danger \u2014 the white-hot danger \u2014 for the private citizen caught in an affair with a public figure.\u201dTo journalists, she was the woman who \u2014 without any journalistic experience \u2014 had persuaded the highest commander in the land to give her unusual access and then abused it. (When the book came out, and she appeared on \u201cThe Daily Show With Jon Stewart,\u201d Mr. Stewart joked that \u201cthe real controversy here is, is he awesome or incredibly awesome?\u201d)To military colleagues, she was guilty of \u201cHollywooding\u201d: commanding the attention to herself in a culture that is all about the team. And then there was the infidelity, a crime for active duty officers for a reason. \u201cService members are required to deploy for months and months at a time \u2014 so you have to be able to trust your spouse,\u201d Ms. Fulton said. It happens, of course, so often that there\u2019s a name for it (\u201ca zipper malfunction\u201d). And yet \u201cto violate that trust is viewed as particularly egregious.\u201d\u201cI think the worst feeling is when you don\u2019t have control over your life,\u201d Ms. Broadwell said. She was sitting on the couch in her living room in Charlotte while her children were at school. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what this felt like.\u201dMr. Petraeus had many defenders \u2014 and a four-decade career of service to stand on. Ms. Broadwell did not. She said she never heard from her best friend \u2014 a crime agent with the F.B.I. She asked another friend, a woman she had mentored, if she\u2019d be willing to speak up on her behalf, but this woman was applying for a job with the C.I.A. \u201cIt was too controversial to even touch; certainly if you were active duty you would pay a price,\u201d Ms. Fulton said.There was the emotional toll of the abrupt severing of an intensely personal relationship. But there was also the professional one: her career tangled up with this man with whom she was once in love, her advocates, his allies. Mr. Petraeus had been helping her with her Ph.D., at King\u2019s College London, on military and organizational innovation. (His unit was one of the case studies.) They were working on another book together, this one focused on his leadership style, called \u201cRelentless.\u201dBefore the fallout, the Republican senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Richard Burr of North Carolina had sat her down in Mr. Burr\u2019s office to discuss a future congressional run, she said. Suddenly, overnight, she became \u2014 in her word \u2014 \u201cradioactive.\u201d (A spokeswoman for Senator Burr\u2019s office confirmed that the meeting took place, but said that he could not recall the precise nature of it.)\u201cShe has such confidence, such presence in the way she carries herself, and she commands this attention,\u201d said Rose Keravuori, a longtime friend and former West Point classmate. \u201cI think people expected her to go into politics, or do something different. And then this happened, and just, nobody helped her up. It was hard to reconcile so many people being sort of gleeful in it.\u201dA few days later, she was still nervously checking the Google alerts on her phone.\u201cYou know, Petraeus, when we were working together, he would never read anything about himself,\u201d she said, seated in the lobby of a Charlotte hotel. \u201cSometimes I wonder, am I doing myself mental harm by reading all of it.\u201dThese days, her coping mechanism is to stay busy. She is on the board of multiple local leadership organizations, and she\u2019s a member of an opera club. She volunteers for a group that provides safe houses for human trafficking victims, another that helps veterans rehabilitate. She drops off her sons at the bus stop each day, then goes for a morning run. She continues to push for women in combat, and is active in a group called West Point Women, which planned the event at her alma mater.She is emotional when she speaks about the Charlotte community that embraced her family. But she\u2019s torn: Should she try to reclaim her past \u2014 her dream of becoming a national security adviser \u2014 or should she pursue something entirely different? Should she fight to restore her military status, or simply move on?\u201cThe truth is, the military is not a place where you can rehabilitate,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a \u2018Zero Defects\u2019 policy \u2014 that\u2019s military code. So the whole redemption thing? It\u2019s not common.\u201cMy husband says I just need to walk away,\u201d she continued. \u201cSue Fulton says I needs to fight back. My lawyers \u2014 I literally ask them, \u2018What would you tell me to do if I were your daughter?\u2019 Some days I think, if I could just move on and it was never again in the news, I probably would. But I can\u2019t. My fabric is to fight back.\u201dShe has also, quietly, reached out to female journalists she thought would be sympathetic, asking them to stop using the word \u201cmistress\u201d: Christiane Amanpour at CNN; Norah O\u2019Donnell at CBS; Susan Glasser at Politico, who advised her staff to refrain from using the word.\u201cYou know that character on \u2018Game of Thrones,\u2019 Tyrion?\u201d she asked. \u201cHe says at one point, something to the effect of, \u2018You\u2019ve got to own your weakness, and then nobody can use it against you.\u2019 Well, I\u2019m trying to figure out how to do that.\u201dHer hometown newspaper, The Charlotte Observer, said it would work to retire the term, opting instead to call Ms. Broadwell and Mr. Petraeus \u201clovers.\u201d \u201cIt takes two to have an affair,\u201d said the newspaper\u2019s editor, Rick Thames.The campaign can feel a little like putting out brush fires, Ms. Broadwell said, but for now, it\u2019s given her some sense of purpose.\u201cOn the one hand, I don\u2019t want to define myself by this,\u201d she said. \u201cBut on the other hand, I\u2019ve been defined by this. So if I can change things for the better because of it, then why not?\u201dOf course, she added, \u201cMaybe some day I just need to take off the Google alerts and live in oblivion.\u201dAn article last Sunday about Paula Broadwell described imprecisely her academic record at the United States Military Academy at West Point. While Ms. Broadwell graduated in the top 5 percent of her class in fitness and military and in the top 10 percent in academics, she did not graduate \u201cat the top of her class.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Austria\u2019s Far Right, a Way to Find Victory in Defeat", "Date": "2016-05-24", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorIt was a close call for Austria; Mr. Hofer would have been Europe\u2019s first far-right head of state since World War II. But for the Freedom Party, there is victory in defeat: Not only did Mr. Hofer make it to the second round of voting, easily outpolling candidates from the center right and center left, but the result was down to the wire \u2014 he was ahead on Sunday night, before absentee votes were counted. Just under half the country voted for the far right. As Mr. Hofer said in his concession statement on Facebook, posted Monday afternoon, \u201cThe effort for this campaign is not lost, but an investment in the future.\u201dIn one sense, Mr. Hofer\u2019s near success is just the latest episode in the rise of the xenophobic right across Europe. But it\u2019s also no surprise that it should happen in Austria. After World War II, the country declared itself Hitler\u2019s first victim, a handy myth that allowed it to avoid grappling with its own, central role in the Nazi era. It muffled debate within a stifling \u201cgrand coalition\u201d centrism, with the left and right ruling more or less in concert. The country did not begin to confront its Nazi past until the 1980s, when Kurt Waldheim was running for president. Despite reports that he had been a Nazi intelligence officer in Greece, he easily won, an event that set off a decade of soul-searching by the Austrian establishment.Still, it wasn\u2019t until the 1990s that the Freedom Party became a national force, when J\u00f6rg Haider modernized the party around a populist, anti-immigrant message that also appealed to Austrians who were tired of the stultifying centrism of coalition politics. In 1999 Mr. Haider rode the party into a coalition government with the center right \u2014 but once in power, the party showed that it couldn\u2019t live up to its bombastic promises. Mr. Haider died in a car accident in 2008, leaving the far right rudderless.Perhaps it was only a matter of time before a new, savvier generation of party leaders, combined with a weakened political establishment and rising xenophobia, returned to the center of Austrian politics. But Mr. Hofer\u2019s success is not just about who runs Vienna; it is also a case for other European far-right parties. That\u2019s because, if Austria is in some ways uniquely vulnerable to the far right, in other ways it\u2019s an odd fit: Unemployment there is at the European Union average, while politics are consensus-oriented, risk-averse and fundamentally conservative. If the Freedom Party\u2019s anti-establishment, anti-immigrant message can work in Austria, it can work anywhere.Even if Mr. Hofer and the far right lost this time, their strong showing will tempt the mainstream parties to copy their message. Austrian and European politics are poised to make a worrying shift to the right, regardless of who wins what election.And the Freedom Party will be back. Elections to the Austrian Parliament are scheduled for 2018, when Heinz-Christian Strache, the party\u2019s leader, will make a bid for chancellor (a position that has much more power than the president). Between now and then, Mr. Hofer\u2019s narrow defeat allows the Freedom Party to portray itself as a victim, excluded from power despite large-scale popular support, and to claim that the system is stacked against it. As Mr. Hofer himself said on Sunday night, \u201cEither I will become president tomorrow, or in two years Heinz-Christian Strache is chancellor of Austria.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Paul Singer Calls Both Trump and Clinton Unacceptable", "Date": "2016-05-10", "News": "Paul Singer, the billionaire financier who has supported conservative causes and who backed Senator Marco Rubio\u2019s presidential campaign, said in a speech on Monday night that neither of the likely general election candidates was acceptable and urged conservatives to \u201cstand up for what we believe.\u201dMr. Singer spoke at a gala that was held at Cipriani 42nd Street for the Manhattan Institute, a conservative group that he has been involved with for many years. Mr. Singer\u2019s remarks, which were shared by an attendee who took notes and were confirmed by a second guest, represent his most extensive comments so far about the presidential race, in which Donald J. Trump has emerged as the presumptive Republican nominee. Mr. Singer was among a group of donors who had funded efforts to stop Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. But the comments also reflect a conversation that is beginning among writers, elected officials and donors over how to protect the conservative movement with Mr. Trump, whom many conservatives revile, at the top of the Republican ticket. The most prominent elected official to emerge from the conservative movement, the speaker of the House, Paul D. Ryan, has said he is not yet ready to endorse Mr. Trump. In his comments, Mr. Singer described Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton as \u201csigns of philosophical, policy and political exhaustion.\u201d In a clear signal that he does not want to encourage a Clinton presidency, Mr. Singer said both candidates reflect \u201cthe politics of anger and nostalgia, of visceral responses.\u201d He added, \u201cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s essential that we \u00e2\u0080\u0094 individually, collectively, and through our institutions \u00e2\u0080\u0094 stand up for what we believe.\u201d Those views, he said, are not \u201cembodied in either choice that will apparently be on the ballot this November.\u201d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "\u2018Zero to One,\u2019 \u2018Good Profit\u2019 and \u2018Team of Teams\u2019", "Date": "2016-05-18", "News": "Supported byAudiobooksIgnore the scent of self-congratulation that wafts from nearly every book in the How to Succeed category and what remains is largess, priced to move. The subtext reads something like this: \u201cI made it big, and if you follow my advice, sold here for a fraction of what it cost me, you can, too.\u201d But pure altruism rarely explains much, and the ulterior motives behind these works are often as interesting as their catechisms.The veneer of beneficence is somehow easier to see through in audiobook form, as evidenced by the works reviewed here. Of the three, \u201cZero to One: Notes on Startups; Or, How to Build the Future,\u201d by the Silicon Valley investor and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, spends the least amount of time justifying itself. This gives the book the feel of an advertisement for a man who believes he has no need to advertise. Which is a very savvy approach to self-promotion.\u201cZero to One\u201d distills lectures from a class about start-ups that Thiel taught at Stanford in 2012, based on the scribblings of his former student Blake Masters, who is credited with a writing assist and who capably narrates the book. The lessons of Thiel\u2019s course are too important to be limited to a few lucky undergraduates, we are told in the preface: \u201cThere\u2019s no reason why the future should happen only at Stanford, or in college, or in Silicon Valley.\u201dSo what future-shaping advice does Thiel have for the next generation of entrepreneurs? First, competition is expensive, risky, and it invariably reduces profits. So your goal is not to dream up a company in a field that already exists and then fight for market share. No, the smart move is to found a business in a still unimagined realm \u2014 an act of creation that Thiel, a serial catchphrase coiner, calls \u201cgoing from zero to one.\u201dOnce you\u2019ve pioneered a new industry, you and your colleagues should set your sights on a very specific goal: building a monopoly. \u201cWhereas a competitive firm must sell at the market price,\u201d Thiel tells us, \u201ca monopoly owns its market, so it can set its own prices.\u201d Thiel\u2019s favorite example is Google, which all but invented the online \u00adadvertising market and has dominated it for years.As advice goes, \u201cCreate the next Google\u201d is both unassailable and perfectly useless. Thiel glancingly acknowledges that the type of start-up he is describing is rare, but the fortune he made at PayPal, and later as an investor in Facebook, has apparently convinced him that the exceptional would be far more common if people were just bolder and more imaginative. He makes this and other points in brief chapters packed with references to Pythagoras, the Unabomber, Tolkien, Karl Marx, Jim Morrison, \u00adNietzsche, John Rawls and Shakespeare. In interviews and speeches, Thiel has displayed a sense of humor that would have been helpful here. Listening to this five-hour production is like getting stuck at a dinner party beside a guy whose money and surfeit of ideas has convinced him that he should do all the talking.It takes a while to figure out the real point of \u201cGood \u00adProfit: How Creating Value for Others Built One of the World\u2019s Most Successful Companies,\u201d by Charles Koch, the chief executive of Koch Industries. The preface, narrated by Koch himself \u2014 Paul Michael, whose voice you might recall from \u201cThe Da Vinci Code\u201d audiobook, handles the rest \u2014 is a folksy origins story, traced to the family patriarch, Fred Koch, a \u201cJohn Wayne-type\u201d chemical engineer. The younger Koch, now 80 years old, quickly segues into the tale of the astounding growth of the company, which currently employs some 100,000 people in fields as varied as oil, ranching and commodities trading. One thousand dollars invested in this privately held behemoth in 1960, Koch states, would be worth $5 million today.The secret? Market-Based Management, Koch says, which turns out to be a perfectly sensible, five-part framework for making decisions about hiring, firing and managing a company. But that framework was the subject of Koch\u2019s 2007 book, \u201cThe Science of Success.\u201d So what we have here is a rehash and, at a running time that exceeds nine hours, quite a slog, despite Michael\u2019s comfortingly authoritative voice. The bulk of \u201cGood \u00adProfit\u201d is self-\u00adevident truths that have been repackaged as wisdom. Typical is this mouthful from a chapter called \u201cIncentives\u201d: \u201cEvery company should strive to leverage incentives to motivate all employees to fully develop and apply their capabilities to maximize long-term value for the company in a principled way.\u201dO.K. Did someone suggest otherwise?The liveliest part of \u201cGood Profit,\u201d and arguably its reason for being, is a series of homilies in favor of free markets and against corporate welfare and special pleading of any kind. Profit that is \u201cgood\u201d is earned honestly, without favors from the government. Giving a counterexample, Koch denounces a 2014 French law intended to aid independent bookstores by banning online booksellers from offering free shipping. \u201cArtificially propping up businesses is bad for consumers,\u201d he writes, \u201cand ultimately bad for the employees of those businesses, since change is inevitable.\u201dThere is hardly a hint here that Koch and his younger brother David are among the most politically active executives in American history. Together, they have spent hundreds of millions of dollars backing candidates who stand against regulations and taxes. By the midterm elections of 2010, according to Jane Mayer\u2019s book \u201cDark Money,\u201d these efforts yielded astounding results. Democrats lost control of the House of Representatives and Republicans gained 675 seats in state legislatures across the country.Given that Koch Industries is among the country\u2019s leading producers of toxic waste and has spent millions settling cases in federal court, these guys are not exactly disinterested parties. No, they don\u2019t lobby politicians. They just have them replaced. Whether you think this strategy leads to \u201cgood profit\u201d depends on where you stand politically. But Koch\u2019s very hands-on role in American politics is a bizarre omission in a book about the intersection of business and government.\u201cTeam of Teams,\u201d by retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal and three co-authors, appears to have several goals. It works as a calling card for his consulting firm, McChrystal Group, which brings \u201clessons from the battlefield to the boardroom,\u201d as the company\u2019s website says. The book is also a history of one of his great victories: the pursuit and eventual killing of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the elusive and sociopathic leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq.Unfortunately, McChrystal the consultant keeps interrupting McChrystal the general. After every twist and complication in the al-Zarqawi story, we pause so that some theoretical concept \u2014 usually related to how groups are organized, and how McChrystal tinkered with command structure in Iraq \u2014 can be illustrated with a historical anecdote. Thus we get a potted biography of Frederick Taylor, the father of industrial efficiency; an account of NASA in its moonshot era; the story of Horatio Nelson\u2019s victory at Trafalgar; and mini-lectures on subjects as diverse as game theory and the Navy SEALs.McChrystal turns up to narrate five-minute summaries at the end of each chapter (Paul Michael, once again, handles everything else). No doubt these are meant as refreshers, but they make you wonder if this hybrid of management course and combat memoir really needs to be 12 hours long. That\u2019s especially true when McChrystal describes his great \u201caha\u201d moment in the battle against Al Qaeda in Iraq: \u201cWe realized that our goal was not the creation of one massive team. We needed to create a team of teams.\u201d He means an organization in which groups from different fiefs, like the C.I.A. and the Army Special Forces, work together, rather than in competitive silos.That\u2019s the big reveal. Which is heartbreaking, because right after September 11 it was obvious that the intelligence agencies hadn\u2019t been communicating. McChrystal addresses this failure in a section called \u201cSharing.\u201d But he doesn\u2019t explain how lessons of that calamity could have been forgotten a few years later, let alone stand as the \u00adtitle-worthy insight of this overstuffed audiobook.ZERO TO ONENotes on Startups; Or, How to Build the FutureBy Peter Thiel with Blake MastersRead by Blake Masters5 hours.

{"Headline": "6 Dead in Texas Floods, and More Rain Is Coming", "Date": "2016-05-30", "News": "Supported byAt least six people have died in flooding from torrential rain across large areas of Texas, and emergency workers were searching for an 11-year-old boy who was swept away in a storm-swollen creek in Kansas, the authorities said on Monday.In an area including San Antonio and Austin, Tex., the heavy rain could not soak into the limestone and sandstone that characterize the Hill Country region, leading narrow creeks to brim with fast-running waters.Since Wednesday, the thunderstorms have dropped pockets of intensely heavy rain, or \u201crain bombs,\u201d as meteorologists call them.These have circulated through East Texas, Dallas and Corpus Christi, along with Austin and San Antonio, hitting some parts harder than others, said Kurt Van Speybroeck, a National Weather Service meteorologist.As a result, rainfall has ranged from four inches in parts of the Dallas-Fort Worth area to 30 inches in Washington County, the authorities said.\u201cEverybody has seen some impact,\u201d Mr. Van Speybroeck said. \u201cIt has been moving all around, but several locations around the state have been taking it on the chin.\u201dIn coastal Brazoria County, where the Brazos River empties into the Gulf of Mexico, 2,600 inmates from two prisons in Rosharon were evacuated on Sunday to facilities in three nearby counties because the river was expected to reach historic flood levels, said Jason Clark, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.Texas\u2019 terrain and location make parts of the state prone to unruly weather. Its proximity to a flow of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico sets the stage for heavy rain, and the high potential for rapid runoff in the Hill Country makes it vulnerable to flash floods, said Lamont Bain, a Weather Service meteorologist.Urban areas like Houston, which was under a flood warning on Monday, are particularly prone to flooding because rain is poorly absorbed, if at all, in sprawling concrete communities, he said.In last week\u2019s storms, a low-pressure system from the west generated a mass of air that stayed moist and semitropical, setting off thunderstorms that moved across the southeastern and central parts of the state, Mr. Van Speybroeck said.One of the hardest-hit places was Washington County, in southeastern Texas, an area of 622 square miles with a population of about 33,700.John Brieden, the Washington County judge, who serves as a county administrator, said on Monday that workers were trying to assess the damage in the county, where 17 to 30 inches of rain had fallen in 24 hours by Friday.\u201cWe are a rolling-hills area, so generally we don\u2019t worry about flooding. It usually goes to low-lying areas,\u201d Mr. Brieden said. \u201cBut this was so much water so quickly, so all of these streams and creeks were going over the tops of roads and bridges.\u201dMr. Brieden said he could not confirm that Mr. Mitchell had posted the message, which had an image of floodwaters lapping at the truck\u2019s windows. Mr. Brieden said three other bodies had been retrieved from vehicles that had been carried off.He said rescuers had carried out about 50 swift-water operations, sometimes with sonar, to search for people reported missing.At least one bridge was washed out and approaches to others were inundated, making many areas of the county unreachable. More than 100 houses have been damaged, Mr. Brieden said.\u201cIt is sprinkling right now,\u201d he said around noon on Monday. \u201cThe rains haven\u2019t gone away completely.\u201dAnd more rain is to come.The National Weather Service has forecast eight to 10 inches and possibly up to a foot of rain from Wednesday through Friday in some central and southeastern parts of Texas.\u201cIt\u2019s a very small break in a pretty bad situation,\u201d Mr. Van Speybroeck said. \u201cThe soils are saturated, and the rivers are swollen and flooded.\u201dIn the central part of the state, Kirk C. Jenkins, a Kendall County warden, said the body of a 23-year-old woman had been retrieved on Sunday from a vehicle that became inundated by flash flooding near Comfort. Mr. Jenkins said it was his understanding that two other people in the vehicle were able to escape.The storms also swamped Travis County, where rescuers in a helicopter retrieved the body of a man on Sunday during a search of a state highway area, said Lisa Block, a county spokeswoman. The man was not identified.In Kansas, much of the central region was under a flash flood watch through the end of last week.\u201cWe will work as hard as we can and as long as we can to try and bring some kind of closure and peace to the family,\u201d Chief Brown told The Wichita Eagle.Advertisement"}

Let\u2019s do a superquick rundown of the week in tech.But this week we wanted to try something new, right? Instead of a deep dive into one tech topic, we\u2019re going to do a short list, mostly because millennials love lists.I never really saw them around on the street until I moved to San Francisco. Now I mostly see them on cyclist dudes, at least two of whom were smoking pot and blazing through stop signs, I kid you not. I\u2019m walking down the sidewalk and all of a sudden I\u2019m getting low-quality audio blared at me. It\u2019s like being accosted by a drive-by Sublime album.Anyway, you know what I hate? The iPhone charging cable. It\u2019s called Lightning, though a better name would be Fraying. I\u2019m lucky if I get six months out of these cables before they start acting up \u2014 usually the connector begins separating from the cable or you get a kink in the line that begins to crack, and soon your phone stops charging. I hate it. Will someone please make a superstrong charging cable, please?Here\u2019s something else that I wanted to like, but actually hate: streaming, stationary digital cameras like those offered by Nest for the home.I really liked the whole safety and security pitch at first. When I lived in New York, the editors unfortunately wanted me to leave my house and go into the office to work \u2014 something I\u2019m pretty sure you have never done in the San Francisco bureau. So setting up a Nest cam to watch my dog while I\u2019m gone seemed like a nice idea.Instead, I felt like a creepy voyeur. My dog sat and slept by the door, and watching her made me feel sad. Then when my dog walker \u2014 whom I trust and like \u2014 came in, I saw him pet my dog and be supersweet with her and do what I always assumed he did normally, which was walk my dog. But not telling him that I was watching him felt like a strange breach of trust, as if I suspected him of something that wasn\u2019t ever really warranted.It made me realize how prevalent these cameras are now, and how violated I would feel were I being recorded in, say, my friends\u2019 homes. My \u201chatred,\u201d I guess, is that it\u2019s so mainstream and there\u2019s little I can do to stop it.But at my house, at least, I let my dog have her privacy when I\u2019m gone. It\u2019s better that way.Let\u2019s see, what else do I hate? I hate most hashtags. I can see their value as part of a political campaign or meme \u2014 like, #oscarsowhite or #blacklivesmatter \u2014 but I hate when people add useless hashtags to their most banal posts. On Instagram, people will post photos of their trendy brunch and then clog it up with a barrage of idiotic hashtags: #brunch #sundayfun #sleepinglate #ihavenolife #pleasehelp. That kind of thing.Look, you\u2019re not a marketing campaign. Your brunch is not searchworthy. Don\u2019t hashtag your life.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Raised-Fist Photo by Black Women at West Point Spurs Inquiry", "Date": "2016-05-06", "News": "Supported byA group of young black women poised to graduate from the United States Military Academy gathered on the steps of West Point\u2019s oldest barracks last week in traditional gray dress uniforms, complete with sabers, for a group photo. Known as an \u201cOld Corps\u201d photograph because it mimics historical portraits, it was nearly identical to thousands that cadets have posed for over the decades, with one key difference: The 16 women raised their clenched fists.The gesture, posted on Facebook and Twitter last week, touched off a barrage of criticism in and out of the armed forces as some commenters accused the women of allying themselves with the Black Lives Matter movement and sowing racial divisions in a military that relies on assimilation.West Point opened an investigation on April 28 into whether the women violated Army rules that prohibit political activities while in uniform. Now, as the women wait to hear if they will be punished, they are gaining supporters who say they were simply making a gesture of solidarity and strength.The elite public military academy, which trains many of the Army\u2019s future leaders, is overwhelmingly male and 70 percent white. The 16 cadets in the photo represented all but one of the black women in a graduating class of about 1,000, a meager 1.7 percent. But the Army has long tried to play down race and gender to create a force where \u201ceveryone is green.\u201dWhen it comes to protest, West Point could not be more different from a civilian campus, where demonstrations, sit-ins and leaflets are commonplace.At the military academy, in contrast, public displays of politics by students and staff members are prohibited in an effort to build a unified force that remains clear of partisanship.The group photo has revealed an underlying tension at West Point.The academy, while seeking to foster a diverse student body that reflects the nation, also aims to educate future officers in the regimented ways of the military, in which the only differences that matter are the ranks displayed on soldiers\u2019 shoulders.At the heart of the controversy is the gesture the women chose: Did it represent a divisive political statement, a matter of free speech, or just a case of students showing their sense of accomplishment as graduation, set for May 21, drew near?Mr. Burk, a former drill sergeant, who is white, said via email that he had disciplined soldiers for making Nazi salutes in photos, and felt the raised fist was not much different. \u201cThe fact that it could offend someone by its usage qualifies it as a symbol that goes against Army policies,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s not the fact that they are wrong for having their beliefs, it\u2019s the fact they did it while in uniform.\u201d\u201cThese ladies weren\u2019t raising their fist to say Black Panthers. They were raising it to say Beyonc\u00e9,\u201d said Mary Tobin, a 2003 graduate of West Point and an Iraq veteran who is a mentor to some of the seniors and has talked with them about the photograph.\u201cFor them it\u2019s not a sign of allegiance to a movement, it\u2019s a sign that means unity and pride and sisterhood. That fist to them meant you and your sisters did what only a few people, male or female, have ever done in this country.\u201dShe said the women were dismayed by the controversy they had caused. She said most of the West Point graduates she had contacted in recent days saw the women\u2019s gesture as a mistake and planned to lobby against punishment.Gestures of solidarity with Black Lives Matter, which seeks to bring attention to the killing of African-Americans by the police, are hardly uncommon among college students.There is a very different environment at West Point, where incoming students are stripped of all personal possessions, including watches and glasses, and remolded through weeks of grueling team building and history lessons into cadets.The academy permits an array of student groups, including a club for black cadets, known as the Contemporary Affairs Club, but activism is not a permitted activity.West Point officials declined to comment on what punishment, if any, the women might receive, saying an inquiry was continuing.This is not the first time students have made a political statements in an Old Corps photo. In 1976, the year before women were admitted to the academy, male cadets widely referred to themselves as \u201cthe last class with balls,\u201d according to an officer who teaches at West Point. The officer, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak, said that a number of seniors that year posed for a photo holding armloads of basketballs, footballs and baseballs. They were not punished, the officer said.Among Black Lives Matter activists, the women\u2019s gesture was viewed as a generic one that did not necessarily show solidarity with any political cause. Jonathan Pulphus, a junior at St. Louis University and an organizer for the movement, said raising the fist was a way for a younger generation of blacks to pay respect to civil rights accomplishments and create \u201ca space for themselves in institutions where they tend to not have a sense of belonging.\u201dHe said a failure by West Point to recognize this could discourage black students from applying.\u201cIf you want to make an institution appeal to a certain kind of crowd,\u201d he added, \u201cyou don\u2019t stigmatize some of the more important cultural pieces to a student\u2019s background.\u201dJohn Eligon contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Home: A Voice-Activated Device That Already Knows You", "Date": "2016-05-18", "News": "Supported byMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. \u2014 The battle for control of the living room just began in earnest. Also, the bedroom, dining room and \u2014 it\u2019s a safe bet \u2014 the bathroom as well.Google, which knows more things about more people than any other company, organization or government in history, announced on Wednesday a new household device that will use that information to help people run their lives.\u201cWe want users to have an ongoing two-way dialogue with Google,\u201d Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, told about 7,000 attendees in an outdoor music amphitheater here in the Internet company\u2019s hometown. \u201cWe have started becoming truly conversational.\u201dGoogle Home got top billing during the two-hour keynote by Mr. Pichai and other executives at the company\u2019s annual developer conference, but many details \u2014 how much it will cost, when it will be available \u2014 were not disclosed. The device existed on the stage, but its features still seemed to be works in progress.Why introduce it now and make such a big thing of it? The reason seemed to lie in Mr. Pichai\u2019s unusual shout-out to a competitor. \u201cCredit to the team at Amazon for creating a lot of excitement in this space,\u201d he said.Those are millions of consumers who are lost, at least to some extent, to Google. The search company had to begin competing with Amazon before that number swelled to tens of millions. Mr. Pichai pointedly noted that Google was \u201cat a pivotal moment.\u201dThis was Google\u2019s 10th annual developers conference, but the first held in the amphitheater adjacent to its headquarters. The event is designed to be mostly instructive and inspirational for the freelance software engineers who use Google\u2019s tools to build things. But it is also promotional, an opportunity taken to broadcast around the world \u2014 there were a million people listening in China, Mr. Pichai said \u2014 what tomorrow will hold.Mario Queiroz, the Google executive in charge of Home, said it would \u201cbe a beautiful addition to any room in your house.\u201d In a short film, a family was shown waking up with Home. The father used it to play music in one child\u2019s room and to turn on the lights in another to get them out of bed. The girl, finishing her homework, asked Home what the Spanish word was for \u201capple.\u201d The parents rearranged their schedules.\u201cIt will let anyone in the family, kids or adults, have a conversation with Google,\u201d Mr. Queiroz said. Indeed, in the film, everyone is so busy communicating with Home they hardly talk to each other.Google already does search solely through voice, but its efforts have been confusingly branded. On Wednesday, Google promoted Google assistant \u2014 the company\u2019s name for the ability to have a two-way conversation to get information. It will be available this summer in a messaging app called Allo and later in Google Home.There have been efforts before to develop control centers for the home, but none have made serious inroads. Even the Echo was not an immediate hit with reviewers, some of whom wondered whether it might be little more than a gimmick.\u201cBefore I got an Echo I thought it was a joke and a bad idea,\u201d said Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray. \u201cBut I saw the utility and ended up buying five of them for my family.\u201dFor Google Home to stand out, he said, it would have to outdo the Echo, particularly in search. \u201cYou have to be able to ask it a complex question, and then it would go to the Internet and read it back to you,\u201d Mr. Munster said. \u201cEcho doesn\u2019t do a good job of that today.\u201dThe big tech companies are the new middlemen of commerce and communication. People used to go to stores to buy brands on impulse or by design. Now Google, Amazon and the others mediate the moment.One example of that power was given by Mr. Pichai, when he demonstrated a conversation with Google through his phone about taking his family to the movie \u201cJungle Book.\u201d\u201cIs \u2018Jungle Book\u2019 any good?\u201d he asked.

He didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, but as the project progressed over the next few years, he and his son both took something away something more meaningful. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the end it did lead to big discoveries,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Archibald said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe discovered a lot about each other.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI never wanted it to be about autism, as much as I wanted it to show the power of a relationship. I wanted to show the relationship between a dad and a kid.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Howarth said she had great respect for the courage of photographers to delve deeply and honestly into personal reality.

But few are aware of it, and it may be unenforceable.

{"Headline": "Gorilla Killed After Child Enters Enclosure at Cincinnati Zoo", "Date": "2016-05-29", "News": "Supported byVisitors to the gorilla exhibit at the Cincinnati Zoo were screaming, panicked.Somehow, a 4-year-old boy had slipped through the exhibit\u2019s barrier on Saturday afternoon and was now being dragged around like a toy by a hulking silverback gorilla.In videos of the encounter posted to Twitter, a woman can be heard calling to the sobbing child: \u201cMommy loves you! I\u2019m right here!\u201dAfter about 10 excruciating minutes, witnesses said, zoo workers shot and killed the animal, named Harambe. The boy, who was hurt but not severely, was taken to a hospital and released on Saturday night, zoo officials said.\u201cIt was pure panic,\u201d said Brittany Nicely, 29, who was there with her two children.Ms. Nicely said that out of the corner of her eye she spotted the boy on the wrong side of wooden and wire barriers along the edge of the enclosure. She reached for him, she said, but not in time, and he fell about 10 feet into a shallow moat.Harambe, a teenage western lowland gorilla, then grabbed the child, but his intentions were not clear. At times, he stood over the boy in what appeared to be a protective posture. But then he darted across the water, dragging the child roughly behind him.\u201cHe wasn\u2019t throwing him around,\u201d Ms. Nicely said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t mauling him to death, which is what I thought was going to happen.\u201dThe gorilla could have easily crushed the boy at any moment, however, if only by carelessness, she said.Cincinnati Fire Department personnel responding to the scene witnessed the gorilla \u201cviolently dragging and throwing the child,\u201d according to an incident report.

So Mr. Redford\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character runs a lark of a race, liberated to say exactly what he wants because he assumes he can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t win. But, improbably, he does win, abetted by a sometimes-credulous political press corps. In the movie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s closing scene, a blanched Mr. Redford asks an adviser, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do we do now?\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn the 24 hours after Donald J.

Mr. Redford\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character did not get an answer before the credits rolled. And the Republican Party is also waiting for one, as donors, activists and elected officials try to make sense of a world in which their nominee has no political experience, has historically high negative ratings, has offended sections of the electorate and has contradicted central planks of the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s platform.

{"Headline": "Supporting Children Who Serve as Caregivers", "Date": "2016-05-23", "News": "Jane Brody on health and aging.Want more family content? Sign up for our Well Family newsletter. Each week, get the latest news on parenting, child health and relationships plus advice from our experts to help every family live well.They may have to shop, prepare meals, clean house, do the laundry and tend to the hygienic needs of family members unable to care for themselves.At the same time, these children must go to school, do their homework and attempt, but usually fail, to participate in nonacademic activities like sports and friendships widely recognized as important to well-rounded development.Connie Siskowski, a registered nurse in Boca Raton, Fla., knows well the challenges these children face. As an 11-year-old with divorced parents, she began living with her grandparents in New Jersey. Her grandfather was, as she put it, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy hero, the only person I was close to, and it was my honor to help him with personal care issues.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI slept in the living room so I could be near him in case he needed something during the night. One night I went into the bedroom to give him his medicine, and I found him dead of cardiac disease.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThere was no support system to help Connie, then 13, deal with the emotional fallout from this loss and put the pieces of her life back together. For years thereafter, she said she made poor personal choices, including three bad marriages. Her only good choice during this time: going straight from high school to nursing school, then getting advanced degrees in cardiac nursing and health care administration and a Ph.D. in educational leadership.After her third marriage failed, she finally found her emotional equilibrium through counseling. She married a fourth time to a man who loves and respects her and, with his encouragement, felt compelled to do something to help caregiving children and \u00e2\u0080\u009cprevent some of the repercussions I experienced.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThus far, more than 1,000 children in Palm Beach County, Florida, have benefited from the support the organization offers to children 18 or younger who regularly help relatives with \u00e2\u0080\u009cphysical or mental illness, disability, frailty associated with aging, substance misuse or other conditions.\u00e2\u0080\u009dDr. Siskowski\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Caregiving Youth project, now at eight middle schools and nine high schools in Florida, offers classes on topics like coping with stress and anger and managing finances. Along with home-care demonstrations and respite care, the project sponsors field trips, overnight camps and other recreational and social activities. They hope to expand the program to other schools throughout the country.Schools are made aware that the children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s responsibilities may be reasons for incomplete homework, absenteeism and poor academic performance. The project offers in-home tutoring and study programs and even provides computers and printers for children who can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get to a library. After four house fires resulted from youthful cooking attempts, the association began distributing slow cookers and fire extinguishers.Perhaps most important, the children learn that they are not alone and that there is help available. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe kids feel valued; they learn what love is, and it flips the anger and frustration they may otherwise feel,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Siskowski said. The project stays in their corner until they graduate from high school.One beneficiary was Nickolaus Dent, featured on CNN in 2012. When Nickolaus was 11, his father died and he became primary caregiver for his mother, sick with H.I.V. The boy was responsible for the grocery shopping and cooking, cleaning and laundry. He made sure his mother took her medication, got her dressed and sometimes even helped her bathe.He said he considered caring for his mother \u00e2\u0080\u009ca bigger priority than going to school.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But with the organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s help, he managed to do both, getting A\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and B\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. His mother died in December 2012, and Nickolaus expects to graduate from high school this year.Others now being helped include Julianna Doran, a 14-year-old ninth grader, and Alecia Locke, a 13-year-old seventh grader, both in Boca Raton. Julianna helps to care for her 10-year-old brother who has cerebral palsy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t walk; he can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t control his muscles; he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dead weight,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. Julianna\u00e2\u0080\u0099s parents have serious back problems, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largely her job to lift and carry him.Alecia, whose parents are divorced, spends weekends with her dad, whose mobility is seriously limited by multiple sclerosis. She does his laundry and dishes, cleans floors, assists with his scooter and fills the gas tank.Dr. Siskowski knows much more help for young caregivers is needed now and in the years ahead. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith the increase in technology, more people are living longer and being cared for at home,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are more multigenerational households, more women working and more gaps in the health care system that are being filled by children. We need to get these kids recognized as a vulnerable population at risk of dropping out of school.\u00e2\u0080\u009dShe added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSociety can benefit from investing in them. Children who graduate from high school have the potential of earning $10,000 more a year.

{"Headline": "Donald Trump and Paul Ryan Face Off Across a Splitting Seam", "Date": "2016-05-06", "News": "\nThe Republican Party banner was yanked at the seams on Thursday. Whether it unravels remains unclear. The highest-ranking elected Republican, Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, told CNN that he could not yet support the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s standard-bearer, Donald J. Trump. The reason, he said, was that Mr. Trump did not yet bear the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s standards, a sentiment emphasizing the effect of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s statements about women, his aggressive comments and his positions that are at odds with the Republican platform in some cases.Yet Mr. Trump did not yield. In an uncharacteristically circumspect statement, Mr. Trump responded that he was not yet ready to support Mr. Ryan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s positions. The speaker is not only a favorite of Republican elites, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a powerful elected official who has been seen as a savior of the conservative movement from which he emerged. Mr. Trump said he hoped that the two could come to terms at some point, another rarity from the presumptive presidential nominee. Mr. Ryan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comments are not only about trying to leverage Mr. Trump to sand down his rougher edges, but they could position Mr. Ryan neatly for a presidential run in 2020, should Mr. Trump lose.

{"Headline": "Peter Thiel, Tech Billionaire, Reveals Secret War With Gawker", "Date": "2016-05-25", "News": "Supported byA billionaire Silicon Valley entrepreneur was outed as being gay by a media organization. His friends suffered at the hands of the same gossip site. Nearly a decade later, the entrepreneur secretly financed a lawsuit to try to put the media company out of business.What the jury \u2014 and the public \u2014 did not know was that Mr. Bollea had a secret benefactor paying about $10 million for the lawsuit: Peter Thiel, a co-founder of PayPal and one of the earliest investors in Facebook.\u201cIt\u2019s less about revenge and more about specific deterrence,\u201d he said on Wednesday in his first interview since his identity was revealed. \u201cI saw Gawker pioneer a unique and incredibly damaging way of getting attention by bullying people even when there was no connection with the public interest.\u201dMr. Thiel said that Gawker published articles that were \u201cvery painful and paralyzing for people who were targeted.\u201d He said, \u201cI thought it was worth fighting back.\u201dMr. Thiel added: \u201cI can defend myself. Most of the people they attack are not people in my category. They usually attack less prominent, far less wealthy people that simply can\u2019t defend themselves.\u201d He said that \u201ceven someone like Terry Bollea who is a millionaire and famous and a successful person didn\u2019t quite have the resources to do this alone.\u201dMr. Thiel said that he had decided several years ago to set his plan in motion. \u201cI didn\u2019t really want to do anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought it would do more harm to me than good. One of my friends convinced me that if I didn\u2019t do something, nobody would.\u201dHe continued, \u201cIt\u2019s not like it is some sort of speaking truth to power or something going on here. The way I\u2019ve thought about this is that Gawker has been a singularly terrible bully. In a way, if I didn\u2019t think Gawker was unique, I wouldn\u2019t have done any of this. If the entire media was more or less like this, this would be like trying to boil the ocean.\u201d Mr. Thiel said he had not targeted any other media companies.But the revelation this week that Mr. Thiel was covertly backing Mr. Bollea\u2019s case as well as others has raised a series of new questions about the First Amendment as well as about the role of big money in the court system \u2014 specifically the emerging field of litigation finance, in which third parties like hedge funds and investment firms pay for other people\u2019s lawsuits.Roy D. Simon, a professor emeritus of legal ethics at Hofstra University School of Law, suggested that the practice has helped \u201clevel the playing field\u201d by providing resources for people to mount cases against big institutions that would be impossible otherwise.But he said there was a risk when a lawsuit was funded by a single person with a potential agenda. \u201cI am troubled by Thiel,\u201d Professor Simon said. \u201cI guess that one guy is much more likely to have an agenda driven by revenge or personal dislike or wanting to prove a point.\u201dBut other legal experts said that the mere fact of Mr. Thiel\u2019s involvement did not change the case. And while there is no legal requirement that underwriters like Mr. Thiel reveal their involvement to the opposing side or the jury, it is considered fair game for lawyers to ask questions about financial backing \u2014 something that Gawker Media did on Wednesday in court as part of its efforts to overturn the Hogan judgment.\u201cIf you really do have concerns about the merits of this case, finding out who bankrolled it doesn\u2019t really help you at all,\u201d said Mary Anne Franks, a professor at the University of Miami School of Law. Absent any indication that there is something unlawful about how the funding took place, she said, \u201cyou would still need to show that there\u2019s something substantively wrong with the ruling.\u201dIn a statement, Nick Denton, the founder of Gawker Media, who was also personally named in the Hogan suit, said: \u201cJust because Peter Thiel is a Silicon Valley billionaire, his opinion does not trump our millions of readers who know us for routinely driving big news stories including Hillary Clinton\u2019s secret email account, Bill Cosby\u2019s history with women, the mayor of Toronto as a crack smoker, Tom Cruise\u2019s role within Scientology, the N.F.L. cover-up of domestic abuse by players and just this month the hidden power of Facebook to determine the news you see.\u201dMr. Thiel is known as a brilliant entrepreneur. Born in West Germany and raised in California, he became a chess prodigy, an academic star and a promising lawyer before settling down in the Bay Area to found companies.He achieved demigod status among Silicon Valley business leaders, thanks largely to his role at PayPal, where he became the de facto don of the early employee group known as the PayPal mafia. That group went on to become power players at such Silicon Valley institutions as Tesla, YouTube, LinkedIn and Yelp.Mr. Thiel is also known for his lucrative investment in Facebook, where he is a board member, and his three venture firms, Founders Fund, Mithril and Valar. (His defunct hedge fund, Clarium Capital, has been long forgotten.) He also co-founded the secretive data-crunching start-up Palantir and bankrolled Breakout Labs, which only funds what Mr. Thiel calls \u201chard tech\u201d start-ups that tackle things like new energy, transportation and biotech companies. \u201cWe wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters,\u201d is the Founders Fund tag line.But unlike most Silicon Valley billionaires, Mr. Thiel openly supports a wide array of eccentric philanthropic and social efforts aimed at radically altering life as we know it. His Thiel fellowship gives high school and college-age students money to drop out of school and start companies. He has donated to organizations that seek to extend the human life span, such as the Methuselah Foundation. And he co-founded the Seasteading Institute, which aims to create cities that float at sea, beyond the reach of governments and their laws.A libertarian, Mr. Thiel is a pledged delegate for Donald J. Trump for the 2016 Republican National Convention.He said that he hired a legal team several years ago to look for cases that he could help financially support. \u201cWithout going into all the details, we would get in touch with the plaintiffs who otherwise would have accepted a pittance for a settlement, and they were obviously quite happy to have this sort of support,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a way very similar to how a plaintiff\u2019s lawyer on contingency would do it.\u201d Mr. Thiel declined to disclose what other cases he had supported but there are at least two current cases against Gawker.Without revealing an exact figure, he said that estimates of $10 million in expenses so far were \u201croughly in the ballpark.\u201d He added: \u201cI would underscore that I don\u2019t expect to make any money from this. This is not a business venture.\u201dHe would not say whether he had compensated any of the people, including Mr. Bollea, which could raise questions in an appeal. He insisted \u201cthere was no gray area\u201d in what he had done.Mr. Thiel was not the only boldface name in Silicon Valley who was outed as gay by Gawker Media \u2014 Timothy D. Cook, the chief executive of Apple, is another example.Owen Thomas, the former editor of Valleywag who wrote the article about Mr. Thiel, offered his side of the story in a telephone interview on Wednesday. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said before, I did not \u2018out\u2019 Peter Thiel,\u201d said Mr. Thomas, now business editor at The San Francisco Chronicle. \u201cI did discuss his sexuality, but it was known to a wide circle who felt that it was not fit for discussion beyond that circle. I thought that attitude was retrograde and homophobic, and that informed my reporting. I believe that he was out and not in the closet.\u201dMr. Thiel said he considered his financial backing of the cases against Gawker to be \u201cone of my greater philanthropic things that I\u2019ve done. I think of it in those terms.\u201dHe refused to divulge exactly what other cases he has funded but said, \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say this is not the only one.\u201dSpeculation that a secret benefactor was backing Mr. Bollea\u2019s case was whispered during the trial but largely dismissed as a conspiracy theory. It gained currency in large part as a result of an unusual decision Mr. Bollea\u2019s legal team made: It purposely excluded a claim that would have allowed Gawker\u2019s insurance company to help pay for its defense as well as damages. The move struck observers as odd because most plaintiffs seeking damages usually hope to settle the case by leveraging the deep pockets of an insurer.Mr. Thiel said, \u201cI figured it would eventually come out,\u201d adding that he was happy his role might spur a conversation about it being \u201cextremely hard for the most common victims to get justice.\u201dHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s not for me to decide what happens to Gawker. If America rallies around Gawker and decides we want more people to be outed and more sex tapes to be posted without consent, then they will find a way to save Gawker, and I can\u2019t stop it.\u201dJohn Herrman, Matthew Goldstein and Katie Benner contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dehydration: Risks and Myths", "Date": "2016-05-09", "News": "Jane Brody on health and aging.Truth to tell, sometimes I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t follow my own advice, and when I suffer the consequences, I rediscover why I offer it. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve long recommended drinking plenty of water, perhaps a glass with every meal and another glass or two between meals. If not plain water, which is best, then coffee or tea without sugar (but not alcoholic or sugary drinks) will do.I dined out recently after an especially active day that included about five miles of walking, 40 minutes of lap swimming and a 90-minute museum visit. I drank only half a glass of water and no other beverage with my meal.It did seem odd that I had no need to use the facilities afterward, not even after a long trip home. But I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t focus on why until the next day when, after a fitful night, I awoke exhausted, did another long walk and swim, and cycled to an appointment four miles away. I arrived parched, begging for water. After downing about 12 ounces, I was a new person. I no longer felt like a lead balloon.It seems mild dehydration was my problem, and the experience prompted me to take a closer look at the body\u00e2\u0080\u0099s need for water under a variety of circumstances.Although millions of Americans carry water bottles wherever they go and beverage companies like Coke and Pepsi would have you believe that every life can be improved by the drinks they sell, the truth is serious dehydration is not common among ordinary healthy people. But there are exceptions, and they include people like me in the Medicare generation, athletes who participate in particularly challenging events like marathons, and infants and small children with serious diarrhea.Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s start with some facts. Water is the single most important substance we consume. You can survive for about two months without food, but you would die in about seven days without water. Water makes up about 75 percent of an infant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weight and 55 percent of an older person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weight.Human cells simply don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t function without water, and the body has evolved a finely tuned, complex system for making sure it has the water it needs under a wide range of conditions. In most cases, thirst is a reliable signal that more water is needed. A main job of the kidneys is to excrete just enough water to keep cells properly hydrated. However, contrary to myth, dark urine does not necessarily mean you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re dehydrated. Urine can be discolored by foods like asparagus, blackberries and beets.Another popular myth: To moisturize skin, prevent wrinkles and produce a glowing complexion, you need to drink eight glasses of water a day. Drinking extra water doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t improve skin in people who are otherwise well hydrated. Better to use an emollient moisturizer to counter dry skin.Good hydration definitely protects against kidney stones, and there is evidence that it counters constipation and exercise-induced asthma. It may also help protect against vascular diseases, like stroke, an elevated heart rate or sudden drop in blood pressure and is especially important for people with diabetes.Despite the vital importance of water, there are relatively few good studies of how much is needed, by whom and under what circumstances, according to Barry M. Popkin, a professor of nutrition at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe do not truly understand how hydration affects health and well-being, even the impact of water intakes on chronic diseases,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he and his colleagues wrote in Nutrition Reviews.\u00e2\u0080\u009cNearly all the funding of water research has been provided by industry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Popkin said in an interview, referring to companies that sell all manner of beverages, including bottled water. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd most of the research on water has been organ-specific, done by people studying the kidneys or lungs. Whole body systems haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been well studied.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThere are no formal guidelines on how much water people need each day. The amount is affected by what people eat, their weight and activity level and even the environment in which they live.The Institute of Medicine, which issues recommendations on the amounts of nutrients we need, states that an \u00e2\u0080\u009cadequate intake\u00e2\u0080\u009d of water ranges from 700 milliliters (about three cups) a day for newborns to 3.8 liters (16 cups) for lactating women. Still, the institute concluded that \u00e2\u0080\u009cindividuals can be adequately hydrated at levels below as well as above the adequate intakes provided.\u00e2\u0080\u009dFurthermore, the institute stated that all kinds of liquids can contribute to a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s total water needs, including beverages like tea, coffee, juices, sodas and drinking water, as well as the moisture contained in foods like fruits, vegetables, soups and even meats. In fact, the institute estimates that the moisture in food accounts for about 20 percent of a typical person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s water intake.Although the institute included juices and sodas as potential sources of hydration, these often sugar-laden beverages have become a serious nutritional problem in recent decades. The entire increase in fluid intake in the United States, from 79 ounces a day in 1989 to 100 ounces in 2002, came from caloric beverages, Dr. Popkin and colleagues reported. Studies have shown that people who drink these extra calories don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t compensate by consuming commensurately fewer calories from food, which has contributed mightily to the ballooning waistlines of Americans.To be sure, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important for athletes to drink plenty of water, especially when high levels of activity, heat and humidity result in excessive sweating. But overdoing hydration has its own risks; marathon runners and other athletes have died after drinking more water than the kidneys are capable of processing in a timely manner, leading to swollen cells and dangerously low blood levels of sodium and other electrolytes.At the same time, inadequate hydration can have debilitating effects. Studies by Lawrence B. Armstrong and colleagues at the University of Connecticut\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Human Performance Laboratory showed that dehydration can adversely affect vigilance, concentration, reaction time, learning, memory, mood and reasoning and can cause headaches, fatigue and anxiety.Older people, especially the frail elderly, are among those at greatest risk of poor hydration, Dr. Popkin noted. The mechanism of thirst becomes less effective with age, and many older people cut back on how much they drink to limit how often they need to get to a bathroom.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a big problem with older people falling during the night and breaking bones when they get up to go to the bathroom,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Popkin said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMany don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t drink because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re afraid to fall, but instead they may die of the effects of dehydration.\u00e2\u0080\u009dRelated:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "Uber and Lyft End Rides in Austin to Protest Fingerprint Background Checks", "Date": "2016-05-09", "News": "Supported byUber and Lyft were not bluffing.On Monday, the two leaders of the booming ride-hailing industry halted service in Austin, Tex., after losing a legislative fight over how they screen their drivers.Ending the service also meant that about 10,000 drivers would be out of work, Taylor Patterson, an Uber spokeswoman, said.\u201cFolks are devastated,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are saying, \u2018I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to pay my rent.\u2019\u201dThe legislative fight playing out in Austin, the Texas capital, has been watched closely by municipalities across the country as they ponder how to handle public-safety issues posed by the so-called sharing economy.Austin\u2019s City Council voted in 2015 to require that the companies subject their drivers to fingerprint background checks, which could turn up criminal records. The regulation was fiercely opposed by the industry as unnecessary and less effective than its own system.Uber and Lyft, both based in California, responded by underwriting a nearly $9 million campaign against the ordinance that culminated with an up-or-down vote by Austin residents on Saturday. Nearly 56 percent voted to preserve the measure, which also includes requirements for identifying vehicles and data reporting.Both companies described the result as bitterly disappointing on Monday.\u201cUnfortunately, the rules passed by the City Council don\u2019t allow true ride-sharing to operate,\u201d Lyft said in a statement. \u201cInstead, they make it harder for part-time drivers, the heart of Lyft\u2019s peer-to-peer model, to get on the road and harder for passengers to get a ride.\u201dLawmakers and some law enforcement professionals have argued that fingerprint checks, which are required of Austin\u2019s taxi drivers, are the best way to establish a person\u2019s identity and weed out those with criminal records.Uber has said that its own checks, performed by the third-party provider Checkr, include scrutiny of court records and other biographical information and are more effective than the fingerprint checks, which it said rely on incomplete federal databases.Industry experts have noted that the fingerprint rules, which go fully into effect next February, could pose a potentially time-intensive and costly new burden on the companies and their drivers.David Butts, a political consultant in Austin who helped lead a campaign to preserve the new ordinance, accused Uber and Lyft of putting corporate strategy above public safety.\u201cBut we\u2019re a progressive city,\u201d Mr. Butts said. \u201cWe happen to believe that government has a role to play. And the idea that we\u2019re just going to give them a blank check and say, \u2018Self-regulate and we\u2019ll take your word for it\u2019 was not acceptable to the majority of voters in this city.\u201dIn addition to Uber and Lyft, at least three ride-hailing companies are operating in Austin, a center of technology that hosts the South by Southwest festival and is home to the University of Texas\u2019 flagship campus.City officials said other companies were making inquiries on Monday after the announcements by Uber and Lyft.Councilwoman Ann Kitchen, who led the effort to tighten the regulation of ride-hailing companies, said in an interview on Monday that the city was open to continuing talks with Uber and Lyft.\u201cOf course, we have always said to Uber and Lyft that they are welcome here and we didn\u2019t ask them to leave,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we have got to respect the will of the voters.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to the start of new fingerprint background rules in Austin.

{"Headline": "\u2018The Founder,\u2019 Like Ray Kroc, Feasts on McDonald\u2019s Imagery", "Date": "2016-05-19", "News": "Supported byThose words are spoken by Ray Kroc, or rather Michael Keaton, in \u201cThe Founder,\u201d a film about the McDonald\u2019s Corporation, as he envisions the stature the soon-to-be ubiquitous emblem would attain for the fast-food chain in a nation that in 1954 already had steeples and flagpoles aplenty.\u201cMcDonald\u2019s can be the new American church,\u201d says Mr. Keaton\u2019s Kroc, as he begs to join the brothers Dick and Mac McDonald in transforming their small California company into much more than a string of burger joints.Twists that soon left Kroc in control of the McDonald\u2019s name and its corporate identity make up the plot of a movie that both loves and loathes its hero, an archetypal postwar businessman. And the film\u2019s portrayal of Kroc comes with a notable irony: Unauthorized by the company, \u201cThe Founder\u201d uses McDonald\u2019s zealously guarded iconography to provide a bold visual tour through Kroc\u2019s supposed hijacking of those same, mostly trademarked, images.\u201cIf it\u2019s a biopic of anything, it\u2019s of the McDonald\u2019s brand and restaurants rather than Ray,\u201d said John Lee Hancock, who directed \u201cThe Founder,\u201d set for release in the United States on Aug. 5 by the Weinstein Company.McDonald\u2019s, like most corporations, maintains close control of its corporate imagery. And it would have reason to keep an eye on \u201cThe Founder,\u201d with its ambivalent portrayal of Kroc.In a movie biography, said Valerie Barreiro, who teaches on the topic of intellectual property at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law, \u201cI would imagine that any use would likely meet the fair-use standard,\u201d as long as the film does not falsely portray McDonald\u2019s, and treads carefully with trademarks in its marketing materials.Ms. Barreiro noted that \u201cthe risks are higher\u201d for an unauthorized use of trademarks in the promotion of a work. Perhaps not by accident, a prominent poster for \u201cThe Founder\u201d portrays only a portion of the current McDonald\u2019s logo, where the Golden Arches converge to form the middle of an \u201cM.\u201dRobert Gibbs, global chief communications officer for McDonald\u2019s, declined to comment on \u201cThe Founder,\u201d its use of company trademarks, or its least complimentary claim about Kroc: that he reneged on a handshake deal to pay the McDonald brothers a percentage of his revenue as part of a 1961 agreement in which he purchased their company for $2.7 million.In his 1977 autobiography, \u201cGrinding It Out,\u201d Kroc did not mention the supposedly promised royalty in his summary of the deal\u2019s terms. But he said the McDonald brothers reneged on an oral promise to include their original restaurant in the sale.Jason French, Dick McDonald\u2019s grandson, said on Friday that the never-paid royalty would have delivered \u201cin the billions\u201d of dollars. His grandfather, he said, did not reconcile with Kroc, but was occasionally involved with the corporation after Kroc\u2019s death.The brothers\u2019 resentment involved not just the money, Mr. French said, but Kroc\u2019s habit of calling himself the McDonald\u2019s \u201cfounder,\u201d though what he actually founded was a corporation that eventually absorbed the original McDonald\u2019s company.\u201cThe Founder\u201d is based on a script by Robert D. Siegel, who wrote \u201cThe Wrestler.\u201d Mr. Keaton, nominated for an Oscar in 2015 for \u201cBirdman,\u201d plays Kroc as a complicated beast, wrapping boundless optimism and heedless drive into a single, half-endearing package.\u201cI couldn\u2019t remember ever reading a script where I was pulling so hard for the protagonist in the first half, then questioning my own feeling for him in the second,\u201d Mr. Hancock said.Mr. Hancock said the \u201cFounder\u201d script struck him as being distinctive, in that it set out to portray the history of both a business and an industry, much as \u201cCitizen Kane\u201d described the rise of modern newspapers, and \u201cThe Big Short\u201d tackled Wall Street\u2019s role in the housing crisis.He spoke by telephone last week, catching a reporter in the parking lot of the oldest operating McDonald\u2019s, in Downey, Calif. \u201cSpeedee\u201d the hamburger man, one of the company\u2019s original trademarks, renewed in 2010, winked from above.Mr. Hancock\u2019s film rivals Kroc\u2019s boldness in using the McDonald\u2019s name and visual identity.In large part, that was engineered by Michael Corenblith, a production designer who worked previously with Mr. Hancock on \u201cThe Blind Side,\u201d \u201cThe Alamo\u201d and \u201cSaving Mr. Banks.\u201dAlso speaking by telephone last week, Mr. Corenblith called the process of recovering the early McDonald\u2019s imagery \u201cas difficult as anything I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d That included, he said, his replication of Walt Disney\u2019s personal office in \u201cSaving Mr. Banks,\u201d a film about Disney\u2019s encounters with the \u201cMary Poppins\u201d author P. L. Travers.Based on old photographs, blueprints and other archival material, the work began, Mr. Corenblith said, with reconstruction of the McDonald brothers\u2019 hamburger assembly line \u2014 a precise system, devised in their original San Bernardino restaurant, that has been likened in its effect on the industry to the automotive work of Henry Ford.Eventually, Mr. Corenblith and his team built two full-size mock-ups of early McDonald\u2019s restaurants, both with working kitchens.One, in Newnan, Ga., replicated the San Bernardino restaurant, an octagonal building that has since been destroyed. The other, in Douglasville, Ga., was based on the existing Downey restaurant, which Mr. Corenblith repeatedly examined and measured.\u201cWe were able to visit on multiple occasions, under the radar,\u201d he said. Ultimately, Mr. Corenblith added, \u201cabsolute high fidelity\u201d to McDonald\u2019s own designs, including the various arches and the largely retired \u201cSpeedee,\u201d bolstered the film\u2019s claim to fair use.The Douglasville set, which had the twin space-age, parabolic arches and canted windows that so captivated Kroc, was redressed, and occasionally tweaked onscreen with digital effects, to stand in for perhaps 20 early McDonald\u2019s locations that appear in the film, including the first Kroc-owned franchise, in Des Plaines, Ill.Some early research by the writer and producers was assisted by an independently owned McDonald\u2019s museum that now occupies the site of the original restaurant. \u201cEverything was hush-hush with us,\u201d said Albert Okura, the museum\u2019s proprietor and the founder of Juan Pollo, his own California fast-food chain.At one point, said Mr. Okura, producers of \u201cThe Founder\u201d suggested they might give the museum their sets. But that plan changed, said Aaron Ryder, a producer of the film, at his own behest, and not under pressure from McDonald\u2019s.\u201cI didn\u2019t want the liability,\u201d Mr. Ryder said, \u201cand all the lawyers.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the state where Des Plaines, the site of an early McDonald\u2019s restaurant, is situated. It is Illinois, not Indiana.Advertisement"}

The rates are published daily for various interest rate derivatives contracts, which banks trade with other financial institutions and sell to clients looking to either hedge against a swing in interest rates or to speculate on the markets. In a separate benchmark fixing case, Citigroup agreed to resolve claims that it had tried to manipulate the Yen London Interbank Offered Rate and the Euroyen Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate. Citigroup\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role in trying to manipulate overseas benchmark rates tied to the pricing of interest rates and the use of derivatives products tied to those benchmarks has been no secret.In 2011, the Tokyo Financial Services Agency sanctioned Citigroup for its actions and temporarily suspended a derivatives product. In February, Citigroup agreed to pay $23 million to settle a lawsuit brought by several hedge funds and a public pension plan over claims that the bank had conspired to manipulate the yen Libor rate.Bitcoin experts and law enforcement officials have spent more than two years trying to establish how hundreds of thousands of Bitcoins disappeared from the Mt. Gox exchange and there have been few solid answers. The trustee said on Wednesday at a meeting with creditors that $414 million of the claims appeared to be legitimate and have been approved. They will get some portion of the $91 million. It is not yet clear how much because of outstanding lawsuits and investigations. Bitcoin investors have complained about how long it has taken to work through the claims. The legal and accounting costs have added up to about $55 million so far. Mr. Karpeles was arrested by the Japanese authorities last August on suspicion of illegally adding money to an account under his control, though not on charges directly related to the missing Bitcoins. Japanese government officials have still given few indications of what they think happened to the missing money. end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "One Top Taxpayer Moved, and New Jersey Shuddered", "Date": "2016-04-30", "News": "Supported byInside WealthOur top-heavy economy has come to this: One man can move out of New Jersey and put the entire state budget at risk. Other states are facing similar situations as a greater share of income \u2014 and tax revenue \u2014 becomes concentrated in the hands of a few.Last month, during a routine review of New Jersey\u2019s finances, one could sense the alarm. The state\u2019s wealthiest resident had reportedly \u201cshifted his personal and business domicile to another state,\u201d Frank W. Haines III, New Jersey\u2019s legislative budget and finance officer, told a State Senate committee. If the news were true, New Jersey would lose so much in tax revenue that \u201cwe may be facing an unusual degree of income tax forecast risk,\u201d Mr. Haines said.The New Jersey resident (unnamed by Mr. Haines) is the hedge-fund billionaire David Tepper. In December, Mr. Tepper declared himself a resident of Florida after living for over 20 years in New Jersey. He later moved the official headquarters of his hedge fund, Appaloosa Management, to Miami.New Jersey won\u2019t say exactly how much Mr. Tepper paid in taxes. But according to Institutional Investor\u2019s Alpha, he earned more than $6 billion from 2012 to 2015. Tax experts say his move to Florida could cost New Jersey \u2014 which has a top tax rate of 8.97 percent \u2014 hundreds of millions of dollars in lost payments.Mr. Tepper, 58, declined to comment on his move. He does have family \u2014 his mother and sister \u2014 who live in Florida. But several New Jersey lawmakers cited his relocation as proof that the state\u2019s tax rates, up from 6.37 percent in 1996, are chasing away the rich. Florida has no personal income tax.\u201cIf you\u2019re making hundreds of millions of dollars and you\u2019re paying close to 10 percent to the state of New Jersey, you do the math,\u201d said Jon Bramnick, the Republican leader in the New Jersey Assembly. \u201cYou can save millions a year by moving to Florida. How can you blame him?\u201dBeyond the debate on taxing the rich, Mr. Tepper\u2019s move is a case study in how tax collections are affected when income becomes very highly concentrated. With the top tenth of 1 percent of the population reaping the largest income gains, states with the highest tax rates on the rich are growing increasingly dependent on a smaller group of superearners for tax revenue.In New York, California, Connecticut, Maryland and New Jersey, the top 1 percent pay a third or more of total income taxes. Now a handful of billionaires or even a single individual like Mr. Tepper can have a noticeable impact on state revenues and budgets.California had to account for a \u201cFacebook effect\u201d in 2012 and 2013 after that company\u2019s 2012 initial public offering of stock. The offering generated more than $1 billion in revenue \u2014 much of that from the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, and a small group of company shareholders. Washington, D.C., had an unexpected $50 million gain in its 2012 fiscal year \u2014 which helped create a budget surplus \u2014 after the death of a local billionaire increased its estate tax receipts.Some academic research shows that high taxes are chasing the rich to lower-tax states, and anecdotes of tax-fleeing billionaires abound. But other studies say there is little evidence showing that the rich move solely for tax purposes. Millionaires and billionaires who move from the high-tax states in the Northeast to Florida, for instance, may be drawn by the sunshine, lifestyle and retirement culture, in addition to lower taxes.While some high earners may be moving for tax reasons, New Jersey, New York, California and other states are replacing rich people faster than they are losing them. New Jersey had 237,000 millionaires in 2015, compared with 207,200 in 2006, according to Phoenix Marketing International, a research firm. New York added 69,500 millionaires from 2006 to 2015, to 437,900, while California added over 100,000 millionaires, to 772,600.The best solution to the mega-taxpayer dilemma, some tax experts say, is for states to do a better job of tracking and forecasting the incomes of their top earners. Since the rich are the most mobile and are able to manage their investments just as easily in Miami as in Manhattan, states are devising new ways to monitor their top taxpayers and keep them from leaving.\u201cIn a time of rising inequality, I\u2019m not sure the right answer is lowering taxes or making them less progressive,\u201d said Kim S. Rueben, senior fellow of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute. \u201cIt\u2019s more about keeping an eye on people, seeing where they are and enforcing the tax rules.\u201dConnecticut, home to several hedge fund billionaires, now tracks the quarterly estimated payments of 100 of its top earners. Kevin B. Sullivan, commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Revenue Services, said about five or six of the highest earners could have a \u201cmeasurable impact on the revenue stream.\u201dMr. Sullivan said that when one of the state\u2019s rich hedge fund executives planned to move his family and company to a lower-tax state, state officials met with him and persuaded him to leave some of his work force in Connecticut.\u201cWe knew we were going to lose him,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said. \u201cBut we wanted to keep some of the higher-paying jobs.\u201d He said the state worked out a deal to keep the jobs in exchange for an agreement about the owner\u2019s regular visits to family and friends in Connecticut. (Homeowners who spend more than 183 days in the state are considered residents for tax purposes.) He said the state was holding discussions with other top earners in hopes of keeping them.\u201cI\u2019m not saying we\u2019re sending fruit baskets and get-well cards,\u201d said Mr. Sullivan, a former Democratic legislator. \u201cBut we\u2019re trying to send a more welcoming message to the high earners as a group.\u201dNew York is now more closely monitoring wealthy taxpayers who have homes in New York but claim Florida as their tax residence. And New Jersey is collecting data on all of the taxpayers who make more than $1 million to forecast their tax payments more accurately.In California, 5,745 taxpayers earning $5 million or more generated more than $10 billion of income taxes in 2013, or about 19 percent of the state\u2019s total, according to state officials.\u201cAny state that depends on income taxes is going to get sick whenever one of these guys gets a cold,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said.Hence New Jersey\u2019s concern over Mr. Tepper\u2019s departure. Whatever the reasons for his move, he is leaving for Florida at an especially opportune time for tax savings. Many hedge fund managers have for years used a tax loophole that allowed them to defer taxes on fees they earned through the use of offshore funds. A 2008 federal tax rule, however, requires them to declare those fees by the end of 2017 and pay any necessary federal, state and local taxes.For some hedge fund managers, the amounts declared will probably be in the billions of dollars, accountants say. A spokesman for Mr. Tepper declined to comment on his overseas income. By moving to Florida, Mr. Tepper could avoid paying state income taxes on any such funds.\u201cIf he\u2019s bringing money back, you\u2019re talking about a big possible gain,\u201d Mr. Bramnick said. \u201cSo it\u2019s a good time to move to Florida.\u201dMr. Tepper regularly topped state wealth rankings as New Jersey\u2019s richest resident. He also has homes in Miami Beach and the Hamptons. In 2012 and 2013, he also topped Alpha\u2019s list of the highest-earning hedge fund managers, with estimated earnings of $2.2 billion in 2012 and $3.5 billion in 2013. His earnings fell to $400 million in 2014.Mr. Tepper never publicly announced his move to Florida. But it became public on April 5, when Mr. Haines, citing a Bloomberg report, mentioned Mr. Tepper\u2019s move in his remarks to the State Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee. In discussing the move, Mr. Haines said, \u201cEven a 1 percent forecasting error in the income tax estimate is worth $140 million.\u201dMr. Tepper\u2019s payments may have even been higher. If Mr. Tepper earned $3.5 billion in 2013, his state tax bill could have been over $300 million, according to New Jersey accountants. Granted, his actual payments were probably far lower because of deferred income, charitable deductions and other accounting treatments. Yet Mr. Haines\u2019s comments are believed to be the first time a state official has warned of a budget risk because of one resident\u2019s relocation.\u201cWe\u2019ve had states mention risks from high-income groups, but never from a single taxpayer,\u201d Ms. Rueben of the Tax Policy Center said.ROBERT FRANK is CNBC wealth editor and the author of \u201cRichistan.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Aging in Place", "Date": "2016-05-02", "News": "Jane Brody on health and aging.When I asked the other three members of my walking group, all of whom are in their mid to upper 70s, whether they had any concerns about future living arrangements, they each said they had none despite the fact that, like me, they live in multistory private homes without elevators and, in two cases, without bathrooms on every floor.My Los Angeles son asked recently what I might do if I could no longer live in my house, and I flippantly replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m coming to live with you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The advantages: I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be surrounded by a loving and supportive family, and the warm weather is a benefit for someone like me who becomes increasingly intolerant of the cold with each passing year. The disadvantages: I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d lose a familiar community and a host of friends, and his house, unlike mine, is on a steep hill with no nearby stores; if I could no longer drive, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have to be chauffeured everywhere.Probably my biggest deterrent would be relinquishing my independence and the incredible number of \u00e2\u0080\u009ctreasures\u00e2\u0080\u009d I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve amassed over the last half century. The junk would be easy, but parting with the works of art and mementos would be like cutting out my heart.For those who wish to age in place, the authors of \u00e2\u0080\u009c70Candles: Women Thriving in Their 8th Decade,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jane Giddan and Ellen Cole, list such often-needed home attributes as an absence of stairs, wide doorways to accommodate a walker or wheelchair, slip-resistant floors, lever-style door knobs, remotely controlled lighting, walk-in showers, railings, ramps and lifts. Add to these a 24-hour help system, mobile phone, surveillance cameras and GPS locaters that enable family members to monitor the well-being of their elders.While many young adults chose to live and bring up children in the suburbs, a growing number of empty-nested retirees are now moving to city centers where they can access public transportation, shop on foot for food and household needs, and enjoy cultural offerings and friendly gatherings without depending unduly on others.One reason my friends and I are unwilling to even consider leaving our Brooklyn community is our ability to walk to supermarkets, banks, food co-ops, hardware stores, worship and recreational facilities, and get virtually everywhere in the city with low-cost and usually highly efficient public transportation. No driving necessary.We also wallow in the joys of near-daily walks in a big, beautiful urban park, remarking each time about some lovely vista \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the moon, sunrise, visible planets, new plantings and resident wildlife.Of course, there are still many older adults, widows and widowers in particular, who for financial or personal reasons move in with a grown child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family, sometimes in an attached apartment or separate floor. Host families may gain a built-in babysitter, and children can develop a more intimate relationship with grandma or grandpa.For those with adequate finances, there is no shortage of for-profit retirement communities that help older people remain independent by providing supportive services and a host of amenities and activities. Some have extensive recreational and exercise facilities, as well as book and craft clubs, discussion groups and volunteer opportunities. Some take residents to theatrical productions and museums and on trips to nearby attractions.I confess that retirement communities that house only older adults are not my style. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t imagine living in a place where I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see and interact with children on a daily basis. I find that nothing cheers me more than a smile or comment from a toddler. I guess I take after my father, who used to flirt with every child he noticed in a car near his. But I realize that, just as some people are averse to dogs, not everyone enjoys the companionship of a high-energy child.For older people likely to require help with the activities of daily living, there are many assisted living facilities where residents can get more or less help, including aid with medications, feeding and ambulation, according to their changing needs.Related:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

It Wants More.", "Date": "2016-05-05", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseFacebook reported dazzling first quarter results last week: Net income nearly tripled to $1.5 billion, and monthly active users hit a record 1.65 billion. But it\u2019s a much smaller number that leapt out at me.Fifty minutes.That\u2019s the average amount of time, the company said, that users spend each day on its Facebook, Instagram and Messenger platforms (and that\u2019s not counting the popular messaging app WhatsApp).Maybe that doesn\u2019t sound like so much. But there are only 24 hours in a day, and the average person sleeps for 8.8 of them. That means more than one-sixteenth of the average user\u2019s waking time is spent on Facebook.The average time that users spend on Facebook is nearing an hour. That\u2019s more than any other leisure activity surveyed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, with the exception of watching television programs and movies (an average per day of 2.8 hours). It\u2019s more time than people spend reading (19 minutes); participating in sports or exercise (17 minutes); or social events (four minutes). It\u2019s almost as much time as people spend eating and drinking (1.07 hours).\u201cWhen you really think about it, 50 minutes is a tremendous amount of time \u2014 it\u2019s huge,\u201d said Ken Sena, a managing director and analyst at Evercore who covers consumer Internet companies. \u201cUsually, when a platform expands its user base, the average time spent goes down, because a lot of new people aren\u2019t that active.\u201dBut the average time people spend on Facebook has gone up \u2014 from around 40 minutes in 2014 \u2014 even as the number of monthly active users has surged. And that\u2019s just the average. Some users must be spending many hours a day on the site, prone to the unofficial syndrome known as Internet Addiction Disorder.\u201cThey\u2019re doing a tremendous job of finding ways to keep people on the site,\u201d Mr. Sena said.Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, disclosed the 50 minutes metric almost as an aside during the company\u2019s earnings call last month. But it could well have been the opening slide in his presentation, because time has become the holy grail of digital media.Time is the best measure of engagement, and engagement correlates with advertising effectiveness. Time also increases the supply of impressions that Facebook can sell, which brings in more revenue (a 52 percent increase last quarter to $5.4 billion).And time enables Facebook to learn more about its users \u2014 their habits and interests \u2014 and thus better target its ads. The result is a powerful network effect that competitors will be hard pressed to match.Ranked by average time spent on the platform, Facebook has few rivals. According to the latest data from comScore, the only one that comes close is Alphabet\u2019s YouTube, where users spent an average of 17 minutes a day on the site. That\u2019s less than half the 35 minutes a day users spent on Facebook, based on comScore\u2019s data (which, unlike Facebook\u2019s 50 minutes, is derived only from users in the United States).Users spent an average of nine minutes on all of Yahoo\u2019s sites, two minutes on LinkedIn and just one minute on Twitter, according to comScore. No wonder Twitter is struggling to attract ad spending.People spending the most time on Facebook also tend to fall into the prized 18-to-34 demographic sought by advertisers.\u201cGenerally speaking, higher usage on Facebook skews to younger users, and towards millennials specifically,\u201d said Andrew Lipsman, vice president for marketing and insights at comScore. \u201cYou hear a narrative that young people are fleeing Facebook. The data show that\u2019s just not true. Younger users have a wider appetite for social media, and they spend a lot of time on multiple networks. But they spend more time on Facebook by a wide margin.\u201dThe surging popularity of Facebook and other social media naturally brings up some questions: What aren\u2019t Facebook users doing during the 50 minutes they spend there? Is it possibly interfering with work (and productivity), or, in the case of young people, studying and reading?That data is hard to come by. For one thing, people don\u2019t want to admit in surveys that they are using social media when they are supposed to be doing something else.While the Bureau of Labor Statistics surveys nearly every conceivable time-occupying activity (even fencing and spelunking), it doesn\u2019t specifically tally the time spent on social media, both because the activity may have multiple purposes \u2014 both work and leisure \u2014 and because people often do it at the same time they are ostensibly engaged in other activities, according to a bureau spokeswoman.The closest category would be \u201ccomputer use for leisure,\u201d which has grown from eight minutes in 2006, when the bureau began collecting the data, to 14 minutes in 2014, the most recent survey. Or perhaps it would be \u201csocializing and communicating with others,\u201d which slipped from 40 minutes to 38 minutes.But time spent on most leisure activities hasn\u2019t changed much in those eight years of the bureau\u2019s surveys. Time spent reading dropped from an average of 22 minutes to 19 minutes. Watching television and movies increased from 2.57 hours to 2.8. Average time spent working declined from 3.4 hours to 3.25. (Those hours seem low because much of the population, which includes both young people and the elderly, does not work.)The bureau\u2019s numbers, since they cover the entire population, may be too broad to capture important shifts among important demographic groups. ComScore reported that television viewing (both live and recorded) dropped 2 percent last year, and it said younger viewers in particular are abandoning traditional live television. People ages 18-34 spent just 47 percent of their viewing time on television screens, and 40 percent on mobile devices. Among those 55 and older, 70 percent of their viewing time was on television, according to comScore. So among young people, much social media time may be coming at the expense of traditional television.Mr. Lipsman of comScore said he was skeptical that social media use could be blamed for stagnating productivity or a decline in educational standards. He said comScore\u2019s data suggests that people are spending on average just six to seven minutes a day using social media on their work computers. \u201cI don\u2019t think Facebook is displacing other activity,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople use it during downtime during the course of their day, in the elevator, or while commuting, or waiting. That\u2019s the biggest driver of so much of this engagement.\u201dFacebook, naturally, is busy cooking up ways to get us to spend even more time on the platform. A crucial initiative is improving its News Feed, tailoring it more precisely to the needs and interests of its users, based on how long people spend reading particular posts. For people who demonstrate a preference for video, more video will appear near the top of their news feed. The more time people spend on Facebook, the more data they will generate about themselves, and the better the company will get at the task.As a company spokeswoman, Jessie Baker, told me: \u201cThe time people spend on our site is a good measure of whether we\u2019re delivering value to them. The better we do at providing what people most want to see, the more likely they are to return to the app and spend time.\u201dObviously there are limits to how much time Facebook users can spend since there are only 24 hours in a day. But short of that, \u201cI don\u2019t feel there\u2019s any upper limit,\u201d said Mr. Sena, the analyst. \u201cEverybody wants to be the platform that\u2019s on all day, kind of like some people used to have their television on all the time. Facebook is probably in the best position because people are already such active users.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Garland.With senators back home, the group Americans United for Change is conducting what it calls its 9-9-9 Tour, taking mobile billboards to nine states over nine days to push for confirmation of a ninth justice to what is now an eight-member court after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe longer the Supreme Court is left a justice short, the more dysfunction and uncertainty it invites for businesses and citizens across the country,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Brad Woodhouse, president of the group.The advocacy group is moving beyond the six swing-state Republican senators who have received most of the attention from Democrats: Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Mark S. Kirk of Illinois, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Rob Portman of Ohio, Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, and Charles E. Grassley of Iowa. This recess, critics of the Republicans are adding Senators John McCain of Arizona, Roy Blunt of Missouri and Richard M. Burr of North Carolina to the target list, and they will also get the billboard treatment.The expanded list not only makes it possible for the Democrats to use their catchy numerical title; it also shows they believe the Supreme Court fight is putting more Republican senators in potential jeopardy in November, and they are trying to take advantage of it.But what the weekslong campaign has not done so far is shown much progress in persuading Senate Republicans to hold hearings and a vote on the nomination. Despite many meetings between Republicans and Judge Garland, Republicans have refused to budge on scheduling a hearing, and the nomination seems firmly stalled.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

He made no attempt to address the questions the author spent eight years exploring.Tillman\u2019s book is about a seemingly incomprehensible murder of three young children by their parents in Brownsville, Tex.

Tillman is determined to locate humanity both in the perpetrators of this heinous crime and in the people who were most intimately exposed to it. Her aspiration, her commitment and her courage are extraordinary.Giridharadas, on the other hand, denies that any such thinking is of value.

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "Juliana Sohn was visiting relatives in South Korea 15 years ago when she walked into a discussion between her grandmother and her mother. The older woman needed a portrait. For her funeral.\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a professional photographer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d her mother said, referring to Ms. Sohn. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe tone of the conversation was like they were talking about the weather,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Sohn recalled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the kind of gravity or tone I was used to with people talking about death.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s who you are, who you think you are and how you want to be remembered. For Koreans, funerary portraits, which honor the dead at funerals, symbolize all three. The unexpected exchange between her mother and grandmother led Ms. Sohn to embark on a project with these portraits in all their complexity. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have learned that when an older person looks at themself they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily see what is reflected in the mirror,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ms. Sohn, who was born in Seoul and moved to New Jersey as a child. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see themselves the way I would see them, a stranger meeting them for the first time. They remember what they looked like and felt like when they were years younger, and this personal history affects the way they see themselves now and want to be represented. Or perhaps by the time some seniors decide they need a funerary portrait, they are older than they had hoped to look in a portrait that will memorialize them.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSeveral years later, when Ms. Sohn started to envision these portraits as a project, she realized that for Koreans, the practice is just a matter of responsibility, like a last will and testament. They are so common in Korea, Ms. Sohn said, that there are photo studios just for customers needing one. Not so much in the United States, where they are usually arranged through churches or Korean community centers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s generally done by someone who is a well-meaning amateur,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Sohn said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure how successful a lot of the results are.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMs. Sohn thought she could give back to her community with her professional skills by providing portraits to Koreans in her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s New Jersey church. Although she was too late \u00e2\u0080\u0094 someone had beat her to it \u00e2\u0080\u0094 she went elsewhere, hoping to provide a service, as well as to create a body of artwork, which she likens to a memento mori. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDeath is portrayed in the artwork of many cultures and religions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is a moral aspect of the memento mori, as it reminds people of their mortality and the vanity of earthly riches. I believe the responsibility of having to set aside a funerary portrait reminds Koreans of their mortality.\u00e2\u0080\u009dOver the course of five years, Ms. Sohn photographed funerary portraits for about 100 older Koreans whom she found in churches, Korean senior centers and community centers in New Jersey and New York. She tried to capture the person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s essence rather than the reality of how they looked. She uses Photoshop to erase blemishes or, in the case of one woman with a stroke, any disfigurations. There is little research into the origin of funerary portraits. It was suggested to Ms. Sohn that they might stem from an older Korean tradition of writing the deceased person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name vertically on a banner.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis was used on the person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death day to pray for them, functioning much like the current funerary portraits,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen Christianity came to Korea this practice of ancestor worship was forbidden. Replacing the banner with a photo of the deceased was the Koreans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 way of working around the ban.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The project inadvertently brought her closer to her own relatives from whom she has always felt a little distant, if only out of respect for her elders. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis whole process has made me understand my elders and seniors,\u201d she said, \u201cand that sort of emotional wall between me and them where I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t relate to them has really been broken down for me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}
{"Headline": "Merrick Garland Completes Nominee Questionnaire for the Senate", "Date": "2016-05-10", "News": "Judge Merrick B.

Instead Judge Garland filled out a standard questionnaire for nominees to lower courts.The document details his awards, speeches, news media interviews and more. His employment history dates to a summer job when he was in his early 20s on the re-election campaign of Representative Abner J. Mikva, an Illinois Democrat who later became chief judge of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the post Judge Garland now holds.It also lists his judicial opinions, at one point asking him to enumerate his 10 \u00e2\u0080\u009cmost significant\u00e2\u0080\u009d decisions. Among them was his 2015 decision in Cause of Action v. F.T.C., a case in which a conservative legal watchdog group argued that it was entitled to have its Freedom of Information Act request fees waived because its requests were in the public interest; the judges, including Judge Garland, unanimously sided with the group.The questionnaire \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which, after naming a nominee and scheduling meetings with senators, seems to be the last bit of the nomination process over which the administration has any control \u00e2\u0080\u0094 represents another attempt by White House officials to pressure Republicans to act.

The senator\u2019s spokeswoman did not reply to a request for comment on Tuesday.For Senate Democrats, the questionnaire offered another opportunity to slam Republicans for blocking the Garland nomination \u00e2\u0080\u0094 this time with props.

They theatrically popped open the lids, posing for photos with the three-ring binders inside, as they again urged Republicans to move forward.Asked whether Senate Democrats would consider holding a mock hearing for Judge Garland if Republicans continued to withhold the real thing, Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the senior Democrat on the committee, said he hoped it would not come to that.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think some would probably like us to do some sort of a pretend hearing.

{"Headline": "Reality TV Inspires Fat Study", "Date": "2016-05-05", "News": "Supported byIt was such a clever idea \u2014 why not look at the \u201cBiggest Loser\u201d contestants and ask what happened to them over the years? But how, I wondered, had Kevin Hall, the researcher at the National Institutes of Health, who actually directed that study, even thought of it?It all began, Dr. Hall says, because he likes to watch reality television shows. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those guilty pleasures I have. When I get home from work I want to watch trash. A friend said, \u2018You ought to check out the Biggest Loser.\u2019 I was more interested in something like \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d but I decided one night to turn it on.\u201dHe tuned in to the NBC show, in the middle of an episode. At the end, the contestants stepped on scales and, to Dr. Hall\u2019s astonishment, registered incredible weight loss, as much as 13 pounds in one week.\u201cI was like, \u2018What the hell is going on?\u2019 \u201d I decided to tune in the next week. I saw a bunch of people getting yelled at on treadmills.\u201d\u201cI had these questions \u2014 what happened to their metabolisms, what happened to their body compositions?\u201d Dr. Hall suggested collaborating with Dr. Huizenga to find out.There were issues \u2014 professional differences and personality clashes between a member of Dr. Hall\u2019s team and Dr. Huizenga. To make matters worse the institute was disinclined to have Dr. Hall do the study because they did not want to be involved with a reality TV show.But Dr. Hall was persistent.\u201cI had a very interesting group of scientific questions, and I couldn\u2019t do this study at the N.I.H.,\u201d he said.There was no way he could bring obese people in and make them exercise that much and diet that strenuously.In the end, the study went forward, with Dr. Huizenga\u2019s cooperation. That was how they got the contestants\u2019 metabolic and hormonal data before season eight began and at the finale.\u201cThen we said, \u2018We\u2019d like to see what happens long term.\u2019 \u201d Dr. Hall said. At first Dr. Huizenga was interested, but then he said NBC wanted the institute to fund a big reunion party. That, of course, was out of the question. So Dr. Hall was on his own.Then Dr. Jennifer Kerns, who had been a Loser herself in an earlier episode of the series and then worked as a doctor with the show, moved to Washington. Dr. Hall told her his problem \u2014 he wanted to study the Losers six years later, but had no way of contacting them. She told him about a secret Facebook page to which Losers belonged. She helped Dr. Hall find them through that page, which enabled him to do the final metabolic measurements without the involvement of NBC or Dr. Huizenga. He invited the 16 contestants from season eight to come to the N.I.H. for two days of testing. Fourteen agreed.When the federal researchers measured the Losers\u2019 metabolic rates, they were shocked \u2014 at the show\u2019s finale, the contestants\u2019 rates were lower than would be expected for people their size. But now, six years later, they were even lower.\u201cIt is very disturbing. I almost don\u2019t believe it,\u201d Dr. Hall told me in December, shortly after he saw the results. \u201cI was just blown away.\u201d Rigorous tests produced the same conclusion: six years after the show\u2019s finale, the contestants\u2019 metabolisms really were slower than they had been when the contest ended.And, that, in the end, was what made the results so stunning. For example, Danny Cahill, the man who won the contest in the eighth season, (losing 239 pounds in seven months,) was now burning 800 calories a day less than expected for a man his size. And he had food cravings that were often irresistible, leading to binges. No wonder he gained back more than 100 pounds despite his best efforts not to.Dr. Hall sent out an email to the contestants, telling them the news, writing: \u201cWe suspect this will not come as a big shock to you guys, who are actually living in your bodies and having to work so hard to keep weight off!

{"Headline": "Muslim Leaders Wage Theological Battle, Stoking ISIS\u2019 Anger", "Date": "2016-05-08", "News": "Supported byAs the military and political battle against the Islamic State escalates, Muslim imams and scholars in the West are fighting on another front \u2014 through theology.It is a religious rumble that barely makes headlines in the secular West since it is carried out at mosques and Islamic conferences and over social media.The Islamic State, however, has taken notice.The group recently threatened the lives of 11 Muslim imams and scholars in the West, calling them \u201capostates\u201d who should be killed. The recent issue of the Islamic State\u2019s online propaganda magazine, Dabiq, called them \u201cobligatory targets,\u201d and it said that supporters should use any weapons on hand to \u201cmake an example of them.\u201dThe danger is real enough that the F.B.I. has contacted some of those named in the Islamic State\u2019s magazine \u201cto assist them in taking proper steps to ensure their safety,\u201d said Andrew Ames, a spokesman for the F.B.I.\u2019s field office in Washington.The death threats are a sign that Muslim religious leaders have antagonized the Islamic State, according to analysts who are studying the militant group. Their growing influence also contradicts those who claim that Muslim leaders have been silent in the fight against violent extremism.Several of the targeted Muslim leaders said in interviews that, while they were taking the threat seriously, they had no intention of backing off. They have hired security guards and fortified their workplaces, and some keep guns at home.\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to be denounced by ISIS,\u201d said Imam Webb, who frequently engages young Muslims over social media, whether on YouTube, Facebook, Periscope or Snapchat. \u201cI consider it one of my greatest accomplishments in life.\u201d\u201cIt has only reinvigorated me,\u201d he said, \u201cto provide the antivenom to the poison of ISIS.\u201dThese Muslim leaders say they are responding to fellow believers who are looking for a religiously based rebuke to violent movements that claim to be acting in the name of Islam. They say that extremist groups like the Islamic State are a threat not just to civil society and security, but to the future of their faith.\u201cNone of our senior scholars of any school \u2014 any school \u2014 has justified these deeds,\u201d Sheikh Qadhi said at the East London Mosque.He argued that the terrorist attacks of recent years had clearly violated Islamic teaching because they \u201ccause more harm than good,\u201d bringing more bombs, more drones and more chaos to Muslim communities, he said.\u201cWho has benefited? Please use the intelligence that Allah gave you,\u201d he said. \u201cThese radical groups have harmed the image of Islam infinitely more than all of the foreign policy of Western lands combined.\u201dThese scholars ridicule the Islamic State\u2019s claim to have created a \u201ccaliphate\u201d ruled by a successor to the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. Instead, in a highly effective bit of rebranding, they call the Islamic State Kharijites, a reviled group of Muslims who killed women and children and rebelled against the caliphs in the seventh century.The imams named by the Islamic State are based in the United States, Canada, Britain and Australia. They represent a broad spectrum of Islamic thought \u2014 from spiritual Sufis to puritanical Salafis, and even the more militant \u201cSalafi Jihadis.\u201dTo the Islamic State\u2019s propagandists, it does not matter that the imams are fervent Muslims or critics of American foreign policy: They are all \u201cunbelievers,\u201d just like the Shiite Muslims, Christians and Yazidis that the Islamic State has killed by the thousands in Iraq, Libya, Syria and elsewhere.This is not the first time that the Islamic State has targeted Muslim leaders in the United States, but this is the longest list yet. It includes Sheikh Hisham Kabbani, a Lebanese Sufi now based mostly in Michigan who has been warning for years about rising extremism.The list also includes Salafi-oriented preachers such as Bilal Philips, a Canadian convert who has been barred from several countries because of allegations that he preaches extremism; Tawfique Chowdhury, an Australian doctor who founded organizations and charities that propagate orthodox views of Islam; and Abu Basir al-Tartusi, a Syrian preacher based in London who has spoken in support of Al Qaeda, according to news reports.Cole Bunzel, a scholar at Princeton University studying Islamic history and jihadist ideology, said, \u201cWhat ISIS is saying is that even if you support Al Qaeda, even if you\u2019re a supporter of someone like Tartusi, you\u2019re still not on team Islam.\u201dSeveral terrorism experts said that an attack on any of these people was more likely to happen abroad than in the United States, but that all it would take is one deluded or mentally unbalanced \u201clone wolf.\u201dSheikh Hamza will soon air a television series in the Middle East, \u201cRihla With Sheikh Hamza Yusuf\u201d (rihla is \u201cquest\u201d in Arabic). The show applies traditional Islamic scholarship to contemporary challenges in the Muslim world, and it includes strong messages against extremism \u2014 which Sheikh Hamza said amounts to \u201cswatting the hornet\u2019s nest again.\u201d It is likely to be seen in Iraq and Syria, the Islamic State\u2019s strongholds, he said.Sheikh Qadhi, however, said that, based on several frightening experiences recently in Tennessee, he has more to fear from right-wing Muslim-haters than from adherents of the Islamic State.\u201cI\u2019m not scared of ISIS in America,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel very safe in every mosque I go to. But I am scared of other people in this land who are very ignorant and bigoted.\u201dHe said he had gotten used to being vilified by both sides: \u201cThe right wing is calling me a stealth jihadist. And ISIS is calling me a sellout. We challenge both of their narratives, even as their narratives feed into each other.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Monday about a theological battle being fought by Muslim imams and scholars in the West against the Islamic State misstated the Snapchat handle used by Suhaib Webb, one of the Muslim leaders speaking out.

I really do try to stay away from corporations that have been problematic for my politics. I don\u2019t ever step foot in a Chick-fil-A restaurant because of the company\u2019s hostility toward L.G.B.T. causes, though if I\u2019m honest, I don\u2019t really know where to find one in my neighborhood anyway. I would never patronize Hobby Lobby because I believe in women\u2019s access to contraception, but I also can\u2019t say that I have consumer needs that Hobby Lobby can fill, either.Then there are those purchases of real importance and the times when you have to make decisions about the cost of your convictions. I am speaking of swimwear and, more specifically, the Lands\u2019 End Slender Tunic, a hardworking piece of equipment that, tricky as it may be to slither into, can transform your body into something similar to what you sort of hoped it would look like if you blurred your eyes in a poorly lit room.If you allow it to, this baby will level out your stomach as if it were an only slightly corrugated piece of cardboard. It will turn some arbitrary midpoint of your torso back into a waist with its patented squeezing technology. I knew all this, for I own two of them: a brown one, whose material became inexplicably see-through around the middle of my back within just a year, and a red one, whose color was too light to help promote the fiction I was trying to unleash on the world.After my first pregnancy, I despaired of finding a suit that might cover the wreckage that childbearing had wrought. I lived in California at the time, so many of my friends told me to embrace my stretch marks as the stripes a tiger has from being fierce, or some such. My stomach, which was now topographically comparable to a road in rural Liberia, was a badge of honor, they said. But those same women wore bikinis, and there was no sign of stretching or aging on them. It was only my friend Janet who looked me up and down, wide-eyed, and politely said, \u201cHave you been to the Lands\u2019 End website?\u201dI had never shopped at Lands\u2019 End; I hadn\u2019t felt old enough or Midwestern enough or suburban enough. In a strange way, I hadn\u2019t felt settled enough in adult life to go somewhere quite so utilitarian. Janet assured me that I was ready, and not by a little, and she sat me down in front of her computer. She introduced me to a feature (now defunct) of Lands\u2019 End shopping: It was called My Virtual Model, and it was a figure you could modify with your own measurements, and even your haircut, so you could see how one of the site\u2019s rayon-blend products would look hanging off your particular figure. I made mine as I was at the time, with thighs that touched hard and back fat and brown hair. I dressed her in horrible A-line dresses with surreptitious elastic waists and boat necks \u2014 so many boat necks on that website, an ocean full of boat necks. With a deeper breath, I finally put her in a bathing suit that, in front of my eyes, reduced the lumps it covered, and the Uncanny Valley version of myself smiled back.My Virtual Model was excised from the site a few years later \u2014 maybe she had taken a stand on the wage gap? \u2014 but it no longer mattered. Once every year or so, I simply clicked \u201corder,\u201d and my bathing suit would arrive.Now at the pool club we join every summer, I see my children\u2019s friends\u2019 mothers wading in the shallow end. We all look like newborn seals in our Lands\u2019 End bathing suits \u2014 colorless, newly hairless after a long winter, frightened and resentful. We greet one another with a quick raise of the chin, and we evaluate what the people you are asked to take seriously at P.T.A. meetings look like barely clothed, knowing this cold truth: that we do not look as bad as we could.How innocuous was the interview? Well, one featured quote was this scorcher from Steinem: \u201cFashion is what someone else tells you to wear, but style is about personal expression and freedom.\u201d Hardly bra-burning stuff. Its only transgressive act was mentioning style in a Lands\u2019 End catalog.I read Lands\u2019 End\u2019s spineless reply (\u201cSome customers were troubled and concerned that we featured an interview with Gloria Steinem in a recent catalog. Lands\u2019 End is committed to providing our loyal customers and their families with stylish, affordable, well-made clothing. We greatly respect and appreciate the passion people have for our brand. It was never our intention to raise a divisive political or religious issue, so when some of our customers saw the recent promotion that way, we heard them. We sincerely apologize for any offense.\u201d). I wrote on Twitter: \u201cLands\u2019 End: many sweatpants, no balls,\u201d and, boy, was that retweeted, and I was pretty proud of my politics. But now, here I was, two weeks later entering my 40s, my body a fossil of young middle-age and childbearing, and I had no place to buy a bathing suit.Taffy Brodesser-Akner is a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}

The way it initially handled this month\u2019s flare-up over accusations of political bias in its Trending Topics feed can only lead to this answer: not very.And that should concern anyone of any political persuasion as Facebook continues to gain influence over the national \u2014 and international \u2014 conversation.That has helped chip away at the centrality of destination news sites like The New York Times, The Washington Post, the right-leaning Daily Caller and the left-leaning Talking Points Memo. Their articles must now vie for attention in the Facebook algorithms that help determine which items will be prominent in which users\u2019 feeds and which will be highlighted in the Facebook Trending section that is prominent on users\u2019 home pages.So Facebook, born of the open Internet that knocked down the traditional barriers to information, becomes a gatekeeper itself. It now has an inordinate power to control a good part of the national discussion should it choose to do so, a role it shares with Silicon Valley competitors like Google and Twitter.And yet\u2026\u201cWhat they have is a disproportionate amount of power, and that\u2019s the real story,\u201d Mr. Carlson told me. \u201cIt\u2019s just concentrated in a way you\u2019ve never seen before in media.\u201dFor outlets like The Daily Caller, The Huffington Post, The Washington Post or The New York Times \u2014 for whom Facebook\u2019s audience is vital to growth \u2014 any algorithmic change can affect how many people see their journalism.For all that sway, Facebook declines to talk in great detail about its algorithms, noting that it does not want to make it easy to game its system. That system, don\u2019t forget, is devised to keep people on Facebook by giving them what they want, not necessarily what the politicos or news organizations may want them to see. There can be a mismatch in priorities.But Facebook\u2019s opacity can leave big slippery-slope questions to linger. For instance, if Facebook can tweak its algorithm to reduce click bait, then, \u201cCan they put a campaign out of business?\u201d asked John Cook, the executive editor of Gawker Media. (Gawker owns Gizmodo, the site that broke the Trending story.)No Facebook executive would discuss it with me on the record. That\u2019s not the only reason this column may seem a little cranky. My Facebook Trending list this week included this beaut: \u201cGastroesophageal Reflux Disease.\u201d First of all, it was dyspepsia, and it was, like, 20 years ago. See that?

{"Headline": "Out With the Old", "Date": "2016-05-12", "News": "Experiments involving health and well\u00c2\u00ad-being typically require their subjects to change just one aspect of their lives. Focusing on a single variable like diet or exercise makes it simpler to collect data and draw conclusions. But some researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara, recently wondered if this minimalist approach might be shortchanging people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s potential to improve their health. Maybe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better to address all of our bad habits at once rather than try to make incremental changes to our lives.After six weeks, the students retook the original tests. Those in the control group showed no changes. But the others were substantially stronger, fitter and more flexible. They performed much better on tests of thinking, focus and working memory. They also reported feeling happier and calmer; their self-esteem was much higher. Their brain scans showed a pattern of activity believed to indicate a greatly enhanced ability to stay focused.These improvements, especially on measures of mood and stress reduction, generally exceeded by a great deal what had been seen in many past experiments whose subjects altered only one behavior. The study\u00e2\u0080\u0099s authors suggest that one kind of change, like starting an exercise regimen, may amplify the effects of another, like taking up meditation. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more, the improvements persisted: According to Michael Mrazek, the director of research at the Center for Mindfulness & Human Potential at U.C.S.B. and the study\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lead author, another set of tests six weeks after the experiment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s end showed that the change-everything students still scored much higher than they originally had on measures of fitness, mood, thinking skills and well-being, even though none of them were still exercising or meditating as much as they did during the experiment.Of course, this study couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t isolate which elements of the lifestyle makeover were essential, or how the various changes influenced one another. There were too many moving parts. Mrazek says that he and his colleagues plan to tackle these issues in future experiments.

{"Headline": "\u2018Farewell Kabul,\u2019 by Christina Lamb", "Date": "2016-05-27", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.There is a certain subspecies of journalist who comes to feel more at home in a foreign war zone than in her native land, who gets so plugged in with power brokers and average people that her access is the envy of diplomats and intelligence agents, and who develops a knack for explaining a country\u2019s idiosyncrasies to a readership keen to make some sense of \u201cthat mess over there.\u201dChristina Lamb, a British journalist and author, stands out among this subspecies as one of the premier explainers and explorers of Afghanistan. She is that rare breed of reporter who not only manages all of the above, but who also refuses to abandon a story even when it disappears from the front pages or becomes exceedingly dangerous to cover. This career choice \u2014 which comes with a mandatory flak jacket \u2014 offers rewards that are bittersweet: The thrill of having a front-row seat to history is lessened by the loss of still-young colleagues and sources you spoke with only yesterday. But perhaps one of the best rewards is living to tell the tale that virtually no one else can.Lamb achieves exactly that in \u201cFarewell Kabul.\u201d Following the success of her books \u201cThe Sewing Circles of Herat\u201d and \u201cI Am Malala\u201d (with Malala Yousafzai), Lamb\u2019s newest volume sheds as much light on the post-9/11 military adventurism of the United States and Britain as it does on Afghanistan and, by default, on neighboring Pakistan. With more than 25 years of experience reporting in the region, Lamb takes the reader on a journey that begins in Kabul on Christmas Eve 2001.A few days earlier, on Dec. 22, Hamid Karzai had been inaugurated as the new president of Afghanistan. Most Afghans, Lamb points out, did not even know his name. But Westerners found him dignified and eloquent, and he had been chosen at a conference in Bonn earlier that month in part because he wasn\u2019t just another warlord. His name may have been new to most of the planet, but not to Lamb. She had come to know Karzai when she lived in his neighborhood in Peshawar in the late 1980s, back when he was a spokesman for a small mujahedeen group fighting the Soviets.Late December 2001 was a little more than three months after Al Qaeda had flown planes into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, killing nearly 3,000 people. America responded by launching a war to topple the Taliban and kill or capture all of Al Qaeda\u2019s arch-\u00adterrorists, who\u2019d found succor with the Taliban regime. Several American allies were cajoled to help, most notably Britain, though as Lamb observes, when Britons look back on the first and second Anglo-Afghan wars of the 19th century, they see mostly graveyards. In 1963, the British prime minister Harold Macmillan declared: \u201cRule No.\u202f1 in politics: Never invade Afghanistan.\u201dUnless, of course, it\u2019s being used as a launchpad by Islamic extremists. Al Qaeda\u2019s attack provided more than enough of an excuse for the United States and its allies to invade Afghanistan \u2014 or \u201cliberate\u201d it, as the Bush administration put it. When Lamb made a quick visit to New York City that December following 9/11, a still-\u00adsmoldering ground zero brought home to her the magnitude of devastation for Americans. But most Afghans, she points out, had no access to television or the Internet, and didn\u2019t believe towers so tall could exist, much less be destroyed by planes. Her senior Pakistani sources were sure it was the work of Israel\u2019s Mossad.George W. Bush, on the other hand, was impressed with how swiftly the largely Pashtun Taliban had been toppled, thanks to an alliance with its rivals in the Tajik-\u00addominated Northern Alliance. So impressed, in fact, that around the time of Karzai\u2019s inauguration, Bush was discussing an invasion of Iraq.\u201cElections were planned for the following spring,\u201d Lamb writes. \u201cBut when I talked to my Afghan friends, nobody mentioned democracy or women\u2019s rights. They wanted security and food and speedy justice. The West had its swift military success, dismantling the Taliban regime in two months. I don\u2019t think anybody spoke to ordinary Afghans about what they wanted.\u201dAlthough the countless mistakes and policy blunders that were made have been documented elsewhere, Lamb connects dots in a way that few others manage. She shows how Afghanistan led to Iraq and how Iraq led to ISIS. Lamb says the West\u2019s sense of failure in both Afghanistan and Iraq led President Barack Obama and Prime Minister David Cameron to stand by \u201cas more than 200,000 people were killed in Syria and Vladimir Putin started to redraw the map of Europe, annexing Crimea from Ukraine.\u201dInevitably, Lamb often turns her attention to Pakistan, where she began her connection with the region after befriending a young Benazir Bhutto, who would go on to become her country\u2019s prime minister before being assassinated in 2007. Personal affections aside, Lamb\u2019s overall impression of Pakistan mirrors the feelings of most Afghans \u2014 of suspicion and exploitation. Without the help of Pakistan\u2019s ISI, or Inter-Services Intelligence, neither the Taliban nor Al Qaeda would have thrived, nor would it have taken so long to find and kill Osama bin Laden. Lamb sounds nearly Afghan herself as she describes her reactions to 9/11. \u201c\u200a\u2018Afghanistan didn\u2019t do this,\u2019 I wrote in my diary. \u2018I don\u2019t know who or how, but I am sure this came from Pakistan.\u2019\u200a\u201dSome of Lamb\u2019s most moving observations arise in her postscript, aptly titled \u201cWar Never Leaves You.\u201d Journalists of her subspecies usually cannot help themselves \u2014 at some point they need to go back. It\u2019s now 2014, Lamb is based in Washington, and she misses Afghanistan \u201cwith a yearning that I could not explain \u2014 in a way that was deep and anguished, like the lament of an ancient mariner for a troubled sea.\u201d Despite the comforts of the West, \u201cI missed squatting uncomfortably on village floors drinking green tea and listening to fantastical stories of ancient feuds. I never remembered the bad bits.\u201dUltimately, those bits pale in comparison to what she finds upon her return to Afghanistan that January. The Taliban are resurgent, even seasoned journalists are being targeted, beloved guesthouses and hotels that were considered safe territory for foreigners are now being bombed or shuttered. Colleagues have been murdered, and opportunities to learn from past mistakes have been squandered. Karzai, once the darling of Washington, is now so publicly at odds with the United States that he slams it in his farewell speech. Britain doesn\u2019t get so much as a thank you for its 13-year effort in Afghanistan before pulling out all its troops, and few Britons view the mission as a success.But perhaps, as Lamb says, we\u2019re living in an era when wars no longer come to a clear end. Especially now, with the Taliban in the midst of a murderous new offensive launched in mid-April of this year, it\u2019s difficult to point to hallmarks of progress amid the rubble. Yes, once-secluded Afghans are now enjoying cellphones and Facebook \u2014 and have gone to vote a few times \u2014 but security is as elusive as ever.To cheer herself up, Lamb goes to the city of Herat. There, the warlord-\u00adturned-politician Ismail Khan makes time for her, but even he is gloomy. Khan believes, for example, that the international community\u2019s disarming of 100,000 mujahedeen in his area was a mistake, making the region less secure than ever. Foreigners, he says, come to Afghanistan too briefly and learn too little. \u201cThey want facts and dates, things which are not our way,\u201d he tells her. \u201cWe can converse all our lifetimes, but you will not understand.\u201d\u201cFarewell Kabul\u201d will help its readers understand Afghanistan a little better \u2014 or at least give them a glimpse of its deepest fault lines. They may even come to understand how a place can be so beautiful and so hideous at once.

{"Headline": "A Donald Trump \u2018Super PAC\u2019 Is Hit With Leadership Woes", "Date": "2016-05-06", "News": "A veteran Tea Party activist who helped kick off a \u201csuper PAC\u201d supporting Donald J. Trump resigned shortly after the candidate became the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, a fresh blow to a group whose other senior strategist was convicted on Thursday of trying to hide payments made to an Iowa politician in an effort to effectively buy his endorsement. The resignation of Amy Kremer, the former Tea Party activist, came as the group, Great America PAC, has tried to ramp up for the general election in the hopes of receiving an overt blessing from Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. The group announced that the veteran Republican consultant Ed Rollins would become its new strategist this week, and, in a conference call, used Ben Carson, the former Republican presidential candidate, as a signal to prospective donors that they should participate in the group\u2019s activities. But Ms. Kremer,  who along with the businessman William Doddridge was an early leader of the group \u2014 originally called TrumPAC \u2014 quit because numerous decisions were made without her involvement. And the future of the group\u2019s structure was not yet clear after Jesse Benton,  a former adviser to Representative Ron Paul and his son, Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, was brought on board as a senior adviser. Mr. Benton was convicted on Thursday in Iowa on federal charges of public corruption related to efforts to woo a state senator to endorse the senior Mr. Paul for president in 2012. In a statement, Ms. Kremer confirmed that she had left. \u201cAs of May 4, I\u2019m no longer at Great America PAC,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m working on an amazing new project that I will announce soon.\u201d In her resignation email to Eric Beach, who oversees the finance operation, Ms. Kremer wrote, \u201cThis isn\u2019t working out as we agreed when you asked me to join you, so I\u2019m resigning effective immediately.  I hate for it to end this way, but I cannot allow my name to continued to be used when there is too much going on without my knowledge.\u201d In a statement, Mr. Beach said, \u201cWe think the world of Amy Kremer and she remains a good friend. We are sorry to see her move on, but we know she will continue to do tremendous work supporting limited government principles.\u201d He declined to address Ms. Kremer\u2019s complaint about activities taking place without her knowledge. A person involved in the super PAC and briefed on Ms. Kremer\u2019s issues said that she was never apprised when Mr. Benton was brought on board. Decisions were made by Mr. Beach, Mr. Benton and the group\u2019s attorney, Dan Backer, without her knowledge, she said. Her name went out on email solicitations that she was never shown, the person said, including last week when Mr. Trump became the party\u2019s presumptive nominee. And Mr. Benton produced a video aimed at softening Mr. Trump\u2019s image without seeking her input, the person said. The group has drawn scrutiny for its unusual ad-buying efforts, purchasing television time through DirectTV and the Dish network, instead of by using traditional methods. Some of their ads urged viewers to call a telephone number to vote on who should be Mr. Trump\u2019s vice presidential running mate, a technique that is often used to harvest names for future small-dollar fund-raising solicitations. While their Federal Election Commission filings show spending of more than $1 million on ads, groups like C.M.A.G., which track media spending, and independent media buyers have only been able to detect a few hundred thousand dollars worth of ads that have run. Recent federal election filings indicate the group is $1 million in debt. The group was asked by the Trump campaign to change its name because it used the candidate\u2019s name, and in recent weeks it received another letter from the campaign disavowing its efforts. But it has continued to try to raise money. \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

And some people appear to be dealt a fat future at birth. My cousin in a thin family was \u201cchubby\u201d from the time she was 3 years old. She has battled to stay thin since she was 10. Doctors have chastised her for eating too much, slapping her with the conventional wisdom that her \u201cexcess calories\u201d are the problem. A person of determination and discipline, she had fought hard over the years, dieting for months, exercising by swimming, bicycling and hiking. Dozens of times she has lost the pounds only to see them come back to the point her previous weight has been surpassed. At age 34, she now weighs 285 pounds. At 5\u2019 5\u201d she is \u201cobese.\u201d To spend time with her can be heartbreaking. As we walk down the street, I watch people regard this gallant woman who has struggled so hard with contempt and disgust. Some even make comments, like \u201cYou should be ashamed\u201d or \u201cstop gorging.\u201d Thank goodness she has many people who love her, including a handsome, fit husband (whom she met at the gym). She is a brilliant, wonderful human in a fat body.So can we stop our cultural tendency to fat-shame people now?This is depressing and more than a bit overwhelming. As someone who has struggled with weight almost all of my adult life, I can\u2019t help but wonder if I am fighting a losing battle or making things worse in the long run. Stay at my current weight (overweight though not obese) or diet and risk lowering my already low metabolism even more? I exercise daily and vigorously though that seems to have little impact on my weight, but have gone on and off heavily restrictive diets for more than 10 years. And it\u2019s true, each time I stop, I gain a bit more weight, so that now I am 20 pounds more than I was 10 years ago.I was 10 years old when I first dieted. I have been dieting all my life. Each time, I regain the weight plus 20 more pounds. The last time, I decided on different goals. I wanted to feel better and move through space more easily rather than lose weight on a scale. I threw my scale away. I focused on what I needed to eat rather than what I should not.I lost the weight slowly, probably about a 2 to 3 year span of time, and after reading this I\u2019m glad I did not do it any faster.I was a chubby child, not good at games, unpopular with peers, and embedded in a dysfunctional family. Food was a reliable pleasure and comfort. You are not doing your kid any favors by giving him that bag of chips or Big Gulp, or encouraging him to graze nonstop. So you can\u2019t just go on a diet and then go off. You must change your life. For me, at least, it was worth it.The amount of exercise the show uses is unrealistic in the extreme. Slower weight loss and more moderate (brisk walking) exercise would be a more prudent approach. I lost 1 to 2 pounds a week for a total of 45 pounds (I\u2019m 5\u2019 2\u201d) and have maintained it with some up and down for over eight years. The up and down is never more than five pounds and only happens when I stop weighing myself once per week.I am an M.D. who works with patients to optimize weight loss every day and I teach at Columbia. Eighty percent of my practice is metabolic related. For example, I saw a 20-year-old student about two hours ago who is barely eating (800-1000 calories per day) and exercising for an hour per day (mostly aerobic) just to maintain her mildly overweight build in the face of pre-diabetes. Her body fights her for EVERY pound, EVERY day, ceaselessly. This article is exactly what I see in daily clinically practice \u2014 how losing weight is the relatively easy part compared to the chronic battle one has as the body relentlessly tries to return you to the \u2018set\u2019 weight it wants.As a scientist, I do not argue with the data that is collected regarding the slowed metabolism. I have to imagine it has something to do with the pace at which these contestants lose their weight. Looking at Mr. Cahill\u2019s description of his life on the show or during his four months at home, it is simply not a realistic lifestyle, except for people being sponsored by a reality TV show. My biggest concern from this study is that some people will read this and direct the reason for their weight gain completely to \u2018something is wrong with my body.\u2019 And while this study appears to say yes there is, there is nothing more hopeless than trying so hard to do something and finding out that it\u2019s not going to work because of something that is out your control. I think this can be very easily interpreted by some to give up and say their obesity it because of their malfunctioning metabolism. That can be very easy to do, but also very dangerous for the individual to give up that pursuit of a healthy lifestyle.The elephant in the room is that we are living in a society where food is abundant, and temptations abound. We are bombarded with food commercials on TV. Grocery stores are packed with delicious, high calorie items that we end up buying despite our best intentions. People keep bringing delicious doughnuts and bagels to work and leave them lying around for everyone to eat. I have found that when I go overseas - specifically, to India to see my mother - I lose weight because I just don\u2019t eat junk food, and I don\u2019t miss it either. I also end up walking a lot more over there than I do here. What this article is missing is the psychological and environmental factors that cause addiction to unhealthy foods.Still, it\u2019s not just biology. Rates of obesity are much higher in the United States than the rest of the world. That is the fact that scientists interested in preventing obesity should be researching.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "New York City Serbian Orthodox Church Is Gutted in Fire", "Date": "2016-05-01", "News": "Supported byA historic Serbian Orthodox church in Manhattan that plays an important role in New York\u2019s Serbian community was gutted by flames on Sunday, just hours after parishioners had filled its pews for Easter services.The New York Fire Department said it received the first report of the blaze at the Serbian Orthodox Cathedral of St. Sava, on West 25th Street between Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas in the Flatiron district, shortly before 7 p.m. It grew to a four-alarm fire that took 168 department personnel to tame, fire officials said.It was not clear if anyone was at the church when the fire started, officials said. The priest had left before the blaze began to go on a bicycle ride after an Easter luncheon that stretched into the late afternoon and capped several busy days of religious celebrations, officials said. A caretaker who arrived after the fire started was treated for smoke inhalation but was not hospitalized, they said.Frank Gribbon, a department spokesman who was at the scene on Sunday night, said the blaze did not appear to be suspicious. He said the department would investigate the cause, but cautioned that the amount of damage could complicate that effort.\u201cThere is so much damage you can\u2019t find the point of origin,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThe whole roof is a wooden truss. It\u2019s gone.\u201dHerman Tulp, 60, a tourist from the Netherlands who came upon the burning church before the firefighters arrived, said he saw a man who was clearly distressed admonishing camera-wielding people in the gathering crowd.\u201cThere was a man who was hysterical because it was his church,\u201d Mr. Tulp said. \u201cHe was shouting, \u2018This is my church! This is my church! Why are you filming?\u2019\u201dLess than two hours before the department received word of the blaze, St. Sava staff members had posted pictures of the Easter services on the church\u2019s official Facebook page. The photos showed priests and well-dressed parishioners smiling over baskets of colorfully dyed eggs.On Sunday night, distraught parishioners gathered near the smoldering ruins of the church, where smoke and the acrid smell of ash hung for hours in the air. Dejan Dex Lipovic, 24, wept as he recalled attending the services just hours before.\u201cIt is hard to look at,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were over a thousand people there. It is a beautiful church.\u201dThe church, which has served for decades as the backbone of New York\u2019s Serbian Orthodox community, was previously known as Trinity Chapel, an Episcopal church that was sold to its current owners in 1943. Attempts to reach church officials on Sunday night were unsuccessful.The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1968, the same year that the city\u2019s Landmarks Preservation Commission gave it landmark status. At the time, the commission wrote of the church that \u201cits special character, historic significance, and aesthetic interest and value of the development, heritage, and cultural characteristics of New York make it irreplaceable.\u201dJovana Djurdjevic, 22, another parishioner, said the church was a vital institution in the life of many Serbian-American New Yorkers.\u201cI basically grew up there,\u201d she said. \u201cI was baptized there, I\u2019ve seen every one of my friends get married there, I\u2019ve been to funerals. I was there almost every Sunday. I went to Sunday school and learned Serbian there.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article in some editions on Monday about a fire that ravaged the Serbian Orthodox Cathedral of St. Sava in Manhattan just hours after parishioners had attended Easter services referred incorrectly to the Julian calendar, which Christian Orthodox churches sometimes follow. It is one of the reasons \u2014 not the only one \u2014 why Orthodox churches often celebrate Easter later than Western churches.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Iraqi Protesters Clash With Troops in Baghdad\u2019s Green Zone", "Date": "2016-05-20", "News": "Supported byBAGHDAD \u2014 In a violent escalation of Iraq\u2019s political crisis on Friday, protesters breached Baghdad\u2019s Green Zone, the secure hub of government, storming the prime minister\u2019s office as security forces fired tear gas at demonstrators and live ammunition in the air.The protesters withdrew within a couple of hours, but dozens of people were injured, according to officials. And Baghdad Operations Command, which is in charge of security in the capital, imposed a curfew for several hours, and closed all entrances to the city.It was the second time in three weeks that protesters managed to breach the blast walls and razor wire of the Green Zone, a fortified area of government buildings and embassies that was named by the American military and that for the Iraqi public has long been a symbol of corruption, occupation and dysfunction.The crisis on Friday was a further demonstration of the rising anger among Iraqis toward a leadership class that is widely reviled, and presented a new challenge to the government of Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi at a time when Baghdad has faced a surge in attacks from the Islamic State, which have killed an estimated 200 people in less than 10 days.For the Obama administration, the political upheaval in Baghdad and the string of deadly attacks by the Islamic State in the capital come as it continues to boast of progress in the war against the terrorist group elsewhere in the country. With a combination of airstrikes by the American-led coalition and Iraqi ground forces, the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, was pushed from the western city of Rutba this week, which the authorities say will allow the main highway between Baghdad and the Jordanian capital, Amman, to be reopened.But as the attacks in Baghdad and the protests have demonstrated, gains against ISIS on the battlefield have done little to improve the country\u2019s stability.The scenes of chaos Friday evening in central Baghdad, even though they were short in duration, potentially represented a volatile new phase of a protest movement that began last summer and had, until Friday, been relatively peaceful. Security forces had often stood aside, even offering supportive messages to demonstrators, saying that they, too, wanted to see an end to corruption. Protesters sometimes gave policemen and soldiers flowers.When protesters entered the Green Zone three weeks ago, security forces largely stood by, allowing them passage, lending the episode a sense that it was choreographed and perhaps tacitly approved by the government. This theory was widely accepted, given that the protesters have not sought to bring down Mr. Abadi, but rather to support him in a push to root out corruption, streamline government and end sectarian quotas for appointments that has faced resistance from other political blocs.But this time, security forces put up resistance when a breakaway group of several hundred protesters pushed into the Green Zone. Videos on social media showed protesters ducking and running into the Green Zone to the sound of automatic gunfire.In one video that circulated on Facebook, the man holding the camera said, \u201cThere will be no surrender from this great popular revolution.\u201dOthers were chanting, \u201cWe sacrifice our blood and souls for Iraq!\u201d and, \u201cNo, no to corruption!\u201dMr. Sadr has cast himself as an ally of Mr. Abadi, also a Shiite, and a supporter of the prime minister\u2019s attempts to reform government. But in the weeks since protesters ransacked Parliament, the government has been largely paralyzed, unable to meet and vote on a slate of new ministers that Mr. Abadi has put forward.Now that his followers have stormed the Green Zone again, and entered Mr. Abadi\u2019s office building, it is hard to see Mr. Sadr as ally to the prime minister.In a statement released Friday evening, Mr. Sadr, in typical fiery speech, said he would intensify the pressure on the government.He equated the crackdown by security forces on the protesters on Friday to the terrorist attacks by the Islamic State, and said the current Iraqi government is no different from those of Saddam Hussein and Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya.Addressing his followers, he said: \u201cYou heroic people, be patient. Your peaceful revolution is inevitable and will be victorious and will put an end to sectarianism, quotas, corruption and terrorism.\u201dTim Arango contributed reporting from Istanbul.Advertisement"}

The cafeteria next door boasts industrial refrigerators stocked with cases of beer, cabinets with bagels and cereal, and, on one wall, a set of glass dispensers that hold an assortment of nuts and candy. It\u2019s called the \u201ccandy wall,\u201d and Zack explains that HubSpotters are especially proud of it. The wall is one of the first things they show off to visitors. It\u2019s a young place, with lots of energy. Teams go on outings to play trampoline dodgeball and race go-karts and play laser tag.And all this is to say nothing of the dogs skittering around the office or the \u201cnap room\u201d with a hammock and a tropical mural on the wall. From the beginning, \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d has gone to town on the infantilized campuses where the tech world\u2019s youngest and brightest can take cereal breaks and change the world on beanbag chairs. By now, viewers understand that this is where the enemy lives. Erlich\u2019s incubator may be a patchouli-caked stinkhole, but at least it\u2019s not Hooli, where the hip, open-office layout is merely a candy-colored facade for 21st century corporate venality.\u201cTwo in the Box,\u201d Sunday night\u2019s episode, brings Richard and his team into the belly of the beast \u2014 and it turns out, they kind of like it. With Action Jack handling the budgeting and V.C. funding, Richard can focus on pursuing his coding dreams without concern about dollars and cents. His doctor, played uproariously by Andy Daly, declares him healthy and even notes a glow about him: \u201cIf it were medically possible, I might even think you were pregnant.\u201d As engineers, Dinesh and Gilfoyle are disgruntled by nature, but now they have the hookup on \u201cMinority Report\u201d monitors and a micro-kitchen chef who makes watermelon Jell-O and gluten-free waffles. Only poor Erlich, who has no significant day-to-day role in the company anymore, seems left out, but even he absconds with a few boxes of expensive, unpasteurized coconut water.But, there\u2019s a big catch: Richard no longer has control of his company. His ambition to create a compression platform that will enrich the lives of people everywhere runs against Jack\u2019s mission to sell Pied Piper to businesses and make the stock price go up, up, up. Jack is not an egotist like Gavin Belson, who\u2019s busy trying to scrub the Hooli algorithm to accommodate his morning vanity searches. He\u2019s a successful businessman who will take his \u201cConjoined Triangles of Success\u201d and turn Pied Piper into a smooth-running operation that will offer a massive return on investment. Stephen Tobolowsky plays him with a serene self-confidence that\u2019s unnerving, but essentially innocent: Jack will see through his business initiative with the same lack of affect with which he watches his mare get $150,000 worth of thoroughbred seed.In short order, the existential threat of failure in Seasons 1 and 2 of \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d has morphed into the nightmare of success. Richard wants to bequeath the world a free, efficient, self-learning compression platform and collect his billions with premium services on the back end. Jack wants him to create a product his top-flight team \u2014 like \u201cJan the man\u201d and the guy who shadows another guy \u2014 can sell before the tech bubble bursts again. And since Jack is C.E.O., he wins the argument, despite his empty assurances that Richard\u2019s product will never be compromised. At the end of \u201cTwo in the Box,\u201d Richard witnesses his vision for the next Google or Facebook shrink into a compact metal box to house business data files. No doubt that next bowl of Froot Loops is going to taste like ash in his mouth.Bytes\u2022 Exchange between Dinesh and Gilfoyle over the game of rock-paper-scissors that costs Gilfoyle the bigger of the two monitors.

He\u2019s too ineffectual to kick the Airbnb deadbeat out of his condo, but in typical Jared fashion, he puts a weirdly positive spin on homelessness: \u201cI imagine that my skeleton is me and my body is my house. That way, I\u2019m always home.\u201d\u2022 The tenant-friendly California laws that keep Jared out of his own place are tied neatly to Erlich\u2019s frustrated efforts to boot Jian-Yang, his uncomprehending Chinese \u201cincubee,\u201d out of the house. Erlich\u2019s attempt to bridge the cultural divide by offering a Japanese kimono as a parting gift gets precisely the response it deserves.\u2022 Last week, I talked about conflict as the comic spark to \u201cSilicon Valley,\u201d and with the soon-to-be-ex-Nucleus team cracking Richard\u2019s middle-out code, the gang will have that to worry about, too.

{"Headline": "In the Hamptons, a Small-Town Paper Is a Beacon in the Mayhem", "Date": "2016-05-29", "News": "Supported byMediatorEAST HAMPTON, N.Y. \u2014 When the leaves return to the trees outside David Rattray\u2019s office window at The East Hampton Star, it means only one thing: \u201cThe beginning of the mayhem.\u201dAnd on Thursday morning, with the leaves an adolescent green, Mr. Rattray, The Star\u2019s editor, gathered his staff in the paper\u2019s central newsroom to hash out their coverage plans for this summer\u2019s version of it, which would start in earnest over Memorial Day weekend.The Star newsroom is a tight space, with walls that have cracks from the day a couple of years ago when engineers showed up close to the paper\u2019s deadline to tilt the cedar-clad house back onto a proper vertical, a vital fix for a building Mr. Rattray\u2019s family built in 1900.(The weekly paper still came out on time; the newsroom staff just worked through the righting.)As Mr. Rattray ran through the story lineup for the next issue, the paper\u2019s editor at large, Irene Silverman, who has worked there since 1968, tracked a daddy longlegs\u2019 meandering path across her desk.First, there was the \u201cMemorial Day Mayhem post-mortem,\u201d when the town government\u2019s crackdown on wild partying in the township would be put to the test for the first time.Then there was a Hamptons-style battle royal playing out before zoning officials: Action on a new tennis court at the old Gardiner Estate was threatening to kill the om at the neighbor\u2019s meditation house. But what really caught Mr. Rattray\u2019s ear was word of $18 French fries at Duryea\u2019s, a beloved old lobster shack in Montauk that had just received a St. Barts-style makeover from its new owner, the billionaire investor Marc Rowan. \u201cI think there\u2019s an editorial about $18 fries \u2014 about why, and for whom,\u201d Mr. Rattray said.Some member of the Rattray clan has been running this meeting for 81 years \u2014 since the family bought the paper from the Boughtons, who bought it from its founder, George Burling, in 1890 for $100. The paper is still extra wide, like the original, and it has resisted the money-saving appeal of shrinking down.But while in 1890 The Star served as a place to announce a local lad\u2019s marriage \u201cto the best girl in the country,\u201d it now covers fights over housing for immigrants; the school curriculum; and the tensions among the superwealthy, the somewhat wealthy and the not-at-all-wealthy who work for them. And somewhere along the way it picked up a logo under its masthead: \u201cShines for All.\u201d An alternative might be, \u201cIt Endures.\u201dThrough the advent of the movie house, the radio, the television, glossy new magazines and now the Internet, The Star has continued to stand. And that\u2019s a 131-year testament to the central role that family-owned, small-town newspapers can still play \u2014 even though, like its big-city brethren, it faces its worst, and possibly last, threat from the web.The Star, a paid weekly, is luckier than most in its class. Many big real estate brokers still view its great big print spreads as a good way to market their huge Hamptons properties. And Craigslist does not have enough of a presence here to kill off The Star\u2019s classified listings.Advertising has given The Star enough resources to start a new four-times-yearly glossy magazine, East, and enough juice to maintain the paper\u2019s mission, which is to \u201cask hard questions, not be afraid to make public officials angry,\u201d Mr. Rattray said.But new competitors like Curbed.com, owned by Vox Media, and Patch, not to mention Facebook, have exerted pressure. Circulation is down to a maximum of 12,000 from 16,000, though many tens of thousands more read it online.\u201cOur gross is about half of what it was at its peak\u201d in 2006, Mr. Rattray told me as we sat in the garden behind the Star headquarters on Thursday, with the first of the holiday traffic trickling by on Main Street.With a shrinking advertising base, Mr. Rattray, a fit 53, has had to pare his staff and take on some of the more menial duties himself: helping with obituaries, letters to the editor (which are published in full, in keeping with a longstanding Star policy), and even the community and government calendars.He still has to find time to write the editorials, the latest of which favored the town\u2019s moves against the \u201cexcesses of the summer bar and party scene\u201d \u2014 the primary generator of mayhem. The scene has been stoked by what longtime residents see as an invasion of club promoters and developers with sensibilities that can seem more Manhattan than Montauk, a hamlet with a proud blue-collar fishing tradition.There were already signs of a public backlash after the town\u2019s strict enforcement of state and local codes pushed one popular \u2014 and, in some quarters, infamous \u2014 club, Cyril\u2019s Fish House, to shut down, and another, The Surf Lodge, to at least temporarily halt its concert lineup of big acts. But Mr. Rattray went ahead with his editorial anyway.\u201cWithout a tough-minded but fair family-owned newspaper, the forces kind of arrayed against this place, the South Fork, would win,\u201d Mr. Rattray said. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s arrogant to think, but it\u2019s how I was raised.\u201dIt\u2019s also how Mr. Rattray is raising his three children \u2014 the oldest is 15 \u2014 who he hopes will succeed him.But most young people interested in media careers seem drawn not to newspapers but to where the growth and opportunity are: modern start-ups with their use of Instagram and Facebook and their new ways of working more closely with advertisers and making them part of the editorial content.I got to see that firsthand when I visited the young crew running Whalebone Media, who in about a year have built their own honest-to-goodness media company. With the stylishly beachy sensibility of its surfer millennial founders, Whalebone publishes a free glossy lifestyle magazine with a circulation of 20,000, and it tells prospective advertisers that it drew more than two million views through social media in its first several months of operation.Whalebone\u2019s offices are sleek and new, with big windows facing Montauk Harbor.Its publisher, Eddie Berrang, and managing director, Bronson Lamb, began the company in conjunction with their friend Jesse James Joeckel\u2019s Montauk-based clothing brand, Whalebone. Mr. Joeckel founded the Whalebone Creative label in 2010 after designing T-shirts and logos for local surf shops. They went door to door to get enough sponsorship to publish the first issue of Whalebone magazine. Their first major advertiser: Soul Cycle, which had taken over the old single-screen Montauk movie theater where the ticket taker also worked the popcorn machine.When I referred to Whalebone as a publication, Mr. Berrang, 34, corrected me. \u201cThe word \u2018publication,\u2019 it\u2019s an antiquated term,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a dying medium.\u201dWhalebone has a robust web presence that will soon include a new retail site. The whole experience relies on what the company calls \u201csubmersive media\u201d: The Whalebone crew designs sponsors\u2019 ads to run seamlessly, and openly, in the editorial content, such that a gorgeous spread of old Montauk fishing photos in the latest issue of the magazine is prominently \u201cpresented by Chris Coleman with Saunders\u201d real estate. Their young readers are unfazed by that sort of integration, they say.That\u2019s good, because as traditional print advertising dwindles, media organizations everywhere have to come up with new ways to pay for their coverage.Yet newspapers like The Star can change only so much. Hard news missions preclude slow dancing with advertisers. With the more traditional model, Mr. Rattray says, \u201cI can only see out about 18 months.\u201dRegardless of what happens after that, this much is true now: The Star still shines for all; after 131 years, it endures. Its new media cousins should be so fortunate.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Warren Buffett Stake Suggests Apple Is All Grown Up", "Date": "2016-05-19", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseWith this week\u2019s imprimatur from the legendary investor Warren Buffett, it should now be official: Apple, the world\u2019s largest company by market capitalization and a symbol of American technological innovation, is a \u201cvalue\u201d stock.That may prove to be a decidedly mixed blessing.Mr. Buffett is the world\u2019s most prominent and successful proponent of value investing \u2014 an approach that seeks stocks that are undervalued and sell for less than their \u201cintrinsic value,\u201d as Benjamin Graham put it his 1949 classic \u201cThe Intelligent Investor.\u201d Mr. Buffett credits Mr. Graham with shaping his own approach to investing.\u201cWe\u2019ve just looked at it again,\u201d said Bill Smead, who manages the Smead Value Fund, one of the most successful large-cap value mutual funds over the last five years, according to Morningstar. \u201cAnybody that discounts the thinking at Berkshire Hathaway does so at their peril, in my opinion.\u201dValue stocks are typically unpopular among many investors, their shares often battered by disappointing short-term revenue and earnings results. They usually trade at very low price-to-earnings ratios, a common valuation measure. Nonetheless, some academic studies have suggested that over time, they outperform other stocks, in part because expectations are so low.Apple \u201cis going to attract more value investors,\u201d said Toni Sacconaghi, a senior analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein who covers Apple. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for beaten-down stocks with negative sentiment. Apple has traded below a market multiple for years and sentiment has become increasingly pessimistic, especially over the past month.\u201dMr. Sacconaghi has a buy recommendation on the stock, \u201cnot because we believe this will be a high-growth company going forward, but because the current price is discounting a decline in cash flow forever, and we think that\u2019s overly pessimistic.\u201dAccording to the market research firm Thomson Reuters Lipper, just 69 of 357 actively managed value funds in the United States \u2014 fewer than 20 percent \u2014 currently hold positions in Apple.That\u2019s because Apple has long been considered a quintessential growth stock: one of the glamorous high-flying cousins to dowdy value stocks. Growth investors think growth stocks are undervalued, too, because they expect their earnings to grow faster (often much faster) than other investors recognize.As a result, valuation measures for growth stocks can go sky-high. In two prominent growth-stock examples, shares of Facebook trade at a price-earnings ratio of about 73, and Netflix at about 312. (The price-earnings average for stocks in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is currently about 24.)This week Apple\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio was just over 10.If Apple is now a value stock, though, plenty of growth investors haven\u2019t gotten the message. Among actively managed growth funds, 249 of 619, or 40 percent, hold Apple shares, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper. That\u2019s more than the 230 growth funds that owned Apple stock in 2014.Should growth funds suddenly decide that Apple no longer meets their criteria, there could be a mass exodus that would be only partly offset by new purchases from value investors.Some prominent value investors aren\u2019t convinced Apple really is a value stock, despite Mr. Buffett\u2019s blessing, or that its stock price is significantly below its intrinsic value. (Intrinsic value considers all aspects of a business, including both tangible and intangible factors.)That means Apple could fall into the neutral zone of stocks that are neither growth \u2014 because they aren\u2019t growing fast enough \u2014 or value, because they\u2019re still not cheap enough.\u201cApple is extraordinarily cheap, but it\u2019s never been a value stock in the traditional sense,\u201d said Bruce Greenwald, who runs the value investing program at Columbia Business School and is a co-author of \u201cValue Investing: From Graham to Buffett and Beyond\u201d (Wiley, 2001).\u201cValue investing has always focused primarily on asset value,\u201d Professor Greenwald told me. Apple\u2019s book value, or asset value, of $130 billion isn\u2019t even close to its market capitalization of about $515 billion.That means, in theory, that other companies could replicate Apple\u2019s assets at relatively low cost, produce rival products and undermine Apple\u2019s enviably high profit margins.Tech companies typically have low asset values relative to their share prices \u2014 one reason Mr. Buffett and other value investors long shunned the sector \u2014 but their patented technologies and intellectual property nonetheless often create formidable barriers to entry by competitors.For an extraordinarily high-profit-margin technology company like Apple, the question is whether there are such \u201cmoats,\u201d as value investors like to put it, that will continue to protect it from these competitive threats.\u201cThat\u2019s always been the issue with Apple,\u201d Professor Greenwald said. \u201cHow sustainable are these profit levels and how big are the barriers? The fear with Apple is that it will get overwhelmed by new entry and new competitors. The moat doesn\u2019t seem that big. It\u2019s not just giant rivals like Samsung, but smaller companies that can survive with even a small share of the smartphone market.\u201dMr. Smead told me this week he had not added Apple to his value fund\u2019s holdings, even though the stock is so cheap that it meets many of his fund\u2019s investing criteria.\u201cOver the past five or six years, when Apple was doing so well, we joked that we were the best-performing large-cap fund that didn\u2019t own Apple,\u201d Mr. Smead said. \u201cNot that we didn\u2019t wrestle with it many times.\u201d\u201cOur difficulty has been that we don\u2019t understand what kind of moat protects their technology over the next 10 years,\u201d Mr. Smead continued. \u201cThat\u2019s the main problem. The other is that, given Apple\u2019s huge success and its sheer magnitude, it needs a monstrous new product or enhancement of an existing product to move the needle on growth.\u201dFor their part, many growth investors were startled on April 26 when Apple reported its first quarterly revenue drop since 2003. Both revenue and earnings fell short of analyst estimates, and Apple shares plunged 8 percent in one day. They rallied some this week on news of the Berkshire Hathaway investment, but are still down sharply from where they were as recently as mid-April.But Apple still has defenders among growth investors.At the end of the year, Apple was the second-largest holding in the Upright Growth Fund, the top-performing large-cap growth fund so far this year, according to Morningstar.\u201cApple\u2019s best and fastest growing days may be behind us,\u201d David Chiueh, Upright Growth\u2019s president and fund manager, told me. \u201cBut even growth-oriented funds like ours don\u2019t just contain high-growth stocks with 35-50 percent growth rates in our portfolio.\u201dHe said such rapid growth was not sustainable, and added that he was happy with companies that showed \u201csolid 8 percent to 12 percent earnings growth,\u201d a category in which he included Apple. \u201dGive them some time and they will show outstanding performance,\u201d he said.Mr. Chiueh said he was also encouraged that Apple had stepped up its spending on research and development, suggesting that new products with strong growth prospects might still be in the offing.At some fund families, Apple seems to be both a value and a growth stock, even though that seems contradictory. At the fund giant Vanguard, Apple is a major holding in the Vanguard Windsor and Windsor II funds (both value funds) and the Vanguard Morgan Growth Fund and US Growth Fund. A Vanguard spokeswoman declined to comment.All of which suggests that when it comes to Apple, \u201cvalue\u201d and \u201cgrowth\u201d may be in the eye of the beholder.Still, Mr. Buffett\u2019s announcement this week underscores that Apple\u2019s once sizzling growth has slowed, and suggests it may well be on the inexorable path from growth to value stock.That\u2019s not an especially good portent for investors. Among technology companies that have already made the same transition, Professor Greenwald cited IBM, Intel, Cisco, Microsoft and Dell, companies whose share prices, after great rocket rides, have mostly languished in recent years. (Dell was taken private in 2013.)For those who failed to buy the stock early enough, \u201cas investments, they all turned out pretty badly,\u201d he noted.Berkshire Hathaway also disclosed this week that it had increased the stake in IBM it first acquired in 2011. IBM shares have declined over the period, but by Mr. Buffett\u2019s long-term standards, the investment is still too new to judge.\u201cIf you believe the iPhone will be the global standard in 25 years, you\u2019d buy\u201d Apple stock, Professor Greenwald said. But many value investors have already seen where smartphones can go, \u201cwhich is where PCs have already gone.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Infighting Threatens to Fell a Venture Capital Firm", "Date": "2016-05-04", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Xfund, a venture capital firm formed in 2011 as technology start-ups boomed, began coming undone last year when the relationship between its two partners soured.The two venture capitalists, Patrick Chung and Hugo Van Vuuren, argued over the dismissal of an employee and who controlled the firm. The disagreements festered, setting off a chain of events including accusations of abuse, a restraining order application, revelations that a hidden camera was used to record an investor meeting, and an investigation by the fund\u2019s investors.Now the firm, which manages more than $100 million and has put money into start-ups like the genetics company 23andMe, is in salvage mode. Even so, Xfund is in no danger of immediately shutting down.Xfund plans to \u201cwork through this transition and move forward,\u201d a spokesman said.The contretemps offer a glimpse into the opaque world of venture capital, where partnerships are easy to form but are very hard to untangle. New venture firms often pop up, especially in boom times, when an investor decides to set up shop alone, or with one partner. But their funds, which are created as 10-year vehicles, rarely have to account for their actions and typically lack a strong corporate governance structure.Many of the ugly episodes among venture partnerships are hushed up, but Xfund\u2019s situation has become public because of a restraining order application filed in Santa Clara County Superior Court by Mr. Chung against Mr. Van Vuuren.\u201cThere are no easy divorces in venture capital,\u201d said Venky Ganesan, a partner at Menlo Ventures, a venture firm that is not connected to the Xfund. \u201cThe average venture capital fund is active for more than 15 years, so you can be stuck with your investment partners for longer than most average Americans will be with their spouses.\u201dMr. Chung, who will remain with Xfund, and Mr. Van Vuuren, who is being pushed out, declined through spokesmen to comment. Mr. Van Vuuren is considering legal routes to fight his removal, according to two people who have worked with the partners and who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The three people who represent Xfund\u2019s investors \u2014 Mr. Breyer, Jenny Chen of Jasper Ridge Partners and David York of Top Tier Capital \u2014 also declined to comment.Yet tensions surfaced between Mr. Chung and Mr. Van Vuuren over who had more control of the firm. Last May, the two started seeing a corporate coach and a psychologist.Mr. Chung had the upper hand because it turned out he had a tiebreaker vote for Xfund\u2019s decisions, according to court documents. Mr. Van Vuuren claims in a statement filed with the court that he thought Mr. Chung had a tiebreaker vote only on investment decisions, not operational ones with the firm.Ms. Ostro did not respond to a request for comment. In an email sent to both men and included in court documents, she said Mr. Chung fired her in retaliation for her claiming that he had been \u201cbullying, and mentally and emotionally abusing me and the entire team.\u201d She wrote that she sought \u201cmedical treatment as a result of the workplace harassment.\u201dMs. Ostro negotiated a severance package with Xfund and signed a nondisparagement agreement, according to two people who were briefed on Ms. Ostro\u2019s arrangement and who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the contract is private.In March, Mr. Chung filed a restraining order application against Mr. Van Vuuren, saying that his partner was acting erratically and had verbally threatened him and his family. Mr. Chung also said that Mr. Van Vuuren had physically threatened him in mid-January by trapping him in an alley in Palo Alto, Calif., and making violent motions.In court filings in response to the restraining order application, Mr. Van Vuuren said Mr. Chung\u2019s accusations were smear tactics. Texts and emails show that Mr. Van Vuuren wanted a more equal 50-50 partnership at Xfund. Mr. Van Vuuren\u2019s court submissions also included video of a meeting that Mr. Chung held with one investor who was worried about the fund, taken from a hidden camera.The restraining order application was later withdrawn.By mid-January, Xfund\u2019s investors had learned of the deteriorating relationship between the men and decided to terminate the main fund\u2019s ability to make new investments. But the investors had limited options to make wholesale changes because the structures of venture funds give the venture capitalists outsize power.Mr. Breyer and others who represented the interests of the investors interviewed the fund\u2019s lawyers, portfolio companies and employees to figure out next steps. A mediation attempt in March failed. Xfund\u2019s lawyers later sent a letter to Mr. Van Vuuren saying he was fired. Mr. Van Vuuren\u2019s lawyers shot back in a letter that the fund structure did not allow Xfund to fire his client.In March, Xfund\u2019s accounts were frozen after conflicting orders to the fund\u2019s bank by Mr. Chung and Mr. Van Vuuren.Xfund\u2019s investors had devised a plan to salvage the fund. They proposed cutting the main fund\u2019s size by at least half, with no new investments allowed, according to a letter to investors. The remaining money would be used to support start-ups that Xfund had already invested in, and Mr. Chung alone would oversee the portfolio until all the start-ups had been sold or gone public, which could take nearly a decade. A third party may be appointed to monitor Mr. Chung\u2019s decisions, according to an investor in the fund who spoke on condition of anonymity.Xfund, under Mr. Chung, is taking other steps to prolong the firm\u2019s life. In a letter to investors last week, Xfund requested $5 million for, among other things, expenses including legal fees for the fund and its investors, as well as expenses for Mr. Chung.Advertisement"}

Each week, get the latest news on parenting, child health and relationships plus advice from our experts to help every family live well.It should have been a simple enough request. My 10-year-old, after several years of piano and voice lessons, had asked for a guitar. But what to buy? I posed the question to my Facebook friends. Full-size or smaller? Acoustic or electric? But then I heard from my friend Craig Bromberg, the father of 11-year-old guitar-playing twins and a serious musician himself. He let me have it for even considering buying a brand-new guitar. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI for one can\u2019t stand the idea of kids with fancy instruments before they have even taken a single lesson,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote. But musical instruments (of all sorts \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not just guitars) are tools for learning, and that makes them different from cars or phones. Many forms of athletic gear for older children \u00e2\u0080\u0093 tennis rackets, lacrosse sticks, gloves for baseball or softball \u00e2\u0080\u0093 are similar. Even so, I realized that in considering my child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s request for a guitar, I got caught up in all the usual aspirations we have for our children, as well as my own memories and regrets about my musical training. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI say that the first thing we want to do is get the kids an electric guitar,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, because electric guitars are often easier for beginners to play. His company doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make very many of them and none at the entry level.And he offered advice for helping a child stick with the instrument. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe first thing you want to teach them is their very favorite song,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he advised.But how much should you actually spend? Mr. Powers outlined the two approaches he hears about most often. The delayed gratification theory has children doing the hard things first. You study, practice and bear with it, and then you get the nice guitar. The other is instant gratification \u00e2\u0080\u0093 buy the nice guitar to start to make learning the guitar enjoyable as soon as possible. Mr. Powers advised against the delayed gratification approach because it could sabotage the child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s learning. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe least enjoyable part is the moment you first pick it up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re physically struggling with an instrument that you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know much about.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And for a child like mine who wants to play acoustic, he couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but wax eloquent on the virtues of the Baby Taylor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s function over form: its intonation, seasoning and repairability. I know a bit about music and caught his drift, but I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sure his arguments would pass muster with every parent. I took his comments back to my friend Craig. He reminded me that most famous musicians did not learn to play on top-of-the-line equipment. And while the Baby Taylor is portable (which is why many adults love owning it too), he wondered whether we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be inclined to tote it around given its price and the possibility of damaging it. My wife asked another question that I hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t thought of: Why not buy our daughter the cheap guitar (or at least a decent but lower-priced used one), and spend more on a really great teacher or a larger number of initial lessons? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an excellent question, if only we knew which style of teaching would be best for her. Picking out an instrument seems easier somehow. One of Craig\u2019s most recent musical purchases for one of his sons was a used instrument. Indeed, buying someone else\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Baby Taylor would set us back $200 to $250. Older ones seem to hold their value reasonably well, which means we could hock ours if my daughter doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take to playing or graduates to a bigger guitar within a few years. Craig said he did not find this approach overly indulgent. I do want my daughter to play on a guitar that gives her the best chance of crossing that chasm. But my hunch is this: It wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have taken $329 to get me to \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo guitar,\u00e2\u0080\u009d had anyone thought to suggest it when I quit classical piano lessons after 10 years. And perhaps that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one more reason I find the used Taylor \u2014 which we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re now in the process of hunting down, at $100 or so off the new price \u2014 so enticing. If my daughter doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stick with guitar, I just may keep her instrument for myself.

{"Headline": "Europe Seeks Greater Control Over Digital Services", "Date": "2016-05-25", "News": "Supported byIf European regulators get their way, Netflix may soon have to do more than just offer \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u201d with French subtitles.But Netflix and others do not want Europe to set specific quotas for the amount of content, arguing that doing so would harm consumer choice as many Europeans want to watch American, not local, programming.\u201cWe appreciate the commission\u2019s objective to have European production flourish, however, the proposed measures won\u2019t actually achieve that,\u201d Joris Evers, a Netflix spokesman in Amsterdam, said in a statement.Netflix and other American technology companies have found themselves at the center of the changing regulatory environment in Europe.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Europe\u2019s latest rule changes are more challenging for Netflix.European officials on Wednesday said they would give individual countries the power, if they so chose, to force video streaming services to help pay for the production of local content, like movies and television programs.\u201cThe way we watch TV or videos may have changed, but our values don\u2019t,\u201d G\u00fcnther H. Oettinger, the European commissioner in charge of the digital economy, said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cWith these new rules, we will uphold media pluralism.\u201dSuch rules already exist for traditional broadcasters, like the BBC in Britain and the TF1 Group in France. On average, they pay the equivalent of millions of dollars each year, or roughly 20 percent of their annual revenue in the countries where they operate, to support local content.European policy makers said that online streaming rivals currently invested only around 1 percent of their annual revenue in local content. Netflix has been able to sidestep existing funding rules, most notably in France, because the company\u2019s European headquarters are in the Netherlands.Streaming services will also be required to ensure that at least 20 percent of their online content is from Europe, and that those movies and television programs are given prominence in their digital catalogs. A report funded by the European Commission recently found that both Netflix and Apple already met this requirement.The commission\u2019s digital plans are subject to the approval of the European Parliament and individual member states, a lengthy process that could lead to significant changes.Europe\u2019s proposals on digital services are only the beginning.The European Commission said on Wednesday that it would also propose new copyright rules in the fall that could force companies like Google to pay online publishers when using their content, including in its news aggregation service Google News.Officials also said that they were still reviewing potential new rules to control how so-called online platforms like Facebook and Amazon operate in the 28-member bloc.European officials said they were looking into making it easier for people to move their digital information between online platforms by the end of the year, giving them greater control over data that companies collected on their daily digital lives.\u201cI want online platforms and the audiovisual and creative sectors to be powerhouses in the digital economy,\u201d said Andrus Ansip, the European Commission vice president in charge of the region\u2019s digital single market proposals. \u201cThey need the certainty of a modern and fair legal environment: That is what we are providing today.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Free Speech: Ten Principles for a Connected World,\u2019 by Timothy Garton Ash", "Date": "2016-05-22", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Among our most treasured public values, free speech is indispensable and perplexing. It involves us at once in high principle and shaming triviality, as two otherwise unconnected headline cases nicely attest. In Germany, a comedian who mocked the Turkish president on air may soon stand trial under an antique law against offending foreign dignitaries. In Florida, a jury in March rejected Gawker Media\u2019s free-speech defense and ordered it to pay $140 million in damages for posting a tawdry video on its gossip site showing a retired wrestler in bed with another celebrity\u2019s wife.Free speech\u2019s many-sided appeal is not hard to identify. It prods society to criticize itself and learn from mistakes. It fosters the independence of mind we need to be responsible grown-ups. Take away free speech, and liberal democracy \u00adceases to be truly liberal or democratic. Free speech hunts out truth and spreads knowledge. When stifled, it responds with soaring words of defiance. Think of Milton or Voltaire, Nelson Mandela or Vaclav Havel, Salman Rushdie or Kamel Daoud.Defending free speech, alas, takes more than standing up for science, sound argument and brave eloquence. It takes standing up as well for the right to say things that are false, hateful, mindless, base, vulgar, stupid or reckless. It is easy to defend what we admire and believe in. To defend free speech, you have to allow for bad speech. Free speech gave us Martin Luther King\u2019s \u201cI have a dream.\u201d It also gave us Donald Trump.It would be nice to have one without the other. But that is not what free speech promises. Free speech is complicated and comes at a high price. We pay for it in terms of other things we also need to care about: public order and security, children\u2019s needs, private reputations, civic courtesy, cultural worth, the social \u00addignity of vulnerable minorities. As Timothy Garton Ash makes admirably clear in his wise, up-to-the-minute and wide-ranging new survey, \u201cFree Speech: Ten Principles for a Connected World,\u201d most of the difficult arguments about free speech bear on its price in terms of other things that also ought to matter to us.The controversies are fierce and familiar. Ought leakers be punished, and how can whistle-blowers be protected? Should pornography be restricted? Do libel laws gag the press? May religion be shielded from mockery? Ought hate speech be criminalized? Garton Ash pursues each in depth. He follows the common practice of taking \u201cfree speech\u201d to mean a cluster of freedoms to express yourself and your thoughts as you please: not just voicing words but printing what you want, \u00adproclaiming your faith as you wish, campaigning for your chosen causes and making art without interference.Speech in that broad sense was once suspect unless expressly permitted; monitored speech was the norm. But in liberal modernity, unmonitored speech is the norm and limits to speech are suspect unless specifically justified. The main arguments now separate laxists from restrictionists. Laxists favor few limits, restrictionists many. The kinds of limits matter. Coercive laws, whether prior censorship or after-the-fact sanctions, provide one kind of limit. Garton Ash is generally against them. High standards of public argument and common decency are another kind of limit. Garton Ash is broadly for them. You could say he is laxist about law and restrictionist about standards. His approach has the great merit of keeping distinct what is legally permissible and what is or ought to be socially acceptable. Garton Ash treasures the jewel but recognizes and regrets the mud. His guiding maxim, never wholly lost amid near encyclopedic detail, is \u201cMore free speech but also better speech.\u201dAs a scholar-journalist, Garton Ash knows what he is talking about from a career of reading, writing, listening and, more lately, web-clicking. When reporting on the breakup of the Communist world in the 1980s, he befriended East European dissidents, saw how truthful speech could sap the will of wrongful power and collected a private lexicon of sardonic political jokes that here lighten the going. Now a fellow at St. Antony\u2019s College, Oxford, he supervises a 13-language online debating platform \u2014 freespeechdebate.com \u2014 for promoting free speech and arguing with all sides about its proper limits. His travels and interviews for \u201cFree Speech\u201d spanned the world, or what he calls the \u201ccosmopolis,\u201d a global space that is virtual as well as geographic. That range alone will squelch the fantasy that free speech is a purely Western concern.Garton Ash invokes recent work by lawyers and philosophers but sees that fine distinctions and tight reasoning get you only so far in public argument. Talk of freedom is empty, he recognizes, when it neglects unequal power. In illustration, he offers a nice cartoon metaphor. Speech, he writes, is fought over by dogs (big state powers like the United States, the European Union and China), cats (big Internet and media concerns) and mice (that is, us). Government and corporations, he thinks, should interfere with speech very little. We should accordingly not look to them to improve speech. Making speech better is up to us, the mice.Law to Garton Ash is a poor tool for \u00adcivic education. He questions hate-speech laws and Holocaust-denial laws, fearing a \u00ad\u201ctaboo ratchet.\u201d Corporations in their turn are after profit, not civic uplift. He distrusts the idea that Google, Amazon and Facebook, for example, serve \u00adequally the values of free speech and good speech. His preferred answer to the more flagrant vices of liberty \u2014 hate speech, manipulative journalism, coarsened debate and a vast sewer of abuse on social media \u2014 is to encourage \u201cshared norms and practices that enable us to make best use of this essential freedom.\u201dIn lesser hands, that recommendation might sound overabstract or simply pious. Garton Ash, \u00adhowever, applies and tests it in 10 chapters offering \u201ccomplex, contextual judgments\u201d that pretty well cover the field of present controversy. He writes with panache and understands the world he works in, especially the virtual world of the Net. Practical answers interest him more than doctrinal purity. His website has adopted a \u201cone-click-away\u201d rule. It screens provocative material \u2014 Muhammad cartoons, for example \u2014 with a warning that some may take offense, leaving them to see it or not as they choose.He knows that \u201cwe,\u201d the citizenry of mice, are not all secular-minded liberals like him but deeply divided in outlook. Heading each chapter is a free-speech maxim that he hopes modernity and tradition may agree on: for example, \u201cNeither make threats of violence nor accept violent intimidation\u201d or \u201cRespect the believer but not necessarily the content of the belief.\u201d His watchword for dialogue amid \u00adcultural diversity is \u201crobust civility,\u201d an ideal somewhere between internal warfare and inauthentic making nice. He derides trigger warnings and on-campus censorship, explaining tersely that \u201cchildren should be educated to become sovereign adults, but not treated as if they already are.\u201dMost of us are somewhat stunned at present by the scale and \u00adcomplexity of the forces in play, be they government surveillance; the \u201cGreat Firewall of \u00adChina\u201d that can censor the national web; the mounting strength of the Internet giants; or the frightening violence of militant Islam. Bewilderment is the easy option. \u201cFree Speech\u201d encourages us to take a breath, look hard at the facts and see how well-tried liberal principles can be applied and defended in daunting new circumstances.Edmund Fawcett, the author of \u201cLiberalism: The Life of an Idea,\u201d is writing a study of conservatism in Europe and the United States from the 19th century to the present.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Netanyahu Names Avigdor Lieberman Israeli Defense Minister as Party Joins Coalition", "Date": "2016-05-25", "News": "Supported byJERUSALEM \u2014 Avigdor Lieberman, the Israeli hard-liner who was named defense minister on Wednesday, recently issued a typically blunt ultimatum to Ismail Haniya, the leader of Hamas, the Islamic militant group that controls Gaza.As the deal was announced, Mr. Lieberman sounded far more conciliatory. \u201cMy responsibility is for a level-headed policy that will bring stability to the region, to our country,\u201d he said, adding that he intended to work in close cooperation with Mr. Netanyahu and the military.\u201cConsidering the importance of defense in Israel, and that our children serve in the army, we need the best person possible in that position,\u201d said Moshe Arens, a former minister of defense and of foreign affairs from Likud. Calling Mr. Lieberman\u2019s appointment a \u201cmistake,\u201d Mr. Arens said that, while the demands of coalition politics required compromises, these \u201chave to stop at the Defense Ministry.\u201dAs well as his aggressive stance against Hamas, Mr. Lieberman has called for the ouster of President Mahmoud Abbas of the Western-backed Palestinian Authority.Together with Naftali Bennett, the education minister and the leader of the right-wing party Jewish Home, Mr. Lieberman was highly critical of the handling of the 50-day war in Gaza in the summer of 2014, which ended without a clear victory for Israel.Until recently, the exchanges between Mr. Lieberman and the government he is joining were no less acerbic. At the gathering in Beersheba last month, Mr. Lieberman accused Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s government of pursuing a \u201cdefeatist\u201d policy in Gaza intended \u201cto buy quiet at any price.\u201dLikud said at the time that Mr. Lieberman \u201cdid not meet the threshold requirements\u201d to be a military analyst, and the party described him as \u201ca man who has only heard tennis balls whistle past his ear,\u201d rather than bullets.For all of Mr. Lieberman\u2019s bluster, many Israeli analysts predict that he will become more pragmatic once he takes office.\u201cWhen you sit in the chair and consider the consequences of your decisions, things look different,\u201d said Amos Harel, the military affairs analyst of the liberal newspaper Haaretz.Mr. Netanyahu also tried to play down the significance of the appointment. \u201cIn the end,\u201d he said, \u201cthe prime minister is the one who navigates all the campaigns, along with the defense minister and the chief of staff.\u201dAs foreign minister, Mr. Lieberman, an immigrant from Moldova, then part of the Soviet Union, who lives in a West Bank settlement, was sidelined when it came to Israel\u2019s critical interests, including its relationship with Washington.He has also said that Israel should seek other allies and work to strengthen ties with Russia.In recent days, Mr. Netanyahu welcomed what appeared to be a behind-the-scenes move for a regional conference hosted by Egypt that had begun to take shape while he was in earlier coalition talks with Isaac Herzog of the center-left Zionist Union. It is not immediately clear where the shift rightward leaves that initiative.Shmuel Sandler, a political-science professor and expert on Israeli foreign policy at Bar-Ilan University near Tel Aviv, said that some Arab leaders were ready, \u201cnot out of love for Zionism but because of their own interests, to accept Israel as a legitimate actor.\u201d\u201cIt will be sad if we miss that opportunity because of domestic politics,\u201d he added.There is also concern over what kind of working relationship Mr. Lieberman will have with the army\u2019s top generals, having recently positioned himself as their adversary.Mr. Yaalon, a former chief of staff, stood firmly with the military, while some other ministers fanned the populist ire.Mr. Lieberman showed up at the military court to support the soldier and called the legal proceedings a \u201ctheater of the absurd.\u201dIn a Facebook post, he wrote, \u201cI hope that at the end of the process the soldier will be acquitted and it will be clear to everybody that it is the right of every Jew, and especially of a soldier, to protect himself from a terrorist who has come to kill him.\u201dMajd Al Waheidi contributed reporting from Gaza.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Shocking Way (Really) to Break Bad Habits", "Date": "2016-05-02", "News": "Personal technology for health and fitness.Every January for the past decade, Jessica Irish of Saline, Mich., has made the same New Year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Resolution: to \u00e2\u0080\u009ccut out late night snacking and lose 30 pounds.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Like millions of Americans, Ms. Irish, 31, usually makes it about two weeks.But this year is different.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already lost 18 pounds,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand maintained my diet more consistently than ever. Even more amazing \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I rarely even think about snacking at night anymore.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cEvery time I took a bite, I zapped myself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI did it five times on the first night, two times on the second night, and by the third day I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any cravings anymore.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAs the name suggests, the $199 Pavlok, worn on the wrist, uses the classic theory of Pavlovian conditioning to create a negative association with a specific action. Next time you smoke, bite your nails or eat junk food, one tap of the device or a smartphone app will deliver a shock. The zap lasts only a fraction of a second, though the severity of the shock is up to you. It can be set between 50 volts, which feels like a strong vibration, and 450 volts, which feels like getting stung by a bee with a stinger the size of an ice pick. (By comparison, a police Taser typically releases about 50,000 volts.)But the Pavlok takes things a step further, delivering a much stronger message.To test the device, I wore it for a week, zapping myself every time I ate dessert. My goal was to curb my craving for sweets after dinner. First I zapped myself before and after I ate a square of dark chocolate, and did it again later in the week after eating ice cream, a red velvet cupcake and a chocolate chip cookie.Set on low, it feels like a strong tickle. Set on high, it hurts. A lot.It should be noted that the creator of Pavlok, Maneesh Sethi, once hired a woman to sit next to him and slap him on the face every time she saw him using Facebook, so he could increase his productivity.

{"Headline": "Oracle\u2019s Suit Against Google Digs Up Old Bones", "Date": "2016-05-11", "News": "Supported byBitsIn Silicon Valley, it is often said that new tech companies are built on the bones of the old ones.Sun Microsystems, one of the most influential tech companies of the 1990s, has been back in the news this week, and its old bones could end up costing Google more than $9 billion. In 1995, Sun released the first version of its Java programming language \u2014 or development platform, as many preferred to call it at the time.Java was a programming breakthrough, just as browsing the World Wide Web was becoming mainstream. The Java motto at the time \u2014 \u201cWrite once, run anywhere\u201d \u2014 while always a bit of an exaggeration, pointed to the importance that software created by anyone working on anything could have. Without that notion, the Web would not work.Sun, founded years earlier and best known for its powerful workstation computers, became one of the most influential companies of the first dot-com boom. It moved on to making servers, which ran many of the most popular websites of the time. It is not a stretch to say that big thinkers at the company were mulling things like cloud computing \u2014 giant computer networks that connect over the Internet \u2014 years before they became a reality.But Sun did not last as long as its ideas. Its costly servers, which usually ran on Sun-made computer chips and software, were undercut by cheaper servers that ran on common processors designed by Intel and Linux, a low-cost, open-source software alternative.By the time the company tried to respond, it was too late. Oracle acquired Sun \u2014 and Java \u2014 for $7.4 billion in 2009. And as Oracle\u2019s lawyers did an inventory of the intellectual property of their new purchase, they came to the conclusion that Google had violated Java copyrights in its Android operating system for smartphones.Interestingly, years ago, Mr. Schmidt was in charge of Java at Sun. He says that helped him know what was and was not a copyright violation. Oracle\u2019s lawyers are sure to argue that history means he should have known better.Sun is long gone, but its intellectual legacy lives on. So do its old headquarters. These days, they are part of Facebook\u2019s campus.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon Proves Infertile Soil for Unions, So Far", "Date": "2016-05-16", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 In early April, Kellen Wadach, the general manager at Amazon\u2019s warehouse in Middletown, Del., told hundreds of workers at the cavernous facility a troubling story about his family being abandoned by his father\u2019s union.Flashing a photograph of himself as a boy with his father, Mr. Wadach said the union did not help his family financially after his father died suddenly in front of their house, not even bothering to send a condolence card, according to three current workers at the warehouse who heard him speak and asked for anonymity for fear of losing their jobs.The problem with Mr. Wadach\u2019s story was that much of it appears to have been untrue.For years, Amazon has successfully battled to keep unions out of the company. And the incident involving Mr. Wadach was an illustration of how important it was to Amazon \u2014 or at least to some of its employees \u2014 to keep it that way.Just days after a reporter approached Amazon about inconsistencies in Mr. Wadach\u2019s story, Scott Stanzel, an Amazon spokesman, said Mr. Wadach was no longer with the company.Mr. Wadach did not respond to repeated messages sent to his email address and Facebook account. A voice mail message left at a listed number for his mother was not returned.Some Amazon fulfillment center workers see unions as a way to gain more influence on pay, how job assignments are doled out and the handling of workplace complaints. Amazon worries unions will burden its operations with red tape, hurting the nimbleness of facilities it is constantly adjusting to be more efficient with robots and other innovations.\u201cAmazon\u2019s culture and business model are based on rapid innovation, flexibility and open lines of direct communication between managers and associates,\u201d Mr. Stanzel said. \u201cThis direct connection is the most effective way to understand and respond to the wants and needs of our associates.\u201dUnion officials think Amazon fights so hard to keep them at bay to prevent a domino effect among its warehouses.\u201cThis is Amazon\u2019s biggest fear,\u201d said Andy Powell, a district organizer for the International Association of Machinists & Aerospace Workers who is trying to organize Amazon fulfillment center workers in Delaware and several nearby states. \u201cThe minute one falls and people see they got a better deal, it\u2019s going to be a cancer for them.\u201dUnions have not made much progress at Amazon after years of campaigns, which union officials and warehouse workers blame partly on the high turnover rate in its fulfillment centers.A labor union in Germany has organized frequent strikes over pay and workplace conditions by a portion of workers at Amazon fulfillment centers in the country, though workers do not have a union contract with the company.In 2014, the machinists union helped organize a union vote by a small number of technicians and mechanics who worked on order-fulfillment equipment at the fulfillment center in Middletown, a community of about 19,000 about a half-hour from Wilmington.It was the first vote of its kind at an Amazon warehouse, but workers voted 21 to 6 to reject the plan, which was opposed by Amazon. The company said there were about 3,000 full-time workers at the facility.Since late fall, representatives of the machinists union, including Mr. Powell, have passed out leaflets at a busy intersection outside the fulfillment center. Some employees at the facility have encouraged co-workers to consider the potential benefits of joining a union.In many cases, pay and benefits are not even the top concerns of workers \u2014 pay at the Middletown warehouse starts around $13 an hour and health care and parental leave benefits are the same for warehouse workers as they are for senior executives at Amazon. The company said full-time workers at the facility made, on average, over $15 an hour in overall compensation when including base pay, bonuses and stock awards.But workers want things like better protection from termination and mechanisms for contesting favoritism by managers. Mr. Stanzel said the company had a process for employees to appeal terminations and an open-door policy that encourages workers to bring their concerns to managers.Like many other companies, Amazon employs standard \u201cunion avoidance\u201d techniques, telling workers in gatherings that they will no longer be able to communicate directly with Amazon if a union represents them, union officials said. Around Christmas last year, managers began making the rounds at the Middletown warehouse, questioning workers on their thoughts about unions, said employees at the warehouse.Last June, Scott Gragilla, a former Amazon fulfillment center employee at the warehouse, began asking questions about why workers were not receiving bonuses they had gotten in the past. Not long after, he said, he was reprimanded for his job performance for the first time.Mr. Gragilla, 38, worked as a picker, someone who gathers items from shelves for Amazon orders, and eventually was promoted to \u201cambassador,\u201d an employee who leads training sessions for other employees.He began openly promoting the idea of unionizing the warehouse to co-workers. But in early December, Mr. Gragilla said he was told he was being fired by Amazon for his work performance, including leaving early for his lunch break and failing to return after being ordered back to work by two managers. He denies either is true.Amazon maintains that no employee has ever been terminated as a result of union activity, said Mr. Stanzel, the company spokesman.Mr. Gragilla filed a complaint about his termination with the National Labor Relations Board. He said he was unable to gather enough former co-workers from the Amazon fulfillment center to testify on his behalf, and the board declined to take the case to a judge.Mr. Wadach\u2019s emotional story, after those months of union activity, aroused suspicions among employees who were skeptical that a union would act so callously.Word of the story got to the machinists union, which found an obituary in The Ithaca Journal in New York on April 20, 2006, that said Mr. Wadach\u2019s father, Peter Dana Wadach, had died while jogging on a family vacation in South Carolina \u2014 not in front of the family home, as Mr. Wadach had said.The obituary and another news story said Peter Wadach was a partner at an insurance agency in Ithaca and had worked in the insurance business for nearly three decades. He was 49 when he died.Amazon declined to discuss details of Kellen Wadach\u2019s departure from the company.Charlotte Garden, an associate professor of law at the Seattle University School of Law, said Mr. Wadach\u2019s story, odd as it may have been, would probably not reach a legal threshold for \u201ccoercive\u201d behavior.\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty high bar,\u201d she said. \u201cThat means a lot of employer persuader activity is lawful.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Another Company With a Cause: Is Google Just Being a Good Citizen?", "Date": "2016-05-12", "News": "Supported byPayday LoansGoogle is an adventurous company, but few would ever think of it as a financial regulator.It\u2019s not censorship, because Google is a private company, not the government. But with so much digital advertising running through Google\u2019s extensive network, Google does have huge power to quickly effect change. But is that power akin to the government\u2019s?An interesting pattern is forming, but it\u2019s not a rampant power grab by corporate America. It\u2019s more nuanced than that.Google could argue that its move is merely tipping the balance back toward the borrower. PayPal could argue that its move was about civil rights. Corporate power is checked to some degree by many kinds of laws and regulations, including those against unfair competition, discrimination and unsafe working conditions. PayPal, for instance, would be in big legal trouble if it fired employees for supporting the North Carolina bathroom law.More important, though, when there is no clear-cut wrong being done, a crackdown on a corporation could do more harm than good.But even if Facebook suppressed every single right-wing article \u2013 something that would reduce its credibility, destroy its reputation and undermine its business \u2014 this would not be illegal. It is guaranteed the freedom of speech like any news organization. Indeed, trying to make a company\u2019s bias illegal would have negative consequences for society that would far exceed any harm done by Facebook\u2019s trending list.Facebook could tweak its own system to guard against bias. But this is tricky, too. How can \u201cbias\u201d ever be conclusively defined on a social media site with 222 million users in the United States with widely divergent opinions? Scouring all those streams for bias would be close to impossible. Still, Facebook could take smaller, more sensible steps like encouraging external monitors to review serious accusations of bias and bring them to the company\u2019s attention.But in reality Google\u2019s move was not radical. Media companies often decide not to run certain types of ads \u2014 like those for escort services. And Google is hardly out of step with the wider financial industry. Mainstream lenders have long stayed away from payday loans, leaving the business to a few firms.The ad ban by Google, in contrast, came fast, a reminder of how effective corporate power can be. You can understand why the payday industry found it unsettling. But the lenders are just one side of this debate.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "After Cataract Surgery, Hoping to Toss the Glasses", "Date": "2016-05-04", "News": "This video shows what it is like to see the world when you have cataracts.Two years ago, Anne Collins of Arlington, Va., who has been wearing glasses since fifth grade, noticed she had trouble reading the overhead street signs while driving. Cataracts, the clouding of the natural lenses that occur with age, were taking their toll.She decided it was time for cataract surgery.Mrs. Collins, now 61, chose to have her lenses replaced with two different intraocular lenses \u00e2\u0080\u0093 one for seeing far and the other for seeing near \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in a procedure known as monovision cataract surgery.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought it was a miracle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Collins said after the surgery was completed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was like I was back in second grade and didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any problems with my eyes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Still, her vision isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t perfect. Mrs. Collins still needs glasses to read the newspaper, but she can see her cellphone just fine.By age 80, more than half of all Americans either have a cataract or will have had cataract surgery, according to the National Eye Institute. The average age for the surgery is the early 70s.   Cataracts typically develop in both eyes, and each eye is done as a separate procedure, usually one to eight weeks apart. Patients most commonly have their clouded lenses replaced with artificial monofocal lenses that enable them to see things far away. Most will still need glasses for reading and other close-up tasks. With monovision surgery, the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dominant eye receives a replacement lens for distance vision. In a subsequent operation, the less dominant eye receives a lens for close vision. Once surgery on both eyes is completed, the brain adjusts the input from each eye and patients typically can see both far and near. Some people can stop wearing glasses altogether, although many, like Mrs. Collins, still need them for certain tasks. But monovison takes some getting used to. The ideal candidates may be people who already have tried a monovision approach with contact lenses for 15 or 20 years, before they even have developed cataracts, said Dr. Alan Sugar, a professor of ophthalmology at the University of Michigan. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople who have worn contact lenses in their 40s, with one contact for near vision and one for distance, are good candidates,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Others may be able to give monovision a trial run. The cataract surgeon replaces the first eye with a lens that corrects for distance vision and then, if the cataract in the second eye hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t progressed too far, can let the patient use a contact lens for near vision in the second eye, Dr. Sugar said. If the patient is comfortable with the trial monovision, the surgeon can then implant a lens for near vision in the second eye. Experts caution that monovision surgery is not for everyone. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMany patients get misled by asking how their friends like monovision,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. David F. Chang, a clinical professor of ophthalmology at the University of California, San Francisco, and past president of the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSome individuals hate what another individual loves.\u00e2\u0080\u009d After any cataract surgery, including monovision surgery, patients may also experience what doctors call \u00e2\u0080\u009cdysphotopsia,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or visual disturbances like seeing glare, halos, streaks or shadows. Moderate to severe problems occur in less than 5 percent of patients, said Dr. Tal Raviv, an associate clinical professor of ophthalmology at the New York Eye & Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai Icahn School of Medicine. Symptoms often improve during the first three months after surgery without treatment, he said, though in a small number of cases one or both lenses may need to be replaced. In addition, some patients who get monovision surgery will need a separate pair of glasses that focus both eyes for distance vision for driving at night. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNight driving is more difficult if both eyes are not optimally focused at distance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Chang said. But patients who undergo multifocal surgery are more likely to have side effects like glare and halos, according to Dr. Mark Wilkins, the lead author of the study and a consultant ophthalmologist and head of clinical services at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London. In his study, six of 94 patients in the multifocal group had to have second surgeries to get replacement lenses, versus none in the monovision group.Typically, Medicare covers regular cataract surgery and implantation of standard monofocal lenses but does not pay for multifocal lenses, so insurance reimbursements may be limited. The key to deciding which type of cataract surgery is right for you is to understand your eyes and goals. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTalk about the pros and cons\u00e2\u0080\u009d of each type of cataract surgery, Dr. Wilkins said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no other way really.\u00e2\u0080\u009dYour health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "Mr. Harris said little as she posed before the industrial-size camera while he exposed a few sheets of instant film. It seemed like a collaborative experience \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a throwback to 19th-century attempts to capture \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe essence of a person,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Lewis recalled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I look at that image of me now I realize he captured something nascent in me that I did not know I would grow into \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a  steely-eyed clarity, a willfulness, tenacity and commitment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was very young. It was an image that showed where I was going.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  The volume was inspired by Frederick Douglass\u00e2\u0080\u0099s speech \u00e2\u0080\u009cPictures and Progress,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which raised the issue of how African-Americans are represented visually and spoke of the transformative power of photography in effecting change in the United States. The edition, available on May 24, includes texts by Henry Louis Gates Jr., Thelma Golden, Teju Cole, Margo Jefferson and Maurice Berger and photos by Carrie Mae Weems, Deborah Willis, Sally Mann, Lorna Simpson, Ruddy Roye, Awol Erizku, LaToya Ruby Frazier, Deana Lawson and Hank Willis Thomas. The issue also includes images from Mr. Harris\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cChocolate Portraits,\u00e2\u0080\u009d named because of the brown color of the prints created by a (Cross processing) technique used on the 20 by 24 Polaroids during development. That series \u00e2\u0080\u0094 published in Mr. Harris\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2010 book, \u00e2\u0080\u009cExcessive Exposure\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 looks not only at blackness, Ms. Lewis said, but also at more general identities that include race, sexuality and class.  Started in the 1990s, the portraits include 200 subjects, ranging from the famous, like Chuck Close, Al Sharpton and Yoko Ono, to the completely unknown. All are rendered in various shades of brown. Each was photographed in close-ups of the face as well as the back of the head, a nod to the pseudo-scientific use of photography to support supposed theories of racial inferiority.  Photography has often been used in \u00e2\u0080\u009ccataloging the other\u00e2\u0080\u009d and as a \u00e2\u0080\u009ctool of control,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Harris said.\u00e2\u0080\u009cSince its inception photography is implicated in ethnography, anthropology, colonialism, imperialism and eugenics,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.Mr. Harris\u00e2\u0080\u0099s subjects were treated with equal care and dignity no matter their race, gender or background, and they also exerted some control over how they presented themselves to the camera. The magazine featured just his portraits of African-Americans. The Aperture issue features an essay by Professor Gates, who noted that Frederick Douglass was not only a master orator and impassioned activist, but also perhaps the most-photographed man in 19th-century America. He was, as well, a theorist on the new medium, Mr. Gates wrote, stating that \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrederick Douglass used photographic images of himself like he used his oratory, in the battle to end slavery and to ensure for the Negro full citizenship rights.\u00e2\u0080\u009dProfessor Gates also wrote that Douglass was quick to embrace photography to counter the narrative \u00e2\u0080\u009cof the debased, subhuman Negro fabricated and so profusely distributed by the slave power.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As such, Douglass \u00e2\u0080\u009cwas a reformer on a mission: he seized upon those long-exposure glimpses of black and majestic human forms, miraculously generated by the chiastic magic of Daguerre\u00e2\u0080\u0099s camera obscura, to fabricate \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to picture \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the very images through which, at long last, the Negro as anti-slave could emerge and then progress, clothed in his own form.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As Mr. Harris captured a cross section of some of the leading artists and intellectuals, he explored \u00e2\u0080\u009ca certain zeitgeist in the birth of a new multicultural moment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said \u2014 \u00e2\u0080\u009clike an updated \u00e2\u0080\u0098Family of Man\u00e2\u0080\u0099 capturing a newer time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Influenced by August Sander, James Van Der Zee, and Bernd and Hilla Becher, he was cataloging his own time \u00e2\u0080\u0094 both leveling the playing field and making clear the field was now much larger than before.And that, Ms. Lewis said, connects Mr. Harris to Douglass: \u00e2\u0080\u009cLyle is the photographer that Douglass would have wanted to see working in the 21st century.\u00e2\u0080\u009d "}

What am I forgetting to worry about?\u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople have a love-hate relationship with worry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Michelle Newman, a professor of psychology and psychiatry at Pennsylvania State University, who was not involved in the writing of the report. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey think at some level that it helps them.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe belief that worrying somehow helps to prevent bad things from happening is more common than you might think. Researchers say the notion is reinforced by the fact that we tend to worry about rare events, like plane crashes, and are reassured when they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen, but we worry less about common events, like car accidents.But that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean all worrying is futile. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSome worry is actually good for you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Simon A. Rego, the author of the new report and a cognitive behavioral psychologist who specializes in anxiety disorders and analyzed decades of research on worrying for the paper. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we call productive or instructive worry, that can help us take steps to solve a problem.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhen the researchers analyzed the results, they determined that about 20 percent of the worries were about anticipating a negative outcome in the future. But nearly half of all the documented worries reflected a process of problem solving. While that can be constructive, people who worried a lot and couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t control their worrying were less likely to find a solution to their problem. The researchers, Marianna Szabo, now at the University of Sydney, and Peter F. Lovibond of the University of New South Wales in Australia, concluded that failing to come up with solutions may actually lead to more pathological worrying.People \u00e2\u0080\u009cget caught up in the worry itself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Newman said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt becomes so habitual, I call it \u00e2\u0080\u0098a process looking for content.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009dThat kind of worrying can get out of hand. \u00e2\u0080\u009cExcessive worriers have multiple domains that they worry about, and if something triggers a worry in one domain, it can seep into other areas,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Rego said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand things can move back and forth like wildfires \u00e2\u0080\u0094 once one gets going, it can start other fires as well.\u00e2\u0080\u009dLiberty Mutual Insurance officials commissioned the report to better understand how Americans can \u00e2\u0080\u009cbreak the worry cycle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d since the insurance business is designed \u00e2\u0080\u009caround helping people live with less worry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Margaret Dillon, the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s executive vice president and chief customer officer for the United States, adding that it could also help them develop the most appropriate products.

{"Headline": "Warren Buffett and Dan Gilbert Unite in Bid to Acquire Yahoo", "Date": "2016-05-15", "News": "Supported byYahoo appears to be making progress in efforts to sell itself, despite some initial skepticism.The latest piece of evidence: Among those vying for the company is the unusual combination of the investor Warren E. Buffett and Dan Gilbert, the founder of Quicken Loans and owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers.That consortium is one of several suitors that have moved into the second round of bidding for Yahoo, according to people briefed on the matter.Mr. Gilbert is leading the bid, said the people, who were not authorized to speak publicly. Mr. Buffett\u2019s conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway, is offering to provide financing, as he has done with the investment firm 3G Capital in its takeovers of H. J. Heinz and Kraft, and is leaving the negotiations to Mr. Gilbert, according to the people.The two are joined in the second round by a range of other bidders, including Verizon Communications and private equity firms such as TPG Capital and a group that comprises Bain Capital and Vista Equity Partners, people briefed on the process have previously said. Several other strategic bidders are also in the second round.Yahoo declined to comment. Representatives for Quicken Loans and Berkshire did not return requests for comment.The companies in the second round of bidding are seeking to buy one of the best-known names in Silicon Valley \u2014 though one that ceded a longtime hold on the Internet to younger rivals like Google and Facebook. Repeated efforts to reinvent itself, led by a string of chief executives, including the company\u2019s current leader, Marissa Mayer, have failed to take hold.As Yahoo and its bankers canvassed for preliminary bids, the company received criticism, including from some prospective bidders and from the activist hedge fund Starboard Value, over the state of the sales process.Yet Yahoo can point to progress. It settled a looming board fight with Starboard, offering the investment firm four director seats. One of those is held by Starboard\u2019s chief executive, Jeffrey Smith, who now sits on the special board committee overseeing the potential sale.Yahoo executives, including Ms. Mayer, and advisers have been sitting down with bidders in the second round, furnishing those suitors with additional details.Among them is Mr. Gilbert, who built his multibillion-dollar fortune with the financial empire. But he is also an active investor in his own right, having taken stakes in a number of online start-ups.Yahoo would be orders of magnitude larger than those other technology investments and significantly more troubled. But Mr. Gilbert\u2019s consortium, like other bidders, has been interested in the still-significant digital footprint that the company possesses, including its popular finance and sports sites.Backing him is his friend Mr. Buffett \u2014 who has long spoken of his aversion to technology companies, outside of an investment in IBM. But the role of Berkshire in the Gilbert bid would be financial, and Mr. Buffett\u2019s conglomerate would collect interest from its financing with the opportunity to convert those holdings into an equity stake in the company.And one of Berkshire\u2019s directors is Susan L. Decker, a former president of Yahoo.Providing advice to the Gilbert consortium are the former senior Yahoo executives Dan Rosensweig, who is now chief executive of the education company Chegg, and Tim Cadogan, now the head of the online advertising platform OpenX. Neither has expressed interest in rejoining Yahoo, one of the people briefed on the matter said.Mr. Buffett and Mr. Gilbert have another \u2014 albeit more troubled \u2014 tie to the Internet company. In 2014, Berkshire, Quicken Loans and Yahoo briefly united to offer a \u201cBillion Dollar Bracket Challenge\u201d tied to the NCAA basketball tournament that year, though the contest was called off and devolved into a morass of lawsuits.Advertisement"}

Now it is getting the kind of recognition that will live on for decades in the fervent, tribal world of English soccer.The Leicester City Foxes were nearly dropped from the Premier League a year ago, but with a middling payroll and few stars the team could now embarrass celebrity rivals including Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United.\u201cYou can\u2019t put words to it,\u201d Ms. Rayner said, asserting that she has been a supporter since her birth, which was \u201cexactly at kickoff\u201d of a match. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the money \u2014 our whole team gets paid what some of these stars get \u2014 but passion and dreams.\u201dKaren Fox, 56, said she had attended her first Leicester City game at 10, \u201cwhen it cost 25 pence to get in and 5 pence for a program.\u201d Now she happily pays more than 415 in British pounds, or about $605, a year for season tickets.\u201cIt\u2019s the victory of the underdog, isn\u2019t it?\u201d her spouse, Jenny Fox, said. \u201cThat\u2019s what everyone loves, that anything can happen.\u201d Leicester\u2019s season, she said, was almost better than Britain\u2019s law permitting them to marry, after many years together.Leicester\u2019s winning the Premier League, he said, \u201cwould be like a Canadian Football League team winning the N.F.L.\u201dLeicester, 100 miles north of London, is one of England\u2019s oldest cities, founded 2,000 years ago, and is among its most diverse, with more than 50 percent of its 330,000 inhabitants estimated now to be nonwhite. Twenty percent of the population is Muslim, and almost 20 percent is Hindu or Sikh.But the people here rub together, with more Asian supporters for soccer than in most English cities \u2014 the team is owned by a Thai, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, who made millions from duty-free shopping \u2014 and a significant reputation for tolerance.In fact, Leicester, which is pronounced here as \u201cLESS-tah,\u201d is better known for rugby.But a soccer team has played here since 1894, and its highest finish previously was in 1929 \u2014 second place in Division One, the predecessor to the Premier League. Now, if Tottenham loses to Chelsea on Monday night, Leicester will be champion, and can win the league regardless at home against Everton on Saturday.The team is made up of players who were mostly dumped from richer, more star-studded teams. Even its Italian coach, Claudio Ranieri, 64, is considered a dull journeyman, known as \u201cthe Tinkerman\u201d for constantly fiddling with his lineup. When he left Chelsea in 2004, his successor, the star coach Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, said he had been hired because the team \u201cwanted to win.\u201dMr. Mourinho, who won it all last year for Chelsea, was fired in December, and Chelsea now sits 10th in the league, while Mr. Ranieri is hailed as a patient genius. At least until next season, when the bigger, richer teams could play closer to their potential and the fairy dust on Leicester could blow away.\u201cHillsborough is the tragedy of football, and Leicester City is the opposite,\u201d Mr. Hobson said. \u201cFor some people who say, \u2018Football isn\u2019t a matter of life and death, it\u2019s more important,\u2019 this has been powerful.\u201dOf course, he added, \u201cthe tragedy in Syria matters more than football, but even if football doesn\u2019t mean as much, it\u2019s still important.\u201dLeicester is basking in recognition, he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been what we are, and now people recognize us for it.\u201d\u201cI think this is once in a lifetime,\u201d Mr. Hobson said. \u201cWho knows about next year?\u201dFor now, no one here cares.Advertisement"}

Buckel, 38, escaped from a minimum-security satellite unit of Bayside State Prison on the grounds of Ancora Psychiatric Hospital in Hammonton, where he was serving a three-year sentence on charges that included aggravated assault and burglary.Mr. Buckel was convicted of aggravated manslaughter in 1996 in the beating death of his girlfriend\u2019s 10-month-old daughter in Jersey City. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison, without the possibility of parole for 12 \u00bd years, and was released in June 2010.On Wednesday, Mr. Buckel was seen on surveillance video entering a CVS drugstore in Barnegat, a town on the Jersey Shore.As police officers descended on the community last week, schools were placed on lockdown and residents were told to stay inside and keep their doors locked.Scores of tips flooded in but it was not until Sunday night that the hunt for Mr. Buckel intensified, when he was spotted at the Forked River rest area near Exit 77 on the parkway in Berkeley Township, the authorities said.The police released video from surveillance cameras at the rest stop that appeared to show Mr. Buckel, clean shaven and wearing a long-sleeve gray sweatshirt, gray shorts and work boots.But by the time the police arrived, Mr. Buckel had fled.State and local police officers searched the nearby woods, assisted by dogs and aerial surveillance.Shortly before noon, the Ocean County Sheriff\u2019s Department posted an update on its Facebook page: \u201cArthur Buckel is in custody.\u201dMr. Buckel was just weeks away from being eligible for parole when he escaped.An earlier version of this article misstated the age of Arthur W.

{"Headline": "The Breakup Marathon", "Date": "2016-05-25", "News": "Want to start a new running habit? We make it easy to get started, get inspired and stay on track. Are you ready? Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s go!Brian Eastwood was a pretty good runner, but he\u2019d always come up a bit short in trying to reach his goal of qualifying for the Boston Marathon. When he set out to train for the 2015 Vermont City Marathon, though, his 12th try at qualifying, he had something new in his life: a divorce.\u201cThe day my wife and I went to court was the first day of 16 weeks of training,\u201d said Mr. Eastwood, 35, of Somerville, Mass. His life was, to put it mildly, in flux. Not only was he on the verge of divorce, but he was in the middle of trying to make a career shift, too.But his training paid off: Mr. Eastwood ran the race of his life in Vermont, finishing in 3 hours, 1 minute, 17 seconds, more than seven minutes under his best time, and more than eight minutes under the Boston Marathon qualifying standard for men his age. His divorce, he says, most likely made the difference. During that difficult time, \u201crunning was my only real constant,\u201d he said.For some people, a life trauma like a breakup or divorce might mean curling up in bed and shutting down. But others find more active ways to cope.Those people \u201care better at compartmentalizing or utilizing some of the energy that surrounds the emotions they\u2019re experiencing \u00e2\u0080\u0094 maybe it\u2019s anger, maybe it\u2019s sadness \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and channeling that into another venue or arena,\u201d said Trent Petrie, director of the University of North Texas Center for Sport Psychology. For runners, that could mean challenging themselves to run better and faster, or to shoot for a longer distance. \u201cChronic or traumatic stress leads to structural and functional alterations in the traumatized brain,\u201d said Ken Yeager, director of the stress, trauma and resilience program at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. And while a breakup or divorce may feel like a single traumatic event, it is often the culmination of months or even years of \u00e2\u0080\u009cmini-traumas\u00e2\u0080\u009d and ongoing stress.\u201cYou had those tensions building up in your body,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Yeager said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMost people don\u2019t realize the way you release those tensions is movement.\u201d He compares the situation to the nervous tension that builds up at the start of a race. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBefore any major race, you have this release of tension, and that movement is what releases the trauma and tension,\u201d he said. Maya Harmon, 32, ran seven half-marathons in 2015 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the year that she and her husband of seven years divorced. She\u2019d picked up running in 2009 when she moved to Phoenix, but started doing it more when the marriage started to unravel in 2011. \u201cWhen things really started to go bad, I started to focus on trying to do something to stay active because I knew that as long as I stayed active, it would keep me slightly happy,\u201d she said. Even though her time was limited between work, graduate school and becoming a single mother, she still got out there, trained and ran races. Her mother asked if she was trying to run away from her problems. Maybe, she said, though the escape that running provided was at least a healthy one, and kept her from feeling overwhelmed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I had time to sit and think about it, I probably wouldn\u2019t have made it through that time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Harmon said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRunning gave me something to focus on that was positive.\u201dDr. Petrie says that while there\u2019s a risk that running might be used as an escape that prevents people from confronting the issues that are causing their stress, it can also be a useful tool for processing painful events. \u201cSometimes in the moment, these escapes into running or exercising or finding a slightly different focus is a way for us to garner the psychological resources we need to circle back and face the other stuff in a more productive way,\u201d he said. When people are \u201cdepressed or stressed out, they tend to isolate themselves, and that facilitates negative moods,\u201d said Jasper Smits, a professor of psychology at the University of Texas at Austin and a co-author of \u00e2\u0080\u009cExercise for Mood and Anxiety: Proven Strategies for Overcoming Depression and Enhancing Well-Being.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Studies he and his colleagues have conducted suggest that exercise may help to lessen anxiety and panic attacks and provide other benefits for mental health. This past April, Mr. Eastwood ran that Boston Marathon for which he had worked so hard to qualify. Now his life is very different: He has a new girlfriend, a new job. He was recovering from a calf injury when he started training this time, so he set a more moderate goal. He finished in 3 hours, 24 minutes, 37 seconds, more than 20 minutes slower than his post-divorce performance, but he has no complaints. \u201cEveryone who saw me along the course said I looked happy and strong, which is exactly what I wanted,\u201d he said.Related:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "Computer Vision Syndrome Affects Millions", "Date": "2016-05-30", "News": "Jane Brody on health and aging.Joanne Reitano is a professor of history at LaGuardia Community College in Long Island City, Queens. She writes wonderful books about the history of the city and state, and has recently been spending many hours \u00e2\u0080\u0094 sometimes all day \u00e2\u0080\u0094 at her computer to revise her first book, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Restless City.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But while sitting in front of the screen, she told me, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI developed burning in my eyes that made it very difficult to work.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAfter resting her eyes for a while, the discomfort abates, but it quickly returns when she goes back to the computer. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I was playing computer games, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d turn off the computer, but I need it to work,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the frustrated professor said.Dr. Reitano has a condition called computer vision syndrome. She is hardly alone. It can affect anyone who spends three or more hours a day in front of computer monitors, and the population at risk is potentially huge.And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not counting the millions of children and adolescents who spend many hours a day playing computer games.Studies have indicated 70 percent to 90 percent of people who use computers extensively, whether for work or play, have one or more symptoms of computer vision syndrome. The effects of prolonged computer use are not just vision-related. Complaints include neurological symptoms like chronic headaches and musculoskeletal problems like neck and back pain.Still, the most common computer-related complaint involves the eyes, which can develop blurred or double vision as well as burning, itching, dryness and redness, all of which can interfere with work performance.One reason the problem is so pervasive: Unlike words printed on a page that have sharply defined edges, electronic characters, which are made up of pixels, have blurred edges, making it more difficult for eyes to maintain focus. Unconsciously, the eyes repeatedly attempt to rest by shifting their focus to an area behind the screen, and this constant switch between screen and relaxation point creates eyestrain and fatigue.Another unconscious effect is a greatly reduced frequency of blinking, which can result in dry, irritated eyes. Instead of a normal blink rate of 17 or more blinks a minute, while working on a computer the blink rate is often reduced to only about 12 to 15 blinks.But there are additional problems. The head\u00e2\u0080\u0099s distance from the screen and position in relation to it are also important risk factors. To give the eyes a comfortable focusing distance, the screen should be about 20 to 26 inches away from the face. The closer the eyes are to the monitor, the harder they have to work to accommodate to it.Improper lighting and glare are another problem. Contrast is critical, best achieved with black writing on a white screen. The screen should be brighter than the ambient light \u00e2\u0080\u0094 overly bright overhead light and streaming daylight force the eyes to strain to see what is on the screen. A bright monitor also causes your pupils to constrict, giving the eyes a greater range of focus.You might need to reposition the desk, use a dimmer switch on overhead lights, or lower window shades to keep out sunlight. In addition, using a flat screen with an antiglare cover, and wearing glare-reducing or tinted lenses can help to minimize glare.Be sure to use a font size best suited to your visual acuity, and have your eyes examined regularly \u00e2\u0080\u0094 at least once a year \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to be sure your prescription is up-to-date. This is especially important for people older than 40 and for children who are heavy users of computers because visual acuity can change with age. Make sure, too, that your monitor has a high-resolution display that provides sharper type and crisper images. And clean the monitor often with an antistatic dust cloth.Those who work from printed materials, moving back and forth from them to the screen, could minimize neck strain by mounting documents on a stand next to the monitor. If, like me, you use many different printed documents at the same time, consider getting special computer glasses \u00e2\u0080\u0094 bifocal or progressive lenses with the upper portion ideal for screen reading and the lower designed for print distance.Consciously blink as often as possible to keep eye surfaces well lubricated. To further counter dryness, redness and painful irritation, use lubricating eye drops several times a day. My ophthalmologist recommends products free of preservatives sold in single-use dispensers.You can also reduce the risk of dry eyes by keeping air from blowing in your face and by using a humidifier to add moisture to the air in the room. And Dr. Reitano said her eye doctor also suggested applying warm moist compresses to her eyes every morning.Related:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

Doubtless, there would be both Democrats AND Republicans who disagreed with him; but, you know \u2026 I suspect that I wouldn\u2019t.These are the same policies which once defined the Democratic Party until they jettisoned them in the late eighties in their pivot to the right.Like it or not, the views of Bernie Sanders are the future of the Democratic Party.If they want to keep winning elections \u2014 including this one \u2014 they had better internalize this, and start acting on it.This comment received over 790 reader recommendations.But the truth is the truth.

Many of those \u00e2\u0080\u009chidden stories\u00e2\u0080\u009d concern social issues facing Arab women that the collective\u00e2\u0080\u0099s photographers approach with greater insight and context. As Arab women, Ms. Habjouqa said, they have advantages in telling these stories. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom a practical perspective,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Habjouqa said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seen as less threatening, and it is much easier to get access to many places.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhile photojournalism in the Middle East is \u00e2\u0080\u009cstill a boys\u00e2\u0080\u0099 club,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said that there were many female documentary photographers experimenting with new and different narrative strategies.Ms. Abdul Hadi was born to Iraqi parents in the United Arab Emirates, raised in Montreal and now lives in Beirut Her seminude photographs of Arab men are a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccelebration of their sensual beauty\u00e2\u0080\u009d and an attempt to \u00e2\u0080\u009cbreak the stereotypes placed upon the Arab male.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Abdelaziz was born in Cairo, raised mostly in Switzerland and France, and is based in New York.  Her project \u00e2\u0080\u009cMenya\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Kids\u00e2\u0080\u009d documents harsh child labor conditions at an Egyptian limestone quarry. Divorce is a difficult subject in Saudi Arabia, where women who are unmarried are often stigmatized, Ms. Alsultan said. Divorced women, like herself, she said, are often thought of \u00e2\u0080\u009cas used goods.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Although they face real problems, her subjects are, for the most part, finding ways to succeed professionally and personally. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have obstacles but we are overcoming them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMost photographers just show Arab women as objects of pity. You can be my friend \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like that pity look.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}
{"Headline": "New Crowdfunding Rules Let the Small Fry Swim With Sharks", "Date": "2016-05-14", "News": "Supported byStarting Monday, new rules will permit anyone, not just the moneyed, to risk $2,000 a year or more investing in small companies in exchange for a stake in the business. Companies can raise up to $1 million a year this way.It is also an opportunity for start-ups and other small businesses, which can raise money with fairly few regulatory burdens. For instance, small companies seeking less than $500,000 and most first-time issuers will not need to provide audited financial statements, just unaudited ones.That was four years ago. It took a long time to iron out the details, in part because the Securities and Exchange Commission was concerned that ordinary people could lose their life savings because of fraud or na\u00efvet\u00e9.\u201cWhen high-growth companies are looking to raise money, it\u2019s not just for the money,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re also looking for validation, and they want it from venture funds or well-known angels. They won\u2019t get that from a crowdfunding offer.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re building a tribe of women around the world who are passionate about African textiles and want to support these emerging designers,\u201d Ms. Anyadiegwu said.Ms. Anyadiegwu wants to increase her part-time workers\u2019 hours, move her base of operations from Sayreville, N.J., to Atlanta, where she has built a clientele, and do more marketing. To finance that, she\u2019s willing to part with some of her equity in the business.\u201cOur customer base is so engaged,\u201d she said. \u201cThis could be a perfect opportunity for them to participate and be a part of the company in another way.\u201d\u201cWe can build a community around our company. That\u2019s an intangible that you don\u2019t get from private fund-raising,\u201d said Kyle Henson, 23, the company\u2019s chief business officer. He is preparing Rorus to comply with the new securities rules, he said, if it chooses to do a crowdfunding offering.But are the 230 million adult Americans who aren\u2019t millionaires really that interested in becoming do-it-yourself venture capitalists? While supporters cheer the new rules as a democratization of high finance, potentially opening up to the masses deals once reserved for the rich, skeptics worry that regular investors might get only the leftovers.They may dream of discovering the next Facebook. But the most promising companies \u2014 the high-growth ventures delivering the monster returns that keep the entire venture-capital industry afloat \u2014 may also be the ones least likely to bother raising money in small dribs from the crowd, they fear.But what got people excited was the crowdfunding provision allowing companies to raise up to $1 million with few regulatory obstacles.The company caught Mr. Hensch\u2019s eye nearly two years ago, after it raised $1.1 million on Kickstarter. He scoured tech blogs for tidbits, signed up for the company\u2019s newsletter and followed along as executives posted updates from China about their production process.So when Virtuix announced in March that it would crowdfund its next investment round, Mr. Hensch and Ms. Roumagoux jumped in. \u201cI\u2019ve seen where Robert\u2019s recommendations have gone in the market. Typically, when he identifies something early on, it becomes a blockbuster item,\u201d said Ms. Roumagoux, recalling her husband\u2019s early enthusiasm for Tesla, Netflix and a \u201creally neat\u201d search engine called Google.Ms. Roumagoux works as a lawyer, and Mr. Hensch is a real estate business manager. As financiers, \u201cwe\u2019re definitely novices,\u201d she said with a laugh, but both like the idea of diversifying their retirement fund and other investments by gambling on a small portfolio of fledgling technology ventures.Jan Goetgeluk, Virtuix\u2019s founder and chief executive, likes the idea of having hundreds or thousands of stakeholders along for the ride. \u201cThis allows us to turn those fans into true brand advocates. It\u2019s incredibly powerful.\u201dMr. Goetgeluk, a 32-year-old mechanical engineer, had dreamed of becoming an entrepreneur since moving to the United States from Belgium nine years ago. The money he raised from 3,000 backers on Kickstarter funded Virtuix\u2019s early production, and the publicity the campaign created got him a spot pitching his company to a panel of rich investors on \u201cShark Tank\u201d \u2014 where he failed to land a deal.\u201cIf my husband brought this into my house, I would divorce him immediately,\u201d Barbara Corcoran, a real estate entrepreneur, announced on the show.The rules that take effect on Monday make crowdfunding far cheaper and easier for companies to use. But the cost of that concession is a $1 million cap on the amount they can raise in a 12-month period.\u201cWe had no idea that it would take the S.E.C. four years to write all these rules,\u201d Mr. Tommarello said. \u201cWe had to figure out how to stay alive and not go bankrupt.\u201dStill, this isn\u2019t like investing in the stock market. Want to sell Facebook? Just call your broker. Want to sell your shares in Ms. Anyadiegwu\u2019s company, Zuvaa? Well, under the new crowdfunding rules, people must generally hold their shares for at least a year. And even then, there are few marketplaces for finding another buyer.But Ms. Roumagoux, who said she had skimmed the circular, isn\u2019t worried. She and her husband may not be millionaires, but she says they\u2019re financially sophisticated enough to judge the risk that they\u2019re taking.\u201cI know all these rules are there to protect us, but honestly, I don\u2019t think we need the protection,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re relatively young, and this is a long-term investment.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is Egg Freezing Only for White Women?", "Date": "2016-05-21", "News": "Supported byOpinionIT all started with these little chocolate colored pink and blue ceramic babies. They were a strange Christmas gift from an older family friend who, I assumed, didn\u2019t realize that baby figurines were better suited for a person with a nursery and not someone who uses her spare bedroom for dirty laundry.But the friend, Ms. Rosalie, made it clear that these brown babies on rocking horses were not a mistake. They were a reminder that my childbearing years were slowly ticking away, and that I should try to have a child soon whether or not I was married. I nervously laughed and hid the gift in the basement of my mother\u2019s house.A few months later, after an unsurprising breakup, I looked at the fading surgery scar across my abdomen \u2014 the remnant of surgery I had eight years earlier to remove uterine fibroids and treat endometriosis \u2014 and realized it was time to heed Ms. Rosalie\u2019s advice. I started thinking about freezing my eggs.Part of the problem is superficial \u2014 the photos of happy patients on fertility websites and brochures don\u2019t look much like me, so it didn\u2019t seem like egg freezing was targeted toward me, even though I am a professional woman in my 30s. It felt like my community had been left behind in this new path to maternal \u201cempowerment\u201d that centers on elite white women, who have long been thought of as the model of femininity and motherhood.My concern went deeper than whitewashed brochures, and even beyond the price, though with costs starting around $10,000 in many cases, that is a factor. While assisted reproductive technology can help women delay motherhood, it can also help them eventually decide to do it on their own.Considering this procedure opens up the possibility that I could become a single mom as a black woman. I worried about becoming a stereotype, a stigma, despite coming from a loving, stable, middle-class single-parent home myself.Still, I wanted to know more about my options. I thought I might get some of my questions answered during an information session at a downtown New York City fertility clinic, where the room was lily-white, both in terms of attendees and aesthetics.I was uncharacteristically quiet during the session, perhaps because I was only one of a handful of nonwhite women and one of only two black women in the crowded space. I wanted to ask the other black woman in the room, who happened to be sitting next to me, what she thought: Did she have concerns about stigma? Lingering worry about the history of black women and forced sterility treatments \u2014 was this a front for secret government tests? Fear that she would be seen, negatively, as a \u201cbaby mama\u201d \u2014 a term that even the very much married Michelle Obama once had thrown in her face?But racial solidarity today can be a tricky thing, valuable to some and a disdainful reminder of the past to others. So I stayed silent and imagined what it would feel like to tell someone I had a kid on my own.Black women aren\u2019t given the luxury of having their nontraditional choices appear to be new and radical. When we make \u201cunconventional\u201d decisions around reproduction, we\u2019re stigmatized. Or labeled angry. Or lonely. Or difficult. We\u2019re robbed of our agency to do and be anything that\u2019s outside of the boundaries of whatever is perceived as normal.Poor black women are criticized for having too many babies they \u201ccan\u2019t afford\u201d and professional middle-class black women are criticized for being too picky and not finding a man. But when professional white women follow these same patterns, it\u2019s often labeled a trend or brave or empowering.\u201cThere\u2019s stigma on us if we decide to have an abortion,\u201d said Monica Simpson, the executive director of SisterSong, a reproductive justice organization for minority women. \u201cThere\u2019s stigma on us if we decide to have multiple children. There\u2019s stigma on us if we decide to use in vitro or if we are in same-gender loving relationships or queer relationships and we are creating families outside the \u2018normal\u2019 context.\u201dLast year, the former model Tyra Banks admitted that she struggled with fertility treatments and recently announced that she and her partner had successfully had a baby via a surrogate. And BET\u2019s \u201cBeing Mary Jane\u201d had its lead character freeze her eggs on the fictional show. It is a step in the right direction, and I\u2019m glad more black women are speaking up about these issues. But the more I continued to research egg freezing, the more I could not separate it from questions of race.I called Dr. Desire\u00e9 McCarthy-Keith, an obstetrician gynecologist and a fertility specialist in Atlanta, who is working to change the discussion around these technologies. She confirmed that it wasn\u2019t just my imagination and said black women are left out of the conversation around egg freezing, though it\u2019s \u201cslowly changing.\u201d\u201cHistorically, fertility treatments have been mostly targeted to and used by white women, middle-class women, so the initial presentation of fertility treatments, they didn\u2019t really include us in the conversation,\u201d she said.Ms. Simpson, of SisterSong, said there was a real divide between white and black women who consider this technology. \u201cI have black women who decide to be single moms, but they know they can\u2019t create a blog and say, \u2018I\u2019m getting ready to be a single mom.\u2019 That\u2019s nothing new for us, and it\u2019s nothing we can wear as a badge of honor because we\u2019ve been stigmatized for that, we\u2019ve been demonized for that.\u201dDr. McCarthy-Keith said within the black community there are still women who think \u201cwe\u201d don\u2019t do things like freeze our eggs, so support is sometimes lacking.At her diverse practice in Atlanta, she said she\u2019s encountered fewer black patients who undergo egg-freezing procedures for the sole purpose of delaying childbirth, but thinks that it could also be because black patients simply aren\u2019t being advised about these procedures at the same rate as their white counterparts.I WANT motherhood to be on my own terms instead of society defining what it should look like and how I should make it happen. But this is hard in a world that often believes that women who look like me are hypersexual, unfeminine and undesirable \u2014 anything but motherly.Of course, there are many other concerns that I have about egg freezing: the medical worries, the costs, will it make me bloat (?!), but this small part of it, this anxiety about the stigma of single motherhood, exposes things about myself that I don\u2019t like to admit. Me trying to assimilate. Me trying to overcompensate for all the other stereotypical behavior I do embrace. (I\u2019m loud. I\u2019m always late. I love Moscato.) Me wanting to have that traditional life that looks like Mayberry. I want to get married and have a kid someday, and I\u2019m not ready to give up on that idea, but I also wonder why I\u2019m so afraid of the prospect of single parenthood.It\u2019s my respectability politics gone amok.Or maybe it\u2019s just me trying to work out issues over my absentee father \u2014 my own lonely tears and youthful feelings of abandonment that make me ambivalent about putting a child through something similar.I\u2019m still considering freezing my eggs. I appreciate that women who are overwhelmed and overburdened by reproductive issues have more options. But I also hope that the fertility industry will realize the narrowness of the lens that it\u2019s using to talk about this technology. I want black women to feel like egg freezing isn\u2019t just for their rich, white peers and to know that we, too, can make unconventional decisions the norm.Advertisement"}

Still, last week, amid staff reductions, he began focusing less on attacking Mrs. Clinton and more on his views for shaping the Democratic Party.Mr. Sanders, who trails Mrs. Clinton by more than 700 pledged delegates and superdelegates, spent Sunday afternoon urging the superdelegates supporting Mrs. Clinton to his side. He argued that many had given her their support before he entered the race and that he thought those from states he won should follow the voters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lead.The senator also said on Sunday that he and Mrs. Clinton were heading for a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccontested\u00e2\u0080\u009d convention because she needs those superdelegates to reach the delegate threshold, rather than relying solely on the pledged delegates won through the state contests. Superdelegates, however, are widely considered to be part of the necessary delegate count, and Barack Obama needed them to secure the nomination against Mrs. Clinton in 2008.Figures released on Sunday also showed that Mr. Sanders raised just $25.8 million for his campaign in April, down by more than 40 percent from March. Seeking to minimize the drop in fund-raising, the campaign\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spokesman, Michael Briggs, emphasized that Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s average monthly fund-raising total was only $17 million.

That program allows for some of that money to also be used for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign.\u201cThanks to 1.2 million people across the country, we have the resources we need to continue to run a winning primary campaign while preparing for the general election,\u201d said Robby Mook, Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign manager.The fund-raising  brings the total Mrs. Clinton has raised in primary funds to $213.5 million, compared to $210 million for Mr.  Sanders.

In April, he raised $25.8 million, about $20 million less than in March, when Mr. Sanders defeated Mrs. Clinton in a string of contests.Mrs. Clinton has also decreased spending on television ads in the primaries as her campaign gears up for the general election, while Mr. Sanders has been forced to lay off staff to invest heavily in hopes of winning Indiana on Tuesday and delegate-rich California in June.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

In a light-filled conference room at IMG\u2019s Manhattan headquarters, he described childhood visits to the dreaded husky department and the \u201cshaming experience\u201d of shopping in mainstream stores, where dressing rooms are now the stuff of nightmares.\u201cGetting the largest size possible and then being in that room alone with the mirror: You\u2019re like, \u2018Come on, man, please, zip!\u2019\u201d Mr. Bart said. \u201cYou don\u2019t fit, and the lovely store clerk will come and say, \u2018Are you O.K.?\u2019\u201cYou\u2019re so not O.K. You don\u2019t even want to say, \u2018Do you have another size?\u2019 You just leave. That\u2019s my experience.\u201dMr. Miko had better luck with subsequent shoots for Target and for clients like the British plus-size label Bad Rhino. And his Brawn portfolio would make it clear that he could look the part of a bon vivant or even a bombshell. \u201cThe photo with the great black T-shirt, where his own tattoos are showing, is one of the hottest, most desirable \u2014 men, women, everybody is passing out and dying,\u201d Mr. Bart said.In a telephone interview, Ms. Graham said: \u201cI\u2019m excited for what\u2019s to come for Zach. I haven\u2019t met him yet, but I\u2019ve seen the amazing photos that he did and I can see why they signed him as the Brawn man.\u201dIn the light of day, it\u2019s hard to believe that Mr. Miko once loathed his body. Relaxing at Rockwood Music Hall, the Lower East Side club where, until recently, he worked regularly tending bar, he looks like a gorgeous lumberjack in plaid shirt, jeans and vintage boots from L.L. Bean: The jowls and jiggles celebrated by dad-bod enthusiasts are M.I.A.Even so, Mr. Miko said that his size has defined his life, and coming to terms with it was a battle. Though his wife always told him he was \u201cperfect,\u201d not until he began modeling clothing that flattered his body did he begin to feel his own power. \u201cI don\u2019t remember when I learned that being big was a bad thing,\u201d he said, \u201cbut as a kid that\u2019s what I thought.\u201dRaised in a Roman Catholic household in Stratford, Conn., where his father was in the medical-supply business and his mother was a receptionist, Mr. Miko reached 6-1 by the time he was 12. Bullied at school, shunned at dances by girls \u201cwho were afraid I\u2019d step on their feet,\u201d he channeled his energy into becoming a stand-up small-town kid. His credits included altar boy, Little Leaguer, rock-band guitarist, drama-club impresario and, inevitably, Eagle Scout.\u201cI never used my size in an aggressive way,\u201d he said. \u201cI tried to be funny and charming. I wanted to be one of the guys.\u201dBlending into the crowd, however, was impossible. While his peers could cruise for clothes at the mall, Mr. Miko wore hand-me-downs from his 6-5 father, whose wardrobe came from big-and-tall catalogs.With the approval of his parents (who he says were extremely supportive), Mr. Miko worked with a personal trainer and began dieting at 13. \u201cFor years, it was a struggle,\u201d he said. At times, he dropped weight. \u201cI look at pictures of me when I was 17, and I was thin,\u201d Mr. Miko said. \u201cBut I always felt big. I had wild body dysmorphia.\u201dA creative sort who loved storytelling and science fiction, he embraced acting in high school and, later, at Albertus Magnus College in New Haven. After two years, he transferred to the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York, where he graduated in 2011.So where will America\u2019s top plus-size male model be at this time next year? At the very least, he will be supporting other brawny dudes in distress.Recently, Mr. Miko took up the fight against American Eagle, which had released videos of undie-clad guys, from svelte to chunky, musing about body image. Body-positive advocates applauded the company for promoting diversity until April 1, when American Eagle announced that the clips were parodies. The real message, the company said, was that it would stop retouching photos of male models in swimsuits and underwear.Mr. Miko didn\u2019t appreciate the joke, and he criticized the company on Instagram. \u201cI don\u2019t think they meant to be malicious,\u201d he said recently. \u201cBut they were saying to all these guys, \u2018Celebrate the way you look.\u2019 And then it was, \u2018Never mind, you still look funny.\u2019\u201d (Since then, the company has begun to explore using more models with diverse body types.)And then there are those \u2014 some, in the fashion industry \u2014 who ask whether body positivity is a whim. Even as plus-size hunks besiege IMG and Mr. Bart scouts for more Zachs, \u201cI tell them that this is something people want,\u201d Mr. Miko said. \u201cThis is something people crave. I hope it\u2019s not a flash in the pan.\u201dAn article on May 5 about the plus-size model Zach Miko misidentified the position held by Ivan Bart, whose agency represents Mr. Miko. Mr. Bart is the president of IMG Models \u2014 not of IMG, its parent company.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is It O.K. to Get a Dog From a Breeder, Not a Shelter?", "Date": "2016-05-11", "News": "Supported byThe EthicistThere is much to be said for adopting a shelter dog; if every canine companion that died or ran away were replaced with one, the shelters would be pretty much empty. But given that you are morally free not to have a dog, you are morally free not to have a shelter dog. Though we should all support laws and policies that reduce animal suffering, taking on a pet you don\u2019t want isn\u2019t the way to do it. Nor are you specifically responsible for the practices that lead to so many animals\u2019 being abandoned.Are you killing a shelter dog when you buy a pet from a breeder? Not in your case: The alternative for you would be to not get a dog at all. Among the 50 or 60 million dog-owning American households, there are other people who share your preferences. And so a role remains for a responsible breeder. But as a dog lover who worries about abandoned animals, you probably should contribute to organizations that may reduce their numbers. Don\u2019t think of this as the canine equivalent of a carbon-offset program. The reason to contribute is not that doing business with a breeder automatically makes you culpable but that it\u2019s a way to support a cause about which you care deeply.Still, it\u2019s worth pointing out that many of the dogs in shelters are purebreds \u2014 some, no doubt, originally from responsible breeders (even though one sign of such a breeder is a willingness to take back a dog from a buyer who wants to return it). So your opposition to shelter dogs may be a prejudice that would yield to a more careful exploration of the facts. Settling that question requires more than ethical expertise. But there is one ethical point here worth noting: Having a preference for one kind of dog (or person) is not morally equivalent to being hostile to all others.The difficult task here, of course, is to explain why his biological father isn\u2019t in his life. It involves admitting that he let you and your son down. Still, you know your son. You\u2019ll have a sense of what information he can handle now. And if you want advice, there are child psychologists and therapists who can help you figure out exactly how to tell him. My ethical advice, though, is that he\u2019s entitled to know these things just as soon as he can absorb them. Which might be today.Kwame Anthony Appiah teaches philosophy at N.Y.U.

{"Headline": "Moshe Yaalon, Israeli Defense Minister, Resigns", "Date": "2016-05-20", "News": "Supported byJERUSALEM \u2014 Israel\u2019s defense minister abruptly announced his resignation on Friday, saying he had lost faith in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and was \u201cfearful for Israel\u2019s future\u201d after his job had apparently been offered to a rival in a far-right party.The minister, Moshe Yaalon, is a senior leader in Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s conservative Likud Party, and quit amid the prime minister\u2019s political maneuvering to broaden his governing coalition, which has only a one-seat majority in Parliament.\u201cThis morning I informed the prime minister that following his management in the latest developments, and in light of my lack of faith in him, I am resigning from the government and the Knesset and taking time out from political life,\u201d Mr. Yaalon wrote, using the Hebrew term for Parliament.In a news conference later, he said: \u201cI viewed all my positions, both when I was in uniform and as a minister, as a mission, and I was unwilling to sacrifice national needs and the security of Israel\u2019s citizens for the sake of political considerations or personal interest.\u201dMr. Netanyahu seemed to confirm the speculation in a statement released on Friday in which he expressed regret over Mr. Yaalon\u2019s departure. Mr. Yaalon \u201cshould have continued being a full partner in leadership of this country, as foreign minister,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said. \u201cThe reshuffle of portfolios did not stem from a lack of confidence between us but rather from the need to broaden the government.\u201dMr. Netanyahu added, \u201cI assume that if Yaalon had not been asked to leave the defense ministry,\u201d the resignation would not have occurred.\u201cThere are political opportunities, particularly due to certain regional developments, which I personally strive towards continuously,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cTherefore I took great efforts to have the Zionist Union join the government. Thus I am leaving the door open in the most serious manner for them to join. Such a move would do only good for the State of Israel.\u201dThe addition of Mr. Lieberman to the government \u2014 which has been widely reported in the Israeli news media but not officially announced \u2014 would further cement the rightist nature of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s coalition.Mr. Yaalon, 65, is at the center-right of the political spectrum, but has served as a bulwark against the most extreme populist sentiments criticizing the military and the Likud coalition, by Mr. Lieberman and others. He said he planned to return someday to political life, including a run for state leadership.\u201cI fought with all my might against phenomena of extremism, violence and racism in Israeli society that threaten its fortitude,\u201d he said, adding that these forces \u201c are trickling into\u201d the military.The contrast in military credentials between Mr. Yaalon and Mr. Lieberman could hardly be more pronounced. Mr. Yaalon, a former chief of staff and career general, led commando units and took part in daring operations. Mr. Lieberman left the military at the rank of corporal. He is known for hard-right positions like demanding the death penalty for Palestinians convicted of terrorism and the toppling of Hamas, the militant group that rules Gaza.Mr. Netanyahu at first took a similar stand, but he later called the soldier\u2019s father, a move that was seen as offering support.\u201cWith great sorrow, senior politicians in the country have chosen incitement and divisiveness of the Israeli society instead of unifying and connecting,\u201d Mr. Yaalon said. \u201cIt is unacceptable to me that we be divided because of cynicism or craving for control, and I expressed more than once my opinion on the matter \u2014 from a position of sincere worry for the future of Israeli society and future generations.\u201dIsraeli Radio said the minister of immigration and absorption, Zeev Elkin, a member of Likud, had called on Mr. Yaalon to reconsider his resignation.Mr. Elkin said that Mr. Yaalon\u2019s place was in Likud and that the prime minster\u2019s moves should not be considered insulting to him.He added that political considerations had forced Mr. Netanyahu to make changes in the coalition government, and that Mr. Yaalon could have remained in another capacity.The minister for social equality, Gila Gamliel, also a Likud member, also expressed regret about Mr. Yaalon\u2019s decision, calling his resignation a huge loss for the party.The resignation caps weeks of confusing negotiations by Mr. Netanyahu, and some analysts noted that Mr. Yaalon has had long-running tensions with the prime minister and could be biding his time to start a new party.\u201cCertainly the other possibility is that he\u2019s had it \u2014 with the intrigues, the backstabbing, the manipulations of politics,\u201d said Gadi Wolfsfeld, a professor of political communications at the Interdisciplinary Center, a private college north of Tel Aviv, who is a frequent critic of Mr. Netanyahu.\u201cIn Israel, we play hardball politics,\u201d Mr. Wolfsfeld said. \u201cOn the other hand, even on the scale of hardball, cynical politics, this was a shocker.\u201dIsabel Kershner contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018The Morning They Came for Us\u2019 Reports on the Hell of Syria", "Date": "2016-05-23", "News": "Supported byBooks of The TimesThe title of Janine di Giovanni\u2019s devastating new book, \u201cThe Morning They Came for Us,\u201d refers to those terrible moments in ordinary Syrians\u2019 lives when the war in their country becomes personal. Those moments when there is a knock on the door and the police or intelligence services take a family member away. Those moments when a government-delivered barrel bomb falls on your home, your school, your hospital, and daily life is forever ruptured.\u201cThe water stops, taps run dry, banks go, and a sniper kills your brother,\u201d she writes. Garbage is everywhere because there are no longer any functioning city services, and entire neighborhoods are turned into fields of rubble. Victorian diseases like polio, typhoid and cholera resurface. Children wear rubber sandals in the winter cold because they do not have shoes. People are forced to do without \u201ctoothpaste, money, vitamins, birth-control pills, X-rays, chemotherapy, insulin, painkillers.\u201dIn \u201cThe Morning They Came for Us,\u201d Ms. di Giovanni gives us a visceral understanding of what it is like to live in wartime Syria, recounting some of the individual stories behind the numbing statistics: students who were whisked away by the police and interrogated and tortured; children who died from common infections because medicine and doctors were unavailable; women who were raped by soldiers at checkpoints and in jail; families who fled besieged cities like Homs, only to return because there was no place else to go.The fact that much of the book\u2019s on-the-ground reporting is confined to the early stages of the war only serves to remind the reader that the horrors she witnessed would escalate in the years to come \u2014 with still no end in sight.Ms. di Giovanni introduces us to a baker named Mohammed, who received messages from the government that he would be kidnapped and killed if he did not stop manning the bread factory that helped feed an opposition-held neighborhood in Aleppo. And to Nada, who brought sandwiches and medical supplies to fellow students on the front lines, and who later helped spread the opposition\u2019s message through Facebook and Twitter. Nada was arrested at her parents\u2019 home and held captive for eight months and three days \u2014 during which she was beaten, whipped and raped, while her jailers told her family that she was dead.Another student, Hussein, had helped organize some of the early peaceful demonstrations that sprang up in Syria, after the Arab Spring protests in Tunisia and Egypt. He was shot, taken captive by pro-Assad forces and savagely beaten and tortured. He tells Ms. di Giovanni that his abdomen was cut, his intestines were pulled out and he was then crudely sewn back up; he survived, he says, only because a pro-regime doctor, who took pity on him, declared him dead and allowed him to escape from the morgue. Ms. di Giovanni quotes a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch, who says, \u201cThe Syrian government is running a virtual archipelago of torture centers scattered around the country.\u201dA longtime reporter who covered the wars in Bosnia, Chechnya and Sierra Leone, Ms. di Giovanni writes here with urgency and anguish \u2014 determined to testify to what she has witnessed because she wants \u201cpeople never to forget.\u201d Her sorrow comes through in the writing \u2014 in the book\u2019s staccato sentences, in its flashbacks to similar scenes of suffering in the Balkans, in its helpless empathy for people she met in Syria, like the ailing woman in a hospital who begged her to take her children away to some place safe.Most of Ms. di Giovanni\u2019s travels in Syria, described in detail here, were in 2012, a year into the conflict. In that spring and early summer, she notes, wealthy elites in Damascus were still in denial about the war \u2014 though explosions from the shelling could be heard during pool parties at the Dama Rose Hotel. By year\u2019s end, the country had slipped down \u201cthe rabbit-hole of war.\u201d The government was targeting civilian neighborhoods, and in the case of Aleppo, \u201copposition forces had cut off nearly all supply routes.\u201d In that city, she writes, there were two criteria for staying alive: \u201chiding from the regime\u2019s barrel bombs, and finding food.\u201dWithin months, Ms. di Giovanni says she saw Syria undergo a metamorphosis \u2014 one that would grow even darker in the years to come. Opposition fighters were becoming radicalized and sectarianism had grown increasingly bitter: \u201cSyrians who called themselves Syrians a few years ago were now saying they were Alawites, Christians, Sunnis, Shias, Druze.\u201d Leaving Aleppo, she writes, she did her best \u201cto take photographs inside my head, pictures that I would remember, that would show a country that no longer existed.\u201d Her testimony is contained here in this searing and necessary book.The Morning They Came for UsDispatches From SyriaBy Janine di Giovanni206 pages.

{"Headline": "The New Strongman of Manila", "Date": "2016-05-11", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorMANILA \u2014 There was no tension on the faces of the police officers guarding City Hall in Pasig City on Monday evening. The mood outside was festive: Working-class Filipinos in sandals, basketball shorts and tank tops were sharing snacks and joking as they watched on a large screen the returns for the national election held earlier that day. Nearby, several police officers sat in the white, plastic monobloc chairs endemic to Filipino bureaucracy, taking it easy.The bloodshed that so often attends political changeovers in the Philippines was happening in other provinces. Somewhere else, gunmen had shot candidates and voters. Somewhere else, a grenade had been thrown at a market. Somewhere else, soldiers had been killed.But in Pasig, a mixed-income city within Metro Manila with more than a half-million residents, a sense of celebration surrounded City Hall. The keepers of tin-roofed shops smiled; the drivers of motorcycle taxis called out to each other. It already seemed clear that the bellicose Rodrigo Duterte, whom the residents of Pasig favored, would become the Philippines\u2019 next president.Most candidates\u2019 campaign posters bore their names or smiling faces, but Mr. Duterte had festooned the entire country with images of fists, his signature symbol. The fist appeared on walls, cars, motorcycles, T-shirts and bare wrists. Depending on your point of view, the fist seemed to promise companionable knuckle bumps, secrets clutched in the palm or the threat of bruises.At one point on Monday evening, I stood by three Philippine National Police officers on the steps of City Hall. One of them, Peterson Y\u00f1igo, had a massive Tavor TAR-21 hanging from his shoulder. \u201cIsraeli,\u201d he said, hefting the weight of his weapon in his hands.I told him I was worried that a Duterte administration would usher in a new dictatorship, undermine civil liberties and even endorse death squads, as Mr. Duterte is said to have done while mayor of Davao City \u2014 all horrors that many Filipinos, including my family, had fled in the 1970s.\u201cShould I be scared?\u201d I asked.Mr. Y\u00f1igo smiled and pulled up a sleeve of his black SWAT uniform. He was wearing a red bracelet that said, \u201cDUTERTE\u201d in all caps.I asked him about the pardon Mr. Duterte said he would grant any law enforcement official who killed criminal suspects. \u201cDrugs are a real problem here,\u201d Mr. Y\u00f1igo said. \u201cThe criminals move in and out. Even in jail they move freely and conduct their business. It\u2019s always the same criminals. We can\u2019t do anything.\u201d The implication seemed clear: Mr. Duterte\u2019s pardon was a welcome idea.On Monday evening, it also looked as though Ferdinand Marcos, Jr., a.k.a. Bongbong, the son of the dictator who terrorized the Philippines in the 1970s and 80s, would win the separate, simultaneous race for the vice presidency. (As of Wednesday afternoon, however, Congresswoman Leni Robredo, an advocate for low-income citizens and women\u2019s rights, was leading Mr. Marcos by a narrow margin.) Mr. Y\u00f1igo is 28 years old, and like many people of his generation who are too young to remember Ferdinand Marcos, Sr., and seem misinformed, he voted for Bongbong.\u201cIf you have a santol tree, it will not produce caimito,\u201d he said, referring to two local fruits. \u201cIf the father was good, the son will also be good.\u201dEarlier that night I had had dinner in a gated community guarded by armed men a few kilometers from City Hall. The house had high ceilings and white floors; a maid served a multicourse Filipino meal and green tea. Alberto Gatmaitan Romulo, the 82-year-old former secretary of foreign affairs under presidents Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and Benigno Aquino III, sat at the head of the table. We were in the home of one of Mr. Romulo\u2019s daughters, and the mood was somber: Both she and a younger brother had lost races of their own, for seats in the House of Representatives and the Senate, respectively.Still, Mr. Romulo said he understood the country\u2019s frustration and shared voters\u2019 hopes. Citizens were angry at the outgoing Aquino administration, Mr. Romulo explained, because it had seemed impervious to their pleas for economic equality.During Mr. Aquino\u2019s six years in power, the poverty rate had remained stubbornly fixed, even as the net worth of the top 40 families in the country had tripled. \u201cThe administration did not invest enough in infrastructure, roads and communications, the things that would make the lives of the people better,\u201d Mr. Romulo added.I asked him the question I would put to Mr. Y\u00f1igo later that night: Should we fear a return to martial law, as under Ferdinand Marcos, Sr., when thousands of political dissenters, student activists, journalists and everyday citizens were killed, tortured or disappeared?Mr. Romulo and his family had had to go into hiding for a time during that period. \u201cI don\u2019t think the bad old days will return,\u201d he said. \u201cI have hope this new president can make some good changes that will really help the people.\u201dUnlike other Duterte supporters, Mr. Romulo wasn\u2019t taken with his crassness \u2014 the upturned middle fingers, the rape jokes, the threat of extrajudicial killings. But he readily discounted it as a populist tactic in the inevitable theater of an election campaign.I\u2019m not so sanguine. And I\u2019m not alone in my unease. On Monday night, some of my friends were making grim jokes about sharing a nightcap before military-style curfews are imposed again. Others were trading tips on Facebook and Twitter about which countries Filipinos can travel to without visas.Elections are human events, but they can feel like natural disasters. In the Philippines elections are like typhoons. They regularly sweep over the country, inevitable and overwhelming. Some alter its routine for a moment. Others scar its landscape and the lives of its citizens forever.Laurel Fantauzzo is an instructor at the Writers\u2019 Center of Yale-NUS College, in Singapore, and the author of the forthcoming \u201cThe First Impulse.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Short-Track Racing, Motorsports\u2019 Riskiest Corner", "Date": "2016-05-21", "News": "Supported byOCALA, Fla. \u2014 Niokoa Johnson was 15, too young for a driver\u2019s license but somehow old enough to race, when she landed a spot in her first auto racing competition.For days, Niokoa practiced on the back roads of Central Florida. On the afternoon of the race, she arrived early to circle the pits of Bubba Raceway Park, a dirt track built among horse fields.On her second practice lap, Niokoa lost control and slammed into a concrete wall, breaking her neck. She was not wearing a head-and-neck restraint, a device required in Nascar but not on most short tracks like this, a lower rung of the racing world.After a day on life support, she died.\u201cIt was the worst day of my life,\u201d said her father, Richard Johnson, who rushed from the stands to pull her from the car. \u201cIf she had the head-and-neck device or something similar, it likely wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201dIn the vast and unregulated world of short-track racing, Niokoa\u2019s death was not an isolated event. Since 2002, when Nascar made head-and-neck restraints mandatory, at least 141 people have died on short tracks, and dozens of others have sustained major injuries, making this the most dangerous corner of American motorsports. Those figures \u2014 based on police reports and news media accounts \u2014 surpass previous estimates and highlight the consequences of lax rules and scant safety protections.Short-track racing, born in rural America in the 1930s, is a catchall phrase that refers to myriad competitions on dirt or asphalt ovals, from mile-long speedways fit for Nascar to smaller tracks that could fit in a yard. The vehicles vary, too, from a windowless school bus to $100,000 cars that can reach 160 miles per hour.The sport now comprises about 900 tracks throughout the country, populated with drivers of varying ages and ambitions. Some hope to ascend to the sport\u2019s higher circuits, while others are hobbyists simply taking their souped-up cars or trucks for an adrenaline-fueled spin.Many short tracks struggle to attract fans and drivers every week, and track owners say they do not have the financial means to enact rigorous safety protocols.\u201cOwners are not pushing safety because people won\u2019t show up,\u201d Richard Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to change unless more tragedy or state mandate happens.\u201dBubba Raceway Park, where Niokoa Johnson died, has no ambulance on site and one paramedic, who is not certified in lifesaving techniques. Other track owners, many of whom face little or no legal liability for a crash, have stopped providing professional safety personnel altogether.At the highest echelon of racing in the United States, Dale Earnhardt\u2019s death in 2001 set off a cascade of safety improvements in Nascar, which has not recorded a death since. But few of those measures have trickled down to short-track racing.Whereas Nascar imposes a battery of safety restrictions \u2014 laying out its rules in a 172-page text \u2014 the safety measures for short tracks amount to a patchwork of lenient rules and mere suggestions. Protocols vary state by state, even track by track.There is no national governing body or overarching league, like Nascar or the N.F.L. Only one state regulates short-track racing, and local officials generally focus more on policing noise and pollution than safety.\u201cWe want to leave it in the private sector\u2019s hand and make it a driver\u2019s decision,\u201d said Earl Arnett, the Marion County commissioner, who represents the area encompassing Bubba Raceway Park.The few safety rules that do exist are routinely ignored. Drivers commonly race without fireproof gloves, fire extinguishers are often not present in cars, and fans stand in restricted areas.Many drivers said they wanted to keep it that way. While Earnhardt\u2019s death prompted a sweeping safety overhaul in Nascar \u2014 and drivers embraced the change by wearing head-and-neck restraints \u2014 most short-track racers resist safety changes.Bubba Clem, the owner of the track where Niokoa died, said he had bolstered safety requirements in the wake of her crash. He also paid for her funeral.Clem, a radio personality known as Bubba the Love Sponge, said he now required minors to wear head-and-neck restraints. Still, he acknowledged that safety standards varied.\u201cMost tracks are pretty good, but some tracks could have better lighting and a better warning system,\u201d Clem said. \u201cAn average track owner on a Saturday night does the best he can.\u201dStill, when deaths occur, the owners face little accountability.Insurance payouts are small, usually between $5,000 and $10,000. And successful lawsuits are rare, because of a single piece of paper that shields owners from liability.Anyone who enters a pit area is required to sign a document protecting the track from legal action. Even when tracks are negligent \u2014 like allowing a fence to collapse or failing to extinguish a fire \u2014 these liability waivers allow the owners to escape accountability, according to court records and copies of the waivers.Most deaths on short tracks receive little or no media attention. One notable exception occurred in 2014 when the Nascar driver Tony Stewart struck and killed a 20-year-old driver, Kevin Ward Jr., in upstate New York. Stewart was cleared of criminal wrongdoing but faces a civil suit from Ward\u2019s family.\u201cTwenty-five percent of tracks get it right; 70 percent take the money and hope you leave alive,\u201d said the former Nascar driver Randy LaJoie, who now manufactures safety equipment.In the one-stoplight town of Bronson, Fla., among rotting palm trees and a mud bog, the dangers of short-track racing were on vivid display during a New Year\u2019s Eve race.Scott McAllister, a first-time racer at Bronson Speedway, did not have a head-and-neck device or a fire extinguisher inside his car, though they are required, according to the track\u2019s rule book. The prerace inspector asked for McAllister\u2019s name and sponsor but did not look inside his car.\u201cThey let the rules slide here,\u201d McAllister said.With fans and drivers at a premium, many tracks like Bronson Speedway throughout the country tend to overlook their own rules.Ann Young, a native New Yorker, bought the Bronson track with her husband as a retirement present after searching \u201crace tracks for sale\u201d on Google. Five years later, she said, she has yet to make a profit.\u201cThe racecar business right now is a dying sport,\u201d Young said. \u201cIt has peaked.\u201dAs a sport set primarily in rural communities, short-track racing has felt the aftereffect of the recession in a painful way. Track owners struggle to attract paying fans and drivers who can afford the racecars.\u201cThe owners need cars, and they need drivers, so they turn a blind eye toward safety to have a show,\u201d said Chris Frost, a 40-year-old driver from Alabama.The Bronson track in Florida was the site of a fatal accident in 2014, when Buddy Howell, a track worker, was hit by a pickup truck in the infield while working as a flagman. Howell was killed during a spectator race, in which fans take their own cars onto the track. Bronson\u2019s infield does not have a fence, and Howell had defied track rules by going into the infield.\u201cThat was because of his judgment and not following safety,\u201d Young said of the fatality.During a recent practice at Bronson, cars reached full speed around the track with no ambulance or safety crews present. Just as racing began, an ambulance pulled into the track but left a few minutes later when a track official fell ill. It never returned.McAllister said he was not worried about the absence of an ambulance. He recently bought a car from a friend and was bullish about his chances that evening. His white Camaro had never raced on asphalt before.After a lackluster race, and hitting the wall, McAllister was all smiles while smoking a cigarette in the pits.\u201cI had a third-place car but a seventh-place driver out there,\u201d he said.There is at least one corner of the short-track racing world that adheres to a strict rule book: a circuit called the World of Outlaws, a group of short-track drivers who tour the country.World of Outlaws drivers are required to wear head-and-neck restraints and must use a racing seat with a halo-shaped headrest that prevents the neck from moving sideways during crashes.There has not been a fatality in a World of Outlaws race since 1999.Tyler Clem competes at the highest level of Florida dirt-track racing. He drives a late-model stock car modified to race on dirt. And just last year, he won the championship at the track where Niokoa Johnson had her fatal accident.Tyler is 13 years old.Tyler, whose father is Bubba Clem, is one of the many young drivers who compete every weekend at short tracks across the country. Some stick to races designed for children, like go-karts and mini racecars, while others race in full-bodied cars alongside middle-age veterans.Bubba Clem is able to fund his son\u2019s racing dream \u2014 and protect his safety \u2014 better than many parents. Tyler races with a head-and-neck restraint, containment seat and firesuit.\u201cHe\u2019d feel naked without his head-and-neck system,\u201d Clem said. \u201cIt would be remiss for anybody to put their kid in a car that didn\u2019t have that. I would scrimp on my motor before safety.\u201dTeenage racers are a microcosm of the short-track racing landscape, an unregulated universe where safety stems from money.Some, like Tyler Clem, are flush with cash, sponsors and safety equipment. Others are just scraping by.\u201cIt\u2019s expensive, but not an opportunity to be a rich little brat,\u201d Clem said.The young racers do not need licenses to compete on short tracks. In some cases, tracks require young racers to submit a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of their driving experience. Others allow anyone with a car to join the race.A few recent deaths raise questions about that approach. In addition to Niokoa, Tyler Morr, 12, was killed in 2012 during a race in Winter Haven, Fla., and Amanda Gambacorto, 21, died in 2014 after hitting the wall during a training session for new drivers in Wall Township, N.J.Jordan Fowler, 13, was a first-time racer at Bronson Speedway in Florida. He had experience on dirt tracks near his Jacksonville home, but his father had to call Bronson to get permission for Jordan to race on asphalt for the first time.\u201cI\u2019m intimidated because everyone is bigger than me, but I realized it was all the same once I got out on the track,\u201d Jordan said.Jordan made the trip to Bronson in a dilapidated Honda Civic. Despite the Civic\u2019s mangled body and Jordan\u2019s lack of experience on asphalt, he finished fifth. He did not wear a head-and-neck device or a containment seat.John Westbrook was not the first driver to flip his car at Williams Grove Speedway in Mechanicsburg, Pa. But he was the one to suffer some of the greatest consequences, becoming a quadriplegic after his sprint car tumbled over the guardrail and down a 16-foot embankment in September 2008.Westbrook sued Williams Grove for negligence, arguing that the track lacked a catch fence that would have prevented his car from flipping out of the racetrack.Six years later, a jury found that Williams Grove was not liable because Westbrook had signed a liability waiver, and Westbrook received no damages.\u201cUnfortunately, if someone is hurt in the future, no matter how negligent the track is, if the release is signed, they are good,\u201d Westbrook said. \u201cIf I was a track owner, I\u2019d be feeling pretty good right now.\u201dWhen anyone enters a pit area at a short track, he or she must sign a liability waiver. This contract protects racetracks from lawsuits, but the agreements go beyond absolving the track for accidents out of their control or honest mistakes.According to multiple waivers reviewed by The New York Times, track owners are released from \u201cany loss, liability, damage or cost they may incur arising out of or related to the undersigned\u2019s injury or death whether caused by the negligence of the releases or otherwise.\u201dThat piece of paper, plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers and safety experts said, enables track owners to resist a safety overhaul.\u201cThere\u2019s zero regulation of tracks \u2014 that\u2019s because of the waivers,\u201d said Westbrook\u2019s lawyer, David Inscho.Insurance companies perform spot checks at racetracks to ensure that fans who are not in the pits have a reasonable expectation of safety. This includes inspecting grandstands and fences.\u201cIf they didn\u2019t have a catch fence, we would deny coverage,\u201d said Tony Huth, a senior accident underwriter at K & K Insurance.Insurance underwriters point out hazards facing fans who don\u2019t sign waivers, like dilapidated bleachers and dirty concession stands, to track owners before issuing policies, but they rarely require head-and-neck devices, according to interviews with track owners and insurance adjusters.\u201cThe insurance company manuals are geared toward spectators,\u201d Inscho said, adding that he did not believe insurers were concerned with the drivers.Most crashes involved drivers, but fans and track workers have died, too. A 12-year-old spectator from Brookland, Ark., died last year when an out-of-control racecar struck him down in the area where cars enter the track. A 49-year-old track worker from Sarasota, Fla., died in 2014 after a skidding pickup truck slammed into him.Ross Curtner, 12, was at a race last fall at Crowley\u2019s Ridge Speedway in Paragould, Ark., when a car on the track lost control and hit him, killing him instantly. He had been standing on top of a wall in the staging area where cars enter the track.Eleven days before the accident, the track owner Trent Francis posted on Facebook saying, \u201cI need to install more fencing to make it safer for spectators, that\u2019s supposed to be the staging area.\u201dThe waiver agreements make no mention of the track\u2019s insurance policy, leaving drivers, crew and fans in the dark about how much the track will pay in the event of an injury or death.Families of drivers who die in short-track accidents receive only a few thousand dollars on average, according to track owners. \u201cMost tracks don\u2019t pay out more than $5,000,\u201d said Young, the Bronson Speedway owner.Drivers who sustain injuries are not fully covered by the track\u2019s insurance.Bobby Arnold, a Georgia driver who had to crawl out of his burning racecar last summer after an accident, didn\u2019t have health insurance. The track paid a lump sum, and Arnold was on his own for the rest of his medical expenses, which totaled around $140,000, he said.\u201cThey covered some of it; I wouldn\u2019t say most,\u201d Arnold said.Some short tracks operate without insurance at all.Thunderdome Speedway in Jasper, Ala., will not open for the 2016 season because its owner, Kenny Hogan, is short on cash. The track has not had insurance for years.Lawyers \u201ccould try to sue me, but what are you going to get out of a guy who is $250,000 in debt?\u201d Hogan said. \u201cI would never sue anybody if I got hurt at a racetrack.\u201dHogan said he made it clear to drivers and spectators that his track was not insured, which does not violate state law. He also posts signs to warn everyone on the premises that they assume their own risk.\u201cWhen you show up to a track and have a damn phone book full of rules, I don\u2019t want to race there,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cWhen you get lawyers and insurance companies involved, you\u2019ll kill racing. Don\u2019t kill each other and use common sense.\u201dRichard Johnson chose not to sue Bubba Raceway Park even though track officials failed to check his daughter\u2019s car before the race, he said. But he believes that it wouldn\u2019t have made a difference because his daughter didn\u2019t have a head-and-neck device.According to a Marion County Sheriff\u2019s report, Niokoa Johnson broke her neck and sustained head injuries while traveling just under 40 miles per hour. Richard Johnson and two other men jumped on the hood of the car to pull the steering wheel and create enough room for Niokoa to be removed by medical personnel.\u201cIt was just a tragic accident; that\u2019s all I can really say,\u201d Bubba Clem said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In College Essays About Money, Echoes of Parents\u2019 Attitudes", "Date": "2016-05-13", "News": "Supported byYour MoneyWe grown-ups often assume that children are oblivious to our money talk, ignorant of our budget woes and uninterested in how adults make financial decisions. Better to protect them from all that for as long as possible, right?The four best college application essays about money that students sent us in 2016.A young woman from an affluent suburb offers a jarring inventory of items for sale at her high school, including Adderall, marijuana and test answers, even as some peers can\u2019t afford the fees for the Advanced Placement tests. Another observes her frugal, immigrant family and how that trait has slowly permeated her own values.A high school senior with only one grandparent who even went to high school comes to terms with the pressure he feels to be the one who breaks the degree-free cycle. And another traces the fine details of her father\u2019s \u2014 and her family\u2019s \u2014 struggle to forge a middle-class life, through her memories of his art and the artifacts they find buried in an arroyo in New Mexico.Each year, I put out an open call for college applicants to send in essays about money, work, social class and related issues that they\u2019ve submitted to undergraduate admissions offices. This year, we received 231 of them and enlisted Ralph Johnson, senior director for college success for the Democracy Prep public schools network and a former admissions officer at Brown University, to help pick the four that we are publishing. We pay the four writers as we would freelancers.In narrowing them down from among the best dozen or so that we received, Mr. Johnson said he put himself back in the mind-set of the gatekeeper role he once held at Brown, when there were so many essays to read that he felt guilty being in a house of worship without a pile of paper in front of him.What he looked for then is the same thing he encourages his students to strive for now. \u201cSome kind of spark,\u201d he said. It needs to be something that isn\u2019t in their transcript or test scores and give admissions officers something to talk about when they\u2019re in the meeting room deciding on that candidate.The single best piece of pure writing we received this year came from Sarah Benson of Lorton, Va., the author of the essay set in New Mexico. \u201cWhen I am 6 years old, the Sunday school teacher asks me what my father does for a living,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI tell her he is an artist like Georgia O\u2019Keeffe. I do not know that I am lying. I do not know that he hasn\u2019t sold a piece in months.\u201dWhen she was small, her father showed her Native American pottery shards in the arroyo near their former home. When they return years later, he tells her that they have all washed away. \u201cSuddenly comes to me the vague image of my father in ripped jeans, pressing a pottery shard into my palm,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI wonder if he, too, has washed far away.\u201d\u201cEvery time I read it, I pulled something different from it,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cIt is a very unconventional story about economic struggle.\u201dWhen Shawn L. Abbott, assistant vice president and dean of admissions in the office of undergraduate admissions at New York University, read the essay that Isabella DeSimone submitted to the university about frugality, he said he worried that it might be too conventional. \u201cShe took a topic that is by all traditional accounting measures pretty banal or pedestrian and really brought her life circumstances to life, talking about something that a lot of us can relate to,\u201d Mr. Abbott said. Ms. DeSimone will go to N.Y.U. in the fall.\u201cWhy buy 99-cent storage containers when the products we buy already provide them for free?\u201d Ms DeSimone wrote. \u201cThese lessons came in Spanish with the speed of a bull in a bullring.\u201d In her family, it was like a game. \u201cThe act of conserving money, the audacity to solve problems no one has thought of before, is what set my family apart,\u201d she wrote.Nowhere in the essay does Ms. DeSimone say where her family falls on the social class spectrum, and after hearing Mr. Johnson\u2019s take on her essay, I chose not to ask. \u201cShe is frugal not necessarily because she\u2019s poor but because that\u2019s part of her value system,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was such a unique take on this type of essay. This is part of a tradition that she holds dear.\u201dMr. Johnson\u2019s favorite essay came from Joseph Liggio, who lives in Suffern, N.Y. When Mr. Liggio starts school at Manhattan College in the fall, he will be the first person in his family to attend college. Mr. Johnson said he always roots for those applicants and counsels many like them in his current job, though Mr. Liggio, who is white, stood out to him in part because he seemed different from many of the first-generation, inner-city, students of color he usually encounters.Mr. Liggio\u2019s essay is also notable for his courage in admitting his confusion about what sort of goals he ought to set. He feels pressure to achieve things that no one in his family ever has, but to what end? \u201cThe thing is, I don\u2019t know where I want to go from here,\u201d he wrote. His grandparents worked where they worked because they had to make money wherever they found opportunity. Had anyone asked them what they actually wanted to do, they would have found the question baffling. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t answer because they had no other options,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI can\u2019t answer because I have too many.\u201dAccording to William Bisset, vice president for enrollment management at Manhattan College, admissions officials can be skeptical of essays that seem too polished or overwritten. \u201cA lot of these essays sound like a Ph.D. student wrote them,\u201d he said. \u201cJoe\u2019s was very genuine. It was well written, but you can tell that a kid wrote it.\u201dHe also had a message for other applicants who are afraid to show weakness or write about their own confusion: Other than the incoming engineers at Manhattan, the most popular expression of academic interest among incoming students is \u201cundecided.\u201d\u201cI prefer to describe Northville as reckless,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe more enterprising students of Northville High School specialize in the selling of three goods: marijuana, Adderall and test answers, all goods many of my peers don\u2019t think twice about using.\u201d If trouble ensues, she added, \u201cour fathers can cover us with cash and connections.\u201dHer essay could have easily read as snobby itself in its anti-snobbery, but she does not spare herself. She blithely inquires after a classmate\u2019s Advanced Placement testing plans without realizing that some people in her school come from families that can\u2019t pay even the reduced fees to take the tests.\u201cI found myself victim to the disease that infiltrates Northville, the same carelessness I despise,\u201d Ms. Meister wrote in the essay, which she submitted to the University of California, Berkeley.Like many former admissions officers, Mr. Johnson has strong memories of seeing piles of essays about what he described as \u201cdesigner service projects,\u201d where teenagers do volunteer work outside the United States, at their parents\u2019 expense, and then return home and appreciate their privilege all the more. \u201cShe stayed close to home and came to a similar realization about herself and the world that she comes from,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought it was striking that she would talk about that.\u201dHer bold approach to the college application process generally seems to have worked out pretty well.

{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Bias Is Built-In, and Bears Watching", "Date": "2016-05-11", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtFacebook is the world\u2019s most influential source of news.That\u2019s true according to every available measure of size \u2014 the billion-plus people who devour its News Feed every day, the cargo ships of profit it keeps raking in, and the tsunami of online traffic it sends to other news sites.Yet few Americans think of Facebook as a powerful media organization, one that can alter events in the real world. When blowhards rant about the mainstream media, they do not usually mean Facebook, the mainstreamiest of all social networks. That\u2019s because Facebook operates under a veneer of empiricism. Many people believe that what you see on Facebook represents some kind of data-mined objective truth unmolested by the subjective attitudes of fair-and-balanced human beings.There is no evidence Facebook is doing anything so alarming now. The danger is nevertheless real. The biggest worry is that Facebook doesn\u2019t seem to recognize its own power, and doesn\u2019t think of itself as a news organization with a well-developed sense of institutional ethics and responsibility, or even a potential for bias. Neither does its audience, which might believe that Facebook is immune to bias because it is run by computers.That myth should die. It\u2019s true that beyond the Trending box, most of the stories Facebook presents to you are selected by its algorithms, but those algorithms are as infused with bias as any other human editorial decision.\u201cAlgorithms equal editors,\u201d said Robyn Caplan, a research analyst at Data & Society, a research group that studies digital communications systems. \u201cWith Facebook, humans are never not involved. Humans are in every step of the process \u2014 in terms of what we\u2019re clicking on, who\u2019s shifting the algorithms behind the scenes, what kind of user testing is being done, and the initial training data provided by humans.\u201dYou could argue that none of this is unusual. Many large media outlets are powerful, somewhat opaque, operated for profit, and controlled by wealthy people who aren\u2019t shy about their policy agendas \u2014 Bloomberg News, The Washington Post, Fox News and The New York Times, to name a few.But there are some reasons to be even more wary of Facebook\u2019s bias. One is institutional. Many mainstream outlets have a rigorous set of rules and norms about what\u2019s acceptable and what\u2019s not in the news business.\u201cThe New York Times contains within it a long history of ethics and the role that media is supposed to be playing in democracies and the public,\u201d Ms. Caplan said. \u201cThese technology companies have not been engaged in that conversation.\u201dThe other reason to be wary of Facebook\u2019s bias has to do with sheer size. Ms. Caplan notes that when studying bias in traditional media, scholars try to make comparisons across different news outlets. To determine if The Times is ignoring a certain story unfairly, look at competitors like The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal. If those outlets are covering a story and The Times isn\u2019t, there could be something amiss about The Times\u2019s news judgment.Such comparative studies are nearly impossible for Facebook. Facebook is personalized, in that what you see on your News Feed is different from what I see on mine, so the only entity in a position to look for systemic bias across all of Facebook is Facebook itself. Even if you could determine the spread of stories across all of Facebook\u2019s readers, what would you compare it to?\u201cFacebook has achieved saturation,\u201d Ms. Caplan said. No other social network is as large, popular, or used in the same way, so there\u2019s really no good rival for comparing Facebook\u2019s algorithmic output in order to look for bias.But could it? Sure. And if it happens, you might never know.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook and the Problem With News Online", "Date": "2016-05-13", "News": "Supported byBitsWould you enjoy reading this more if it were written by a machine? Spoiler alert: It\u2019s not. But whether created by human or computer, what do we want from news?Basically, Facebook said it used a base of computers putting possible stories from various places in front of human editors, who direct how these will be presented and displayed. Facebook said that it had a system of \u201cchecks and balances\u201d that made sure a number of viewpoints were examined, and that it did not allow editors to \u201cdiscriminate against sources of any political origin, period.\u201dIt\u2019s unclear whether the people who think Facebook did wrong will be appeased. All too often, where modern media is concerned, the general public assumes there is bias of one form or another. And Facebook did not seem to have sufficient details about how it made sure a human didn\u2019t carry out a grudge by omitting one story or another.There is a deeper issue at play as well, which has to do with the reasons Facebook is putting up the stories in the first place.Like Google, Facebook makes money by putting up ads concerning things its computers think you are interested in. And like Google, the content (search results or friend\u2019s updates, depending on the company) that goes with the ads is chosen based on previous behavior.There are several reasons for this, including giving you pleasure and not stressing or boring you with dissonance.That is problematic where news is concerned, at least if the reader is seeking an objective viewpoint: Since new information can force us to change our minds, we have to want, on some level, to be stressed if we\u2019re looking to be fully informed. In a slower-moving world, this was known as changing your mind.Is that what people want from news in a click-paced online world, though? The rise and success of specialty news outlets, which largely confirm their readers\u2019 points of view, indicate that many people want to hear about the world, but through filters that affirm how they already feel about things.Arguably, it was ever thus, and the right or the left had their own journals that people read. But the use of computer algorithms that know what you like stand to make it much more so.Facebook may struggle to take news from a lot more points of view, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to put them in front of you.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Lawsuits Over Baby Powder Raise Questions About Cancer Risk", "Date": "2016-05-23", "News": "Deane Berg thought she was going to die, and she wanted to know why. She was 49, way too young, she thought, to have advanced cancer in her ovaries.As she scrolled through websites that listed possible causes of ovarian cancer, one jumped out at her: talcum powder. She did not have risk factors like infertility or endometriosis, but she had dusted baby powder between her legs every day for 30 years.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI went into the bathroom, I grabbed my Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Baby Powder and threw it in the wastebasket,\u00e2\u0080\u009d recalled Ms. Berg, now 59, a physician assistant in Sioux Falls, S.D. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098What else could it be?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009dJohnson & Johnson says its trademark baby powder is safe, and it plans to appeal two multimillion-dollar jury awards, including $55 million in damages awarded to a cancer survivor earlier this month and a $72 million award in February.The International Agency for Research on Cancer in 2006 classified talcum powder as a possible human carcinogen if used in the female genital area. But the agency, part of the World Health Organization, has also said pickled vegetables and coffee are possible carcinogens and that hot dogs cause cancer.Johnson & Johnson says research implicating talcum powder is flawed and points to studies that absolve talc of any cancer risk.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have children ourselves,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Tara Glasgow, the research and development lead for the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s baby products franchise worldwide. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe would never sell a product we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe was safe.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSo did the juries get it right or wrong?

The best we can do, Dr. Tworoger said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis look at the preponderance of the evidence.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThere has never been an experiment to see what happens when you deliberately expose women to talcum powder \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for practical and ethical reasons, there never will be \u00e2\u0080\u0094 so scientists must rely on observational studies that can link an exposure to a disease but cannot determine a cause-and-effect relationship.At least 10 subsequent studies echoed the results, with varying degrees of increased risk. But a small number of studies did not find a heightened risk for talc users.But critics say such studies can get it wrong, because they quiz women about their risk factors after a cancer diagnosis, and people, by nature, have selective memories.\u00e2\u0080\u009cA patient is looking for reasons, and wondering, Why did this happen to me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Larry Copeland, a gynecologic oncologist from Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center and paid expert for Johnson & Johnson. If a researcher asks a patient about talc use, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe answer is going to be \u00e2\u0080\u0098Aha, yeah \u00e2\u0080\u0094 maybe that was it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009dDr. Copeland points to a large government-funded study, the Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Health Initiative. Researchers asked 61,576 women at the beginning of the study whether they had ever used perineal powder (although they did not specify talcum powder) and tracked their health over time. After 12 years, the study investigators found no relationship between powder use and cancer.But that paper has critics, too. Dr. Narod said that the Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Health Initiative cohort was not large enough and did not track women long enough to find differences in ovarian cancer. The findings, he said, do not invalidate the earlier observational research that showed a link between talc and cancer.Why talc use might lead to cancer is not clear. Studies have shown that talc crystals can move up the genitourinary tract into the peritoneal cavity, where the ovaries are. Indeed, a pathology report on Ms. Berg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tumor found talc particles embedded in the tissue.Since the research began showing a link between talc and cancer in the 1990s, federal officials have not acted to remove the powders or add warning labels. The nonprofit Cancer Prevention Coalition petitioned the Food and Drug Administration in 1994 and again in 2008 for talc warning labels. In a 2014 denial letter, the agency said there was \u00e2\u0080\u009cno conclusive evidence\u00e2\u0080\u009d to establish causality, though it is plausible that talc \u00e2\u0080\u009cmay elicit a foreign-body-type reaction and inflammatory response that, in some exposed women, may progress to epithelial cancers.\u00e2\u0080\u009dNevertheless, Johnson & Johnson made plans to \u00e2\u0080\u009cgrow the franchise\u00e2\u0080\u009d by targeting African-American and Hispanic customers, according to internal company documents obtained by the plaintiff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyer, Allen Smith. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNegative publicity from the health community on talc (inhalation, dust, negative doctor endorsement, cancer linkage) continues,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a 1992 memo said.Although Johnson & Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talc supplier added warning labels in 2006, J&J did not add similar warnings to its products, according to litigation documents. Baby powder does carry a warning to keep it out of the reach of children and many pediatricians discourage its use on babies, who can become ill or die after breathing in the particles. Inhalation studies in female rats demonstrated carcinogenicity, according to the National Toxicology Program. Condom and surgical glove makers have stopped dusting their products with talc.\u00e2\u0080\u009cTalcum powder is an interesting case, because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not something that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s necessary,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Anne McTiernan, an epidemiologist with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s any doubt, why should anyone use it?\u00e2\u0080\u009dAs for Ms. Berg \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the Sioux Falls woman with advanced ovarian cancer \u00e2\u0080\u0094 she won her lawsuit against Johnson & Johnson, but the jury did not award damages.

Trump to form a commission on \u00e2\u0080\u009cradical Islam\u00e2\u0080\u009d was \u00e2\u0080\u009ca good step,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and did not rule out the possibility of leading it if Mr. Trump asked him to.In an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said that if he won the presidency, he might consider Mr. Giuliani to lead such a commission, which he said would \u00e2\u0080\u009ctake a very serious look\u00e2\u0080\u009d at Islamic terrorism.At an event in Manhattan kicking off a vintage watch sales venture for one of his former senior advisers, Mr. Giuliani said that the Trump campaign \u00e2\u0080\u009chas to comment on what it wants to do, but I believe that wherever this goes, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know where it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go, this is a good step.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAt the event, Mr. Giuliani begrudgingly gave away a watch he owned that had belonged to the New York Giants shortstop Dick Bartell. Before parting with the watch, he spoke to more than 150 attendees bathed in red and purple light and snacking on edamame dumplings and sushi.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think the idea of studying how we can best deal with radical Islam, and try to figure how to distinguish between all the good people who are Muslims and the bad ones, is a good idea,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\u00c2\u00a0said.He was quick to add, however, that he had taken steps to protect Muslims in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been trying to remind people that on the night of Sept. 11, I said that nobody in New York should take action against anyone who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Arab, because we shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t engage in group blame,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Giuliani said, adding that he had assigned officers to protect Muslims.After making his remarks, Mr. Giuliani meandered his way through the packed event\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attendees, pausing for photographs. Before getting into his car, he was asked for his reaction to the prospect of being chosen by Mr. Trump.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Giuliani said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe says a lot of things, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see what happens.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

A jury sided with Google.Do you understand any of this? I\u2019m guessing no. The upshot for you is, thanks to this win, your phone won\u2019t get superexpensive and will probably still keep getting better. And that\u2019s probably pretty much all you care about.Let\u2019s talk about the big news of the week, or month, in tech and media land: #Thielgate.The story is sort of unbelievable, in and of itself, but also hits a sweet spot within all the crazy things that editors love: tech, billionaires, tech billionaires and, of course, media.The basic argument of those on the tech side was that Gawker was singularly bad. They said that Gawker abused its journalistic platform, it routinely invaded people\u2019s private lives, including outing their sexual orientation, and in other ways made life very difficult for wealthy coastal techies.I\u2019ve certainly not been a fan of everything Gawker has done. But I\u2019m struck by the inability of techies to consider both the proportionality of this punishment and the chilling effects this case could induce on the media generally. First, to me, it doesn\u2019t make sense that a small excerpt from a sex tape should result in a company-ending decision. And I don\u2019t see how techies could support that.All of these examples are potentially far more damaging to the world than a leaked sex tape. But none of these companies were fined anywhere near hundreds of millions of dollars for their recklessness. Do tech venture capitalists really want to support a system in which moving fast and breaking things results in company-ending lawsuits?I\u2019m not sure I quite believe that. But it\u2019s fair to say that Gawker had its day in court \u2014 with a lot of caveats over jurisdiction and judge and jury, Gawker supporters would say \u2014 and that the company lost the case. This should be a deterrent to \u201cbad\u201d journalism.That\u2019s a rosy view, but again, I don\u2019t quite buy it wholesale. Do I agree with every story Gawker chooses to publish?

{"Headline": "\u2018Jane Doe January\u2019 and \u2018I Will Find You\u2019", "Date": "2016-05-24", "News": "Supported byNonfictionLike a common virus, the experience of rape invades not only the body but the mind of its victims, and it can do so in startlingly similar ways. Dissociation kicks in, mercifully and efficiently, almost like a response of the immune system, as well as a twisted, desperate desire on the part of the victim to please the rapist, in the desperate hope of a quicker conclusion, a better chance for survival. And yet, while these reactions appear to be almost universal, their emotional wake is intensely personal, possessing \u2014 at times obsessing \u2014 each individual in a unique way. Consider, for example, these two memoirs, which explore the 20-year aftermath of being raped by a stranger.\u201cJane Doe January,\u201d by the crime novelist Emily Winslow, chronicles in relentless detail the drama of the justice system\u2019s attempt to indict her rapist after matching DNA evidence is finally secured. Her story reveals a stark, maddening \u00adreality: that rape victims must often become their own legal advocates if they want an \u00adopportunity for retribution. In Winslow\u2019s case, this required more than 20 years of persistent inquiry before the scattered legal and forensic components of her 1992 rape coalesced into something the police and prosecutors were able to pursue.During her junior year at Carnegie Mellon University, Winslow was sexually assaulted by a man who followed her into her apartment building. Less than a year later, a man raped another young woman in the same Pittsburgh neighborhood; thus the two victims became Jane Doe January and Jane Doe November. In the decades that followed, Winslow would encounter a revolving door of detectives, reacquainting them with her case, keeping it alive mostly through her own persistence. By pure luck, a friend of the second victim reached an aggressive detective, who was able to match the DNA sample in the women\u2019s evidence kits to a man named Arthur Fryar.Fryar had also been convicted of rape in the 1970s, but it was a 2002 drug conviction that put his DNA into the system. By the time Winslow learns this, she is living in Cambridge, England, now happily married and the mother of two sons. As she assembles a detailed composite of the rapist\u2019s legal profile, she returns again and again to the same official documents. Yet she is wary of researching Fryar\u2019s personal life, content with surface-skimming Google searches and speculation drawn from the Facebook pages of his sister and his supposed girlfriend.Surprisingly, given Winslow\u2019s career writing crime fiction, there\u2019s nothing novelistic about the way this memoir unfolds. The detectives and prosecutors who emerge as significant supporting characters are given scant descriptions. Settings are all but invisible. Instead, the focus is on the finer points of law enforcement procedure, with every excruciating moment of the process painstakingly recounted. While much of this is bureaucratic, even tedious, Winslow attempts to inject drama with explosive bits of dialogue and many short, declarative stand-alone sentences, a device repeated to diminishing effect.Eventually, the judicial bureaucracy begins to seem almost as destructive as the rapist. Winslow must confront issues like extradition, statutory limits and sentencing guidelines. She must endure lab tests and postponements of the legal proceedings. During all this, she must go through the motions of her daily life in England. She fixates on what she should wear at the trial, how tightly she should try to harness her emotions, how she might be judged as a victim: \u201cBeing angry was appropriate. A jury, though, or a more formal judge, is more likely to reward sadness in a victim and disapprove of anger.\u201dWinslow channels her rage into this meticulously constructed and ultimately terrifying memoir. In the end, writing it proves a necessary release since the proceedings hit a roadblock: A Supreme Court decision overrides the Pennsylvania law on extending the statute of limitations, and the rape charges are withdrawn. Arthur Fryar is a free man.In \u201cI Will Find You,\u201d Joanna Connors, a reporter for The Cleveland Plain Dealer with a college-age daughter, embarks on a quest to understand the man who raped her two decades earlier, a crime she had never discussed with her children. Using her journalistic skills, she sets out to investigate the world that produced a man capable of such an act. The result is a searing narrative that plumbs both emotional and political depths.Like Winslow, Joanna Connors is a white woman raped by a black man, but this fact, largely ignored in Winslow\u2019s memoir, becomes a point of serious moral and political inquiry in Connors\u2019s \u201cI Will Find You.\u201d In July 1984, Connors, then a drama critic for The Plain Dealer, walked into an empty theater on the Case Western Reserve campus, late for a 5 o\u2019clock interview. Claiming to be working the lights, a man in the lobby offered to take her inside. Ignoring her internal alarm, Connors followed him, and there the man (who had been released on parole just a week earlier) raped her at knife point. Asked why she went with him, Connors privately, and with great shame, admits to herself, \u201cI could not allow myself to be the white woman who fears black men.\u201d Despite being \u201cthe perfect victim\u201d (white, educated, middle-class, married, with proof of a struggle and an immediate police report) and her perpetrator, David Francis, the perfect assailant (black, poor, with a criminal record), she is subjected to painful scrutiny and degradation before he is finally convicted.Connors\u2019s forthright exploration of race and poverty enlarges her personal story, turning it into a richer, more complex and ultimately more harrowing account of interwoven traumas. David Francis, she discovers, was one of eight children born into a family that one surviving member describes as \u201ccursed.\u201d That\u2019s as apt an explanation as any other: When Connors interviews some of Francis\u2019 siblings and family friends, she confronts a dizzying intersection of addiction, alcoholism, violence, racism, poverty and crime. (Even small children can\u2019t escape: In this extended family not one but two toddlers are killed, one by violence, the other through gross negligence.) What\u2019s miraculous about this memoir is Connors\u2019s ability to identify, in clean, lucid prose, evidence of hope \u2014 and even beauty \u2014 amid such an abundance of misery.In searching for the reasons the man who raped her became such a monster, Connors hoped to find freedom from the PTSD that haunted her for so long. She discovers instead a complicated web of tragedy connecting her family and his, a discovery that deepens her sense of compassion and allows her finally to heal. Winslow hasn\u2019t been granted the luxury of such closure. Her memoir illuminates the many ways in which legal and criminal institutions succeed in deepening the sense of violation, helplessness and anguish felt by the survivors of rape. Together both books serve as powerful evidence of our society\u2019s failure to address the \u00adcauses and consequences of sexual violence.JANE DOE JANUARYMy Twenty-Year Search for Truth and JusticeBy Emily Winslow279 pp. William Morrow/ HarperCollins Publishers. $26.99.I WILL FIND YOUBy Joanna Connors256 pp. Atlantic Monthly Press. $25.Domenica Ruta is the author of a memoir, \u201cWith or Without You.\u201d Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Shooting, the Hospital and Then, Months Later, It\u2019s a Homicide", "Date": "2016-05-07", "News": "Murder in the 4-0Bruce Purdy was shot in the back in the South Bronx last year, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down. He wanted revenge, but instead wound up being added to the 40th Precinct\u2019s 2016 murder tally.Supported byThe gunshot survivor, frozen from the waist down, a .380-caliber bullet lodged between his left kidney and lowermost rib, lay on a hospital bed looking at mug shots of South Bronx gang members.Sgt. Michael J. LoPuzzo asked the man whether he could pick out his shooter.\u201cYep,\u201d Bruce Purdy answered, looking spent. Then he handed back the 8 \u00bd-by-11-inch booklet, with 23 photos.\u201cWho?\u201dMr. Purdy would not say. Soon, he told Sgt. LoPuzzo, the police would hear about a crazy man in a wheelchair shooting the person who had put him there. \u201cThen you\u2019ll know who it was,\u201d Mr. Purdy said.The hospital-bed threat only hinted at Mr. Purdy\u2019s scorn for the system. Raised during a crack plague, he was a child of government institutions \u2014 a half-dozen foster homes, a city jail, six state prison facilities, public housing high-rises \u2014 who, at 29, had landed at yet another: Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center, a red brick monument to both well-honed emergency treatment and overburdened recovery care where most gunshot victims in the South Bronx are taken.Detectives began to make regular trips to Mr. Purdy\u2019s bedside in Room 6C at the hospital after the shooting in October. But he was unswayed: Having been robbed of sex and the use of his legs, he said, all he had to look forward to was getting revenge.Then one night in December, a week after Mr. Purdy had left the hospital against doctors\u2019 orders with little more than a basic wheelchair, he fell short of breath, was picked up by an ambulance and, in the same emergency room that had tended to his gunshot wound, died of a blood clot. A three-month investigation by the New York City medical examiner traced the fatal clot to the shooting, and on March 14, Mr. Purdy\u2019s death was added to this year\u2019s homicide tally for the 40th Precinct, a section of the South Bronx where violence takes diverse paths to death.Mr. Purdy\u2019s murder is perhaps the precinct\u2019s truest mystery this year. The killer remains on the loose, the beneficiary of a lack of cameras outside the public housing building near where Mr. Purdy was shot and a reluctance on the part of his companions and other witnesses to cooperate with the police. He carried his silence to the grave.Beyond the detectives, Mr. Purdy also gave up on Lincoln Medical Center in his last weeks. He resisted physical therapy. He told relatives he had been left to lie for hours in his own excrement. He lit his bedsheets on fire, and cursed and yelled at doctors to send him home.The hospital, in turn, said in medical records that it was unable to do more for Mr. Purdy. Doctors tried for weeks to find a bed at a rehabilitation center \u2014 especially difficult for patients on Medicaid \u2014 only to have him change his mind on the day of his discharge and go home. He told a nurse he planned to kill himself but was never admitted to a psychiatric ward. The records are not clear about whether he went home with a prescription for anti-clotting medicine; his mother said he did not.Saving Mr. Purdy from a bullet in the back was not enough. The poor pockets of the Bronx from which he carved his itinerant life created hurdles that made it hard for a gunshot survivor to stay alive.Mr. Purdy\u2019s long path to death wound through a bathtub in a public-housing project where a brother lifted his limp 181 pounds in and out of the water. Before that, Mr. Purdy lingered for six weeks at Lincoln Medical Center, a well-regarded hospital for trauma care that \u2014 like many institutions across the country \u2014 struggles to care for paraplegics.\u201cThis is just another case where society\u2019s ability to care for people in a multidisciplinary way is not always so perfect, especially in underserved populations,\u201d said Dr. Ronald Simon, the former chief of Lincoln\u2019s trauma division and one of the doctors who oversaw Mr. Purdy\u2019s treatment.While the challenges of his care illuminate broad problems in how the health care system treats the poor and permanently disabled, Dr. Simon and outside medical experts said the hospital appeared to have met the relevant treatment standards and that Mr. Purdy might have unwittingly hastened his death by leaving.He spent much of his last 47 days trying to prove he could return from injury and get justice on his own, without the help of doctors or detectives.Mr. Purdy\u2019s mother, Thelma Johnson, believes her son would still be alive had doctors treated him more thoroughly at discharge. \u201cWhen he left,\u201d she said, \u201cthey didn\u2019t do nothing but give him a wheelchair.\u201dHanging on her wall at a homeless shelter on the Grand Concourse in the Bronx is a red T-shirt she pulled off his body in the emergency room, near a box containing his ashes.\u201cOne day,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m going to get some money and buy an urn for them.\u201dMr. Purdy was shot in a void: a stretch of sidewalk unwatched by the city\u2019s extensive crime-fighting surveillance equipment, outside the reach of cameras, floodlights or gunshot detectors.It was 9 p.m. on Oct. 28, and he had been hanging out in Apartment 3C at 517 East 144th Street, a low-rise building at the Betances Houses, a public-housing project. He was with Yesenia Figueroa, the wife of his best friend, Shamel Robinson. The two had gone to court earlier after Mr. Robinson was arrested in the apartment early that day for having a loaded Hi-Point .45-caliber pistol. (Mr. Robinson told officers he had gotten the gun after an argument at a bodega, according to court papers.)Mr. Purdy stepped outside to get chips and a soda. Ms. Figueroa, who has a history of arrests for prostitution, stayed inside. The apartment \u2014 sparsely decorated, with a curtain marking off one area \u2014 is home to a cast of transients. Mr. Purdy told detectives at one point that Ms. Figueroa was his fianc\u00e9e, though she told a reporter they were only close friends.Steps from the building\u2019s front door, a gunman came up from behind and fired two shots, the second going deep into Mr. Purdy\u2019s back. He fell between two parked cars. \u201cRRN!\u201d the gunman yelled, Mr. Purdy told detectives, referring to a gang that, the police said, reigns in the Betances Houses and was behind a surge in shootings in the 40th Precinct that hit a recent peak of 72 in 2011 amid a feud with gang members from the nearby Moore Houses. Mr. Purdy told his sister Precious Parker that the gunman also screamed, \u201cYou on my block.\u201dMr. Purdy told detectives that he had thought about playing dead, but it was too late. His eyes were still open and twitching when the gunman stood over his body. Then, inexplicably, the gunman uncocked his pistol and walked away.\u201cI\u2019m shot. I\u2019m down, Miss, I\u2019m down. Please,\u201d Mr. Purdy told a 911 operator on his cellphone as he lay there alone.The operator mixed up the street name; Mr. Purdy repeated it. When she asked him several times who shot him, he said he did not know. He grew more desperate as seconds ticked by.\u201cMa\u2019am, ma\u2019am, hurry up, there\u2019s people coming,\u201d he said. \u201cPlease hurry up.\u201dOf the gunman, he said: \u201cThey ran off, I think. I\u2019m afraid.\u201dThere was no blood at the scene; the slug had spared major blood vessels on the way to Mr. Purdy\u2019s spine.At the hospital, Mr. Purdy lurched between being depressed and being sanguine about his recovery, according to medical records his mother received.He had once dreamed of being a doctor and had studied nursing in prison. Now he was a case study in the physical devastation and psychological ripples that result from surviving a shooting.The bullet had shattered two of the strongest vertebrae, in the small of his back, nudging his spinal cord to the right. He lost movement and feeling in his lower half.Roughly one in four trauma cases at Lincoln Medical Center involve penetrating trauma \u2014 gunshots or knife wounds \u2014 compared with about 5 percent at most private hospitals, and so a trauma surgeon is always on duty.Mr. Purdy spent his time in Room 6C learning to shift from his bed to a wheelchair and being taught to insert a catheter to urinate. On Nov. 5, the day he was to have the bullet removed, he declined to be operated on, a decision that may have increased his back pain later.Starting around 2004, the city\u2019s public hospitals undertook a decade-long effort to address what Dr. Robert S. Kurtz, a trauma specialist who helped lead the push, called a \u201cnational problem\u201d of failing to prevent deep vein thrombosis. He said city hospitals had raised their compliance rate above 90 percent.Reeling from his injury, Mr. Purdy clashed with medical staff members, refusing at first to discuss his family situation or mental state. Two days after the shooting he threatened to slide onto the floor unless someone brought him a wheelchair. Doctors said he had adjustment disorder, a response to life-altering trauma.Mr. Purdy\u2019s mother said his cousins took him cigarettes to smoke in bed. Having lost control of his bowel movements, he told relatives that nurses had left him sitting in his own excrement for hours.On Nov. 19 at around 2 p.m., a social worker, Maria Kazaki-Maher, told him that he had not been doing physical therapy sessions. He replied that an attendant had tried to take him to therapy without cleaning the stool he had been lying in for three hours. He recorded his seven-minute conversation with Ms. Kazaki-Maher and a physical therapist, Michael Santoro.Mr. Purdy says of the physical therapy, \u201cHow am I going to go if I\u2019m sitting in\u201d excrement?On the video, Mr. Santoro can be heard telling Mr. Purdy his health has improved and that he can go home, but Mr. Purdy asks how they know. He says he has not seen them in five days.Ms. Kazaki-Maher replies, \u201cYou saw me like four days ago, not counting the weekend.\u201dThey ask Mr. Purdy whether he can think of any other equipment he would need. Mr. Purdy sounds confused. They abruptly end the conversation, making preparations for Mr. Purdy\u2019s discharge, possibly the next day.\u201cThe discussion was scattered, superficial, totally disconnected \u2014 it\u2019s pathetic,\u201d said Dr. Kurtz, former director of service for trauma and surgical critical care at Kings County Hospital Center and one of three doctors who reviewed the video and Mr. Purdy\u2019s medical records at the request of The New York Times. He cautioned that the encounter showed only a snapshot of his care. \u201cIt\u2019s a religion to take care of a spinal cord patient. It\u2019s a massive undertaking.\u201dThe city hospital system said in a statement, \u201cThe video demonstrates that the hospital staff were actively developing a safe and appropriate discharge plan.\u201dMr. Santoro, asked about the video, said: \u201cI gave him the best care I could, we all did. There was no improper care by me.\u201d Ms. Kazaki-Maher, who has since left the hospital, declined to comment through her husband.On Nov. 26, Thanksgiving Day, at 7:34 p.m., with a TV commercial hawking holiday deals playing in the background, Mr. Purdy recorded another video. He lay naked on his bed, with a clump of stool and dirty wipes next to him. Speaking into his cellphone camera, he said he had been waiting 25 minutes for help.\u201cThis is embarrassing, man,\u201d he said, aiming the camera out the open door. \u201cYou got guests, you got all sorts of people just walking by, door open. Look at me, look at me.\u201d He panned the camera to the pile of waste beside him.Paraplegic patients often languish without thorough and affordable care. Sound recovery requires, among other things, buying a special bed for home and teaching a patient\u2019s relatives to give an enema. But doctors say that outside of Veterans Affairs hospitals, treatment often neglects even simple needs.\u201cThe care is fragmented, it\u2019s scattered, it depends on the whim and the will of individuals,\u201d Dr. Kurtz said, adding that there was a \u201ccrying need\u201d for more seamless programs.A patient like Mr. Purdy could have left the hospital after as little as two weeks for a round-the-clock rehabilitation center, Dr. Simon said. But while he estimated that 20 local rehabilitation centers would have taken Mr. Purdy if he had insurance, far fewer would have done so without insurance.\u201cSo he ended up staying at Lincoln for a more prolonged time until they found him a bed,\u201d Dr. Simon said.The city hospital system said there was pressure from the federal government, in the form of financial penalties for delays, to move patients to rehabilitation centers.It did not take long for Mr. Purdy to spiral into desperation.For a time, a health aide watched him around the clock. A psychiatrist followed up the next day to assess his capacity to make decisions.But the limited mental health care documented in the medical records provided to Ms. Johnson surprised some of the doctors interviewed for this article. Ms. Johnson said she had asked twice for her son\u2019s full case file and specifically for his psychiatric records, but doctors who reviewed the documents said they appeared incomplete. The city hospital system said all records had been provided. Mr. Purdy later denied being suicidal.Dr. Simon noted that trauma care was often the first encounter with doctors in many years for young victims of violence in the South Bronx. Mr. Purdy\u2019s mother and sister visited a few times a week, but without a regular family presence, the burden on him only grew.He repeatedly asked to go home, only for doctors to talk him out of it. Lincoln finally secured a bed for him in rehabilitative care at the city\u2019s Metropolitan Hospital Center in East Harlem. An ambulance was arranged to take him at 1 p.m. on Dec. 7.But he changed his mind. Medical notes quote him telling attendants he was going home because someone had lost his belongings.Dr. Simon, who was not involved in Mr. Purdy\u2019s discharge, said he has had patients insist on leaving before, even when he told them they risked dying. \u201cAnd they\u2019re like, \u2018I don\u2019t care,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a sticky situation once you leave against medical advice.\u201dMr. Purdy was told about the risks of blood clots, encouraged to exercise and stop smoking and educated on an injection for blood thinners, records show.But the records do not include a clear list of prescriptions he received at discharge. His family said he did not return home with a blood-thinner prescription or medication.Ms. Parker, Mr. Purdy\u2019s sister, whose public housing apartment doctors noted he was going to, said she was not informed of the risk of blood clots or how to help prevent them.Dr. Michael M. Baden, a former New York City chief medical examiner, said that proper administration of blood thinners would very likely have prevented the fatal clots.His last-minute decision to go home would have made any plan more difficult to enforce. Dr. Kurtz said that he would have prescribed a blood thinner for home use, but that other doctors might reasonably have decided otherwise.He said he understood why someone as distraught and isolated as Mr. Purdy would have left against medical advice.One of the cousins who had been delivering him cigarettes rolled Mr. Purdy out in his wheelchair.Mr. Purdy came home to a family that hardly knew him. His own 5-year-old daughter was in foster care, sent there in 2012 after he fought with the girl\u2019s mother. It was a fate he knew himself.Around 1990, New York City\u2019s child welfare agency took Ms. Johnson\u2019s seven children from her home. Mr. Purdy was 5. His mother was sprinkling crack cocaine on cigarettes \u2014 she liked the smell of the drug mixing with tobacco \u2014 and smoking crack rocks from pipes. It was the tail end of an era when the crack cocaine trade drove violence across the city and left many children in broken homes.That began an institutional odyssey, as Mr. Purdy and his siblings bounced through five foster homes across the city together, rebelling at every turn and sometimes running away, Ms. Parker said. The most difficult siblings, Mr. Purdy among them, were separated and scattered across Long Island and the city. He landed in a Brooklyn home and at age 13, he joined the Shotgun Gangsta Crips, a local affiliate of the national Crips gang, he told a detective during a 2010 arrest.\u201cHe looked at it like his family,\u201d said Mr. Robinson, his friend, who also grew up in foster care. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have his real family.\u201dAround age 14, the two of them landed at an alternative school in Yonkers, where they bunked next to each other.Mr. Purdy told Mr. Robinson that he wanted to pursue a music career, and maybe become a doctor. They finished school, Mr. Robinson said, before moving into a group home in the northern Bronx that helped them look for jobs and took them to Six Flags and Disney World.But Mr. Purdy had inherited some of his parents\u2019 drug habits, first smoking a joint around 15, Ms. Johnson said.\u201cThat\u2019s what we do,\u201d said Ms. Johnson, who started smoking marijuana at 9. \u201cThat\u2019s just what we do.\u201dMs. Johnson recalled telling mourners at her son\u2019s funeral that he had tested her patience as a boy, running in from the street and sticking his hands in pots for an early taste.\u201cThat was me and his biggest problem,\u201d she said.But he grew more bitter in later years. He would sometimes meet his mother on the streets after running away from foster homes. As they parted, he would call out, just loud enough to hear, \u201cCrackhead.\u201d\u201cI thought I was paranoid, that I was just hearing things,\u201d Ms. Johnson said. \u201cBut that\u2019s how he really felt about me.\u201dShe trailed off, clapping her hands, upset at the memory.Twenty-three people told the police they heard gunfire from Mr. Purdy\u2019s shooting. But none reported seeing anything, using some version of a mantra that has wearied generations of Bronx detectives: \u201cHeard shots, saw nothing.\u201dDetectives combed Mr. Purdy\u2019s arrest record. (Over the years, he had used four different names \u2014 Mike Johnson, Bruce Cobb, Bruce Cobbs and his real name.) Many of his 23 arrests were for petty crimes, but some were for selling drugs, suggesting the possible role of narcotics or gangs in the shooting.His most serious crime came in 2009, when he choked a man from behind as two friends beat him and stole a cellphone and wallet. He pleaded guilty to second-degree attempted robbery in 2011, after having served nearly 20 months at Rikers Island. He was in and out of state prison on parole violations until December 2014.He foretold his problems in a Facebook post the next year: \u201cWhen I married the streets,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI knew she made your heart cold and would eventually take everything from you.\u201dBut the Shotgun Gangsta Crips, Mr. Purdy\u2019s gang, was not known to be in conflict with gangs in the Betances Houses. He had little history in the South Bronx; many of his arrests were farther north, near his old group home.Mr. Purdy told relatives he believed the gunman had walked away while he was still alive because the man had mistaken him for someone else. A young man was arrested in a shooting using a .380-caliber gun at the same housing complex in April, and he said in an interrogation that the word on the street was that Mr. Purdy\u2019s shooting was a case of mistaken identity.Without video footage, Detective Richard Simplicio said he made at least four visits to Mr. Purdy\u2019s bedside, trying to get him to say what he knew. On one occasion Mr. Purdy commented on Detective Simplicio\u2019s leopard-print-accented Nike Dunks, leading to a conversation between sneaker buffs.\u201cHe felt comfortable,\u201d the detective said. \u201cUnfortunately not comfortable enough to assist in the shooting.\u201dDetective Simplicio said he sympathized. \u201cAt the end of the day, too, we\u2019re not with them 24 hours a day,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019re not there for the most part to help them out.\u201dMs. Figueroa, his friend, rebuffed detectives twice. She and her husband, Mr. Robinson, had their own criminal cases, with Ms. Figueroa toting her baby in a carrier to an April court appearance for Mr. Robinson. He said he was in jail when he learned that his friend had died.Investigators believe Mr. Purdy told people close to him before he died that the man who had shot him was someone he had seen before.Detective Simplicio said, \u201cObviously I didn\u2019t think he was going to, you know, die, after he got cut loose from the hospital.\u201dThey are linked only by the creeping pace of death\u2019s arrival, and the stalled investigations that can follow.Of the seven reclassified homicides logged by the police so far this year, five remain unsolved, a Police Department spokesman said, a reflection of how cases become harder to close as time goes on. There were 16 over all last year.\u201cOf course a delay presents another challenge, but it\u2019s not the only challenge,\u201d said Dermot F. Shea, the department\u2019s deputy commissioner in charge of crime analysis, stressing that detectives are trying just as hard to uncover clues while a victim is alive.In Mr. Purdy\u2019s case, the crime scene unit that handles homicide scenes did not respond, leaving the work to an evidence collection team that conducts less rigorous ballistics tests and takes less detailed measurements. There was scant progress in the case between his death in December and the medical examiner\u2019s homicide ruling in March.Only in recent weeks have detectives begun gathering better leads.No matter how quickly a victim\u2019s relatives or law enforcement officials want an answer on the cause of death, the city\u2019s 30 medical examiners are bound to trace a corpse\u2019s clues to the start of the chain.\u201cThe No. 1 thing in every case is the body itself,\u201d said the chief medical examiner, Dr. Barbara Sampson. \u201cAnd the body never lies.\u201dMr. Purdy\u2019s autopsy was completed the day he died, and an examiner would have found the fatal blood clots in his lungs immediately. But the delay in ruling the case a homicide appears to have stemmed from toxicology tests, which can reveal contributing causes and take weeks or months to be completed.Soon after, the medical examiner\u2019s office cautioned Sergeant LoPuzzo, the commander of the 40th Precinct detective squad, that drugs like K2 could have raised Mr. Purdy\u2019s body temperature and caused the release of the blood clots.But his death certificate ultimately linked them to the gunshot wound and resulting paralysis, not to any drugs. The blood clots pooled in his legs, migrated toward his heart and threw off fatal clots to both lobes of his lungs.Back at his sister\u2019s apartment, Mr. Purdy\u2019s nieces and nephews jumped into his thick, tattooed arms, competing for attention.They asked why he was in a wheelchair. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018Because I done something really stupid,\u2019\u201d his mother, Ms. Johnson, recalled. He kept to himself what he meant.He took trips outside in his wheelchair for a smoke or fresh air. He fitfully discovered life outside the hospital as a paraplegic. He dwelled on the numbness in his penis, expressing anxiety about never again being able to have sex or children.\u201cI\u2019m never going to feel this again?\u201d he would say, Ms. Johnson recalled. \u201cIt was funny to me, but he was really serious.\u201dAs a salve for his fears, his aunt tickled him below the waist. \u201cAnd he felt that,\u201d Ms. Johnson said.At the end of each day his younger brother Randy Parker, an Army veteran of Kuwait and Afghanistan, scrubbed him down in the bath. Mr. Purdy often hugged him and told him he loved him, and grieved his wilting body.Mr. Parker recalled him saying, \u201c\u2018I never thought that I would see the day that my baby brother would have to pick me up and do this, you know, wipe my ass and change my Pampers and stuff like that.\u2019\u201d\u201cHe would sit there and he would cry,\u201d Mr. Parker added.On the night of Dec. 13, Ms. Parker ordered a pizza. Mr. Purdy and some siblings were playing cards at a table in a cramped kitchen of her sixth-floor apartment. He gasped for air.\u201cAt first I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s a joke,\u201d Ms. Parker said. \u201cHe said he was tired.\u201dMr. Purdy had been sleeping on a couch in the living room, and Mr. Parker wheeled him there to rest. It was the first time he had lost his breath since coming home.\u201cNext thing you know, he\u2019s like, \u2018I can\u2019t breathe, I can\u2019t breathe,\u2019\u201d Ms. Parker said.An ambulance rushed him to Lincoln Medical Center, where emergency medical workers took him in just as his mother arrived.His heart was racing, its rate in the 130s. He had high blood pressure. Nurses tried pulling his clothes off, but it hurt his back.\u201cSo I was like, \u2018O.K., I got this, let me do this,\u2019\u201d his mother said. Her son threw up his arms, and she pulled off his shirt.Seconds later his eyes rolled back and his body started shaking. Nurses tried to tie him to the gurney to draw blood, but he went unconscious. He \u201cbegan having pseudo-seizure-like activity where he would gesticulate and make grunting noises,\u201d medical notes say. Doctors pulled him away.He was put on a ventilator at 12:43 a.m. A half-hour later, he had no pulse. For 26 minutes, doctors tried to resuscitate him. At 1:41 a.m. on Dec. 14, he was pronounced dead by Dr. Allysia Guy.They wrote in medical records that his death appeared connected to an unknown drug, though they acknowledged not understanding the true cause.The next day at 10 a.m., Mr. Purdy had been scheduled to have his first doctor\u2019s appointment since his discharge from Lincoln. It was the day before what would have been his 30th birthday. One of the last things doctors had told him was how important that appointment was.Reporting was contributed by Sheri Fink, Noah Remnick, Nate Schweber and Ashley Southall, and research by Susan C.

{"Headline": "A Traveler\u2019s Guide to Taking a Smartphone Abroad", "Date": "2016-05-25", "News": "Supported byTech FixThe summer travel season will soon be upon us, with notions of escape, unplugging and faraway lands.But while the idea of disconnecting from technology when abroad seems relaxing, the stress of visiting a foreign country without a smartphone connection can quickly counteract the benefits of a digital detox. After landing in an unfamiliar place, you may realize that an inability to look up mobile maps or places to eat on a phone can be crippling. Relying on a printed tourist guide may feel primitive and immediately inform muggers that you are holding lots of cash.So what to do? There are two ways to take your cellphone abroad and get data \u2014 the frugal way and the pay-full-price way. The inexpensive method involves some tinkering and planning ahead, while the full-price way is easy but requires paying even more money to your carrier.First, the full-price option. For many years, American wireless customers have been able to pay extra to their carrier for international roaming, or the ability to seamlessly use a foreign network. Among other options, AT&T sells an international package with a modest amount of data (800 megabytes, enough to last about a week) for $120, and Verizon Wireless charges $10 a day for roaming in many countries. And in recent years, T-Mobile USA and Sprint began offering free international roaming, but with a caveat: The data speeds are very slow.Toni Toikka, chief executive of Alekstra, a research firm that analyzes cellphone bills, said he finally caved in to paying AT&T an extra $120 whenever he traveled abroad after growing tired of juggling multiple cellphones and SIM cards when in Europe and New York.\u201cAfter all the frustration, they finally got me,\u201d Mr. Toikka said. Paying AT&T or Verizon some extra money is the most convenient option for taking a smartphone abroad, he said.For frugal travelers, there are some smart alternatives if they are willing to do a bit of homework.To get a good deal, bring an \u201cunlocked\u201d smartphone, which is a phone not restricted to use with one carrier, into a foreign carrier\u2019s store, buy a data package and insert its SIM card into the phone. (In wireless industry jargon, these are called prepaid international SIM cards.) Even better, some overseas carriers let you order a SIM card ahead of time so you can get it before your trip or have it delivered to your hotel.Here is a guide to taking your smartphone abroad on the cheap, including analyses by Alekstra on the costs of mobile services in five popular travel destinations: China, Japan, Britain, France and Spain.First and foremost, to use a foreign carrier\u2019s SIM card, you usually have to unlock your smartphone or buy a cheap unlocked phone. Typically, when you buy a new smartphone, it comes locked so you can use it with only one carrier. After you have fully paid off the phone, you can ask the carrier unlock it.If you get a foreign SIM card, you will be using a different phone number from your regular one. To simplify taking a smartphone abroad, we recommend ignoring traditional phone and texting services and relying on free communication services that rely purely on data connections.Apple iPhones include iMessage and FaceTime, services for sending messages and placing calls over a data connection. If someone wants to contact you, tell them to use one of those services.Once you have freed your smartphone of carrier restrictions and downloaded a messaging app, it\u2019s time to find a service package for wherever you are traveling. Mr. Toikka recommends buying service from well-known carriers in each country because they are more reliable than off-brand carriers.For China, the big carriers are China Mobile and China Unicom. Both carriers sell a package in their stores that includes one gigabyte of data for $20.40 \u2014 enough for a two-week trip.For a longer visit, you might consider the two-gigabyte package offered by both carriers for $24.90.In Japan, Mr. Toikka recommended considering the carrier eConnect. It sells a one-gigabyte package that can be used for 15 days for $25.95. For a longer visit, it offers a three-gigabyte package for $40.64 that is valid for 30 days.In Spain, Vodafone offers three cheap options in its stores. Its one-gigabyte package costs $11.20, the 1.5 gigabyte option costs $16.80, and the two-gigabyte option costs $22.40. Each of the packages works for 30 days. We would recommend the one-gigabyte option for a one-week trip, the 1.5-gigabyte package for a two- to three-week trip and the two-gigabyte option for a four-week visit.In Britain, the carrier EE offers a handful of options in its stores, including a two-gigabyte package for $21.75 and a four-gigabyte package for $36.25. Both plans are valid for 30 days.We recommend foreign SIM cards with a few caveats. If you are traveling to multiple countries \u2014 among Britain, France and Spain, for example \u2014 you will need a separate SIM card for each country, and the costs will add up quickly. In that situation, contacting AT&T and Verizon to set up international roaming or tolerating T-Mobile and Sprint\u2019s slow data speeds may be better than the extra trouble of juggling multiple SIMs.Otherwise, you can save a lot of money and get a lot more high-speed data by planning ahead and buying a foreign SIM card.Because of an editing error, an article on the Personal Tech pages on Thursday about traveling abroad with a smartphone misstated the recommended data option for visitors to Spain. It is one gigabyte for one week and 1.5 gigabytes for a two- to three-week trip, not 1.5 gigabytes for a one-week visit and two gigabytes for a two- to three-week visit.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Asian-American Actors Are Fighting for Visibility. They Will Not Be Ignored.", "Date": "2016-05-25", "News": "Supported byWhen Constance Wu landed the part of Jessica Huang, the Chinese-American matriarch on the ABC sitcom \u201cFresh Off the Boat,\u201d she didn\u2019t realize just how significant the role would turn out to be. As she developed her part, Ms. Wu heard the same dismal fact repeated over and over again: It had been 20 years since a show featuring a predominantly Asian-American cast had aired on television. ABC\u2019s previous offering, the 1994 Margaret Cho vehicle \u201cAll-American Girl,\u201d was canceled after one season.\u201cI wasn\u2019t really conscious of it until I booked the role,\u201d Ms. Wu said. \u201cI was focused on the task at hand, which was paying my rent.\u201dThe show, which was just renewed for a third season, has granted Ms. Wu a steady job and a new perspective. \u201cIt changed me,\u201d Ms. Wu said. After doing a lot of research, she shifted her focus \u201cfrom self-interest to Asian-American interests.\u201dThe statistics are unequivocal: Women and minorities are vastly underrepresented in front of and behind the camera. Here, 27 industry players reveal the stories behind the numbers.In the past year, Ms. Wu and a number of other Asian-American actors have emerged as fierce advocates for their own visibility \u2014 and frank critics of their industry. The issue has crystallized in a word \u2014 \u201cwhitewashing\u201d \u2014 that calls out Hollywood for taking Asian roles and stories and filling them with white actors.It\u2019s never been easy for an Asian-American actor to get work in Hollywood, let alone take a stand against the people who run the place. But the recent expansion of Asian-American roles on television has paradoxically ushered in a new generation of actors with just enough star power and job security to speak more freely about Hollywood\u2019s larger failures.And their heightened profile, along with an imaginative, on-the-ground social media army, has managed to push the issue of Asian-American representation \u2014 long relegated to the back burner \u2014 into the current heated debate about Hollywood\u2019s monotone vision of the world.\u201cThe harsh reality of being an actor is that it\u2019s hard to make a living, and that puts actors of color in a very difficult position,\u201d said Daniel Dae Kim, who stars in \u201cHawaii Five-0\u201d on CBS and is currently appearing in \u201cThe King and I\u201d on Broadway.Other actors lending their voices include Kumail Nanjiani of \u201cSilicon Valley,\u201d Ming-Na Wen of \u201cAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\u201d and Aziz Ansari, who in his show, \u201cMaster of None,\u201d plays an Indian-American actor trying to make his mark.They join longtime actors and activists like BD Wong of \u201cGotham\u201d; Margaret Cho, who has taken her tart comedic commentary to Twitter; and George Takei, who has leveraged his \u201cStar Trek\u201d fame into a social media juggernaut.\u201cThere\u2019s an age-old stereotypical notion that Asian-American people don\u2019t speak up,\u201d Mr. Wong said. But \u201cwe\u2019re really getting into people\u2019s faces about it.\u201dThis past year has proved to be a particularly fraught period for Asian-American representation in movies. Last May, Sony released \u201cAloha,\u201d a film set in Hawaii that was packed with white actors, including the green-eyed, blond-haired Emma Stone as a quarter-Chinese, quarter-Native Hawaiian fighter pilot named Allison Ng.In September, it was revealed that in the planned adaptation of the Japanese manga series Death Note, the hero, a boy with dark powers named Light Yagami, would be renamed simply Light and played by the white actor Nat Wolff. In \u201cThe Martian,\u201d released in October, the white actress Mackenzie Davis stepped into the role of the NASA employee Mindy Park, who was conceived in the novel as Korean-American.And in the live-action American film adaptation of the manga series Ghost in the Shell, scheduled for next year, the lead character, Major Motoko Kusanagi, will be called Major and played by Scarlett Johansson in a black bob.Studios say that their films are diverse. \u201cLike other Marvel films, several characters in \u2018Doctor Strange\u2019 are significant departures from the source material, not limited by race, gender or ethnicity,\u201d the Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige said in a statement. Ms. Swinton will play a character that was originally male, and Chiwetel Ejiofor a character that was originally white. Paramount and DreamWorks, the studios behind \u201cGhost in the Shell,\u201d said that the film reflects \u201ca diverse array of cultures and countries.\u201dBut many Asian-American actors aren\u2019t convinced. \u201cIt\u2019s all so plainly outlandish,\u201d Mr. Takei said. \u201cIt\u2019s getting to the point where it\u2019s almost laughable.\u201dThe Academy Awards telecast in February added insult to injury. The show dwelled on the diversity complaints aired through #OscarsSoWhite, yet blithely mocked Asian-Americans with punch lines that banked on Asian stereotypes. The host, Chris Rock, brought three Asian-American children onstage to serve as a sight gag in a joke made at their expense.\u201cI have never seen the Asian-American community get so organized so quickly,\u201d said Janet Yang, a producer who serves as a liaison between Hollywood and Chinese studios. She added, \u201cIt was the final straw.\u201dOnline, even more Asian-American actors and activists have spoken out with raw, unapologetic anger.Meanwhile, television shows \u2014 competing for fresh content and audiences as the number of scripted series has increased dramatically in recent years \u2014 have helped expand the boundaries of what was once thought possible. Asian-Americans increasingly play leads and love interests and star in multiple family sitcoms.Following \u201cFresh Off the Boat,\u201d ABC debuted the sitcom \u201cDr. Ken,\u201d featuring an Asian-American family led by the show\u2019s creator, Ken Jeong, plus the drama \u201cQuantico\u201d starring the Bollywood actress Priyanka Chopra. On CW\u2019s \u201cCrazy Ex-Girlfriend,\u201d Rachel Bloom, as the title character, pines after the hunky Vincent Rodriguez III, who is Filipino-American. They join such mold-breakers as Mindy Kaling, creator and star of \u201cThe Mindy Project,\u201d and Lucy Liu, who plays a reimagined Dr. Watson in \u201cElementary.\u201dThese shows help, but the issue is pervasive, including on TV. \u201cThe mainstream Hollywood thinking still seems to be that movies and stories about straight white people are universal, and that anyone else is more niche,\u201d Mr. Ansari wrote in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s just not true. I\u2019ve been watching characters with middle-age white-guy problems since I was a small Indian boy.\u201dIn films, a few roles have transcended stereotypes: Mr. Takei in the first \u201cStar Trek\u201d installments, Ms. Liu in the \u201cCharlie\u2019s Angels\u201d features, and John Cho and Kal Penn in the stoner hit \u201cHarold & Kumar Go to White Castle\u201d and its sequels. And more are in development: a film adaptation of Kevin Kwan\u2019s novel \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d is underway, and the Vietnamese-American actress Kelly Marie Tran will play a major role in the next \u201cStar Wars\u201d installment.But mostly, Asian-Americans are invisible. Though they make up 5.4 percent of the United States population, more than half of film, television and streaming properties feature zero named or speaking Asian characters, a February report from the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism at the University of Southern California found. Only 1.4 percent of lead characters in a sample of studio films released in 2014 were Asian.For Asian-American actors, the dearth of opportunities compounds itself. \u201cAn Asian person who is competing against white people, for an audience of white people, has to train for that opportunity like it\u2019s the Olympics,\u201d Ms. Wu said. \u201cAn incredibly talented Asian actor might be considered for a leading role maybe once or twice in a lifetime. That\u2019s a highly pressured situation.\u201dSo some are stepping behind the camera. In addition to actors creating their own shows, like Ms. Kaling, Mr. Jeong and Mr. Ansari, Mr. Kim of \u201cHawaii Five-0\u201d has started his own production company, 3AD, \u201cto help tell the stories of the underrepresented,\u201d he said. Asian-American and other minority actors, he added, are \u201ctired of waiting to be hired for the roles Hollywood creates for us.\u201dAudiences, too, are catching up. \u201cThere was a time when this conversation was completely foreign to people,\u201d Mr. Wong said. Now young participants \u201care already fully versed in the issues and able to discuss them with great passion.\u201dEllen Oh, a writer for young adults who devised the #whitewashedOUT hashtag, credited a generational shift. \u201cFor a long time, Asians have been defined by the immigrant experience, but now second- and third-generation Asian-Americans are finding their own voices,\u201d Ms. Oh said.They\u2019re also employing a new vocabulary. \u201cThe term \u2018whitewashing\u2019 is new, and it\u2019s extremely useful,\u201d Mr. Wong said. In contrast to \u201cyellowface,\u201d which protested the practice of white actors using makeup and prosthetics to play Asians, \u201cwhitewashing\u201d gives voice to the near-absence of prominent roles.Whether that translates into change onscreen is an open question. \u201cEveryone seems to be becoming slowly aware of how overwhelmingly white everything is,\u201d Mr. Ansari said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like the whole system is slowly being shamed into diversity, but it\u2019s moving at a snail\u2019s pace.\u201d He added: \u201cJust look at the movie posters you see. It\u2019s all white people.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Their success hinges on a deceptively simple trick: Do something slightly outr\u00e9, add uncontrollable laughter and post.But humor is the feeling most likely to set others off. \u201cWhen someone else laughs, we\u2019re a lot more likely to laugh,\u201d Mr. Warren said.But what the laugher is laughing at also matters. The uncontrollable giggles are prompted by events that feel slightly inappropriate. The laugh provides an emotional release from the tension.\u201cLaughter is a signal,\u201d Mr. Warren said. Yes, a transgression has occurred, but the laugh \u201cmeans that something that feels potentially threatening, off-putting or socially awkward is actually nothing to worry about.\u201dThe \u201cDamn Daniel\u201d video is funny because a high school student who surprises a classmate, camera in hand, might well be playing a nasty trick, but in this case, he has come only to deliver a compliment. In the case of the Chewbacca video, the social transgression is extremely minor: \u201cThis grown woman is using a mask that\u2019s supposed to be for kids,\u201d Mr. Warren said. But when we see the pure, childlike joy it produces in Ms. Payne, a stay-at-home mother from Grand Prairie, Tex., the event feels gloriously silly instead of pathetic.And because she\u2019s filming herself in close-up, her emotions are front and center \u2014 even once she puts on the mask, you can see her eyes glistening in delight. \u201cSympathetic viewers will involuntarily mimic her facial expressions, leading to emotional contagion,\u201d Mr. Plantinga said. The use of Facebook Live \u2014 which streams live video instantly, with no opportunity to edit or scratch a take \u2014 only draws the viewer in closer.In highly intimate settings, viewers don\u2019t want to see a transgression too big \u2014 that would be frightening, not funny, Mr. Warren said. The inherent intimacy of viral social videos helps explain why they often hinge on events so idiosyncratic and slight that their humor almost defies explanation.There\u2019s one more thing that might have helped Ms. Payne\u2019s video become an instant online classic. Facebook Live is a new product that the company is aggressively promoting. The video features an unofficial tie-in toy for the \u201cStar Wars\u201d franchise. And Ms. Payne mentions Kohl\u2019s, the store where she bought the mask. These corporate properties could not have produced a viral video as intimate and infectious as Ms. Payne\u2019s (and a Kohl\u2019s spokeswoman said the company had no involvement in the video\u2019s creation), but they have all been grateful for her inadvertent endorsements, and they have helped boost the video\u2019s profile after it aired.Corporations will do anything for a laugh.Advertisement"}

Donald J. Trump also won in the state, as well as in Nebraska, although his two remaining rivals left the race last week. Mrs. Clinton won West Virginia over Mr. Obama in 2008. And Mr. Obama received a primary challenge there in 2012 from a Texas felon who won some counties there. The politics of the state have been hard to cleave away from racial lines.But Mrs. Clinton struggled in the state, not just because of her alliance with Mr. Obama, but also because of her missteps in discussing the coal industry. A comment, lifted out of context but clunky nonetheless, about the coal industry and people being put out of business followed her there, and she faced protests from coal workers during campaign stops.Primaries are not necessarily bellwethers for how candidates will fare in a general election. But Mrs. Clinton will have work to do with white working-class voters in the fall in battlegrounds like Pennsylvania. And so Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s candidacy continues, a fact that has exasperated some of Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supporters, particularly as Mr. Trump has sewn up his race weeks before people expected him to.

{"Headline": "Who You Calling Cheerleader?", "Date": "2016-05-20", "News": "Stunt is an athletics and technique-focused sport that is not yet recognized by New York state or the N.C.A.A. Meet New York City\u00e2\u0080\u0099s defending high school champions from Staten Island.Think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re too busy to work out? We have the workout for you.One recent Saturday on Staten Island, Brooke Winkler surveyed the pack of teenage girls before her with an expression of barely suppressed fury. Just 20 minutes before the start of its game against Morrisania Educational Campus, from the Bronx, the Susan E. Wagner High School stunt team was fumbling its way through practice. The girls\u00e2\u0080\u0099 landings teetered, their timing lagged and one flier couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to maintain her balance. And then there was the matter of congeniality.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI need you all to smile!\u00e2\u0080\u009d barked Ms. Winkler, 27, a team coach and a math teacher at Wagner. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou look like you want to die out there!\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe girls had every reason to smile. The Wagner Falcons of Staten Island are the reigning city champions of stunt, an increasingly popular variant of cheerleading that focuses on its technical and athletic components. Introduced by the Public Schools Athletic League in 2014, stunt is less rah-rah and more basket tosses.With a 9-1 record this season, the Falcons are tied for second place heading into the playoffs in early June, where seven other teams will compete for the title. Yet even as the Falcons perfect their form with daily two-hour practices and a pair of games each weekend, their most trying contest revolves around legitimacy.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen we walk through the hallways, people always tease us that stunt isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a real sport,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Crystal Knapp, 16, a sophomore on the team. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut look at us \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re athletes. We work hard.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAlthough stunt has yet to receive the same status, a committee met last month to evaluate its potential for the 2017-18 season, said Todd Nelson, assistant director of the New York State Public High School Athletic Association. And when the stunt program began in New York City two years ago, it gained more traction.The program has grown to approximately 470 participants playing on 33 teams, from 120 participants in 2014, said Donald Douglas, the Public Schools Athletic League\u00e2\u0080\u0099s executive director.Stunt competitions unfold with no less seriousness than high school basketball games. Teams perform identical predetermined routines, \u00e2\u0080\u009cso you can see who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more perfect,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Winkler said. The arrangement is meant to enable more objective scoring, but it carries the daunting consequence of exposing any minute flaw.Wagner was forced to confront a blemish of its own in the opening routine of its game against Morrisania, when one girl stumbled out of the wobbling arms of a teammate. It proved to be Wagner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only blunder. For the rest of the game, their tosses were precise, their tumbling synchronized and their pyramids as exquisitely constructed as any in the sands of Giza. Even as their eyes betrayed their nerves, the girls kept grins plastered across their faces.The playlist for the contest was a collection of mostly retro techno music selected for its adherence to the sport\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eight-count rhythm and, it would seem, the ability to induce mass frenzy. At one point, a remix of \u00e2\u0080\u009cRock and Roll All Nite\u00e2\u0080\u009d transitioned into a remix of \u00e2\u0080\u009cRock You Like a Hurricane,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which transitioned into a remix of \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou Shook Me All Night Long.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A more contemporary song that brusquely commands listeners to \u00e2\u0080\u009cShut Up and Dance\u00e2\u0080\u009d played no fewer than two dozen times.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learned to block out the music,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Martyna Kulikowski, the team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s captain, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean I like it.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWith women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sports on the rise, cheerleading has grown crowded with a variety of iterations all vying for accreditation, among them game day, spirit and stunt. Advocates hope Title IX privileges are in the future. Though the athletic league technically considers stunt a coed sport, only a few teams include boys. The Wagner team is entirely female.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn cheer, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re rooting for someone else, usually boys,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Kulikowski said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn stunt, everyone else cheers for us.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSprawled across the stands between games, the Falcons allowed themselves a few moments to unwind, snacking on doughnuts and chatting. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBeing a teenage girl is stressful, and stunt is a sort of escape for a lot of them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Winkler said.Wagner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second competition of the day proceeded smoothly, as the Falcons defeated Stuyvesant High School, from Manhattan, without losing a single routine. Still, some of the team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most ardent supporters struggled to watch the action.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is the hardest part of my week,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Natasha Dunn, whose daughter Kayla is a junior on the Falcons.Wagner has avoided any major disasters, but the team has not been immune to stunt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dangers. Last season, one girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s teeth went through her upper lip after she was elbowed in the face. Another girl broke her pinkie finger. Both were back at practice the next day.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just bows and pompoms, these girls are tough,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Winkler said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cStunt breaks so many gender stereotypes, and I love that.\u00e2\u0080\u009dRelated:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

But the arrest of a Marine veteran last week in connection with the murder of a woman whose body was found in the woods has escalated into a crisis that may complicate the Pentagon\u2019s Okinawa operations.The Okinawa victim, Rina Shimabukuro, 20, an office worker from the city of Uruma, disappeared in the evening on April 28 after having gone out for a walk, according to Japanese news accounts.The suspect, Kenneth Franklin Gadson, 32, who goes by his Japanese wife\u2019s family name, Shinzato, was arrested exactly four weeks later, on May 19.Japanese news reports about the case, which quote unidentified police sources that could not be independently corroborated, provided this basic account:Mr. Shinzato, who did not know the victim, was questioned by the police after bloodstains were found in his car. He admitted to having killed Ms. Shimabukuro and he provided the police with the location of Ms. Shimabukuro\u2019s body, in a wooded area of Onna, about seven miles north Uruma.He was initially charged with the illegal disposal of a body, but additional charges including homicide are expected pending the results of an autopsy.It is not known precisely how Ms. Shimabukuro was killed, with some Japanese news reports saying she was stabbed and others saying she was strangled. No murder weapon has been found and no motive has been established. It remains unclear if she was sexually assaulted.\u201cHe was still in a daze,\u201d the lawyer, Toshimitsu Takaesu, was quoted as saying. \u201cI do not accept a statement taken under such conditions.

It is just a supporting role, a small showcase but not much of an assignment. How things have changed for her \u2014 and, much more sadly, for him.On Thursday at Carnegie Hall, Mr. Levine led the Met Orchestra in sizable excerpts from Wagner\u2019s \u201cRing\u201d operas with Ms. Goerke now singing Br\u00fcnnhilde \u2014 no supporting part, but the cycle\u2019s heroine \u2014 thrillingly. It was an exhilarating yet poignant evening.But Wagner\u2019s \u201cRing\u201d has long been a Levine specialty. For this highly anticipated concert, he summoned the requisite energy and focus to draw plush, powerful \u2014 at times a little too powerful \u2014 playing from the orchestra.Mr. Levine will almost certainly not be on the podium then, but at least he and Ms. Goerke could collaborate here. After a rehearsal on Monday, Ms. Goerke, sounding awe-struck, posted on Facebook: \u201cJust sang through bleeding chunks of Br\u00fcnnhilde with James Levine and got all the wisdom thrown at me.\u201d During the performance, it felt like one era at the Met was giving way to another.Mr. Levine, conspicuously, had no direct involvement with these presentations, though he had been scheduled to conduct \u201cLulu\u201d before withdrawing for health reasons. Yet he was crucial to each one.Over decades, he has made Berg\u2019s \u201cWozzeck\u201d and \u201cLulu\u201d pivotal to the Met\u2019s repertory. \u201cThe Pearl Fishers\u201d featured two singers Mr. Levine guided closely during their early years with the company: the tenor Matthew Polenzani and the baritone Mariusz Kwiecien, who trained in the young artist program. Mr. Levine has also made a specialty of \u201cElektra,\u201d a work he first led at the Met in 1980 with Birgit Nilsson, no less, in the title role and Leonie Rysanek as Chrysothemis.It\u2019s pretty clear that the orchestra, though devoted to Mr. Levine, has struggled in recent years as his gestures have become hard to follow and his stamina has flagged. But by this point, the players know what he wants in the \u201cRing.\u201d There were occasional slip-ups and tentative moments during Thursday\u2019s concert. Still, the audience was treated to engrossing highlights from all four parts of the cycle.Mr. Levine began with orchestral excerpts: the Entry of the Gods into Valhalla from \u201cDas Rheingold\u201d and the Ride of the Valkyries from \u201cDie Walk\u00fcre,\u201d with radiant, full-bodied string playing and stirring, brassy climaxes.Ms. Goerke has it all: clarion top notes and supple lyricism; tenderness and chilling intensity. She achingly conveyed the identity crisis Br\u00fcnnhilde faces when, a goddess no longer, she knows her destiny is to love, and be loved by, Siegfried.After intermission, Mr. Levine led an hour of excerpts from \u201cG\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung,\u201d starting with the prologue\u2019s dawn music and the duet between the now-devoted lovers, which Mr. Vinke and Ms. Goerke sang beautifully. Mr. Levine conducted a restless account of Siegfried\u2019s Rhine Journey and brought dark weightiness to Siegfried\u2019s Death and Funeral March. Ms. Goerke was vocally glorious and emotionally vulnerable in Brunnhilde\u2019s Immolation Scene.The ovation went on for almost 15 minutes.

{"Headline": "The Fight Over Privacy and Secrecy in Government Investigations", "Date": "2016-05-16", "News": "Supported byWhite Collar WatchThe challenge will be striking the right balance between the government\u2019s need to obtain information for law enforcement \u2014 a significant priority these days \u2014 with the desire to keep at least some personal information private, a growing concern as more sensitive data is stored online.Why the different level of protections based on the age of the communications? Thirty years ago, Congress considered any messages over 180 days old to be abandoned, and therefore subject to reduced protection. This distinction does not make much sense now, but in the early days of emails when they were seen as a cutting-edge innovation, no one thought that a message of more than six months would be of much importance.The S.E.C.\u2019s willingness to follow a procedure similar to obtaining a warrant as a prerequisite to obtaining emails would make it more difficult to obtain evidence because issuing an administrative subpoena involves no judicial review. Given the prevailing tide in favor of enhancing the privacy of electronic communications, this concession is the best way for the agency to maintain access to emails.If the legislation is not changed, then other agencies, such as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Federal Trade Commission, would similarly be unable to obtain emails as part of their investigations. This type of evidence is standard fare because the communications can provide crucial insight into the knowledge and intent of participants \u2014 the key to establishing most regulatory violations.Whether Congress wants to hamstring civil enforcement actions, which occur much more frequently than criminal prosecutions, is something that should be addressed explicitly in deciding how to enhance the privacy afforded electronic communications.The flip side of privacy is secrecy \u2013 how much authority should the government have to keep its investigations from becoming known when it seeks personal information. That is an issue that has come to the forefront as technology companies object to demands that they not notify customers when their information is sought.Corporations have constitutional rights, but it may be difficult for Microsoft to show that it has an unfettered right to inform customers about a government inquiry that involves their information when that could present a danger to public safety or jeopardize an investigation. The lawsuit appears to be intended more to highlight how the growth of secrecy orders presents a threat to customer privacy, especially if they become almost a matter of routine.That issue arose last week when Magistrate Judge James Orenstein of the United States District Court in Brooklyn issued an opinion denying Justice Department requests in 15 cases, two involving Facebook, for orders prohibiting disclosure of subpoenas for customer electronic records.The judge found that prosecutors asserted that disclosure would jeopardize the investigation without any evidence showing why, especially when at least one subpoena was directed to a potential victim and not a target of the case. \u201cThe boilerplate assertions set forth in the government\u2019s applications do not make such a showing,\u201d he wrote, while affording prosecutors a right to renew the requests if there were additional facts supplied to support imposing a secrecy order.An order directing a company not to inform its customer is issued \u201cex parte,\u201d which means that only the prosecutors and judges are involved in the procedure. With no one present to oppose a request, there is the danger that secrecy becomes the rule rather than the exception to efforts to obtain digital information.The interesting question is whether Judge Orenstein\u2019s opinion will prompt other judges to question these requests for secrecy, perhaps imposing a higher threshold than the Justice Department has been accustomed to when requesting such orders. What Microsoft seeks in its lawsuit may actually come about more through judicial scrutiny than an expansive reading of the rights of corporations.The Email Privacy Act would amend the law by allowing a secrecy order for up to 180 days in any case that involves obtaining email, while also recognizing a right for service providers to notify customers of any effort to obtain their information. The momentum is certainly present to expand the privacy protections afforded to electronic information because Congress rarely shows the type of unanimity the House did in passing the bill.It is worth taking a moment to consider how administrative agencies should fit into expanded privacy protections, and how much secrecy should be afforded when the government seeks that information.Advertisement"}

Now, the 17-year-old is suing the officer, the mall and some of its security guards.The complaint accuses Officer Williams of negligence in his treatment of a minor while working off duty as a security guard at the mall, and it seeks unspecified damages for physical and mental harm.\u201cA child riding a bike should not have to worry that a police officer will stop her without legal cause and brutalize her,\u201d Ms. Tillman\u2019s lawyer, Vito de la Cruz, said in a statement. \u201cOur communities are weary of another African-American child being hurt by unwarranted and excessive police force.\u201dThe video, just over three minutes long, shows Ms. Tillman and her older brother Eric Branch riding bicycles through the parking lot of the Tacoma Mall on May 24, 2014. They were on their way home, the lawsuit says.Two white vans pull up, including a Tacoma Police Department cruiser, with its lights flashing and air horn blaring. Officer Williams, wearing a Police Department uniform, gets out from behind the wheel of the department vehicle. The youths stop, and when Ms. Tillman ask him what they did wrong, the lawsuit says, Officer Williams reply that the two are being \u201ctrespassed\u201d for causing a disturbance.Ms. Tillman can be seen gesticulating while speaking with the officer. She asked what they did wrong several times, the lawsuit says, and when she tried to ride off, Officer Williams pulled her off her bicycle by her left arm. The suit said he \u201ctossed\u201d her around like a \u201cchild\u2019s doll, slamming her into parked vehicles, forcibly shoving his forearm into her chest, grabbing her by the hair and body-slamming her into the pavement.\u201dOfficer Williams then used his department-issued Taser on her, handcuffed her and put her into a patrol car, the lawsuit says. Ms. Tillman was charged with assaulting the officer and resisting arrest, but the charges were later dismissed at trial, the lawsuit says.Ten other people, some of them Tacoma police officers and others security guards, were also listed as defendants. The complaint did not name them or describe their role in the episode.Mr. de la Cruz said in an email that part of the delay in filing the lawsuit was because they had waited for the criminal case against Ms. Tillman to conclude. The suit says she had been stopped without reasonable suspicion and probable cause.Jennifer Carroll, a spokeswoman for the Tacoma Mall, declined on Monday to comment on the lawsuit but confirmed that Officer Williams had been working as a mall security officer at the time. When asked about the mall\u2019s rules governing bicycle riding in its parking lot, she had no comment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Capitol Hill Newspapers, Once a Protected Class, Redefine Themselves", "Date": "2016-05-14", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When Neetzan Zimmerman arrived at The Hill as its first director of audience development in January 2015, he found a publication largely unchanged since its heyday as a scrappy weekly for Washington\u2019s deal makers.\u201cI don\u2019t know if struggling is the right word because that would imply they had been trying, and they really had not,\u201d he said recently, referring to the paper\u2019s efforts to compete in a digital ecosystem. \u201cThey did not have any reasons to think they needed to exist in any meaningful way in this world.\u201dIt has been the job of Mr. Zimmerman, a former editor at Gawker and Whisper, the anonymous messaging app, to help change that. And the challenge is daunting.Capitol Hill publications like The Hill, Roll Call and National Journal were for decades a Beltway staple, strewn across desks on K Street and in Congress. With a captive audience and a strong advertising base, they were protected from broader economic forces and less concerned about competition from more nationally focused newspapers.Now these publications are scrambling to find their footing in a political landscape that is more competitive and almost unrecognizable from the one they chronicled for decades. Advertisers have fled, in part, these publications say, because of congressional inaction, which has sapped the special interest advertising that once padded their balance sheets.\u201cA generation ago, ad sales people would sit back and wait for phone calls and probably have opportunities to tell people the book was full,\u201d David Ellis, the chief content officer for CQ Roll Call, said recently. \u201cThose days are long gone.\u201dIn addition, Politico, founded in 2007, has been changing the media game in the Beltway, offering readers fast, savvy political reporting in a more digitally native form. The old lions of Capitol Hill were left straining to catch up.The realignment has already led to a profound adjustment by National Journal, a weekly magazine known for its substance-heavy writing on politics and policy. In January, it suspended its print magazine, leaving the free news business, and laying off or transferring a large portion of its staff as it reorganized. It now relies on about 1,000 corporate members paying four to five figures a year for services like Hotline, a well-known election news aggregator; live events; and access to databases of PowerPoint presentation slides and data sets.The move constituted a return to the publication\u2019s roots, said David G. Bradley, whose Atlantic Media Company owns National Journal, and to a business model that serves as a counterweight to advertising-driven publications.The Hill and Roll Call have tacked in the opposite direction, in pursuit of a national readership they can sell to potential advertisers.At The Hill, Mr. Zimmerman, the senior director for audience and strategy, said his goal is to emulate the attitude and approach of sites like Gawker and BuzzFeed without distorting what he calls The Hill\u2019s distinct voice. He has filled a handful of new positions, including a director of emerging platforms, who is exploring ways to use Snapchat and Facebook Live to share its content.Mr. Zimmerman\u2019s digital efforts come as The Hill\u2019s owner, the New York media investor Jimmy Finkelstein, is proceeding with ambitious expansion plans.\u201cWe want to be one of the big sites of America within a year,\u201d Mr. Finkelstein said in an interview.The Hill\u2019s website had almost 14 million unique visitors in March, up 126 percent compared with the previous year, according to comScore, the traffic measurement firm. Those kinds of raw numbers have put the site in competition with sites like Politico, which it managed to surpass for the month of December, according to comScore. The Hill\u2019s print circulation of about 26,000 has remained roughly steady.Much of the site\u2019s growth can be attributed to social media, aggressive aggregation and a premium on breaking news. The Hill\u2019s aggregation strategy has prompted critics to brand it as less serious than other competitors.Mr. Zimmerman countered that criticism, saying it \u201cchanges the notion of aggregation\u2019\u2019 if you are furthering a conversation about an issue and giving proper credit to the work of others.To Mr. Finkelstein and Bob Cusack, the editor in chief, the strategies are being used to finance a transformation of the once-parochial publication into a national player.\u201cWe don\u2019t want just the people who watch C-Span all the time to read us,\u201d said Mr. Cusack, who assumed the top editorial post in July 2014. \u201cOur name suggests really only Capitol Hill. What we have become now is more about original content and interviews. You should know what\u2019s going on in the entire world of politics.\u201dThat has meant cosmetic tweaks, like getting the names of obscure lawmakers out of headlines and framing stories for a larger audience.Mr. Finkelstein declined to discuss the publication\u2019s finances in detail; he said he expects profit to grow this year as The Hill undergoes a rapid election-year expansion that includes increasing the editorial staff about 25 percent and expanding opinion content. Just this week The Hill announced a rash of new hires, including a new publisher, Johanna Derlega, formerly of the National Journal; three new associate editors; and reporters to cover political fund-raising in Hollywood, Latino issues and transportation.Those moves are being watched closely at Roll Call, once known as the \u201ccampus newspaper\u2019\u2019 of Capitol Hill. Mr. Ellis and the paper\u2019s new editor, Melinda Henneberger, are trying to use techniques like narrative storytelling and human interest to attract a wider audience.\u201cI don\u2019t want to win the two-minute cycle; I want to go deeper,\u201d said Ms. Henneberger, a former reporter at several publications, including The New York Times.The evolution has been slower to make an impact on web traffic, though, which dipped sharply in January, February and March compared to the previous year, bottoming out well below 500,000 unique visitors, according to comScore. The paper\u2019s print circulation of about 21,000 has been largely unchanged.Mr. Ellis and Ms. Henneberger said they expected a new, multimedia-heavy website and a print design that made its debut in mid-March to help.Roll Call\u2019s strategy has partly been shaped by the financial security it receives through its relationship to CQ, the subscription-supported congressional tracking publication. The two publications, owned by The Economist Group, merged in 2009.Some in the Beltway worry that the drive for wider readership has necessitated a kind of betrayal of Capitol Hill DNA. \u201cPut me down as questioning whether they can pull it off,\u201d said Jim Manley, a Democratic strategist and former congressional staff member who described himself as an avid reader of Washington\u2019s political press. \u201cIt seems to me that they are moving away from their bread and butter and tying to find new ways to bring in clicks.\u201dStill, as the rules of doing business evolve, the Capitol Hill publications insist that their only choice is whether to learn them.\u201cI\u2019m not nostalgic at all,\u201d said Mr. Finkelstein, whose father helped found The Hill in 1994. \u201cEvery media organization is different, and you have to figure out how you\u2019re going to grow each one. I loved The Hill when it was just in paper. I love it much more now.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Sunday about changes underway at Capitol Hill newspapers misstated the surname of the new publisher of The Hill. She is Johanna Derlega, not Derlerga.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Overcoming the Shame of a Suicide Attempt", "Date": "2016-05-30", "News": "I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember much about the first time I tried to kill myself, 21 years ago, because any time the memory popped up I deleted it from my mind like an unflattering photo on Facebook. Despite being open and public about my second attempt, in 2006, which I revealed in a memoir about my alcoholism, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never told anyone else about that first one \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not my partner of 25 years, my therapist of 10 years, family, nor friends \u00e2\u0080\u0093 until now.Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what I remember about that first time, in 1995. I felt hopeless, that my 27 years of life were done (27!). I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d come home drunk from a glamorous Manhattan book event, which I had organized as the publicist. The wattage of successful artists in literature, fashion and theater was blinding. I felt like a failure, that I would never be more than the hired help, that my own dreams were just thin air. When I came home and poured another drink and remembered the leftover painkillers in my medicine cabinet \u00e2\u0080\u0093 prescribed for a sprained ankle earned by a drunken fall \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I thought, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy not?\u00e2\u0080\u009dMy attempt was impulsive, not premeditated. Had it been successful, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d classify it as suicidal manslaughter. I climbed into the antique wrought iron bed I shared with my partner and passed out. The next morning, I woke up next to him and he was none the wiser. I got up in a daze and went to work feeling like I was moving under water, so heavy was my triple hangover from booze, pills and shame. I kept moving, kept drinking (I was blind then to the cause and effect of booze and depression) and kept silent.My silence nearly killed me. Eleven years later, I tried again. I had been fantasizing about suicide every day for months. I was more hopeless. I was drunker. That time I did it with sleeping pills I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d been taking to prevent me from drinking as much at night. Booze, pills, suicide attempts: it was all one big happy \u00e2\u0080\u009cValley of the Dolls\u00e2\u0080\u009d family. That time I took the pills in the morning after my partner left for work, and I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wake up on my own. My partner found me in that antique bed when he came home from work. The jig was up, and my winding path to recovery began.As a recovering alcoholic I know that admitting to my behavior and owning my story is the only way it can no longer own me. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not ashamed of being an alcoholic, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m still ashamed of trying to kill myself, even though I know I did it under the temporary insanity of alcohol. According to the A.F.S.P., approximately 30 percent of those who die by suicide have blood alcohol levels in the range of intoxication at the time of their deaths.After my second attempt, I went to rehab and then to sober meetings. The focus quickly shifted from my suicide attempt to my alcoholism, and rightfully so. Once my alcoholism was treated, the depression lifted. It was alcohol that brought on my depression and thoughts of suicide, and ultimately twice gave me the courage to try it. Since I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been sober, I no longer suffer from depression, do not take antidepressants and no longer think about killing myself.I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m fortunate to live in New York City, where there are almost as many sober meetings as there are bars. These are peer-led meetings of alcoholics helping other alcoholics, free of judgment and condescension. These meetings keep me sober, hence nonsuicidal.I admitted my second suicide attempt because I was found out, and had to. But shame kept me quiet about my first attempt. I admit it now, and I throw out a call for other closeted suicide attempt survivors to do the same: Own it, and find \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or create \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a safe group where you can talk about it.Today I own my story, so that my story doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t kill me.Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

He is their presumptive nominee. Their party belongs to him. It\u2019s a YUUGE \u2026 disaster.Now the few remaining serious folks in that party have to make a decision: support this man who, if current trends in polling hold, is likely to lose the general election by an overwhelming margin (and likely do even more damage to the party brand and hurt the chances of down-ballot candidates), or they can \u2026 wait, they don\u2019t really have another option other than to sit out this cycle and pretend that their party hasn\u2019t gone stark raving mad.Many prominent Republicans have also indicated that they will skip the party\u2019s convention.\u201cIf the delegates ratify this madness in Cleveland, many of us will look elsewhere for a credible candidate to oppose both Trump and Clinton,\u201d Erickson told CNN.If you didn\u2019t already believe that whoever wins the Democratic nomination would be a huge favorite to win in November, a third-party conservative candidate would seal the deal.But please, shed not a single tear for this conservative calamity. They brought it on themselves. They allowed their unhinged contempt for \u2014 and in some cases, even hatred of \u2014 Obama to drive them insane, into the arms of a walking absurdity who catered to their rage.Now, that man \u2014 simultaneously an unbelievable joke and an undeniable threat \u2014 is on the verge of ripping the party, and indeed the country, apart (even as he insists that he\u2019s \u201cvery much a unifier\u201d).No, the threat is not that he will necessarily win, but that he will further poison our national dialogue in the six months between now and Election Day, and the off chance that maybe, just maybe, a September surprise could turn his sliver of a chance into an actual victory.This what-if, worst-case possibility that America might do the unimaginable \u2014 and elect Trump to our highest office \u2014 is severely unsettling.Sure, there are some prominent Republicans tucking their tails, biting their tongues and swallowing hard as they begrudgingly announce their support for the presumptive Republican nominee.Trump has used a toxic mix of bullying and bluster, xenophobia and nationalism, misogyny and racism, to appeal to the darker nature of the Republican Party and secure his place as the unlikeliest presidential nominee in recent American history.There is real pain in America, and where you sit along the ideological spectrum dictates whom you see as your Satan and whom as your savior. It appears that enough Republican voters have opted for the combo package, for which the party is likely to pay a hefty price.Congratulations, Republicans, you\u2019ve hitched yourselves to the madman-driven carriage, and it\u2019s heading for the cliff.Advertisement"}

Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Jeff Flake of Arizona, both Republicans, have treated Mr. Trump like an insufferable relative at a family wedding. But Mr. Graham said he recently had a \u201ccordial\u201d phone call with Mr. Trump on foreign policy, and Mr. Flake has said he is still deciding whether to endorse the businessman.Far more congressional Republicans have adopted wan smiles and insisted that they will give Mr. Trump their full support.

This month, they officially reprimanded Mr. Sasse and opposed his call for a third candidate, moves that were led by Ms. Fischer\u2019s nephew.Party leaders were also unhappy that Mr. Sasse followed a unity speech by Ms. Fischer by telling the convention that he would not address his anti-Trumpism. He instead delved into his thoughts on ordered liberty and his older daughter\u2019s recent stint living on a cattle ranch.\u201cThe senator missed an opportunity to express himself on this issue at the convention and get an honest reaction from the delegates,\u201d said J.

{"Headline": "In Silicon Valley, Gossip, Anger and Revenge", "Date": "2016-05-25", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Silicon Valley likes to keep the media on a tight leash. Tech executives expect obedience, if not reverence, from reporters. They dole out information as grudgingly as possible. Sometimes they simply buy a chunk of a publication, a time-honored method of influencing what is deemed fit to write about.Outing famous people has a long and not particularly respectable history, but Valleywag said it was celebrating Mr. Thiel. The point, as Valleywag\u2019s then-editor Owen Thomas wrote in his post, was that even in Silicon Valley, \u201ca gay investor has no way to fit into the old establishment. That frees him or her to build a different, hopefully better system for identifying and rewarding talented individuals, and unleashing their work on the world.\u201d\u201cSilicon Valley is a closed world and has become more closed at the elite levels,\u201d said Fred Turner, chairman of the department of communication at Stanford. \u201cThe gossip that circulates between people doesn\u2019t always leap into the media the way it might in New York. So Americans know the Valley primarily through its advertising, its self-promotion and its products.\u201dValleywag challenged that, and the Valley \u2014 or at least Mr. Thiel \u2014 pushed back.\u201cWe should not be surprised that they act like entitled industrialists out here, because they are,\u201d Mr. Turner said.Valleywag was born in 2006, an arm of Gawker\u2019s then-expanding empire of blogs, and it died last winter. It had a hiatus or two along the way, with Nick Denton, the Gawker founder, stepping in to write the blog at one point. Its most influential years were in the beginning, especially under Mr. Thomas, who ran the site from 2007 until 2009.\u201cOn one hand the reporting was terribly caustic and brutal and on the other it was really thorough and investigative and accurate in a lot of cases,\u201d said Brandee Barker, former head of global communications at Facebook. \u201cI would read a story and think, \u2018How on earth did they find this information that is correct?\u2019 Other times I\u2019d read Valleywag and think, \u2018This is the most evil and unfair characterization of somebody I\u2019ve ever read in journalism.\u2019\u201dJohn Cook, executive editor of Gawker Media, who helped put Valleywag to rest last year, said the site \u201cdidn\u2019t play the access game.\u201dMr. Thomas, now business editor of The San Francisco Chronicle, said the goal of Valleywag was to improve the tech community.\u201cSilicon Valley said it had ideals,\u201d he said. \u201cAll we asked was that it live up to those ideals. If you\u2019re going to say that you\u2019re a meritocracy, then don\u2019t hire all of your buddies to launch a start-up who all happen to be young white men. Don\u2019t say you\u2019re apolitical when you\u2019re secretly funding anti-immigration measures.\u201dFor Mr. Thiel, taking action against Gawker may be a win. Dan Lyons, an author who was briefly a Valleywag writer, said what Mr. Thiel did \u201csets a scary precedent,\u201d but \u201cmy guess is that most people hate Gawker as much as he does, so he probably ends up looking like a hero among his own crowd.\u201dMr. Adams wrote approvingly of Mr. Thiel, \u201cI assume he is acting out of a combination of revenge and a desire to make the world a better place.\u201dWithout this week\u2019s news, Valleywag\u2019s legacy would be uncertain. Several Silicon Valley figures asked to comment on Wednesday said they had not read it or did not know it was defunct.Others, like the Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff, an occasional Valleywag target, said simply about the site and this week\u2019s events, \u201cI don\u2019t care about any of those people.\u201dThe news about Mr. Thiel funding the suit against Gawker broke just as the previous contretemps about Silicon Valley and the media \u2014 how Facebook shapes the news that its users see, sparked by a story in Gizmodo, another Gawker property \u2014 was dying down. Mr. Thiel, as it happens, is a Facebook board member. Facebook declined to comment on Mr. Thiel.Mr. Thomas, who is himself gay, argues that Valleywag was not really outing Mr. Thiel. \u201cI did discuss his sexuality, but it was known to a wide circle who felt that it was not fit for discussion beyond that circle,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe he was in the closet.

{"Headline": "Alan Rusbridger, Once Guardian\u2019s Celebrated Editor, Severs Ties With It", "Date": "2016-05-13", "News": "Supported byBut Mr. Rusbridger on Friday departed the organization to which he had devoted his career. With mounting financial losses that threatened The Guardian, he was forced to give up the plum role he was set to assume in September, as chairman of the Scott Trust, the nonprofit organization that owns The Guardian.Mr. Rusbridger\u2019s decision to cut ties with The Guardian follows a series of events that made his presence seem increasingly untenable: lingering resentments from a battle over his replacement as editor; a string of articles detailing the paper\u2019s deteriorating finances; and, finally, a clash with his successor, Katharine Viner, who helped spearhead his strategy for international growth but now faces a period of retrenchment.The tensions, playing out on a public stage, deviate from the familiar news media angst in the digital world, where print\u2019s changing fortunes can create upheaval at the top.In his resignation statement, Mr. Rusbridger, 62, seemed to imply at times that he had been undone by the new regime \u2014 which he helped put in place \u2014 as well as a rapidly shifting environment in which even forward-thinking news organizations hemorrhage money while titans like Facebook and Google devour advertising revenue.The Guardian lost an estimated 45 million pounds, or $65 million, last year. It is seeking to cut its annual budget of $380 million by 20 percent over the next three years. It is cutting its British work force by 310 positions \u2014 250 job cuts and 60 vacant positions that will not be filled \u2014 or 18 percent of the total.\u201cMuch has changed in the year since I stepped down,\u201d Mr. Rusbridger wrote in a memo to The Guardian\u2019s staff members on Friday, stating that the leadership of The Guardian \u2014 David Pemsel, the chief executive of the Guardian Media Group, and Ms. Viner, the editor \u2014 no longer wanted him to take over the Scott Trust.\u201cWe all currently do our journalism in the teeth of a force-12 digital hurricane,\u201d Mr. Rusbridger said in the memo. The leaders of The Guardian \u201cclearly believe they would like to plot a route into the future with a new chair,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI understand their reasoning.\u201dA central point of disagreement within The Guardian has been its refusal \u2014 for Mr. Rusbridger, virtually an ideology \u2014 to charge online subscribers, as news organizations like The Financial Times, The Times of London, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times have come around to doing. The Guardian has recently experimented with a membership model that amounts to seeking donations, but Mr. Rusbridger insisted that a digital pay wall would be at odds with the newspaper\u2019s editorial mission.Under Mr. Rusbridger, The Guardian invested hundreds of millions of dollars in expansion, fueled in part by proceeds from the sale of a trade publication, Auto Trader. The Guardian Media Group\u2019s investment fund had been shrinking recently at an alarming rate \u2014 to \u00a3740 million in January, from \u00a3838.3 million in July.The Guardian, which started in Manchester, England, in 1821, built a presence in Australia and the United States beginning in 2011. It seemed to move easily into the digital realm, staffing 10 bureaus in the two countries and hiring more than 50 reporters.The Guardian succeeded in significantly expanding its international readership \u2014 the company says traffic from outside Britain now represents two-thirds of its digital audience. But its resistance to charging readers for content came at a significant cost.In a statement on Friday, Ms. Viner lauded Mr. Rusbridger as \u201ca truly towering figure at The Guardian over the last three decades.\u201d But she added: \u201cIn his email to staff, Alan recognized how much has changed in the year since he stepped down as editor, and that it is right that we all plot a new route to the future. We face a formidable challenge over the coming months in a digital environment that is shifting all the time.\u201dCerebral and academic, with often unruly hair, Mr. Rusbridger had an inner steel that won him admiration and devotion. Early in his career at The Guardian, Mr. Rusbridger led the newspaper\u2019s tenacious investigation of what became known as the cash-for-questions scandal in Parliament, which contributed to the fall of the Conservative government of Prime Minister John Major in 1997. Mr. Rusbridger stared down a libel suit against the newspaper by a powerful former minister involved in the scandal, Jonathan Aitken, who was ultimately jailed for perjury. In the hypercompetitive and partisan world of British journalism, Mr. Rusbridger was sometimes a lonely figure, often more admired in the United States than among his rivals at home.As Mr. Rusbridger\u2019s vision for the newsroom played out, the strategy appeared to have the full support of the top brass. Shortly after Mr. Rusbridger retired in 2015, Mr. Pemsel, the chief executive, said he was \u201chugely excited at the prospect of managing the next phase of growth at The Guardian, building on our international audience, capitalizing on the many commercial and digital opportunities.\u201d Around that time, another top executive said the company\u2019s finances had been good that year.Then the bottom fell out. Print advertising cratered, and expected digital money never materialized.Support for Mr. Rusbridger suddenly shifted, as he was cast as a negligent manager who had saddled the paper with a slew of problems. Janine Gibson, a favorite of Mr. Rusbridger\u2019s who lost out in the race to succeed him, left with other senior Guardian journalists, further shifting the way his legacy was viewed in the newsroom. In January, Mr. Rusbridger\u2019s choice as The Guardian\u2019s opinion editor, Jonathan Freedland, stepped down in what was seen as a leftward shift in the organization\u2019s editorial stance. And Ms. Viner\u2019s plans for the newsroom seemed increasingly at odds with Mr. Rusbridger\u2019s, making the idea that he would soon return, as essentially her boss, increasingly unsavory.It all reached a head on Thursday when the board of the trust met to discuss Mr. Rusbridger\u2019s future. The meeting ended without a decision.Mr. Rusbridger was by all accounts apparently dismayed by the public back-and-forth and the sour tone at the institution he dominated for so many years. While his supporters framed the decision to go as his, others said he had lost the battle with the trust and had no choice but to leave.In his memo, Mr. Rusbridger, who is currently the principal, or head, of Lady Margaret Hall, a college at the University of Oxford, wished his colleagues well. In September, he will also become the chairman of the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, also at Oxford.Graham Bowley contributed reporting from Toronto, Sarah Lyall from New York, and Nicola Clark from Paris.Advertisement"}

Lawmakers on both sides of the issue said they would rush to the Supreme Court, hoping for an answer on whether the impeachment proceedings would move forward as planned.The battle over impeachment is happening at a time when Brazil is reeling from multiple crises, including its worst economic downturn in decades, the Zika epidemic and an enormous corruption scandal engulfing the national oil company.At the same time, the nation is preparing to hold the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, a city grappling with a brutal crime wave and doubts over the safety of infrastructure projects built around the Games.Now politicians are scrambling to determine how the decision might affect the president\u2019s fate.\u201cDilma\u2019s government was on its deathbed, so anything like this that creates a mess could be positive for her,\u201d said Thiago de Arag\u00e3o, a political risk consultant in the capital, Bras\u00edlia.Mr. de Arag\u00e3o cautioned that legal scholars and opposition figures were already mounting a formidable challenge to Monday\u2019s decision.\u201cNothing is settled right now,\u201d Mr. de Arag\u00e3o said. \u201cThe Supreme Court or the Chamber of Deputies itself will likely say this is invalid. But that doesn\u2019t mean that chaos isn\u2019t the word of the day.\u201dMr. Maranh\u00e3o contended that procedural rules had been broken in the impeachment vote against the president last month. He said the lower house should hold a new one.Leaders in the Senate signaled that they had no plan to reschedule their vote on whether to suspend Ms. Rousseff on Wednesday. Raimundo Lira, the senator at the helm of that body\u2019s impeachment commission, said that Mr. Maranh\u00e3o\u2019s decision had no \u201cpractical effect.\u201dSimilarly, Renan Calheiros, the leader of Senate, called Mr. Maranh\u00e3o\u2019s move a \u201cjoke with democracy.\u201d He said he would disregard it.\u201cThe decision has no value whatsoever,\u201d said Ronaldo Caiado, a senator from the conservative Democrats Party. \u201cIt\u2019s just an act of the government\u2019s desperation and five minutes of fame for the guy in charge.\u201dMs. Rousseff responded to Monday\u2019s decision by urging \u201ccaution,\u201d saying that she did not know what the impact would be, while some of her supporters embraced it.Dilma Rousseff, Brazil\u2019s president, is facing removal from office. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the proceedings.\u201cWe know that the impeachment process wasn\u2019t done in the right way,\u201d said Benedita da Silva, a lawmaker from Ms. Rousseff\u2019s leftist Workers\u2019 Party. \u201cWe hope that Maranh\u00e3o will stay firm in his decision.\u201dMany of the nation\u2019s leaders were already preparing for Ms. Rousseff\u2019s suspension.Michel Temer, the vice president who broke with Ms. Rousseff and is the country\u2019s leader in waiting, has been seeking to assemble a cabinet in recent weeks, drawing potential ministers largely from his centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement Party and the opposition Social Democrats.Some questioned whether Mr. Maranh\u00e3o was seeking to shore up political support in his home state in northeast Brazil, which is governed by an ally of Ms. Rousseff. Others questioned whether Mr. Cunha had played a role in Monday\u2019s decision.Mr. Cunha, the deposed speaker, said on Monday that he disagreed with Mr. Maranh\u00e3o\u2019s decision. Referring to Brazilian news reports speculating about whether he had a hand in the move, Mr. Cunha said, \u201cI condemn the insinuations of any nature published by unscrupulous journalists about any role of mine in this episode.\u201dMr. Maranh\u00e3o has faced claims that he was not fit to take the helm of the lower house, which would place him next in line for the presidency if the vice president takes over. Like Mr. Cunha and dozens of other high-ranking politicians, Mr. Maranh\u00e3o is facing claims that he took bribes in the enormous graft scheme surrounding the national oil company, Petrobras.Ronaldo Macedo Jr., a law professor at Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Get\u00falio Vargas, an elite university, said he expected Mr. Maranh\u00e3o\u2019s decision to be struck down.\u201cI don\u2019t think that this decision by Maranh\u00e3o will prevail,\u201d he said, pointing to previous decisions by the nation\u2019s highest court. Mr. Macedo emphasized that justices had already approved the impeachment proceedings carried out in the lower house.In a speech to the lower house on Monday, Mr. Maranh\u00e3o defended his decision, calling it an effort to \u201csave democracy.\u201dVinod Sreeharsha contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro, and Paula Moura from S\u00e3o Paulo.Advertisement"}

Instead, they have come from a constituency one might have assumed would be his ally: advocates for criminal-justice reform.\u201cThere\u2019s an overwhelming disenchantment with him in this community,\u201d said Keegan Stephan, a veteran activist who has taken part in the protests against Mr. Thompson. \u201cIt would be wrong to suggest he hasn\u2019t done good things, but many people who supported him at first are criticizing him now.\u201dThere would seem to be an irony in liberal protesters\u2019 openly condemning a liberal district attorney. But those who have found fault with Mr. Thompson \u2014 including public defenders who have joined the activists in the substance, if not style, of their complaints \u2014 have claimed that he applied standards of justice for the former officer, Peter Liang, in Mr. Gurley\u2019s death that were different from those used in the cases of ordinary people, many of whom were black or Hispanic and charged with minor crimes.Mr. Thompson, whose supporters have said he is interested in running for higher office, declined to publicly discuss his critics. But after the rally at his home last month, his aides released a statement in his name that read, \u201cThese efforts to harass and intimidate my family, frighten my young children and disturb my neighbors at 1 in the morning will not deter me from doing what is right.\u201dFor any district attorney \u2014 let alone the first black one in Brooklyn\u2019s history \u2014 the Gurley case would have been a test.In November 2014, Mr. Liang, a probationary officer, was on patrol in a dark stairwell of a public-housing project when he fired a shot that ricocheted and struck Mr. Gurley in the heart. A three-month investigation followed as the city reeled from protests over a lack of charges in the case of Eric Garner, who died after a confrontation with police officers on Staten Island. After the Gurley inquiry, Mr. Thompson secured a manslaughter indictment against Mr. Liang, who was convicted this year.Though there were clear legal differences between the cases, many activists have found it hard to swallow the divergent outcomes.Some of the tension is rooted in the age-old battle between those who work for incremental remedies and those who reach for fundamental change.\u201cWhile Thompson has embraced reforms that acknowledge the limits of the punitive approach, he\u2019s still the district attorney and is operating in a punitive framework,\u201d said Alex S. Vitale, an associate professor of sociology at Brooklyn College who studies law enforcement issues. \u201cBut the activist movement is feeling its power and wants dramatic action, not just someone tinkering with the system.\u201dThe dispute also reflects a clash of perspectives that has surfaced many times after police killings across the country. It has been said \u2014 most notably by David Kennedy, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City \u2014 that activists, particularly black ones, look at these killings through the long lens of history, in which specific facts and individual cases dissolve into an overarching narrative of continuing abuse and a lack of accountability. But that, of course, is not the lens through which a district attorney, weighing evidence and making legal judgments, looks.\u201cThe power structure, whether black or white, tends to focus on the incidents themselves, on what happened in the moment,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said. \u201cBut there\u2019s a different way of looking, one that considers a very long history of agents of the law doing people harm.\u201dIn that context, Mr. Kennedy said, it was no surprise that the conversation has remained contentious \u2014 and occasionally confusing.\u201cThe city and the country are in movement on these issues in a sudden, dramatic way,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to sort out exactly what\u2019s going on.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Starting in 2007, when he began his attempt to be America\u2019s first black president, the name first appeared on the charts with five babies. Through 2009 the year he was inaugurated, more than 100 babies were named Barack. Fewer than five newborns were given that name every year before 2007.Babies named Hillary, too, were more rare in 2015 than in previous years. The name rose in popularity in the 1980s and peaked in 1992, but as Hillary Clinton took on a contentious political role in her husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s administration, its use dropped off steeply: more than 2,500 Hillarys were born in 1992, but only 408 in 1994.The name perked up a bit in 2008, suggesting some parents may have been animated by Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first, failed run for the presidency. But since then, the name has continued to decline, with only 136 born last year.On the Republican side, though the presumptive nominee Donald Trump brags about bringing many new voters into his party, he has not made the number of baby Americans named Donald great again: there were only 690 born last year.\n            The number of babies named Franklin, Harry or Dwight peaked in the years men with those names became president.

Candidates named John in recent political life are practically uncountable: Kerry, Edwards, Kasich and McCain, along with Jeb Bush, whose full name is actually John Ellis Bush. Ted Cruz, George Bush and Bill Clinton, too, have names that are generally in decline as parents of baby boys tend to prefer names like Noah, Liam and Mason.Though it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not his formal name, and though his campaign never took off, the name Jeb exercised its right to rise last year, with 37 babies, the most since 2006, when he was still governor of Florida.And he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the only Republican who seems to have been more inspiring in the maternity ward than the voting booth.

And in an emailed statement, she cast herself as someone willing to challenge Mr. Trump. \u201cRepublicans waited way too long to stand up and tell the truth about Donald Trump\u2019s record, his temperament, and why he is unfit to be president,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t repeat that mistake.\u201dBut Ms. Warren may also be trying to blunt Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to woo supporters of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s primary opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, no matter how unlikely Mr. Trump is to bring them to his side in large numbers. She is the person most closely aligned with Mr. Sanders\u2019s brand of anti-Wall Street populism, and her imprimatur could help Mrs. Clinton while the Democratic primary race goes on.In some ways, Mr. Trump is reprising the Native American attack that then-Senator Scott Brown used against her, unsuccessfully, in their 2012 contest. Ms. Marsh said that during that race, Ms. Warren won over some of the working-class men who had voted for Mr. Brown in his 2010 special election to the Senate, making her a particularly potent force on the Democratic side.\u201cShe is probably the most effective voice to engage Trump and Trump supporters because she won his voters in her election here, and when it comes to helping them and creating jobs, she is wildly popular with them,\u201d Ms. Marsh said. \u201cShe has standing with Trump voters.\u201dA detailed list of the journalists, politicians and places President Trump has insulted since declaring his candidacy.Ryan Williams, a Republican consultant, said Mr. Trump needed to \u201cstop chasing every shiny object and going down every rabbit hole, and focus on the White House.\u201d\u201cI think Donald Trump needs to recognize that he\u2019s the nominee of the Republican Party and his target is Hillary Clinton, not Elizabeth Warren or anyone else,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cOne of the main rules of politics is to never punch downwards, and he\u2019s punching way downward by engaging with a liberal senator who\u2019s not even on the ballot this year.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s allies view the dust-up as simply Mr. Trump\u2019s being himself, and winning over voters in the process.\u201cDonald understands the power of Twitter,\u201d Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime Trump confidant, wrote in an email. \u201cNothing will galvanize the Republican Party like brawling with anti-business Fauxcahontas.

Around 3:20 a.m., a pair of blasts punctuated the morning hush and Mr. Micalizzi, 23, was found shot in what the police and college officials believe was an attempted robbery at the fraternity house.Mr. Micalizzi, an engineering student who was in his second year at N.J.I.T. after transferring from Brookdale Community College, was taken to University Hospital here, where he was pronounced dead at 5:02 a.m.\u201cHe died senselessly, that\u2019s all I can say,\u201d Mr. Micalizzi\u2019s father, John, said, his voice trembling as he spoke from the family\u2019s home in Freehold, N.J., where relatives and friends had gathered to cope with the news. \u201cHe was a good kid, studying very hard for his engineering degree.

{"Headline": "Readers\u2019 Turn: The Inventions That Mattered Most", "Date": "2016-05-18", "News": "Supported byAn Age of MiraclesHere are some of our favorite comments, together with a few more old pictures.Control of infectious diseases and parasites, for sure. Look how we freak out today over the threat of anything transmissible. What must it have been like to live in fear of tuberculosis, smallpox, yellow fever, plague, tetanus, etc. Imagine watching half your children die. One of the greatest fears was over a disease we hardly think about today \u2014 rabies. The South was plagued with hookworm around 1900, with almost half the population infected. It blows me away when I hear people seriously consider the iPhone as the greatest invention of all time. I put the iPhone well behind the pizza.You forgot to include the development of the safety bicycle during the late 1800s. Its advanced technology (chain drives, wire spoke wheels, pneumatic tires, etc.) was an essential step before automobiles could become practical. Even aviation (think Wright brothers) was based on bicycle technology. Besides causing a technological revolution, the bicycle also caused a social one \u2014 women\u2019s emancipation. As Susan B. Anthony famously said, \u201cI think it has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world.\u201dMy grandmother passed away several years ago at 101. She had lived through two world wars, a man on the moon, television, phone (initial and cellular), the polio vaccine, 9/11... I asked her what she thought were the greatest innovations that had occurred during her lifetime. Without missing a beat, she replied electricity and women obtaining the right to vote. Indoor plumbing came in a close third.You are not even close. The biggest advancement in all of human history is effective birth control. It changes every aspect of life: economic, social, day-to-day life, moral. Impacts everyone and every social structure.Since the origin of homo sapiens, there was little recording of anything until perhaps 40,000 years ago when they began to paint in caves and on rocks. To me, speech and the ability to tell a story is the greatest innovation ever.The biggest innovation is education and allowing even the poorest girls and boys to reach their full potential. For education to be available, kids have to have time to go to school (so no chores fetching water or firewood) and they have to survive long enough to make it to school (so neonatal care, food for healthy mother, antibiotics and vaccinations). This article didn\u2019t try to cover the social changes in the years 1870-1916, but the biggest was the idea that people should be educated (especially girls) and that everyone should have a chance. That wasn\u2019t the case in 1870, when sprawling families were there to work the land.In my view the era that began with Sputnik in the late 1950s and ended with moon landings was the greatest era of innovation. We watched as the first communication satellites were built and launched. Nuclear submarines became the norm. The Concorde was built, as was the Saturn rocket that launched men to the moon. The Lockheed corporation built the world\u2019s fastest aircraft, the Blackbird, and the first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier the U.S.S. Enterprise was also launched. Telstar too was launched in the early 1960s. The New York World\u2019s Fair in 1964-65 demonstrated touch tone dialing, and I.B.M. built the first small computers for schools and business. Many colleges began to offer computer programing courses. The Bell Telephone Laboratories were doing experiments with lasers and other optical-electrical devices. Even the Armalite rifle was built by Eugene Stoner, changing the combat rifle forever. Microwave radio transmissions and color TV technology raced ahead, as did FM stereo multiplexing. And don\u2019t forget the introduction of the Mustang and other pony cars! I\u2019m lucky. I got to live in the most innovative time of all. The time of the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and the Beach Boys, too. Great time to be a young teenager.Invention/discovery does not occur over a straight line. Use of a tool for cutting, use of fire for cooking, language and the narrative myth to put these diverse items to use (hunting and eating animals) occurred over hundreds of thousands of years.Express tracks. Whoever thought to build four New York subway tracks on many lines instead of two was brilliant, and still affects the lives of millions of commuters every day.Pretty simple: Indoor plumbing is more important than jet travel or cellphones. Try living without each and see what happens to most people.I know this article has an American bent, but to me from a purely public health point of view the invention of soap and sewers advanced the human cause more than any machine invention. In Europe a long, long time ago, the tradition was for the man to walk closer to the buildings on the street while dating a woman. Why? Because, if anyone living above decided to throw out the day\u2019s household waste out the window, the man took the brunt. A second after the date, scrubbing with soap would be required.American innovations in commercial banking and finance made all the other innovations possible. Without our financial infrastructure, largely perfected in 18th, 19th and 20th century America by our illustrious robber barons, we would have been unable to produce telephones, aircraft, trains, roads, bridges, a stable food supply, clean water, government services and all the rest. Our entire modern world rests on the bottoms of shiny-pants bookkeepers with green eyeshades and sleeve garters. The accountants and bankers are the modern masters of the universe.Sorry to let you know, but there has been nothing truly new for decades. Internet, personal computer, email, cellphone. These are all stemming from one thing: 1947 transistor/semiconductor; integrated circuit, 1958. The theory for these ... 1905-1927 mostly. But electrical systems created lighting, heating, and allowed immense productivity in the workplace and home: washers, dryers, toasters, clocks, factory machinery, automobile plants, aluminum. Vastly more impactful to humankind.The greatest era is always now, for it builds on the advances of the past, without which it would have to start from the beginning. The greatest \u201cinnovation\u201d was the Roman aqueduct, the knowledge of water, and subsequently, by others, much later, the flush toilet. More important for all \u2014 the Gutenberg first and the printing press second.I was promised a flying car by now, and all I got was Facebook.Advertisement"}

It is the most widely consumed joke that I have produced. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the funniest thing I\u2019ve ever written, but that\u2019s how these things go. Either way, it\u2019s everywhere and it\u2019s made me no money.As a comedian, I like Twitter because it\u2019s free and kind of merit-based. It\u2019s a branch of comedy that you can just hurl thoughts into without an agent or manager. I like the instant reaction it gives you from the ether. It\u2019s a vice, like cigarettes or candy. I like it a little too much.On Feb. 13, I was sitting at the desk in my bedroom where I spend a lot of time poring over half-finished novels and mostly finished pizza pockets, thinking about the 10 years I\u2019d spent so far on a comedy career that had a way of dying and restarting like the engine of an old truck. I was unemployed, unrepresented professionally and out of money in New York. I\u2019d spend whole days alone, reading the news, taking it way too personally.It occurred to me that of all mind-boiling aspects of the current presidential race, the worst part was arguing with people whom I considered friends. I watched people block and unfriend one another online. I spelunked into the human darkness that we call YouTube comment threads. I\u2019d stare into the glow for hours, reading articles that supported views I had already decided were correct. I\u2019d write angry Facebook posts, alienating myself from friends who happened to be voting for someone else. There has to be some common ground somewhere, I thought. I rattled out an opaque observation about the one thing that it seemed we could all agree on, the fact that things were getting weird.This was somewhere around the 15,000th thing I had ever tweeted and this one took off, which is theoretically what I was trying to make happen with the first 14,999 tweets. That theory, however, assumes that the purpose of social media is to get famous, or that there is a purpose of social media at all. Either way, I would be lying if I told anyone it didn\u2019t feel like a win. I watched my phone explode with notifications as I lay in bed staring into its artificial light. The Internet was telling me \u201cYes, Jake, you are indeed funny.\u201dMy brain filled with dopamine. My phone buzzed and blinked. I was experiencing a mythologized modern experience: going viral.When you\u2019re pursuing a career in a field that\u2019s both unrewarding and mostly D.I.Y. you cling to these little successes as if they are buoys in the water, assuring you that you\u2019re not entirely lost at sea.On the first night after the tweet took off, my name was trending in different cities around the globe. Celebrities were batting my joke at one another. People like John Hodgman, Bette Midler, Minnie Driver. People I watch in movies and don\u2019t even consider real. Friends from all over the country got in touch to tell me they heard someone quote me. Someone in Britain immortalized it in needlepoint. The tweet reached easily more people than any album or podcast I\u2019d ever produced.Over the years I\u2019ve watched a lot of comedian friends achieve some success. It always feels as if there\u2019s one big break that starts the whole process. I wonder how it happens. I don\u2019t ask. I just keep working and waiting patiently. The big break is always ahead like a mirage on the highway. I stand in line at bodegas and roll my eyes at people who buy lottery tickets and then I continue to wait for the entertainment industry to hand me a job for being funny on Facebook. Sometimes irony is lost on me, I guess.In February, while my joke was going viral, I was looking for a new day job. Interviews were both uplifting and depressing. I didn\u2019t exactly think becoming a meme would launch my career, but hoped it would. I wanted to get paid to write, but I needed to get paid to do anything, so I hit Craigslist and started searching.In March, I landed a bartending gig at a bar that hosts an open mike comedy night. My first night at work, when I finished my shift and was packing up to leave, the M.C. asked me if I wanted to go up and do some stand up.I went up and launched into seven minutes of solid material I\u2019d done at comedy clubs and music festivals around the country. In my 10 years of comedy, I have recorded an album and performed on the road. I knew what worked.My plan was: I\u2019d do my strongest material and crush, the analog equivalent of a rush of instant retweets. After all, I was famous on the Internet. What happened instead was I bombed, so hard. The room stared at me in silence as I moved through what I thought were road-tested jokes. It was like that nightmare where you show up to school naked. Words fell from my mouth and onto my shoes.The thing I\u2019ve always loved about stand-up comedy is that it is unable to show you mercy. For the last decade I\u2019ve periodically thrown myself into comedy\u2019s inferno for five minutes, 10 minutes, sometimes an hour at a time. I always come out of it feeling that I learned something.Even when I do well I still feel mangled and worked over by it.Sometime recently I stopped thinking that maybe I\u2019d get rich. I even stopped thinking I\u2019d quit. I started to love the baptism in battery acid that comes from bombing. I\u2019ve stopped wishing for a life where I\u2019m rich and famous and don\u2019t have to work. Now I like the work.I think the Internet is like a broken slot machine. I didn\u2019t put any money into it, I received all of its flashing, shrieking, beeping cacophony when I hit its jackpot, and no money came out. I wondered why I\u2019d believed in this system at all.Very few people, in the scheme of things, get paid to write jokes. But the exposure is limitless. The fact that anyone can join Twitter almost guarantees that no one will parlay it into a moneymaking venture. It almost feels like socialism. It almost feels like something you might stay up all night arguing about on social media and never find an answer. Perhaps this is the last season of the Internet and the writers are just going nuts.Jake Flores is a comedian based in New York City.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "It\u2019s No Accident: Advocates Want to Speak of Car \u2018Crashes\u2019 Instead", "Date": "2016-05-22", "News": "Supported byRoadway fatalities are soaring at a rate not seen in 50 years, resulting from crashes, collisions and other incidents caused by drivers.Just don\u2019t call them accidents anymore.That is the position of a growing number of safety advocates, including grass-roots groups, federal officials and state and local leaders across the country. They are campaigning to change a 100-year-old mentality that they say trivializes the single most common cause of traffic incidents: human error.\u201cIn our society,\u201d he added, \u201clanguage can be everything.\u201dAlmost all crashes stem from driver behavior like drinking, distracted driving and other risky activity. About 6 percent are caused by vehicle malfunctions, weather and other factors.Preliminary estimates by the nonprofit National Safety Council show deadly crashes rose by nearly 8 percent in 2015 over the previous year, killing about 38,000 people.Dr. Rosekind has added his voice to a growing chorus of advocates who say that the persistence of crashes \u2014 driving is the most dangerous activity for most people \u2014 can be explained in part by widespread apathy toward the issue.Changing semantics is meant to shake people, particularly policy makers, out of the implicit nobody\u2019s-fault attitude that the word \u201caccident\u201d conveys, they said.On Jan. 1, the state of Nevada enacted a law, passed almost unanimously in the Legislature, to change \u201caccident\u201d to \u201ccrash\u201d in dozens of instances where the word is mentioned in state laws, like those covering police and insurance reports.At least 28 state departments of transportation have moved away from the term \u201caccident\u201d when referring to roadway incidents, according to Jeff Larason, director of highway safety for Massachusetts. The traffic safety administration changed its own policy in 1997, but has recently become more vocal about the issue.\u201cWhy can\u2019t human error be an accident even if the error is preventable,\u201d one person wrote. \u201cWhat is being solved by having this debate? What injustice are we correcting?\u201dAnd when Mr. Larason suggested to officials at the Virginia Department of Transportation that they stop using \u201caccident,\u201d he received a note saying that drivers are familiar and comfortable with the word. Virginia officials also wrote that drivers might not consider a minor incident to be a \u201ccrash,\u201d and so the change could be confusing.Mr. Larason counters that accident is simply the wrong word. \u201cI\u2019m betting it\u2019s one of the most commonly used words that is used inappropriately,\u201d he said.On Facebook, he posted a Merriam-Webster definition that describes accident as \u201can unexpected happening\u201d that \u201cis not due to any fault or misconduct on the part of the person injured.\u201dThe word was introduced into the lexicon of manufacturing and other industries in the early 1900s, when companies were looking to protect themselves from the costs of caring for workers who were injured on the job, according to Peter Norton, a historian and associate professor at the University of Virginia\u2019s department of engineering.The business community even developed a cartoon character \u2014 the foolish Otto Nobetter, who suffered frequent accidents that left him maimed, immolated, crushed, and even blown up. The character was meant to warn workers about the risks of inattention.\u201cRelentless safety campaigns started calling these events \u2018accidents,\u2019 which excused the employer of responsibility,\u201d Dr. Norton said.When traffic deaths spiked in the 1920s, a consortium of auto-industry interests, including insurers, borrowed the word to shift the focus away from the cars themselves. \u201cAutomakers were very interested in blaming reckless drivers,\u201d Dr. Norton said.But over time, he said, the word has come to exonerate the driver, too, with \u201caccident\u201d seeming like a lightning strike, beyond anyone\u2019s control. The word accident, he added, is seen by its critics as having \u201cnormalized mass death in this country,\u201d whereas \u201cthe word \u2018crash\u2019 is a resurrection of the enormity of this catastrophe.\u201dThese days, the pressure to change the language stems partly from aggrieved families using social media like Facebook clubs and Twitter to lobby for change.Safety advocates often post Twitter messages to journalists and policy makers, urging them to stop using \u201caccident\u201d to describe a crash.When New York City changed its policy in 2014, it did so partly in response to such grass-roots efforts, including from a group called Families for Safe Streets. The group is led by parents like Amy Cohen, whose son, Sammy, was run over and killed in Brooklyn in 2013.\u201cWhose story do you have at the time of the crash? The driver! The victim is dead,\u201d Ms. Cohen said. \u201cThe presumption should be to call it a crash, which is a neutral term.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Police and Tech Giants Wrangle Over Encryption on Capitol Hill", "Date": "2016-05-08", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the district attorney of Manhattan, visited Washington late last month to argue his case on a pressing issue: encryption.\u201cI wanted to express a sense of urgency around resolution of this issue,\u201d Mr. Vance said in an interview about his Washington visit.Law enforcement officials immediately announced their support of the bill and began to push lawmakers to back it. Trade groups representing tech companies like Apple and Facebook have flooded into congressional offices, sent letters expressing concerns that the bill weakens consumer privacy and security, and delivered scorching speeches about the proposals.\u201cThis is an escalating fight,\u201d said Robert D. Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a research firm based in Washington that is funded by tech companies including Google and Microsoft. \u201cIt\u2019s become the focus now in Washington, with hearings and legislative activity.\u201dLaw enforcement officials blame tech companies for creating the impasse.\u201cThere\u2019s no question our relationship with the tech industry has gotten worse, and now it seems like the tech industry is taking every opportunity they have to put up obstacles in our way, including trying to derail legislative efforts that would give law enforcement what they need to keep people safe,\u201d said Terrence Cunningham, president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police.\u201cToday, terrorists and criminals are increasingly using encryption to foil law enforcement efforts, even in the face of a court order,\u201d Senator Feinstein said in a statement about the draft bill. \u201cWe need strong encryption to protect personal data, but we also need to know when terrorists are plotting to kill Americans.\u201dThe rhetoric in Washington around encryption has grown increasingly sharp. Last month, when the contents of the draft encryption bill were leaked, the president of the Consumer Technology Association, a trade group that counts Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon among its 4,000 members, spoke to an audience filled with government officials at a lunch hosted by the Media Institute.The bill is \u201cdangerously overreaching and technically unsophisticated,\u201d said Gary Shapiro, president of the association. \u201cThis bill would essentially make effective cybersecurity illegal in the United States, pushing companies that take cybersecurity seriously offshore.\u201dOther tech trade groups, including Reform Government Surveillance and the Business Software Alliance, have also waded into the fray, sending critical letters and meeting with senators to warn of the dangers of the bill. And Silicon Valley executives have, in increasing numbers, made the trek to Washington to make their cases directly.Bob Lord, chief information security officer at Yahoo, visited several members of Congress in late April to talk about the technology behind encryption and to warn of the \u201cunintended consequences\u201d of legislation that could weaken security. While he did not specifically mention the Burr-Feinstein bill, he emphasized how consumers and human rights activists worldwide depend on encrypted technology for their safety and privacy.\u201cThe notion that we would weaken encryption or provide back doors, those suggestions will have unintended consequences,\u201d Mr. Lord said.Law enforcement officials, in turn, have frequently met with the same lawmakers in the Senate and House intelligence, judiciary and commerce committees who are being targeted by the tech companies, according to congressional staff members. Chief Cunningham and other members of the police chiefs\u2019 group have talked with Mr. Burr and Ms. Feinstein, given opinions during the drafting of the legislation and hosted panels on encryption for House and Senate lawmakers.Tech companies have turned to certain politicians to champion their cause, such as Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon. On the day the draft encryption bill was introduced, Mr. Wyden, who voted against the 2012 copyright bills known as the Stop Online Piracy Act and the Protect Intellectual Property Act, which were also opposed by the tech industry, said he had been flooded with calls from tech companies wanting to know what he would do.Mr. Wyden said he intended to filibuster the proposal. He has since met with Intelligence Committee members to persuade them to kill the bill.\u201cI have not filibustered many issues, but I think the stakes are enormous,\u201d Mr. Wyden said in an interview. \u201cThe bill as written is a lose-lose, because it will create less security, American families will be less safe, and your liberty and privacy will be damaged.\u201dFor all the lobbying, few lawmakers have expressed their views on the encryption bill.\u201cI\u2019m reserving judgment,\u201d said Senator King, who met with Mr. Vance last month. \u201cThe issues are so complex, it\u2019s like trying to nail Jell-O to the wall.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Evacuated From Canada\u2019s Wildfires but With Nowhere to Turn", "Date": "2016-05-05", "News": "Supported byEDMONTON, Alberta \u2014 The passengers arrived through an airport gate normally used as an exit. Some had bulging oversize bags, others nothing more than a shopping bag or backpack. And all around were an unusual number of children, along with dogs and cats of all sizes.\u201cIt\u2019s just surreal, I don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d Lory Curnew told her former neighbor Marlene McDonald as they stood by a baggage carousel. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating to say the least.\u201dThe evacuees had taken refuge in work camps normally used by oil sands workers. But some of those camps quickly became overcrowded. The combination of the camps being cut off and the remote possibility that the fire could swing their way, has led to the airlift, which will last for days. While the evacuees\u2019 arrival in Edmonton brought them to safety, it only reinforced the uncertainty they now face having fled a town where much, including many of their homes, has been reduced to ashes.They had been among the Canadians drawn to Fort McMurray by jobs that paid exceptionally high wages during the oil boom. That beacon dimmed with the global plunge in petroleum prices, but the oil industry\u2019s downturn is now the least of their concerns. And although her future is far from clear, Ms. Curnew, like many of the evacuees, is already skeptical about promises from politicians that Fort McMurray will rise again.A state of emergency was declared in Alberta, Canada, forcing the frightened residents of three additional communities to evacuate.\u201cFor a lot of people, I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll go back,\u201d said Ms. Curnew, a single mother who worked in construction and who arrived with a single suitcase, her 15-year-old son, Parker, and two dogs. \u201cYou just can\u2019t go back there with no services, no food coming in, no anything. You just can\u2019t go back there.\u201dWith flames lapping at the edges of Highway 63, the city\u2019s only land connection to the rest of Canada, the vast majority of the 88,000 evacuees went south in a slow-motion traffic jam in which trips that normally last for minutes stretched into hours.Some drivers, their cars low on gas and with service stations closed down and dry, stopped on the side of the road or gave up at nearby communities like Anzac. As the fire expanded and shifted south, they were forced to again pack up and find refuge.By Thursday, officials believed that the vast majority had made their way to Edmonton, the nearest major city, or farther south to Calgary, the home of white-collar oil industry workers.About 2,800 people without friends or family in Edmonton ended up registering at the Northlands Exhibition Center, now an emergency shelter, including Justin Dick, 23, who was lured to Fort McMurray three years ago along with his mother and stepfather, from Winnipeg, Manitoba, by hopes of sharing in the oil boom.Now, Mr. Dick said outside the exhibition hall, it looked as if the house where he lived and all their belongings had been consumed.\u201cWe just wanted to get ahead in life, and now we\u2019ve lost everything,\u201d he said.A few yards away, Malcolm MacQueen, 31, a fire extinguisher technician from Fort McMurray, said that he was already looking for another job just hours after arriving in Edmonton.\u201cYou want to remain hopeful but it\u2019s hard with the reports, so you just have to make the best of it,\u201d Mr. MacQueen said.Like many hotels, the Chateau Lacombe in downtown Edmonton had become something of an impromptu shelter, at least for those Fort McMurray residents who could afford it. Dogs and children sat around the lobby as their anxious parents tried to figure out how to move forward. In the restaurant on Wednesday night, a group of employees of Suncor, a Canadian energy company, watched television news reports about the fire and checked Twitter. Ryan Whitmarsh, 28, an engineer, said he happened to sleep late on Tuesday morning, missed a company shuttle and had to take his car to work. His inadvertent tardiness proved to be a boon a few hours later when everyone was told to evacuate immediately.At home, his father, Randy, a Suncor worker on the night shift, quickly packed frozen food and drinks into a cooler, which they loaded into Mr. Whitmarsh\u2019s car along with a tent and their passports. The highway to Edmonton was so jammed that they camped on the road on Tuesday night, waking up to spot good Samaritans offering free gasoline to stranded motorists. While Ryan Whitmarsh and his father are safe, worries about his $427,000 house torment him. \u201cI have a knot in my stomach just thinking about it,\u201d he said.Though most residents cling to the faint hope that their homes and belongings have survived, some are less optimistic. Asked what she expected to find upon returning to her condominium, Mona Wesala, 27, a Kenyan engineer who works for Suncor, slowly shook her head. \u201cAshes,\u201d she said.Not all evacuees had flights to safety. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported that thousands of cars were lined up behind a blockade north of Fort McMurray on Thursday. As frustration mounted, the broadcaster reported, more than two dozen cars and trucks tried to force their way through police cars acting as barriers but stopped when at least one police officer stood in front of his cruiser.What will replace the ashes of Fort McMurray and what to do with the displaced remained questions for the future on Thursday. While temperatures that were unusually warm even for midsummer were replaced by more seasonable conditions on Thursday, the fire showed no obvious signs of abating. Fire officials told reporters that without significant rainfall, it could remain out of control and continue growing for several more days. Aerial bombers were covering the buildings still standing in Fort McMurray with water and flame retardants. But officials said those measures would not guarantee the buildings\u2019 protection.Fort McMurray has loomed large in the collective imagination of Canada. To environmentalists, its name is synonymous with degradation. Others view the oil sands a major technological achievement. And many Canadians, without ever visiting, imagined an out-of-control boom town rampant with crime and social problems. Both, along with eye-popping real estate prices, exist but became inflated in retellings beyond the city.Ms. Curnew, like a disproportionate number of Fort McMurray residents, came from Newfoundland, a province of chronic unemployment, 22 years ago to build a new life. She hopes to stay in her adopted province.While she said that she has encountered nothing but kindness since Tuesday, Ms. Curnew was disturbed over much of what she saw on social media.\u201cI\u2019ve been reading some of the negative comments on Facebook people, saying, \u2018All these materialistic people, they\u2019re getting what they deserve, their crap town is burning,\u2019\u201d she said before boarding a chartered city bus to Northlands. \u201cI started out as a single mom there just renting, worked it up and got a house all myself. I\u2019m not materialistic. I was just there living within my means just trying to raise my son.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementMay 24, 2016Dawn Eden GoldsteinChristopher HaleLast week, Pope Francis told a group of Catholic women that he would set up a commission to study the role of female deacons in the early history of the Catholic Church with an eye toward reinstating a modern version of the diaconate open to women.As a traditionalist dedicated to conserving some of the earliest traditions of the Roman Catholic Church, I think this is a wise decision. Like their male counterparts, female deacons would be able to baptize, preside at marriages, funerals and other liturgies, and preach homilies during Mass. To me it\u2019s clear: The people of God need to hear the good news of Jesus Christ preached from the lived experience of more than half its members. After all, that was the way it was in the beginning.After Jesus\u2019 death, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb to remove his body. On the way there, she encountered a gardener. The gardener revealed himself to be the risen Christ. As Mary ran to tell the other disciples the good news, she held within her the very reason of the church: to share God\u2019s saving love in Jesus. In that moment, she was Jesus\u2019s first evangelist and -- perhaps -- the church\u2019s first deacon.Critics of the women diaconate will argue that such a move will both suggest the church will one day ordain women to the priesthood. This slippery slope fallacy is the result of bad theology and a profound misunderstanding of the intrinsic nature and primary mission of the diaconate.Rather, deacons have a particular nonliturgical focus on service to God\u2019s people -- particularly those who are most excluded. St. Lawrence, one of the church\u2019s earliest and most famed deacons, vivified this reality. Lawrence\u2019s subversive act ended in his martyrdom at the hands of the emperor. Being a deacon isn\u2019t easy. It\u2019s gritty work. It requires one to be in touch with the realities of others, their hopes and joy, and their sufferings and anxieties.It\u2019s a tough job. And as the old adage goes, when you have a tough job, give it to a woman.\nCatholic deacons, priests and bishops are all clerics; each receives in ordination the sacrament of Holy Orders. Those advocating for women deacons claim that, in the first centuries of the church, women deacons received the sacrament of Holy Orders just as male ones did. But did they really? As a woman, I believe with Francis that, when both clergy and laity think the clerical office means power rather than service, the answer is not to upend the sacramental system by ordaining women. The answer is rather to dissociate Holy Orders from unholy ambition \u2014 something that requires a change not of doctrine but of hearts.\nDawn argues that making women deacons is an attempt to \u201cclericalize\u201d women. Clericalism is a charged word in the Catholic Church. It is an unhealthy attitude of profound deference toward the clergy. It misconstrues an unjust power dynamic between the clergy and laity, where priests and other clerics can lord over the people of God. I agree with Dawn: Clericalism is a total affront to the Gospel of Jesus Christ.Where Dawn goes wrong is when she suggests that women who want to become deacons suffer from such clericalism. I find no widespread evidence that women want to join the diaconate as part of some power grab. This isn\u2019t, as Dawn suggests, \u201cunholy ambition.\u201dThis isn\u2019t about clericalism. This isn\u2019t about grabbing a mantle of power. This isn\u2019t about \u201cunholy ambition.\u201d It\u2019s about allowing women to more effectively serve God\u2019s holy and faithful people. It\u2019s about allowing those same people of God to experience in a consistent way the wise and fruitful pastoral experience of more than half the members of our apostolic faith.Dawn is correct that Pope John Paul II said that ordination to the priesthood has \u201cfrom the beginning always been reserved to men alone.\u201d But notice that John Paul II didn\u2019t say the same about women in the diaconate. The question of ordaining women to the priesthood and including them in the diaconate is all together different-in-kind. The question before us is about diaconate alone. To deny women entry into the diaconate because of this slippery slope fallacy is unwarranted. Christopher, we agree clericalism is wrong. But if you think my argument \u201cgoes wrong\u201d when I associate the women\u2019s ordination movement with clericalism, take it up with Francis, who does the same whenever he is asked about women\u2019s ordination.What makes it clear that Francis did not intend to raise hopes of women\u2019s ordination is his response to the religious sister who asked if he would let women preach at Mass. He recalled that, as archbishop of Buenos Aires, he was approached \u201cthree or four times\u201d by priests asking if they could \u201cclericalize\u201d a layman in their parish: \u201cHe knows how to organize things, he gets things done. \u2026 Shall we make him a deacon?\u201d His answer was always the same: \u201cNo! Let him remain a layperson.\u201dShould the Roman Catholic Church allow women to become deacons?"}

{"Headline": "Why Might Vietnam Let U.S. Military Return? China", "Date": "2016-05-19", "News": "Supported byCAM RANH BAY, Vietnam \u2014 The ghosts of the Vietnam War have finally faded at the strategic port of Cam Ranh Bay. More than 40 years ago, United States forces left this massive base where Marines landed, F-4C jets loaded up for bombing raids, and wounded American soldiers were treated.Now, some Vietnamese say they are yearning for the American military to return.\u201cOn Facebook, there was a question recently: What do you want from President Obama\u2019s visit?\u201d said Vo Van Tao, 63, who fought as a young North Vietnamese infantry soldier against the United States. \u201cSome people said they wanted democracy. I said I wanted the Americans to come back to Cam Ranh Bay. A lot of people agreed with me.\u201dMr. Obama is scheduled to arrive in Vietnam on Sunday, the third visit by an American president since the war ended. The big question he is expected to answer is whether Washington will lift a partial arms embargo and allow Vietnam to buy lethal weapons from the United States. The Communist government has long asked for the ban to be revoked, and American access to Cam Ranh Bay could be part of the payoff.Washington has for years made lifting the ban contingent on Vietnam\u2019s improving human rights for its people, and has prodded Vietnam to allow more freedom of speech and to release political prisoners. But as tensions with China have escalated in the South China Sea, the sentiment in the Obama administration has shifted toward lifting the ban, American officials familiar with the discussions said.Vietnam\u2019s government, pressed by an ever more powerful China, knows it cannot stand up to Beijing alone and is cautiously moving toward increased ties with the United States.More recently, China has built artificial islands with military runways in the South China Sea just 300 miles from the Vietnamese coast.Vietnam\u2019s needs dovetail with those of the United States, which has been encouraging maritime states in Southeast Asia to better defend themselves, an effort partly aimed at keeping the United States from being dragged into a direct naval conflict with China.The prospect of access to Cam Ranh Bay, where the Vietnamese have built a new international port, provides another enticement for lifting the ban.\u201cIf the United States can get regular access to Cam Ranh Bay, it would be very advantageous to maintaining the balance of power with China,\u201d said Alexander L. Vuving, a Vietnam specialist at the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies in Honolulu. \u201cIf something happens in the South China Sea, it takes a while for the U.S. to get there. China can get there more quickly.\u201dThe Vietnamese, who shun alliances and forbid foreign bases, have made clear they would not entertain exclusive use of the facilities by the United States but would allow it to share the base with others. Singaporean and Japanese vessels this year were the first to use the facility.Deputy Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken assured Hanoi during a recent visit to Vietnam that Washington was not seeking a base here.Lifting the embargo would go a long way toward shoring up Washington\u2019s credibility among conservatives in the Vietnamese military who fear the Obama administration sees improved relations as a way to bring multiparty democracy to Vietnam, experts said.China has been feverishly piling sand onto reefs in the South China Sea, creating seven new islets in the region and straining already taut geopolitical tensions.\u201cTo get over the resistance of the Vietnamese military, the U.S. has to show its good intentions by lifting the arms embargo,\u201d Dr. Vuving said. Doing so would \u201copen the door\u201d to closer military cooperation, he said, and access to Cam Ranh Bay would most likely follow.Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter said in a Senate hearing last month that he favored lifting the embargo.Last week, the assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor, Tom Malinowski, met with human rights leaders and government officials in Hanoi for a final human rights assessment before the Obama visit. The State Department said he urged Hanoi to \u201crelease political prisoners without condition\u201d and make other human rights improvements.Vietnam still has more than 100 political prisoners, activists here say, including bloggers and lawyers whose only crime was to criticize the government.An American official who was briefed on the visit said there had been positive signals from the Vietnamese. Mr. Blinken had praised the government in a speech last month for \u201csome progress\u201d on human rights, notably allowing independent trade unions for the first time.Surprisingly, a leading dissident has come out in favor of lifting the arms embargo, telling Mr. Malinowski the issue should not be linked to the release of political prisoners.\u201cIf Obama lifts the embargo totally that would be great for Vietnam and Vietnam-U.S. relations,\u201d said Nguyen Quang A, the founder of the Civil Society Forum in Hanoi. \u201cThe Communists say the U.S. needs to respect our legitimacy and don\u2019t make trouble. That\u2019s the negative from our point of view. But the positive is it starts a new era with the United States.\u201dLifting the embargo is not expected to produce a windfall for American defense suppliers.It would also be costly for Vietnam to switch from heavy equipment made in Russia, long Vietnam\u2019s main arms supplier, to American-made equipment.But Vietnam wants to diversify from its reliance on Russian arms. It is using India to train its crews on Russian-built submarines, and is looking to Israel for some weapons.Last week, Vietnamese officials met with American military suppliers, including Boeing and Lockheed Martin, at a symposium in Hanoi to discuss the needs of the Vietnamese military.Christopher W. Sfedu, who attended the meeting and is director of international expansion for EDI-USA, a Philadelphia-based supplier of communications equipment, said communications software appeared to be near the top of the military\u2019s wish list.The Russians still have privileged rights at Cam Ranh Bay, using the base for tanker aircraft that refuel reconnaissance flights over Guam.Protected on its southern and eastern flanks by hills looming up from the South China Sea, Cam Ranh Bay juts inland for 20 miles, the largest sheltered harbor in Southeast Asia, and its most strategic because of its deep water.For Mr. Tao, a local resident, the return of the Americans cannot happen fast enough.\u201cThe Vietnamese people are very angry at the Chinese airstrips in the Spratlys,\u201d he said, referring to the disputed islands in the South China Sea. \u201cWe figured out it will take them only one hour to come and bomb Saigon.\u201dAn article on May 20 about signs that some Vietnamese are eager for the American military to return to Cam Ranh Bay base, which the United States used in the Vietnam War, referred incorrectly to the use of the base during the war by American warplanes. While fighter jets took off from the base, B-52 bombers did not.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sadiq Khan vs. Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-05-09", "News": "Supported byThe most important political event of recent weeks was not the emergence of Donald J. Trump as the presumptive presidential nominee of the Republican Party but the election of Sadiq Khan, the Muslim son of a London bus driver, as mayor of London.Trump has not won any kind of political office yet, but Khan, the Labour Party candidate, crushed Zac Goldsmith, a Conservative, to take charge of one of the world\u2019s great cities, a vibrant metropolis where every tongue is heard. In his victory, a triumph over the slurs that tried to tie him to Islamist extremism, Khan stood up for openness against isolationism, integration against confrontation, opportunity for all against racism and misogyny. He was the anti-Trump.It is worth noting that under the ban on Muslim noncitizens entering the country that Trump proposes, Khan would not be allowed to visit the United States. To use one of Trump\u2019s favorite phrases, this would be a \u201ccomplete and total disaster.\u201d It would make America a foul mockery in the eyes of a world already aghast at the Republican candidate\u2019s rise.Khan\u2019s election is important because it gives the lie to the facile trope that Europe is being taken over by jihadi Islamists. It underscores the fact that terrorist acts hide a million quiet success stories among European Muslim communities. One of seven children of a Pakistani immigrant family, Khan grew up in public housing and went on to become a human rights lawyer and government minister. He won more than 1.3 million votes in the London election, a personal mandate unsurpassed by any politician in British history.Khan has also reached out to Britain\u2019s Jewish community, vigorously disavowing the creeping anti-Semitism in Labour ranks that last month saw Ken Livingstone, a former London mayor, suspended from the party.Trump as a politician is a product of American fear and anger above all. In the past several weeks, a U.C. Berkeley student has been escorted off a Southwest Airlines flight because he was heard speaking Arabic, and an olive-skinned, curly haired Italian Ivy League economist was taken off an American Airlines flight because he was spotted scribbling mathematical calculations that his seatmate found suspicious.Trump \u2014 described to me by Norm Ornstein, the political scientist, as \u201cthe most insecure and ego-driven person in the country\u201d \u2014 is the mouthpiece of this frightened America that sees threats everywhere (even in an Italian mathematician).When Trump declares, \u201cAmerica First will be the major and overriding theme of my administration,\u201d the rest of the world hears an angry nation flexing its muscles.Khan\u2019s rise, by contrast, is a story of victory over the fears engendered by 9/11. His victory is a rebuke to Osama bin Laden, the Islamic State, jihadi ideology of every stripe \u2014 and to the hatemongering politicians like Trump who choose to play the Muslim-equals-danger game. Khan has argued that greater integration is essential and \u201ctoo many British Muslims grow up without really knowing anyone from a different background.\u201dSigmund Freud wrote, \u201cIt is impossible to overlook the extent to which civilization is built upon a renunciation of instinct.\u201d Donald Trump has written: \u201cI have learned to listen and trust my gut. It\u2019s one of my most valued counselors.\u201d He recently said, \u201cWe must, as a nation, be more unpredictable.\u201dRight.Put together an egotist, a bully, immense power and a taste for gut-driven unpredictability and you have a dangerous brew that could put civilization at risk. Those small fingers would have access to the nuclear codes if Trump was elected.In this context, Sadiq Khan\u2019s victory is reassuring because he represents currents in the world \u2014 toward global identity and integration \u2014 that will prove stronger over time than the tribalism and nativism of Trump.Advertisement"}

Facebook\u2019s clumsy experiment in news management exposes the inherent problems when the news feed that people get is based on \u201ctheir past actions on Facebook.\u201d It contributes to our present Balkanized culture of different groups getting \u201cthe news\u201d filtered through their own prisms.TED DUPONTMontclair, N.J.I am not surprised by right-wing protests and left-wing counterstatements about the alleged tampering with algorithms used to pick articles trending on Facebook, a privately operated entity that is not government regulated. This is nothing new.Years ago, when television was a dominant source of news, there was the Fairness Doctrine to supposedly allow alternative views to get on air. It was dropped as it was found unnecessary. However, it mostly worked.With its passing, many broadcast outlets simply edit the news they offer. There is Fox News, an entire network that edits to the right. There is MSNBC, which is doing it to the left.The conclusion I reach is that this is a tempest in a teapot. Is there a need for a solution? I think not.ROBERT HIRSTMassapequa, N.Y.To the Editor: Frank Bruni argues that Facebook creates a pressure to conform that warps our points of view. This does not mirror my experience.So while Facebook may create online bubbles for like-minded people, encouraging our tendencies to fall into the trap of confirmation bias, it also provides an important tool to help us broaden our exposure to differing ideas.JEFFREY L. FALICKRoyal Oak, Mich.To the Editor: Thanks to Frank Bruni for his column on the way Facebook warps our worldview. These days, given the near universal penetration of social media, I\u2019m encouraged every time I see an article about the enormous effects (largely harmful, I\u2019m afraid) that they are having on us.As a professor of literature, I\u2019m particularly concerned about the effect these media are having on the ability of students to process difficult, emotionally and intellectually complex texts. As Mr. Bruni notes, the preference engines of social media lead us away from opinions that are unfamiliar to us. I fear that the decline of complex reading ability means that even if students are able to access diverse opinion, they\u2019re less able to understand it.I think a connection can be made to the astounding success of Donald Trump. As a lover of textual ingenuity, I\u2019m most struck, in Mr. Trump\u2019s speeches, by the mind-numbing syntactic simplicity of his utterances, by the lack of logical coordination and subordination, and by the repetition of basic subject-verb-object sentences with little in the way of coherent connection.Our social media, and now our politics, are leading away from the complex syntax that allows for full living and thinking.NICK WILLIAMSPoland, Ind.The writer is an associate professor of English at Indiana University.Zeynep Tufekci\u2019s article was well considered and shed a lot of light on the algorithm-driven decision-making process, but there\u2019s another aspect that I think should be included.If my opinions skew liberal or conservative, it\u2019s likely that my list of friends also reflects that. I\u2019m more likely to have Facebook friends who tend to have similar views and opinions to mine. As I follow their posts more, that bias dominates my newsfeed. As I diversify my ideological portfolio, the biases should mathematically mellow a bit.DAVID W. JONESLiberty, Mo.To the Editor: If there is bias at Facebook, what would be wrong with that? I\u2019m a conservative, but I believe that as a public company Facebook is under no obligation to be objective.If conservatives suss out that Facebook is a not-so-friendly place for their ideas, they can always go elsewhere for news. Find a good newspaper (like The Times), read it and make objective evaluations of the information it provides, but don\u2019t go to the information equivalent of a bubble gum machine as your primary news source.As conservatives we can\u2019t decry demands for equality of outcomes and then complain when we don\u2019t get a 50 percent share of media coverage reflecting our views. We are at a pivotal juncture for our nation\u2019s politics; the direction we take will ultimately be decided by ideas and not algorithms.DUDLEY BOKOSKIGreensboro, N.C.It is well known that Facebook collects data on its users and sells it. We notice shopping website ads on our Facebook newsfeed minutes after visiting those sites. But I believe that is the trade-off in our modern, money-driven world to be able to use Facebook.But I am not O.K. with Facebook\u2019s human-controlled algorithm determining what news shows up on my newsfeed. Facebook has become a main source of news for me and many other Facebook users. How do we know that we are getting the most accurate account of the biggest news stories of the day? Journalists are supposed to be our nation\u2019s news gatekeepers \u2014 not Facebook, a social media site.So while we seem to be distraught over Facebook\u2019s stealing our browser information, I think we need to be more concerned about Facebook\u2019s playing gatekeeper.MADDY GILDERSLEEVEVadnais Heights, Minn.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Dear Evan Hansen\u2019 Puts a Twist on Teenage Angst", "Date": "2016-05-22", "News": "Supported byWhat\u2019s Evan so anxious about? Well, what have you got?Even ordering in food \u2014 a seemingly stress-free transaction, as his mother points out, in the age of online access \u2014 sends Evan into a tailspin of fear.\u201cYou have to talk to the delivery person when they come to the door,\u201d he explains. \u201cThen they have to make change. You have to stand there while it\u2019s silent and they\u2019re counting the change and \u2026 \u201d His voice trails off, as he envisions the horrific scene in his angst-addled mind.But it\u2019s primarily the agony of being a misfit facing his first day as a high school senior \u2014 with a crush on a junior he can\u2019t bring himself to approach \u2014 that gives Evan the jitters. He has been advised by his therapist to improve his self-image by writing himself daily pep notes.As he\u2019s dutifully printing one out at school, it\u2019s snatched up by another outsider, the black-clad Connor (Mike Faist), who stuffs it in his pocket. And noticing that poor Evan has been unable to find anyone to sign the cast on his broken arm, Connor scrawls his name across it with a mocking sneer.When Connor subsequently commits suicide, his grieving family \u2014 which happens to include Zoe (Laura Dreyfuss), the very girl on whom Evan has long been crushing \u2014 reaches out to Evan, assuming that the letter they found in Connor\u2019s pocket was written to his best friend. Corroborating evidence: that lone signature on Evan\u2019s cast. Connor\u2019s family had thought he had no friends at all.Evan finds himself faced with the kind of moral dilemma that would send even the most tempered soul into crisis mode. Should he tell the truth and both embarrass himself and disappoint Connor\u2019s family? Or should he allow them to believe what they want to believe, that the alienated Connor, whose antisocial behavior made him an outcast even at home, was not really the suffering soul they believed him to be? The letter ended: \u201cWould anyone even notice if I disappeared tomorrow?\u201dThe clever book, by Steven Levenson, tracks Evan\u2019s sudden ascendancy from a neglected nerd to the lionized leader of a social media movement to combat the pressures that lead kids like Connor \u2014 and Evan \u2014 to such dire extremes. (The set, designed by David Korins, features a series of scrims across which Peter Nigrini\u2019s projections \u2014 of tweets and Facebook posts and Instagram feeds \u2014 almost constantly scroll, evoking the sometimes treacherous, sometimes buoying virtual waters in which high-schoolers swim.)At the same time, Evan \u2014 whose mother, Heidi (Rachel Bay Jones), a nurse\u2019s aide, works or goes to class most nights \u2014 is drawn into the embrace of Connor\u2019s better-off parents. Larry (John Dossett) and Cynthia (Jennifer Laura Thompson) are happy to have a surrogate son to fill the void left by Connor, as Evan is happy to find a welcome in a more conventional family. (Evan\u2019s father left long ago.)Although it occasionally trades in perky caricature \u2014 specifically in the character of the hyper-achieving Alana (a very funny Kristolyn Lloyd), who appoints herself co-president of the \u201cConnor Project\u201d \u2014 for the most part Mr. Levenson\u2019s book sensitively explores Evan\u2019s predicament. Among his solutions: enlisting his \u201cfamily friend\u201d Jared (an amusingly snarky Will Roland) to create a series of backdated emails between Evan and Connor.The songs, by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (\u201cDogfight,\u201d \u201cA Christmas Story\u201d), strike the same complex notes, with shapely, heartfelt lyrics that expose the tensions and conflicts that Connor\u2019s death and Evan\u2019s involvement cause in both families. The music, played by a small but excellent band on a platform upstage, is appealingly unstrident pop-rock, with generous doses of acoustic guitar, keyboards and strings. It\u2019s the finest, most emotionally resonant score yet from this promising young songwriting team.Ms. Jones is particularly touching as Evan\u2019s overworked mother, whose deep love for her son is expressed in her attention to his sensitivities, but who also develops her own thin skin when she sees Evan turning to another family for emotional support. Ms. Thompson\u2019s bright soprano is always a pleasure to hear, and while Mr. Dossett\u2019s singing is less assured, he affectingly illustrates how Larry\u2019s quasi-paternal relationship with Evan helps chip away at his remote veneer. And as Zoe, who is at first dubious about Evan\u2019s friendship with her brother \u2014 how could the bully who tormented her be the sensitive soul revealed in those emails? \u2014 Ms. Dreyfuss is understated and lovely.But the appeal of \u201cDear Evan Hansen\u201d is virtually inseparable from the endearing awkwardness that Mr. Platt brings to the stage. With his eyes blinking and twitching nervously, Evan has trouble conducting even the most minimal conversation without somehow twisting himself into a pretzel of self-doubt. His hands flutter nervously, as if trying to semaphorically erase his latest awkward utterance.But when Mr. Platt sings Evan\u2019s songs \u2014 including the touching introductory cri de coeur, \u201cWaving Through a Window\u201d \u2014 we can simultaneously hear the heartsore, conflicted young man and the intelligent, kindly kid buried inside him. And as Evan blossoms under the attention his notoriety draws, Mr. Platt illuminates both his growing sense of self-esteem and the remorse that practicing his deception \u2014 however well intended \u2014 causes him.At times Mr. Platt\u2019s performance feels so exposed that you want to look away, to give him some breathing room. But it\u2019s impossible. Mr. Platt draws us so deeply into the character\u2019s psyche that it would be like looking in a mirror and trying not to see your reflection.Advertisement"}

Until 2013, the San Francisco company\u2019s board was all-male. It was all Caucasian until last year. That has attracted criticism for a lack of representation of the diverse ethnic groups that use Twitter. Ms. Lee is the first African-American, and the third woman, to serve on the company\u2019s board.Ms. Lee\u2019s appointment also breaks with the prevailing representation of Silicon Valley tech companies, which are disproportionately white and male.

{"Headline": "Facebook \u2018Trending\u2019 List Skewed by Individual Judgment, Not Institutional Bias", "Date": "2016-05-20", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Last July, in a seventh-floor conference room at Facebook\u2019s Lower Manhattan offices, a small group met to discuss the future of news media on the social network.Facebook leaders were bullish on a relatively new section of the site that surfaced the most popular news stories, like news of the terrorist attacks on the Charlie Hebdo newspaper in Paris or stories about Chris Hemsworth\u2019s genitalia. They decided the effort, called Trending Topics and until then a pilot operation by a dozen or so staff members, should be doubled to more than 30 people. One goal for the team: use human judgment to make algorithms better at finding news on Facebook.\u201cWe asked, do we consider ourselves Facebook journalists?\u201d said Benjamin Fearnow, a former news curator at Facebook who worked on Trending Topics for close to a year, until April, and who attended the meeting. \u201cWe straddled that very thin line between social media and news. None of us really knew how it was going to play out.\u201dAn examination of Trending Topics, based on interviews with current and former Facebook employees and a demonstration of the curator tools, found that Facebook\u2019s employees were not directed to squelch conservative news on the site, nor would that be easily accomplished by a staff member who wished to do so.Instead, these people said, Trending Topics was a fledgling, ill-managed group \u2014 made up largely of recent college graduates with little work experience \u2014 where individual judgment of news was encouraged. That led to inconsistencies in how the most popular stories were presented, along with departures from the team, eventually landing the group in the controversy that spotlights Facebook\u2019s huge role in the type of information people see every day.\u201cWe\u2019ve reflected a lot,\u201d said Justin Osofsky, Facebook\u2019s vice president for global operations and media partnerships, which includes Trending Topics. He said Facebook had \u201cidentified ways in which we should have improved.\u201dTrending Topics, introduced in a handful of countries in January 2014 with a small staff based in New York, was Facebook\u2019s first major attempt to comb through the avalanche of information being posted on the social network and to make it easier for people to find current events \u2014 such as the pope\u2019s visit to the United States and anything involving the Kardashians \u2014 and to read and talk about them on Facebook.It was a shot at competitors like Google and Twitter, according to two former news curators who spoke on condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Facebook wanted people to search for more content \u2014 like news \u2014 on its own site instead of on Google, the search king, or Twitter, which was widely regarded as better for real-time news, they said.That is where humans came in. Facebook enlisted a set of 20-somethings as curators, copy editors and team leads, charged with sifting through the material the algorithms unearthed. They were crucial, they were told, to improving Facebook\u2019s ability to discern, over time, what constitutes news.Mr. Fearnow, who was terminated from Facebook in April for breaking his nondisclosure agreement, said his job as a curator was to \u201cmassage the algorithm.\u201d Managers were ambivalent about allowing staff members to identify themselves as curators or editors on their LinkedIn profiles, he said, given concerns that outsiders would notice the element of human judgment and ask questions about it.Facebook declined to comment, citing employee confidentiality.During each eight-hour shift, curators were presented with a continuously refreshing list of trending terms they had to sort through and identify as junk or relevant, and draft descriptions for those topics. After labeling them and checking whether they had been independently reported by a number of major news outlets, curators gave topics a value that would make them more or less likely to show up on individual users\u2019 pages. Each user saw a different list of personalized Topics based on their past actions on Facebook.In Facebook\u2019s editorial guidelines, curators were also told to \u201cblacklist,\u201d or push aside, junk topics that appeared in their queue for a period of eight to 24 hours before they could potentially appear again, according to current and former employees. When duplicate or confusing topics arose, curators were told to \u201cinject\u201d a more accurate Topic term. Copy editors and team leads would also oversee and approve the choices being made.The work was monotonous \u2014 and not entirely gratifying. Workers were incentivized to compete against one another to clear the most trends from their queue, former employees said. Top performers were given \u201cpoints\u201d that could be spent on Facebook paraphernalia like T-shirts.Staff turnover was high, they said. Most on the team were contractors, though some were full-time employees. That led to a sense of inequality between the two groups, some said. Starting annual salaries for contractors were in the mid-to-high $50,000s, according to former staff members.Facebook denied the allegations. In a demonstration of its internal tools this week at its headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., Facebook showed multiple layers of scrutiny by staff members that would make it extremely difficult for other workers not to notice an intentional manipulation of the system, nor was it likely to be technically possible.Former employees agree. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see any kind of intentional, outright bias,\u201d Mr. Fearnow said. \u201cThere were an amazing amount of steps taken to avoid that.\u201d He said he regularly wrote headlines and descriptions for far-right conservative sites or personalities that were visible on Trending Topics.Still, current and former Facebook employees said the personal judgment of curators was integral. Unconscious bias, they said, is tough to prevent. Facebook\u2019s 28-page editorial guidelines were also constantly updated and changed, former curators said, and engineers would tweak the product with little or no notice, making it difficult to keep up.Facebook said it was improving employee training to make its guidelines for news curators clearer, including renaming some of the more nefarious-sounding terminology in its guidelines, changing \u201cblacklist\u201d to \u201crevisit,\u201d and \u201cinjection\u201d to \u201ctopic correction.\u201d The company continues to investigate whether any curators intentionally tried to suppress conservative news.Executives said that for an experimental product, they got a lot wrong.\u201cThis is a relatively early product,\u201d Mr. Osofsky said. \u201cThere are aspects of it that clearly we\u2019re continuing to work on.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republicans Return to Congress Facing Unavoidable Issue: Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-05-10", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As the House and Senate return in full from a recess on Tuesday, Republican lawmakers may try to run \u2014 and some will \u2014 but they cannot hide from the question that is likely to dog them until Election Day: How do they solve a problem like Donald J. Trump?Republican members of Congress, guided by a complicated soup of regional interests, constituent pressure and inner moral voices, will be hard pressed to avoid taking a position on Mr. Trump now that he is their presumptive presidential nominee.Current polls show an uphill battle for Donald Trump should he and Hillary Clinton face off in the general election.House Republican leaders are also fractured. While Mr. Ryan is withholding his support, the No. 2 House Republican, Kevin McCarthy of California, and the No. 3 Republican, Steve Scalise of Louisiana, have backed Mr. Trump.Lawmakers have grappled with whether or not to support the presumptive nominee.In the Senate, many members have remained vague about where they stand, and there are divisions within states. In Nebraska, Senator Ben Sasse has repeatedly said he cannot support Mr. Trump and has called for a third-party candidate to step in. The senior senator from the state, Deb Fischer, said she would support Mr. Trump.\u201cI don\u2019t agree with his strategy,\u201d she said of Mr. Sasse. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hand this election to Hillary Clinton, and that\u2019s what a third candidate would do.\u201dRepresentative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a senior member of the House Republican conference, said he expected a majority of his fellow Republicans in Congress to eventually line up behind Mr. Trump with varying levels of enthusiasm, even though he might jeopardize the party\u2019s chances in some Senate and House races.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.\u201cYou play this game with the cards you\u2019re dealt,\u201d Mr. Cole said. \u201cThe G.O.P. primary electorate has dealt incumbents running for re-election Trump. In some districts, Trump will help. In some, he will hurt. In most, he will impact the margin rather than the outcome of the congressional race. Members know that and will react accordingly.\u201dHe added: \u201cRepublican members are far better prepared for the volatility and uncertainty of this election than they were in 2006 and 2008,\u201d when the Democrats seized control of Congress and the presidency. \u201cThey are better organized, funded and positioned than they were, because most of them saw this coming. And most of them are battle tested.\u201dThat does not mean that some are not deeply disturbed. Senator James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma, offered support of Mr. Trump on Monday with the enthusiasm of someone receiving a tetanus shot \u2014 it is necessary, in his view, but not pleasant.\u201cThere are a lot of people in my state who have been asking me, \u2018Is this who we are?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Lankford said. \u201cI say yes.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ask Well: Taking a Daily Aspirin", "Date": "2016-05-06", "News": "Reader Question \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 1388 votesAdults ages 50 to 69 who are at high risk for heart attack or stroke should take a daily low-dose aspirin to prevent both heart attacks and strokes as well colorectal cancer. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the latest advice from the United States Preventive Services Task Force, an influential expert panel that published a final recommendation last month in Annals of Internal Medicine.It was the first time a major medical organization took this \u00e2\u0080\u009cnew approach\u00e2\u0080\u009d of endorsing the broad use of aspirin to prevent cancer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich makes a great deal of sense,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Eric Jacobs, a researcher at the American Cancer Society. The recommended dose is a low-dose or \u00e2\u0080\u009cbaby\u00e2\u0080\u009d aspirin, typically sold in doses of 81 milligrams.Low-dose aspirin has long been recommended for some people who have had a heart attack or some forms of stroke, and for certain people at high risk for heart disease. Several of the factors that put one at risk for heart disease \u00e2\u0080\u0094 such as obesity and being physically inactive \u00e2\u0080\u0094 also play a role in colon cancer.Some experts think aspirin is too risky for people who have never suffered a heart attack, since aspirin increases the risks of potentially dangerous internal bleeding.But the task force\u00e2\u0080\u0099s review of the evidence concluded that people in their 50s and 60s who have at least a 10 percent chance of having a heart attack or stroke over the next 10 years could benefit from a daily low-dose aspirin. Those in their 60s are at greater risk for bleeds, which increase with age, so doctors should weigh risks and benefits in individual patients. There is no recommendation for aspirin use for people under 50 or for those 70 and older.If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever had a gastrointestinal bleed or ulcer, you probably should not take aspirin. Blood thinners, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, omega-3 supplements and uncontrolled high blood pressure also increase your risk of bleeding, and the risk of a bleed is higher for men than for women. Daily aspirin therapy should continue for at least 10 years.Aspirin may also lower the risk of other types of cancer, including esophageal and stomach cancers, as well as cancers of the breast, prostate and lung, though the level of evidence for these \u00e2\u0080\u009cis too weak to draw strong conclusions\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Jacobs said.Related:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "A Potent Side Effect to the Flint Water Crisis: Mental Health Problems", "Date": "2016-04-30", "News": "Supported byFLINT, Mich. \u2014 Health care workers are scrambling to help the people here cope with what many fear will be chronic consequences of the city\u2019s water contamination crisis: profound stress, worry, depression and guilt.Uncertainty about their own health and the health of their children, the open-ended nature of the crisis, and raw anger over government\u2019s role in both causing the lead contamination and trying to remedy it, are all taking their toll on Flint\u2019s residents.\u201cThe first thing I noticed when I got to Flint, quite honestly, was the level of fear and anxiety and distress,\u201d said Dr. Nicole Lurie, an assistant secretary at the Department of Health and Human Services who has been coordinating the federal recovery effort here since January. On Wednesday, President Obama will pay his first visit to the city since the lead contamination was revealed.A team of behavioral health specialists from the United States Public Health Service began addressing the mental health problem in February by providing \u201cpsychological first aid\u201d training for people interested in helping others cope with the water emergency.Genesee Health System, a local mental health agency, also created the Flint Community Resilience Group, whose members are focusing on the long-term psychological consequences of the water crisis and how to address them.With a $500,000 emergency grant from the state, the group is offering free crisis counseling at churches and the public library, and has held two community meetings on stress management. Social workers and social work students from around the state are helping with the counseling on a volunteer basis.But the need probably extends far beyond the 400 people who have been helped since the counseling started in February.Diane Breckenridge, Genesee Health\u2019s liaison to local hospitals, said she had seen \u201cpeople come into the hospitals directly related to breakdowns, nervous breakdowns, if you will.\u201d\u201cMost of it\u2019s been depression or suicidal ideation directly linked to what\u2019s going on with their children,\u201d she added. \u201cThey just feel like they can\u2019t even let their children take a bath.\u201dChildren, too, are traumatized, said Dexter Clarke, a supervisor at Genesee Health, not least because they constantly hear frightening things on television about the lead crisis, including breathless advertisements by personal injury lawyers seeking clients.\u201cI teach a fifth-grade class of little girls every Wednesday, and they\u2019re from Flint,\u201d Ms. Breckenridge said, \u201cand I just get all kinds of questions because they\u2019re terrified.\u201dA bill in the United States House of Representatives would provide $5 million for mental health needs in Flint as part of a broader aid package, but has not gotten traction. A separate aid package in the Senate appears to have more momentum, but does not include money for mental health.The state, meanwhile, is planning to send mobile crisis teams into Flint neighborhoods and to provide help to local pediatricians through a child psychiatric teleprogram.Michigan\u2019s earlier decision to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act will help more low-income residents get psychological help, although officials at Genesee Health System worry about not having enough licensed social workers to meet the eventual demand. About 15,000 additional children and pregnant women here will be eligible for Medicaid, possibly starting this month, under a temporary program that government and local officials are rushing to put together.One challenge is convincing people to seek mental health care. The Rev. Rigel J. Dawson, pastor of the North Central Church of Christ and a member of the Flint Community Resilience Group, said his focus was on persuading religious-minded residents of the majority-black city to pursue psychological help if they need it.\u201cThere\u2019s a history, especially in the African-American church, of \u2018I\u2019m strong enough spiritually to deal with it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Dawson said. \u201cYou see the signs of stress and what it\u2019s doing to the community, but we\u2019re conditioned to put on our church face and act like it\u2019s O.K.\u201dDanis Russell, the chief executive of Genesee Health System, said that while the potential for stigma had kept many here from seeking mental health services in the past, the water crisis might make them more willing.\u201cNow there\u2019s an acceptable reason,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople may say: \u2018This isn\u2019t my fault. Somebody did this to us and everybody\u2019s getting help, so I should, too.\u2019\u201dStill, Mr. Russell added, \u201cWhat the demand will look like going forward, I don\u2019t think anyone knows.\u201dFive Flint residents recently shared their accounts of the psychological impact of the crisis:Janice Berryman spends solitary days in a home scattered with pink pillows and angel figurines, following every twist of Flint\u2019s water crisis on television and trying to keep her anger at bay.Her tap water was found to have extremely high lead levels as recently as February, she said. Family members have stopped visiting, including a niece in Arkansas whose twin toddlers Ms. Berryman, 71, is aching to meet. Sometimes her loneliness brings her to tears, she said.For a while she found it helped to attend protests, and she even took a bus to Lansing in January to march outside the Capitol during Gov. Rick Snyder\u2019s State of the State address. But with heart disease, diabetes and other ailments, \u201cI just said, \u2018I\u2019ve got to back down.\u2019\u201dShe began sleeping a lot \u2014 too much, her relatives told her.\u201cIf you go to sleep, it feels like it\u2019s all going to go away,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it don\u2019t.\u201dHer doctor has persuaded her to try the crisis counseling at the public library.\u201cHe said, \u2018I think you need to, Jan, just to get your feelings out,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBut if I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s working? Adios. If they try to start pushing pills on me, I\u2019ll be gone. I don\u2019t need a bunch of pills to drug me up.\u201dTwo of Ms. Berryman\u2019s siblings died young, experiences that she said had forced her to learn endurance.\u201cI think that\u2019s why I handle this a little better than others,\u201d she said. \u201cNo matter what your anger level is, God sees you through.\u201dBob and Johanna Atwood Brown thought they were doing everything right.When reports of lead in the water supply surfaced last summer, they installed a filter on their faucet, which removes lead up to 150 parts per billion. They used bottled water for drinking, but relied on their filtered tap water for cooking, coffee or to make their 10-year-old son and his friends Kool-Aid on hot summer days.But when they had their water tested in January, they learned that it contained lead at 200 parts per billion \u2014 more than their filter was designed to handle, and far more than the federal safety threshold of 15 parts per billion.Ms. Brown said she was haunted by thoughts of her son and his friends drinking the lemonade and Kool-Aid she had made them.\u201cThe guilt is unreal,\u201d she said. \u201cI poisoned other people\u2019s children.\u201dMr. Brown said he felt as if he had failed as a father and protector of his family.\u201cYou beat yourself up,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t we do something earlier? Why didn\u2019t we test earlier?\u201dTheir son received a diagnosis of bipolar disorder and attention deficit disorder before the water crisis, and the Browns said they feared that the lead could exacerbate those problems \u2014 or produce others.He \u201chas special needs as it is, so it\u2019s hard to tell if there\u2019s a behavioral component,\u201d Ms. Brown said. \u201cThings are not clear.\u201dShe added: \u201cAre we going to get cancer from this? I\u2019m terrified.\u201dAs an outlet, Ms. Brown has started a blog and uses Facebook. She was already seeing a therapist, she said, but now the stress and guilt associated with her home\u2019s water contamination dominate her sessions.Mr. Brown said he did not talk about it much, but as the associate director in Flint for Michigan State University\u2019s Center for Economic and Community Development, he finds it therapeutic to share his story when he speaks at events and meetings.\u201cIt never leaves you,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cAt some point you just want to jump up and down and yell and scream, and then you just try to move forward. Because what are you going to say?\u201dToo often now, Nicole Lewis cannot sleep.\u201cI\u2019m up until midnight some nights because I can\u2019t shut down,\u201d she said. \u201cJust thinking about my life in general \u2014 like really, did I deserve this? Did my kids deserve this?\u201dMs. Lewis, a 29-year-old accountant and single mother of two boys, said she had also been experiencing chest pains. When they come, she lies down and drinks bottled water.\u201cYet I\u2019ve been told that this bottled water could have lead, too,\u201d she said, voicing a common concern here.To help her nerves, she recently installed a home water filtration system, paying $42.50 a month for the service on her main water supply line. She also bought a blender to make her sons smoothies with lead-leaching vegetables, like spinach and kale.But still her mind races, especially late at night. Her 7-year-old was just found to have attention deficit disorder, she said. Her 2-year-old is already showing athletic promise, but she wonders whether lead exposure will affect his ability to play sports.She also worries that living in Flint will brand her as damaged goods if she ever tries to find a job elsewhere.\u201cWhen they see my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 will they say, \u2018Oh wait, she\u2019s from Flint \u2014 she might be a huge liability for us\u2019?\u201d she said.She has no time for a therapist, she said, but regularly talks to her mother in Houston.\u201cI just vent a lot of stuff out to her,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s a listening ear.\u201dAs if there were not enough putting Maelores Collins on edge, her dog will not stop barking. She suspects Flint\u2019s water is to blame.\u201cI think he\u2019s hallucinating,\u201d she said as Wally, a Yorkshire terrier, yapped from a cage near the back door. \u201cWe need to get him tested.\u201dThe barking adds to a sense of disorder that has agitated Ms. Collins, 48, for months. She is tired of the water bottles cluttering her house, and of eating only microwaved food because she fears cooking with even filtered tap water. Small kindnesses, like her sister bringing over potpies from Kentucky Fried Chicken, keep her going.Ms. Collins blames the water for a problem that deeply troubles her: Her hair has broken off over the past six months.Her self-prescribed therapy consists of cruising the aisles of Walmart or playing bid whist, a card game, with friends. A few months ago, her doctor also prescribed Xanax, a tranquilizer, which she takes \u201cto get up\u201d in the morning, she said.\u201cI\u2019m depressed, I\u2019m angry, my anxiety is running high,\u201d said Ms. Collins, a former construction worker who has asthma and is on permanent disability.Worse off, she said, is her 12-year-old grandson, who refuses to drink even bottled water and will eat only off paper plates. The family jumped several hurdles to secure a psychiatric appointment for him in early May.\u201cHe\u2019s freaking out \u2014 he\u2019s like, \u2018We\u2019re all going to die from the water,\u2019\u201d Ms. Collins said. \u201cI said, \u2018You\u2019re young, you ain\u2019t going nowhere.\u2019 But I can\u2019t convince this boy.\u201dMs. Collins called the situation \u201ccrazy.\u201d\u201cLose your hair, your family tripping about different things, your kids leaving water bottles all over the house,\u201d she said.She laughed sharply. Wally continued his frantic barking, and she cast a withering glance his way.\u201cThis thing,\u201d she said, \u201cwill never be over.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Behind the Scenes, Billionaires\u2019 Growing Control of News", "Date": "2016-05-27", "News": "Supported byMediatorAt first blush, the secret support that the Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel provided for Hulk Hogan\u2019s lawsuit against Gawker is a salacious yarn about money, power, gossip and revenge.But it is also about something more important: an aggressive bid by the very wealthy to control the American news media at a time when it is in a financially weakened state, struggling to maintain its footing on the electronic frontier\u2019s unstable terrain.His verdict rendered, Mr. Thiel had the resources to swap his judge\u2019s gavel for an executioner\u2019s sword. Should the $140 million verdict stand up to appeal, Gawker Media will most likely cease to exist as we know it. And if too much of Gawker survives, Mr. Thiel, with an estimated net worth of $2.7 billion, indicates he will keep financing anti-Gawker lawsuits to kill off whatever is left.Mr. Thiel\u2019s campaign is in keeping with the pledge his favored candidate for president, Donald J. Trump, made to ease barriers to lawsuits against journalists. But it is actually the flip side of the media realm\u2019s new coin. Many of his fellow billionaires have gained control of news organizations by buying them or starting them.Of course, powerful media executives have long been part of the global fabric. Rupert Murdoch, the News Corporation executive chairman, has been at it for decades, and his influence over his news group has taken on mythical status.And long before Mr. Murdoch, there was one William Randolph Hearst, who defined what it meant to be a media mogul.But there is a difference between Hearst and the many billionaires who are trying to control today\u2019s news media, said David Nasaw, the author of the great Hearst biography \u201cThe Chief: The Life of William Randolph Hearst.\u201d \u201cHearst made it abundantly clear \u2014 \u2018This is my newspaper, these are my views, take or leave it,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cHearst put his editorials on the front page, with his picture, and he signed them, for God\u2019s sake.\u201dMr. Nasaw, on the other hand, sees Mr. Adelson as \u201cdissembling\u201d when he says he isn\u2019t involving himself in editorial decisions at the paper. And then there are the Silicon Valley moguls, he said, who \u201ctry to have it both ways \u2014 they try to say, you know, \u2018Oh no we\u2019re playing by the rules and we\u2019re not indulging in our personal whims.\u2019\u201dThat\u2019s because Facebook has something Hearst never had: power over the distribution of content from most major American news organizations, which increasingly rely on exposure to the huge audience Facebook provides. Facebook has said no one person or even group of people controls what news its algorithmic formulas spit out for individual news feeds.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "When she went into labor last November, 18-year-old Kema James climbed onto the back of a motorbike taxi in her village in eastern Sierra Leone and rode half an hour to the main government hospital in the nearby city of Kenema. When her baby was delivered, he was sickly yellow and stricken with sepsis, an ailment caused by bacteria in the blood, and he hung limply in the hands of the hospital staff. He died five days later before he could be named.The same fate befell 17-year-old Christina Dasama, only her child was stillborn and she suffered excessive bleeding from a vaginal tear during birth. Another woman in the maternity ward bled to death during childbirth the same week.\u00e2\u0080\u009cEveryone seemed to cover Ebola and the whole media scrum was there and then everyone kind of just left and that was like the end of it, even though for these countries it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not over,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ms. Jaques, 30, whose work focuses on women and their places within societies and explores how communities rebuild and heal after trauma. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaybe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a global problem anymore, but in this region, it still is an issue that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re fighting all the time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sierra Leone and Liberia \u00e2\u0080\u0094 two of the West African countries hardest hit by the virus \u00e2\u0080\u0094 have long ranked among the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worst for maternal health, but before the outbreak they had been slowly improving after years of civil wars that reduced both nations to ruin. Those meager gains have since been erased. Many health care workers, especially those in maternity wards, were exposed to Ebola through contact with bodily fluids and died, devastating the ranks of skilled hospital staff. Most of the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health facilities were forced to close during the epidemic, precipitating an institutional collapse.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cEbola destroyed the whole health system in Sierra Leone, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pretty sure it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the same thing in Liberia and Guinea,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Sarah Neusy, a humanitarian reproductive health adviser who worked on Ebola in Sierra Leone for Save the Children. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like having lost 10 years in terms of health quality. Now you have to train new staff from a young age, you need to restart everything.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMaking matters worse, many health care workers who survived Ebola have been reluctant to return to work, while pregnant women often avoid the poorly equipped clinics and hospitals for fear of contracting the virus or other diseases.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWomen will die at home, they will die on the way to those first small clinics and they will die after a referral on the way to a bigger hospital and in the hospital they will also die of infection or hemorrhage or whatever depending on the structure or depending on the level of staff and their qualifications, or the medications,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Neusy said.Ms. Jaques \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who was commissioned by WaterAid, an international nonprofit agency that aims to improve access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene \u00e2\u0080\u0094 spent a week at the Kenema hospital photographing life and death in the maternity ward. Her images reveal the stark conditions faced by health care workers and patients \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a lack of running water, unreliable electricity and limited access to medication and sterile equipment. In one photo, a health care worker in protective clothing uses a grimy rag to wipe down a mattress and a bloodstained gurney. In another, Ms. James stares despondently at her son on Day 3 of his short life. And then there is the burial of Ms. Dasama\u2019s baby, encased in a brown cardboard box and put in an unmarked grave. The quiet resignation of such images is as disturbing as the shocking state of the sickly babies when they emerged limp and jaundiced from the womb. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRather than an epic event, this was more like just a day in a maternity ward, even though it was shot over a week,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Jaques said by phone from her home in Istanbul. \u00e2\u0080\u009cKema and Christiana are so young to have experienced a loss, and for both women this was their first child. Yet this is the reality of the situation in a country torn by disease and civil war.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAs grim as the situation is, basic prenatal consultations can identify problems and advise expecting mothers and family members on how to improve maternal and infant health. But like many women fearful of Ebola, neither Ms. James nor Ms. Dasama sought prenatal care, and both suffered from anemia, often caused in poor countries by protein- and iron-deficient diets. Anemia causes fetal health problems and impedes blood clotting, increasing the risk of bleeding during childbirth. Pregnant women in impoverished countries like Sierra Leone are often given iron and vitamins to supplement poor diets. One of the biggest problems in Sierra Leone, including at Kenema hospital, is poor hygiene caused by the lack of running water.\u00e2\u0080\u009cRunning water and hygiene and hand washing is basic, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not talking about highly sophisticated stuff, but this affects everything,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Neusy said.Keeping the aftermath of Ebola in the spotlight was important for Ms. Jaques, but she also offers a sense of optimism by depicting the more uplifting moments when babies are born healthy and families bring food and gifts, showing how things should be.\u00e2\u0080\u009cMost of these deaths are easily preventable; this is something that can be changed, and improved,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Jaques said. \u201cIt\u2019s not hopeless.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}
{"Headline": "Health Care Ruling Gives John Boehner at Least Some Temporary Vindication", "Date": "2016-05-13", "News": "The Obama administration and its allies are confident that Thursday\u2019s federal court ruling, gutting an important part of the new health care law, will be overturned on appeal. But Republicans were not worrying about that for the moment. They were too busy celebrating the decision.After years of complaints that the Obama White House was flagrantly exceeding its executive authority on a range of issues, a federal district court judge in Washington, Rosemary W. Collyer, agreed with Republicans on the Affordable Care Act, finding that Congress had not funded a $130 billion program providing subsides to insurance companies.\u201cThis is a historic win for the Constitution and the American people,\u201d Speaker Paul D. Ryan said in a typical reaction. \u201cThe executive branch is being held accountable to We the People.\u201dThe victory was particularly sweet for former Speaker John A. Boehner, but it may have also been bittersweet. The suit was the brainchild of Mr. Boehner and members of his staff, who initiated it as a way to challenge the new health care law. They recognized that congressional Republicans were never going to be successful in repealing the health care law with Mr. Obama in the White House (i.e., the failed shutdown in 2013) and looked for a more fruitful way to undermine it. Despite his efforts, Mr. Boehner was ultimately forced out of the speakership last year by a group of hard-right conservatives who viewed him as not aggressive enough in calling the administration to account.

Its temperature can swing from 800 degrees Fahrenheit to minus 200 at night, Professor Kendall said.Enormous volcanoes erupted across its surface billions of years ago, yet the icy craters at the north pole of Mercury, where the sun never shines, are some of the coldest places in the solar system, he added.During today\u2019s transit, Mercury will look like a moving freckle on the sun.Here\u2019s what else is happening:Mother Nature is on the fence.But curb the urge to throw on a sundress or shorts.

That is because he was feeding the cows on his Iowa farm, as he does early every morning before most people have gone to work.The cartoon shows two farmers, in overalls and skewed baseball caps, chatting at a fence.\u201cI wish there was more profit in farming,\u201d one farmer says.\u201cThere is,\u201d the other replies. \u201cIn year 2015 the C.E.O.s of Monsanto, DuPont Pioneer and John Deere combined made more money than 2,129 Iowa farmers.\u201dAfter the cartoon was published last Friday, Mr. Friday said he was told in an email from an editor the next day that the cartoon would be his last for Farm News because a seed company had withdrawn its advertising in protest.For Mr. Friday, 56, the termination came as a shock. He has not only lived the farm life since he was a child, but has also used it as his muse in illustrations for just as long. He is a self-taught artist who picked up a No. 2 pencil when he was growing up on a 300-acre livestock and grains farm in Lorimor, Iowa. As a child, he sold sketches to other children on the school bus for a nickel or a dime.When he paused to talk, he revealed he was leaning against a fence, and the heifers were staring at him, hard.\u201cThey are going, How come you are not feeding me right now?\u201d Mr. Friday said. \u201cAnd I have got some bulls around the corner that are patiently waiting for me to feed them, too.\u201d\u201cI am a little bit behind, because my phone has been ringing off the hook.\u201dHe agreed to talk after the cows were fed.Later, Mr. Friday, who sometimes answers to \u201cRicky,\u201d (which is what the older women in town call him) said that the rural life had inspired the 1,090 cartoons he had drawn in pen in the 21 years he had been illustrating his Farm News column.As with the others, he had sketched the offending cartoon at his kitchen table. Then, as always, he scanned it, emailed it off to an editor and asked for confirmation that it had been received. It had been.Usually, Mr. Friday said, he receives a reply with typical editor feedback. An apostrophe goes here or a word is spelled wrong there, he said. But the cartoon was published online, with little else said.But on Saturday, an email from a news editor landed in his inbox. Mr. Friday, quoting the email, said that the cartoon \u201chad caused a storm here\u201d and that \u201cin the eyes of some, big agriculture cannot be criticized or poked fun at.\u201dHe was told his run with the Farm News, for which he said he had been paid \u201cembarrassingly low\u201d wages on a freelance basis, was over, per instructions from the publisher.Farm News is read in print and online by 24,000 households in 33 Iowa counties, according to its website. On Wednesday, a woman who answered the phone at the company said, \u201cNo comment\u201d when asked about the end of the publication\u2019s relationship with Mr. Friday. Calls to Farm News\u2019s publisher, The Messenger in Fort Dodge, Iowa, were not returned.Mr. Friday said he had never intended to make fun of anyone. He said that as an editorial cartoonist, he was illustrating news. The plight of farmers was evident last year, when commodity prices took a dive, he said.\u201cWe are kind of dictated what our wages are going to be somewhat on the stock exchange,\u201d he said.Asked why he had singled out Monsanto, DuPont and John Deere, Mr. Friday said he wanted to illustrate the differences between what a year in agriculture can look like for individual farmers and big agribusiness. He said he drew his inspiration and research from a report in The Des Moines Register and from whatever he could find on the Internet about the salaries of the chief executives of those companies.\u201cIn agriculture, you need chemicals, herbicides, seed companies and equipment,\u201d he said. \u201cI just used reputation. It was not trying to pick on anybody in this industry; it is just common knowledge.\u201cThe point of my cartoon, and I hoped that it would be self-explanatory, is that one farmer said he wishes there was more profit \u2014 and who wouldn\u2019t?\u201d he added.\u201cBut someone complained about it, and this is the philosophy I use when I explained it to my children: They were being fed by two hands,\u201d Mr. Friday said, referring to Farm News and its relationships with him and with its advertisers.\u201cThey knew they had to chose one, and they chose the hand that they knew would hurt the least,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter 21 years, that is what really bothered me.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Gen. John Rosa, said that while the college in Charleston, S.C., often arranged for transportation to religious services and made accommodations for prayer and diets based on religion, it would stop short of changing the uniform. He added that officials hoped the student would still attend.\u201cAs the Military College of South Carolina, the Citadel has relied upon a highly effective educational model requiring all cadets to adopt a common uniform,\u201d General Rosa said. \u201cUniformity is the cornerstone of this four-year leader development model.\u201dBut a spokesman for the family, Ibrahim Hooper of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said Tuesday that the student would not attend the college because she had been denied her religious rights.Mr. Hooper, who said he had spoken with the student\u2019s father, described her as heartbroken and in tears when she learned of the Citadel\u2019s decision, which he said stood in opposition to past decisions by the military to accommodate religious dress.He also said all legal options were being considered and expressed confidence that the decision would be challenged in court. \u201cWe just can\u2019t leave an unconstitutional, and frankly un-American, policy to stand,\u201d he said.The family has declined to reveal the identity of the student and her home state, Mr. Hooper said.The commitment to uniformity has long been a foundation of institutions that are conduits to the United States military.

Susan Gubar writes about life with ovarian cancer.As any medical practitioner knows, uttering the words \u00e2\u0080\u009csevere,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cinvasive\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009ccarcinoma\u00e2\u0080\u009d to a patient in remission cannot but escalate terror.  Why couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the nurse or the doctor find the ways and means immediately \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in a brief phone call or email \u2014 to put those fears in perspective?Given the paperwork, the patient load, and the long hours of medical professionals, we all understand the constraints within which physicians and nurses operate. Surely neither the nurse nor the doctor was willfully unfeeling. However, their tardy and cryptic announcements resulted in callous care. Whether a medical judgment is optimistic or pessimistic, its inept conveyance can upset or infuriate already anxious patients.Some of the women in my support group were alone, groggy from anesthesia, and in pain when a poorly articulated diagnosis of gynecological cancer unhinged them. After a debulking operation, Julia recalls, a resident involved in the surgery stood near the door, avoided eye contact, and declared, \u00e2\u0080\u009cStage 3 \u2014 we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not talking cure now, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking treatment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d When I heard similar words, I was in a crowded emergency room with only a privacy curtain between me and other patients.Julia, a practicing therapist, believes that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthese events are so traumatic that medical professionals need to look out for our emotional welfare . . . to reduce the possibility of PTSD. The person in a life-threatening emergency needs specialized mental health care.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Upon hearing a diagnosis of cancer, patients can plummet into the depressing supposition that their life is effectively over and their rapidly impending death will be painful.Another very private member of our group \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I will use her initials, I.M. \u2014 suffered through a delay between intimations of bad news and a diagnosis. After a CT scan, a hospital technician warned I.M. that she might have cancer, but he did not have the authority to discuss the matter with her. She would have to wait until her gynecologist could meet with her \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the longest and most harrowing period in her life, she said with a shiver. None of us were eased by communication strategies that have evolved since 2000 when Dr. Walter F. Baile and his associates published their paradigm for delivering bad news in The Oncologist. This article advocates a program called Spikes:  S stands for finding the appropriate setting; P for gauging the perceptions of the patient; I for obtaining the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s invitation to hear bad news; K for providing the knowledge that the patient needs to receive; E for dealing with the emotional reactions of the patient with empathy; S for concluding with a needed summary.      Despite such a thoughtful template, miscommunication does not taint only diagnosis, as I.M. realized when she went on to confide  about a more recent exchange. At her last meeting with her oncologist, they had discussed the sorry fact that the current cycle of chemotherapy had not inhibited tumor growth. The doctor gave her three choices:  returning to the drug used in her first cycle, trying a clinical trial or \u00e2\u0080\u009copting to do nothing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Alarmed and shaken by this last proposal, she felt as if he were throwing up his hands or she had somehow been fired.Because the members of our group had visited a hospice facility, we could assure her that she need never choose \u00e2\u0080\u009copting to do nothing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Even when patients decide that the struggle to combat cancer will be ineffective, they can gain access to palliative specialists who will alleviate pain and anxiety while rescuing them from pointlessly aggressive, time-consuming, expensive and debilitating treatments.It cannot be easy for oncologists to deliver bad news so frequently, but it must be worse for them when they deliver bad news badly.  The manners of patients erode as we become maddened by confusion and dread. Injurious words should never add insult to the injuries medical professionals witness and patients suffer daily.Related:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "Mr. Trump\u2019s Wild Ride", "Date": "2016-05-18", "News": "FeatureDown the homestretch with the impossible nominee.Supported byDonald Trump was on the phone with a man he had never met, a Republican delegate in Pennsylvania. It was May 2, one day before the Indiana primary election, and the private plane bearing his last name in gigantic letters was taxiing along a runway at Indianapolis International Airport. Trump proceeded to quote the numbers to the man in Pennsylvania: ahead of Clinton by 2 points in that day\u2019s Rasmussen poll, 3 points behind her in the previous week\u2019s George Washington University poll. These were the only two national polls at the moment that did not show him lagging behind the Democrat by a wide margin in the general election, but Trump was a businessman who preferred to negotiate using numbers that were in his favor.\u201cI\u2019d love your support, Phil,\u201d the candidate said as he squinted at his own handwriting, a scrawl in black marker on a piece of paper. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re the only delegate I\u2019ve talked to. But I saw you on television, and you appreciate what I do \u2014 I won your county by a massive amount, and you\u2019re respectful of that, and I just appreciate what you\u2019ve said: \u2018Having a moral obligation to support the winner\u2019 \u2014 I hadn\u2019t heard a delegate say that before.\u201dTrump thanked the delegate and hung up just as the Boeing 757 took off, en route to a final campaign stop in South Bend. He settled into his plush leather seat, beside a large cardboard box containing various documents relating to the Trump Organization\u2019s sundry enterprises. \u201cIt\u2019s hard negotiating elevator rates while you\u2019re running for president,\u201d he said. On the table before him were some notes for a speech on law and order prepared by his senior policy adviser, Stephen Miller, who sat behind the candidate around a table with a few other aides, including Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. On the more conventional presidential campaigns I have covered \u2014 George W. Bush, John McCain, Mitt Romney \u2014 the candidate\u2019s mobile inner sanctum was a hive of activity, the advisers hovering constantly over their boss, rattling off the latest polling data or words of unsolicited advice from a big donor. On Trump\u2019s plane, the aides spoke when spoken to and otherwise kept to their labors on their laptops.Trump\u2019s attention was on the large flat-screen TV on which various Fox News pundits were forecasting his probable victory in Indiana\u2019s Republican primary the following day and the bleak implications for his opponent Ted Cruz. The Republican contest, they all seemed to agree, was pretty much over. The 69-year-old billionaire now appeared destined to be Clinton\u2019s opponent in the general election. The Fox commentators, even the ones who favored Trump, seemed to struggle for the words to convey this eventuality.The candidate took in the good news with an oddly inert expression. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll get beat tomorrow,\u201d he said, for at least the third time that day. Not a single poll had given him cause for worry. But for all his swagger, Trump had an awareness of unseen, deal-breaking contingencies that held his triumphalism in check. He was compulsively superstitious; twice on other plane trips I had seen him toss a few granules of salt over his left shoulder after eating. And here he was, on the day before he would effectively clinch his nomination, calling a single obscure delegate in a state he had already won in a landslide \u2014 an implicit nod to the forces aligned against him before resuming the affect of indomitability.On the TV, Fox had moved on from the election to footage of the smoky aftermath of a bombing in Baghdad. Trump rose from his seat and walked over to the screen for a closer look. \u201cBoy, this ISIS,\u201d he murmured.I asked Trump if he had ever been to Iraq. \u201cNever!\u201d he said, sounding horrified by the thought.\u201cWhat\u2019s the most dangerous place in the world you\u2019ve been to?\u201dHe contemplated this for a second. \u201cBrooklyn,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cNo,\u201d he went on, \u201cthere are places in America that are among the most dangerous in the world. You go to places like Oakland. Or Ferguson. The crime numbers are worse. Seriously.\u201dIt was a stark reminder of what set Trump apart from every other politician in recent memory who had occupied his current position: how little of the world he had seen beyond the archipelago of boardrooms, golf courses and high-rise hotels he inhabited, how utterances that by now would have torpedoed a more normal campaign continued to roll off his tongue with impunity.That Trump would emerge as the last candidate standing from a field that once included 17 seemed at times unimaginable over the five spasmodic weeks I had spent intermittently in the company of the Trump campaign. More than during any other stretch over the past year, everyone \u2014 at times even Trump and his loyal advisers \u2014 seemed hellbent on denying him victory. Now it was clear that there would be no technicalities, as some had long suspected, to keep the victory from him; no self-administered fatal error, as so many had assumed. No, this was it: the final stage of a process by which Americans accepted that this man, wholly unlike any politician they had ever seen, was going to definitely, not maybe, become the standard-bearer of one of the two political parties of the most powerful nation on earth.On the TV, the Fox News pundits were speaking consolingly of the soon-to-be-vanquished Cruz\u2019s political future. Standing in front of the oversize screen, Trump scoffed: \u201cI don\u2019t think he has much of a future.\u201d He returned to his seat and proceeded to scratch out a few notes for what would be his final speech as a Republican competing for the nomination.Trump sat down across the table from me and next to Hicks and Lewandowski, who were poring over their smartphones. Opposite them loomed a painting of a much younger Trump in tennis whites. A waiter materialized and poured him a Coke. (Trump says that he has never touched alcohol.)The month of March had been Trump\u2019s best thus far as a presidential candidate. Although he had, early on, privately rated his chances of winning the Republican nomination as one in 10, he now seemed poised to do just that. On March 1, he clobbered Cruz across the South, winning five of the seven primaries in the region that day \u2014 victories that wiped out hope, among the many Republicans who viewed Trump as an apocalyptic threat to their party, that Cruz\u2019s support among evangelicals would form a bulwark against the interloper. Two weeks later, Trump decisively won Illinois and North Carolina, and seemed to have squeaked by in Missouri, though the narrow margin there meant that the result wasn\u2019t yet official.More astounding, he won Florida, beating its native son, Senator Marco Rubio, by nearly 19 points and forcing him out of the race. Less than two months earlier, the first-term senator was the Republican Party\u2019s favorite son: precocious and upbeat but exquisitely calibrated, never in danger of wandering off-message \u2014 in short, the antithesis of Donald Trump. By early March, Trump had baited him into the tar pit, where he was reduced to questioning the penis size of the man who called him \u201cLiddle Marco.\u201d\u201cHe was branded beautifully,\u201d Trump said, slouching contentedly in his chair. He turned to Lewandowski. \u201cDid they ever announce the results of Missouri?\u201d\u201cSir, they\u2019re still certifying the counts of the delegates,\u201d Lewandowski said.\u201cAm I leading? Have they taken anything away from me?\u201d\u201cSo far you\u2019ve lost a net of three votes.\u201d\u201cSo when will we know?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re trying to certify this by Friday. They\u2019ve allocated 25 delegates to you, 15 to Cruz \u2014 there\u2019s still 12 out there.\u201dTrump\u2019s brow wrinkled. \u201cSo are they saying I won Missouri by doing that?\u201d he asked.\u201cNot yet,\u201d Lewandowski patiently explained. \u201cYou\u2019ve won a series of congressional districts. You won five of them, which is 25 delegates. Cruz won three \u2014 so 15 for him.\u201dDistaste clouded Trump\u2019s face. Like most Americans, he had until recently been almost completely ignorant of the obscure mechanics by which a candidate became the party nominee. To win the nomination, he needed the support of 1,237 delegates. Achieving this was not as straightforward as simply winning the most votes in primaries. In each state, lifelong party officials largely controlled the delegate-selection process. This was the Republican establishment\u2019s last front in its war against Trump \u2014 and Trump feared, not without cause, that his rivals would resort to whatever connivances were necessary to deny him a 1,237 majority and throw the Republican convention into a melee of multiple balloting and back-room deal-making.\u201cWhat I don\u2019t like,\u201d Trump said, \u201cis Cruz has a guy working for him\u201d \u2014 his campaign manager, Jeff Roe \u2014 \u201cthat\u2019s one of the most powerful guys in Missouri. So when I hear there\u2019s a revote\u201d \u2014 there wasn\u2019t, actually \u2014 \u201cI know too much about politics, so I get it. And I don\u2019t like it.\u201dCruz was, perhaps, the only candidate as little-liked among Republican Party hands as Trump was, but Trump plainly saw the Cruz campaign\u2019s machinations as a reflection of the party establishment\u2019s ferocious determination to stop him. It was no secret that many Republicans viewed Trump as an explosive device poised to obliterate in a single blast the party\u2019s economic orthodoxy and its ability to project an image of tolerance. Trump himself had vowed to blow up the party\u2019s \u201crigged system.\u201d And yet he remained somewhat puzzled as to why the party was so opposed to him. In his view, he had arrived on the scene as something of a gift to the G.O.P. He had attracted to the polls hordes of Americans who had previously given up on the party, or on politics as a whole. Viewers were tuning in to the once-boring Republican debates in ratings-smashing numbers \u2014 and this, he argued, was \u201c100 percent Donald Trump.\u201d The party had become too obsessed with ideology. \u201cOne thing I\u2019ve seen over the years,\u201d he observed, \u201cis that the Democrats stick together, and the Republicans eat their young. That\u2019s why they lose so many elections. You know, a normal, very nice, very likable Republican would be hard pressed to win.\u201dTrump did not accept the concern that his more incendiary statements had alienated women and minorities and thereby made him unelectable. \u201cI\u2019m going to be better to women on women\u2019s issues than Hillary Clinton and everybody else combined,\u201d he would later tell me. Now, sipping his Coke, he cited his moderate-for-a-Republican view that Planned Parenthood was a valuable women\u2019s health care organization, albeit one that should not receive federal funding as long as it performed abortions. \u201cFrankly, for the general election I think that\u2019s a very good issue for me,\u201d he said. \u201cStructurally, it\u2019s very hard, almost impossible, for a heavily conservative Republican to win, because of the Electoral College. Whereas I bring in Michigan. Look at what I did in Michigan \u2014 I won it in a landslide, it wasn\u2019t even close. So I bring in Michigan. I maybe bring in New York. Republicans don\u2019t even go for the general election to campaign in New York, because there\u2019s no chance.\u201d\u201cIllinois!\u201d Hicks chimed in.\u201cI win Illinois,\u201d Trump said of a state in which, by the latest polling from early March, he was trailing Clinton by 25 points and which a Republican had not won since 1988.\u201cThe reason they did an autopsy of the party,\u201d Hicks said, referring to the Republican National Committee\u2019s internal analysis following the defeat of 2012, \u201cwas because the party was dead! People are accusing Mr. Trump of killing the party \u2014 well, that\u2019s already been done. He\u2019s bringing the party back to life!\u201dAs we moved to the patio for dinner, Trump signaled for Lewandowski and Hicks to join us, which seemed to surprise them. We were seated at a table that afforded a view of the beach while also placing the resort\u2019s owner in the center of everyone else\u2019s attention. Trump accepted the greetings, congratulations and selfie requests with rote magnanimity \u2014 posing for the camera phones, his forced wince of a smile looked as if someone were grinding a shoe into his toe \u2014 before dispatching each well-wisher with an \u201cEnjoy your evening.\u201d He regarded the parade of men in salmon- or lime-colored blazers with a flicker of amusement. \u201cRight out of central casting,\u201d he said.Melania Trump joined us on the patio; Trump doted on her throughout the meal, often touching her shoulder or leg and calling her \u201cbaby.\u201d His eldest son, Donald Jr., sat with his wife at a nearby table, as did Trump\u2019s grandchildren and his youngest son, 10-year-old Barron. Melania\u2019s soft-spokenness and Lewandowski and Hicks\u2019s deferentiality \u2014 both referred to Trump as \u201csir\u201d and \u201cMr. Trump\u201d \u2014 lent the whole tableau an Old World texture, like a Habsburg patriarch in repose. \u201cThis is fun, right?\u201d Trump exclaimed. \u201cReally! We\u2019re having a good time!\u201dSometime after 10, he and his wife rose from the table and said good night. Back in his bedroom just before midnight, he checked his Twitter feed, as he often did when, he told me, he felt the passing urge to \u201cknock the crap out of\u201d somebody. Tonight, one of his eight million Twitter followers had tweeted a pair of photographs: a flattering image of Melania alongside one of Cruz\u2019s wife, Heidi, with a sort of prune-faced expression, with the caption \u201cA picture is worth a thousand words\u201d and the hashtag #NEVERCRUZ. Trump retweeted it from his own account \u2014 his last public statement of the day.The next morning, a Thursday, Lewandowski drove Hicks and me from Mar-a-Lago to Trump\u2019s nearby golf resort in one of the candidate\u2019s many cars. \u201cI\u2019m Corey,\u201d Lewandowski, in shorts and loafers, explained to the security guard at the entrance. Then, more emphatically: \u201cWith Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.\u201d The guard eyed him skeptically as we drove past.Though he was Trump\u2019s top aide, Lewandowski was viewed by some political observers in Washington as a glorified body man \u2014 he seldom left the candidate\u2019s side, and he lacked the blue-chip credentials usually characteristic of front-running campaign strategists. Lewandowski handled the details, not the vision. He was not a guru. Had he been, Trump, who is his own guru, would not have hired him. In his briefcase, Lewandowski carried a bulky black binder. It contained virtually everything of significance in Trump\u2019s political universe: the daily, weekly and monthly master schedules; the full staff list with everyone\u2019s contact information; a similar list of the campaign\u2019s various contractors; daily talking points for staff and surrogates; a running tally of the delegate count; a list of Trump endorsers; a metrics chart of field activities in each state, including the daily number of calls made and doors knocked; position papers on each major issue; various documents requiring the candidate\u2019s signature; and drafts of coming speeches. When he was not taking orders from the candidate, he was on the phone executing them, pacing around with his hand cupped over the receiver like an offensive coordinator furtively calling in plays.What Lewandowski did have in common with David Axelrod, Karl Rove and other marquee strategists was a romanticized view of his candidate \u2014 one that even Trump, for all his self-regard, didn\u2019t seem to share. Lewandowski saw him as a Braveheart-like hell-raiser tilting against a party elite that had not seen fit to embrace either of them. Though Lewandowski had kicked around in the political circles of New Hampshire for much of the past two decades, he had never seen thousands of people turn out to greet a candidate there the way they did his new boss. Nor had he expected the campaigns of more experienced candidates run by better-known consultants to collapse so quickly and spectacularly in the face of Trump\u2019s challenge. Today, 15 months into the job, Lewandowski plainly admitted that he was not this campaign\u2019s \u201carchitect.\u201d Instead, he described himself to me as \u201ca jockey on American Pharoah. You hold on and give him a little bit of guidance. But you\u2019ve got to let him run.\u201dOver coffee in the club\u2019s sunny dining room overlooking the links, Lewandowski and Hicks joked about the \u201ctoxic infighting\u201d that some media outlets had claimed was bedeviling the campaign. Its four principals \u2014 Lewandowski, Hicks, the deputy campaign manager, Michael Glassner and the social-media director, Dan Scavino \u2014 were, Hicks insisted, extremely close. They had also been made aware of two things by Trump: There was only one star of the campaign, and there was also only one communications director. Unlike most who held her job title, Hicks did not tend to the campaign\u2019s messaging strategy. Nor did Hicks, who is 27, see it as her job to spend evenings sharing off-the-record insights over drinks with the traveling press corps. The rest of the Trump team felt similarly. This, combined with the campaign\u2019s unusually long blacklist of media outlets it deemed unfair or unfriendly, had left reporters with few of the usual means of interpreting the campaign\u2019s inner doings, requiring them to rely instead on more far-flung sources.Among those was Trump\u2019s longtime adviser Roger Stone, an inveterate mischief-maker in the dark seams of American politics who lived by the credo that, as he put it, \u201cthe only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.\u201d Depending on whom you believed, Stone had either been dismissed by Trump last August or had quit. Trump had also parted company with Stone\u2019s former prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Sam Nunberg, who worked for Trump from 2011 until last August, when it was disclosed that he had previously posted racist messages about Obama and the Rev. Al Sharpton on his Facebook page. Nunberg no longer spoke to the candidate; Stone remained on good terms with Trump but communicated with him infrequently, usually when Trump called to compliment him on a TV appearance. Both harbored an intense dislike for Lewandowski, who they believed had tried to wall off their access to the candidate \u2014 Stone, whose formative years were spent working for the re-election campaign of President Richard Nixon, described Lewandowski to me as having \u201call of Bob Haldeman\u2019s negative traits and none of his good ones\u201d \u2014 and merrily disseminated tales of his imminent professional demise.At the golf resort, I brought up the more strategic criticism that had been leveled at the campaign, that Trump needed to turn his guerrilla squad into something resembling a more conventional operation, and asked Lewandowski and Hicks how that might happen. \u201cEver since we won Nevada, all these guys have been calling us and saying we had to build out the team,\u201d Hicks said. The campaign\u2019s core staffers had received this advice with eye-rolls, recognizing it as a worldview at odds with their own \u2014 and from time to time would draw up imitation organizational charts imagining what an expanded Trump World would look like:The man Trump called \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d was running a campaign operation that, in the view of Trump World, wasn\u2019t half as brilliant as the media had given it credit for. After all, who had won the evangelical vote in South Carolina? Who had swept nearly all of the South? Who had snatched victory in Missouri from the jaws of Cruz\u2019s supposed wizard Roe? Still, Cruz\u2019s campaign had found a different way to win.Trump read the story at Mar-a-Lago the next day. Unnerved, he called Roger Stone. \u201cCan they really steal this thing from me?\u201d Stone later recalled Trump asking him.Stone told him that yes, such a feat was entirely possible.Manafort went on to advise several subsequent Republican presidential campaigns, but since the mid-\u201980s, much of his counsel had been devoted to helping foreign leaders including Ferdinand Marcos and Vladimir Putin\u2019s ally in Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych. Still, with his pinstripe suits and white-shoe deftness, he represented a steady and low-profile contrast to Trump\u2019s whippetlike campaign manager. He was also more than 25 years Lewandowski\u2019s senior \u2014 a true peer to Trump, who often referred to his traveling entourage as \u201cthe kids.\u201d As it happened, he lived on the 43rd floor of Trump Tower, and was Stone\u2019s former business partner.At Trump\u2019s request, Manafort had dinner the evening of March 24 with the candidate at Mar-a-Lago. Manafort offered his services pro bono \u2014 he was already plenty wealthy, and presumably preferred an optimized blend of influence and independence. Four days later, on the morning of Monday, March 28, members of the campaign staff assembled at the Washington office of Donald McGahn, Trump\u2019s campaign lawyer, for a secret meeting. The team conferred for three and a half hours. The manager of Trump\u2019s shoestring delegate operation, Ed Brookover, and his deputies Brian Jack and Alan Cobb, began with a review of the campaign\u2019s current delegate-hunting status state by state. But midway through the presentation, the discussion spilled over into a deeper examination of the state of the campaign \u2014 of how the candidate\u2019s message should be shaped and how his operation should be broadened.As the newcomer in the room, Manafort was deferential but also pointed in his observations. He told Lewandowski he was taking on a new role now, according to two people present at the meeting. He was bigger than just a campaign manager, he said. Senators would want to meet with him directly, and he should leverage that when he was in Washington. Such leveraging was, of course, exactly the skill of an establishment hand like Manafort, not an outsider like Lewandowski. (A spokesman for Manafort said he did not recall this being said.)The next morning, March 29, Lewandowski turned himself in to police in Jupiter, Fla., and was charged with simple battery for the incident with Michelle Fields. Ultimately the state attorney for Palm Beach County would decline to prosecute him. What lingered in significance, however, was the complete senselessness of his denial that he had ever touched Fields. (The episode was captured on video.) Instead, Lewandowski had followed the example of his pugnacious boss, which he and Hicks characterized to me during our meeting at Trump\u2019s golf resort in Palm Beach: Don\u2019t back down. Double down.Trump, meanwhile, had other problems. He was now campaigning in Wisconsin, where anti-Trump forces were mounting a fierce and skillfully coordinated effort to deny him the nomination at the convention. \u201cI\u2019ve never said this before, but if I don\u2019t win it on the first ballot, the dishonest establishment will never allow me to win,\u201d Trump told me aboard his 757 on the morning of April 5. We were departing Milwaukee, where voters were going to the polls, and the Fox News pundits on his TV were dissecting what had been the worst two-week stretch of his young political career \u2014 one that had begun with his campaign manager\u2019s arrest.When one commentator made reference to Trump\u2019s recent \u201cunforced errors,\u201d Trump said, \u201cO.K., you can turn the sound down now.\u201d Scavino obliged.Referring to the results of the Wisconsin primary that would arrive that evening, Trump asked me, \u201cWhat do you think is going to happen?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re probably going to lose,\u201d I said.He shrugged. \u201cI have the whole machine against me.\u201dSurveying his recent setbacks, however, he allowed that he had perhaps made some mistakes. He had come to regret his decision to retweet the Heidi Cruz photo that night at Mar-a-Lago, which had dogged him for weeks now. \u201cI could\u2019ve done without it,\u201d he gruffly acknowledged. \u201cSome people were offended.\u201d I asked him if it was strategically wise to have spent the past week in Wisconsin repeatedly attacking the state\u2019s governor, the former presidential candidate Scott Walker \u2014 who, granted, was a Cruz supporter but who also enjoyed an 80 percent favorability rating among the state\u2019s Republicans. \u201cMaybe not,\u201d Trump mumbled. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201dIn any other presidential campaign, this string of failures would have cost someone his or her job. But no heads had rolled in Trump World \u2014 a tacit acknowledgment by the candidate, perhaps, that responsibility for the campaign resided in the man with the office on the 26th floor of Trump Tower. The campaign\u2019s inner circle remained intact; Hicks now sat directly behind Trump on the plane, pecking away at her laptop alongside Lewandowski, whose eyes were haunted with fatigue and who had lost so much weight recently (15 pounds, he would later tell me) that his blue blazer drooped like a cloak around his shoulders. I asked Trump if his campaign manager\u2019s job description had been affected by recent developments. \u201cZero,\u201d he insisted.That evening Trump lost Wisconsin by 13 points to Cruz. Further setbacks followed in Colorado and Wyoming, where Cruz\u2019s team outmaneuvered Trump\u2019s in the delegate-apportioning process, as even some of Trump\u2019s staff members would concede to me. Lewandowski thought highly of the 1993 Bill Clinton campaign documentary \u201cThe War Room,\u201d and admiringly regarded Clinton\u2019s team as a roomful of \u201ckillers.\u201d The able but mild-mannered Trump delegate crew, which included Jack, Brookover and Barry Bennett \u2014 all alumni of Dr. Ben Carson\u2019s recently shuttered campaign \u2014 did not seem to have the appetite for the jugular that Cruz\u2019s team did.Manafort and Lewandowski had gathered the team to discuss the campaign\u2019s new structure \u2014 which would now have Manafort overseeing the entire delegate operation and Lewandowski the campaign apparatus \u2014 and to introduce its new members, including Rick Wiley, the national political director, previously Scott Walker\u2019s campaign manager. The candidate strolled into the conference room. \u201cWow, this looks like a professional group of people,\u201d he said, smiling, according to two sources who were present. \u201cAll right, guys. I need you to go win. And we\u2019re going to make sure you have what you need to win.\u201dAfter speaking for less than two minutes, Trump walked out. For the rest of the meeting, much was said by everyone in the room, but nothing was decided, because Manafort and Lewandowski had thoroughly opposing visions of how the campaign should be run. The Washington-based strategist believed it was time for Trump to close out the primaries by taking a more scripted, mollifying approach. The campaign manager held to the view that people attended a Trump rally fully expecting the same type of raucous, unpredictable drama they saw at a sporting event. Trump apparently was listening to both men now. But it was not obvious that morning whose view would prevail \u2014 or even which of the two had the authority to give orders. One attendee told me that he came out with no more clarity than he had before the meeting.The plane touched down at the airport, and the waiting fleet of black sedans whisked the candidate and his entourage to the city\u2019s hockey arena, where the rally would take place. Trump was posing for photographs with campaign volunteers when Hicks\u2019s phone buzzed. It was Paul Manafort, calling to try to head off another public-relations controversy.At the candidate\u2019s direction, Hicks had prepared a statement chiding Jacobus\u2019s threat. Manafort was now on the phone urging Trump not to release the statement. Attacking Jacobus yet again struck him as unnecessary, not to mention a distraction from the task at hand: winning big in tomorrow\u2019s primary. It also flew in the face of Manafort\u2019s publicly stated vow that his new client would now be evincing a more \u201cpresidential\u201d affect.Trump grew more red-faced as he heard Manafort out. Then he said, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me how to [expletive] do P.R.\u201d He stepped into a private room to fix his hair, then posed for a few more photos with the man who was about to introduce him to the crowd, Rex Ryan, head coach of the Buffalo Bills. That evening, addressing a hockey arena filled with perhaps 17,000 delirious Trumpophiles, he bellowed: \u201cI don\u2019t want to really act more \u2018presidential\u2019 until we win!\u201dManafort had managed to impose a veneer of Beltway respectability on the campaign. More field organizers were now materializing in states like Pennsylvania, where local volunteers had hitherto been left largely to fend for themselves. Supporters who previously received no direction from the campaign before going on TV to expound on the candidate\u2019s policies \u2014 \u201cI just make [expletive] up,\u201d Representative Duncan Hunter of California confessed to a Trump senior adviser \u2014 were now receiving daily talking points.But the moment-to-moment decision-making \u2014 where to go, whom to see, what to say and how to say it \u2014 still rested almost exclusively upon the whims of Trump and, secondarily, with the person in his immediate proximity, who was almost always Lewandowski. That became apparent to me on the morning of April 25, the day before the string of Northeastern primaries that would restore Trump\u2019s indomitability. The candidate was seated in the front of his Citation as it departed the airstrip of Warwick, R.I. \u2014 a stop that, Manafort and Lewandowski agreed, had been a complete waste of the candidate\u2019s time, given that he was ahead of Cruz there by 40 points. But when Trump told Lewandowski, \u201cI can\u2019t just not go there,\u201d there was little point arguing. Lewandowski began making calls to his advance team on Sunday morning. Some 24 hours later, Trump walked into a sweaty and delirious tented gathering adjacent to a Warwick hotel \u2014 exulting, with customary hyperbole: \u201cWe set this up 12 hours ago! There\u2019s thousands outside \u2014 we need a bigger tent!\u201dLater that day, en route to West Chester, Pa., Trump\u2019s thoughts kept wandering afield from politics. He sat with a large stack of newspaper clippings \u2014 some of them with handwritten notes from his daughter Ivanka \u2014 at his feet. To his right sat his 32-year-old son Eric, whom I heard Trump refer to as \u201choney.\u201d He perused some documents relating to a land deal he was considering, pausing to fret over the fate of his friend Tom Brady, the New England Patriots quarterback whose four-game suspension for his role in the Deflategate scandal was upheld that morning by a federal appeals court: \u201cHe should\u2019ve sued the N.F.L. in Boston at the very beginning.\u201d He asked Lewandowski whether his campaign schedule would allow him to attend the June 25 grand opening of his Turnberry golf resort on the coast of Scotland.\u201cIf we get to 1,237, you\u2019re there,\u201d Lewandowski said. \u201cIf we\u2019re at 1,100, you\u2019re going nowhere.\u201d Trump scowled a bit but did not protest. I was reminded that Trump was still fundamentally a real estate developer with exactly zero previous campaign experience, who had gotten this far by spending only a fraction of what his opponents had and against the wishes of his party \u2014 who was as new to the idea of a Trump candidacy as the rest of us were.It was a sobering reminder of the expectations that a President Trump might find on his shoulders come January. But the moment passed, and his mood seemed to regain altitude, the desperate souls on the rope line reaggregating into an adoring mass of victory-assuring, superlative-defying yugeness. \u201cSo you\u2019ve covered other people \u2014 nobody comes close to this,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo guys from Fox said they\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201dWe rose upward through the skies in the vehicle Trump referred to as \u201cjust about the fastest plane made,\u201d eventually passing over the Ferry Point golf course that Trump said he had built faster than anyone else could, and finally toward the great Manhattan skyline that Trump had made even greater \u2014 a taste of what he could do for America, if its great people would only let him.An article on Page 29 this weekend about Donald J. Trump\u2019s improbable journey to the Republican nomination for president misstates the sequence of events by which Paul Manafort, a senior adviser, joined Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. Manafort was referred to Trump by more than one person close to the campaign, not just by the former Trump adviser Roger Stone, and Manafort\u2019s March 24 meeting with Trump occurred before, not after, Trump read a Wall Street Journal article describing Ted Cruz\u2019s delegate strategy.Advertisement"}

They\u2019re not talking up or down to each other.\u201dThe most commonly cited topics by women included words such as \u201cwonderful,\u201d \u201chappy,\u201d \u201cbirthday,\u201d \u201cdaughter,\u201d \u201cbaby,\u201d \u201cexcited\u201d and \u201cthankful.\u201d Women were more likely to discuss family and social life, relying on words that described positive emotions, such as \u201clove,\u201d and intensive adverbs, such as \u201csooo,\u201d \u201csooooo,\u201d and \u201cridiculously,\u201d the study said.Men more frequently discussed topics related to money or work, and favored words tied to politics, sports, competition and activities, such as shooting guns or playing video games.

More important, can anything stop them?For one, we cannot stress enough just how well Facebook handled the broad consumer shift from using a desktop computer to get to the web to now using smartphones as our gateways to pretty much everything on the Internet. The entire industry was caught off guard by the success of iPhone and Android, and absolutely no one was prepared for how to make money on the phone.That killed \u2014 or at least deeply wounded \u2014 quite a few successful companies. Remember Zynga? That place was raking in the cash from FarmVille-loving moms on the desktop. Suddenly, everyone is playing Candy Crush Saga on the iPhone and all those cash crops are lying fallow. Zynga still hasn\u2019t recovered or found a viable way out.Anyway, Facebook nailed mobile ads in the news feed, and now 82 percent of the company\u2019s ad revenue comes from people viewing those ads on smartphones. That\u2019s a shift in just a few years, and it\u2019s insane.Facebook endured, I think, because it understood that its appeal was primal and wasn\u2019t dependent on format: People wanted to see what was going on with their friends and frenemies from whatever device they used. Kind of like how you and I can\u2019t stop chatting no matter what machine we\u2019re on.No one puts Zuck in the corner, ever again.That means huge gambles on acquiring start-ups like Oculus, the virtual reality company, and WhatsApp, the messaging app, for billions upon billions of dollars.I\u2019m nervous to give Facebook too much in the way of props, only because it\u2019s already a lovefest with analysts and what goes up must eventually come down. I think Isaac Newton said that. Or Gordon Gekko.Anyway, for now, Facebook is still the company to beat. I guess they get to keep taking victory laps.Advertisement"}

Since the campaign began in February, WildAid has seen the number of small donors to its elephant initiative rise 94 percent, he said.Celebrities also persuade other celebrities to open their wallets.Elephant Family will make further inroads into the art world this summer, when it takes the Elephant Parade, a showcase of elephant-themed outdoor art by David Yarrow, David LaChapelle, and other artists, to the Hamptons\u201cIf you want to understand the issue, you have to talk former C.I.A. officers who are in touch with Kenyan intelligence who can tell you who is corrupt at the port at Mombasa,\u201d Mr. Neilson said.By contrast, \u201cWhen a well-meaning reality TV star in Los Angeles is tweeting \u2018save the elephants,\u2019 I think it\u2019s safe to say that that has no impact whatsoever,\u201d he said.President Obama has called for a near-total ban on the ivory trade in the United States, and conservation groups expect the new law to be put in effect this summer.She finds the issue gripping in part because elephants seem so human in their behavior, she said: Each herd has its matriarchs, its wise old aunts, its rowdy teenagers. When an elephant dies, the others mourn. \u201cThey touch the body with their feet, smell it with their trunks, and stand around for a day or longer,\u201d Ms. Davis said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like sitting shiva.\u201dAnd unfortunately, there is a lot of that going on in Africa these days, she said. \u201cHow on earth will we be able turn to our children and say, \u2018All those elephants in books, they used to be everywhere, now they\u2019re gone.\u2019\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article last Sunday about celebrities who are trying to save elephants from extinction referred incorrectly to the mother of Maggie Q, an actress who starred in \u201cNikita\u201d and \u201cStalker.\u201d She is not an actress herself and did not appear in either of those shows.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nick Denton, Gawker Founder, Assails Peter Thiel as \u2018Vindictive\u2019 Foe", "Date": "2016-05-26", "News": "Supported byThe letter from Nick Denton, the company\u2019s founder and majority owner, was published Thursday on Gawker, hours after the company acknowledged that it had hired an investment banker in recent weeks to help it explore strategic options, including a possible sale.Mr. Denton harshly criticized what he said was a lengthy, unnecessary vendetta Mr. Thiel waged against not only Gawker Media but also individual journalists.Other lawsuits against Gawker, led by the same lawyer, Charles Harder, representing Mr. Bollea, are still pending.A spokesman for Mr. Thiel declined to comment on Thursday.In his interview with The Times, Mr. Thiel \u2014 who was outed as being gay by Gawker\u2019s Valleywag blog nearly a decade ago \u2014 said he did not view his underwriting of the lawsuits as a business venture. \u201cI would underscore that I don\u2019t expect to make any money from this,\u201d he said.In his open letter, Mr. Denton issued a play-by-play of past stories that drew Mr. Thiel\u2019s ire and of two defamation lawsuits currently pending against Gawker, and criticized what he characterized as an inability by Silicon Valley figures to accept criticism from journalists.\u201cI can see how tempting it would be to use Silicon Valley\u2019s most abundant resource, a vast fortune, against the harsh words of the writers of a small New York media company,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe have our devices; you have yours.\u201dMr. Denton also assured Mr. Thiel that Gawker\u2019s journalists would be reporting on his involvement in lawsuits against the company.\u201cWe, and those you have sent into battle against us, have been stripped naked, our texts, online chats and finances revealed through the press and the courts,\u201d Mr. Denton wrote. \u201cIn the next phase, you too will be subject to a dose of transparency.\u201dIn the statement, Gawker said that it had worked with investment bankers for some time, and that Mr. Patricof was only the latest. Gawker said word of Mr. Patricof\u2019s hiring \u201cseems to have stirred up some excitement, when the fact is that nothing is new.\u201dGawker\u2019s strategic review is in its early stages, and Mr. Denton has not decided on how to proceed, according to the people with direct knowledge of plans.The company has been considering its options for months. Gawker had weighed potential offers earlier this year that were as high as approximately $350 million, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.Last year, Mr. Denton revealed that Gawker Media generated about $45 million in advertising revenue in 2014 and profit of about $7 million. But the prospect of further litigation draining the company\u2019s coffers prompted the media outlet to prepare contingency planning around what the company described as Mr. Thiel\u2019s \u201crevenge campaign.\u201d\u201cThe refusal to engage in public relations or access journalism,\u201d the post read, \u201cis usually the mark of an outlet\u2019s credibility. For Thiel and his peers in Silicon Valley, such a refusal amounts to repudiating their way of life.\u201dThe post\u2019s headline was \u201cThis Is Why Billionaire Peter Thiel Wants to End Gawker.\u201dFor his part, Mr. Denton ended his letter with a series of reported questions that challenged points Mr. Thiel had made in the interview with The Times and elsewhere, and questioned whether Mr. Thiel\u2019s personal political opinions had affected his decisions as a board member for Facebook.He also asked what Mr. Thiel ultimately hoped to achieve.\u201cIs your goal to bankrupt, buy, or wound Gawker Media?\u201d Mr. Denton wrote. \u201cIf you were to own the company after a final judgment in the Hogan case, what would your editorial strategy be?\u201dJohn Herrman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Apple Pay and Other Mobile Wallets Beat Chip Cards", "Date": "2016-05-04", "News": "Supported byTech FixEvery weekend, when Pierre Houle works the brunch shift at Olea, a neighborhood restaurant in San Francisco, many customers want to split the tab on multiple credit cards, a process that takes much longer than it used to.For waiters like Mr. Houle, diners going Dutch is nothing new. But now he has to take each of the credit cards, insert them into a chip reader and wait about 10 seconds for every transaction to process. In the past, he could swipe a card, wait a few seconds, print out the receipt and get going.\u201cIt isn\u2019t much, but in the restaurant world it can be enormous,\u201d he said. \u201cI have to wait there, and I can\u2019t go check on something else. You need to move all the time when you do a job like that.\u201dThat means if a criminal swipes a counterfeit credit card to buy something, the merchant now has to pay for it. The sweeping change has compelled many retailers to upgrade their equipment to read chips, which have stronger security than the easy-to-forge magnetic stripe. By the end of this year, about 80 percent of all credit cards in the United States should include chips, according to a new report by the fraud prevention company Iovation and the research firm Aite Group.The chip initially may annoy consumers. For most chip transactions, you have to dip the credit card into a slot and wait for the transaction to be approved before you can remove it and scribble your signature.\u201cContrary to what Tim Cook said when Apple rolled out Apple Pay, consumers have been swiping their cards for a long time and it\u2019s not that hard,\u201d said Julie Conroy, a research director for the Aite Group.I tested chip cards and each of the mobile payments services in three different stores: Walgreens, BevMo and Nancy Boy, a small beauty supply store in San Francisco. I inserted a chip card or tapped a phone and timed how long it took each transaction to be approved and start printing a receipt. The results varied slightly, but the mobile wallets were generally much faster than the chip.At Walgreens, after I inserted a chip card, the transaction took eight seconds before a receipt started printing; Apple Pay and Samsung Pay took three seconds; and Android Pay (Google\u2019s service) took seven seconds. At BevMo, the chip payment took 10 seconds; Samsung Pay took four seconds and Android Pay and Apple Pay each took five seconds. At Nancy Boy, the chip took eight seconds, and all the mobile payment services tied at 2.4 seconds.What is happening with the chip to make it so slow? When you dip in the card, the chip generates a one-time code, which is sent to the bank over a network. The bank confirms the code and sends verification back to the terminal. With mobile wallets, the same thing is basically happening in the background. They generate one-time tokens that are sent out and approved by the banks.In the last two years, Apple, Samsung and Google have released mobile wallets, and we decided to test how well these new technologies work. Here\u2019s a rundown of how the mobile wallets compare and where they are accepted.Stephanie Ericksen, a Visa executive who works on security solutions for new payment technologies, says the sluggishness of the chip is largely a perception issue. The actual transaction time behind a mobile payment and a chip card is the same.But with the chip, most merchant terminals require you to leave the card inside the reader until the transaction is complete and wait for a screen to tell you that you can remove the card. With the mobile payments, you can just tap the phone, and there is no extra screen telling you to remove the phone, which partly explains why the transaction appears to move along more quickly.Mobile wallets feel faster, more convenient and less awkward to use than the chip, so you should use them whenever possible. The caveat, of course, is that not every merchant that takes credit cards also accepts mobile payments.To see if the wallet is supported at a store, you will have to look out for Apple Pay or Android Pay logos on cash registers, or a logo of a hand holding a card in front of a wireless signal, which means contactless payments are supported.That brings us to the differences among the mobile wallets. They all work about the same \u2014 take your phone out, enter your passcode or fingerprint and tap the terminal \u2014 and they have their pros and cons.Samsung Pay is accepted by the most merchants because it uses magnetic secure transmission, a technology that emits a magnetic signal to mimic the magnetic stripe, meaning it can be used on most credit-card readers. Samsung Pay also supports payments made wirelessly with near-field communications, for NFC, a technology that enables devices to exchange information wirelessly over short distances.Apple Pay is supported by more banks than the Samsung and Android wallets. (I was surprised, for instance, that I could not add a Chase card to Android Pay). Android Pay\u2019s advantage is it is available on the broadest array of devices. It can run on most Android phones that support NFC, whereas Samsung Pay can only be installed on Samsung phones and Apple Pay can only run on iPhones and the Apple Watch.In a statement, Samsung said Samsung Pay was the most accepted mobile payment service and it \u201cdramatically decreases opportunities for fraud.\u201d Google\u2019s senior director for Android Pay, Pali Bhat, said, \u201cWe want Android Pay to be available everywhere, and everywhere means as many devices as we can support.\u201dJennifer Bailey, vice president of Apple Pay, said, \u201cUsers tell us they love the convenience and speed of paying with their iPhone or Apple Watch.\u201dIn rare cases, there can be a long wait before you take your chip card back. Mr. Houle, the restaurant waiter, also works part time at the beauty supply store Nancy Boy. He recounted an incident in the store when he dipped a chip card for a customer who left before he could hand it back. He tracked her down on Facebook and mailed it to her in New York three days later.\u201cIt was my fault as much as hers,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Do You Give Up on Treating a Child With Cancer?", "Date": "2016-05-12", "News": "The Health IssueAndrew Levy\u2019s parents knew that the rare and deadly cancer in his blood could not be beaten, so they began to prepare for the worst. Then something mysterious happened.Supported byLeukemia, a cancer of those cells in the bone marrow that produce new blood cells, has many varieties, but the most common type in children, acute lymphocytic leukemia, is largely curable. Andrew\u2019s cancer, however, a subtype of acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL), affects only about 45 children a year nationwide and is much more difficult to treat. The odds of surviving this type of AMKL are roughly even \u2014 unless the child is one of a handful who happen to have a particular genotype, in which case these odds plummet to a mere one in 10. Genetic analysis revealed that Andrew was in this tiny group.There was more bad news. Two weeks after the diagnosis, Andrew\u2019s doctor, Norman Lacayo, an oncologist at Lucile Packard Children\u2019s Hospital at Stanford University, received an urgent call from Michael Loken, the president of Hematologics Inc., a Seattle lab that was analyzing Andrew\u2019s cells. Loken had recently discovered that a small percentage of children with AMKL had a specific phenotype \u2014 a pattern of proteins on the surface of the leukemia cell he called R.A.M. (a former patient\u2019s initials) \u2014 that independently predicted a terrible outcome, with a survival rate of about one in six. Andrew had this phenotype too.\u201cHas anyone ever survived this kind of cancer?\u201d Dan asked Lacayo. \u201cAll I wanted to know is that it was not impossible,\u201d Dan recalls. Lacayo said yes, but Dan felt his answer was \u201cfoggy.\u201d The truth was that the team couldn\u2019t find a single equivalent case in the literature.Beginning on that December morning in 2014 when Esther took Andrew to the E.R., she recalls, she felt as if they had stepped into a horror movie, the unfolding events both surreal and evil. Up to that point, Esther and Dan had led, in her words, \u201ccharmed lives \u2014 picture perfect.\u201d Only a small subset of people would sincerely say that nothing truly bad has ever happened to them; before the diagnosis, Esther and Dan say, they were among them. When Andrew got sick, they were in their mid-30s and energetic, optimistic and extroverted. They had both attended Stanford \u2014 Dan majored in industrial engineering, Esther in human biology, with a minor in dance \u2014 before going on to successful careers. Dan founded a sports-related start-up, then became vice president of small business at Facebook, while Esther worked at Kurbo, a start-up focused on weight management for kids, and taught spin classes at a Jewish community center for fun. Their own families were stable and close-knit; to recall any true adversity in either family, they had to think back to a grandmother of Dan\u2019s whose family perished in the Holocaust.Once Andrew\u2019s illness was diagnosed, he needed a bone-marrow transplant as swiftly as possible. First the doctors had to kill the leukemic cells in Andrew\u2019s bone marrow with chemotherapy, then replace them with a donor\u2019s cells. Andrew\u2019s 3-year-old sister, Lea, and his 5-year-old brother, Wills, were tested, and in the family\u2019s first bit of luck since the diagnosis, Wills turned out to be a perfect donor match. Andrew underwent two rounds of chemotherapy, but there were still traces of cancer when the transplant was performed in February 2015, putting the outcome at high risk of failure.The Levys had created a Lotsa Helping Hands website, where friends signed up to host play dates or deliver meals (as did our family because our children were in the same school as Wills), and a Facebook group for updates on Andrew\u2019s illness, which 1,700 people joined. But despite all the support, Esther felt deeply \u201calone with the experience,\u201d she says. Her former life had vanished: She was living in Andrew\u2019s hospital room, sleeping on a sofa that opened into a hard bed. She had left her job and the rest of her family while Dan continued to work and live at home with Wills and Lea. Her nights were punctured by Andrew\u2019s cries; her days were spent frantically trying to distract him from his pain and nausea, cleaning up his vomit, holding him down during blood draws and making stressful medical decisions. He screamed if she left him for a few minutes, even to use the bathroom or shower.After Esther and Andrew spent three months in the hospital, the entire family moved into a nearby apartment, in order to live in a smaller space they could keep immaculately clean while waiting for Andrew\u2019s new immune system to develop. Esther remained Andrew\u2019s full-time nurse, responsible for a dizzyingly complex regimen of medications and sterile changes of the IV. A bone-marrow test that April showed no traces of cancer, and Andrew was considered to be in remission. They posted videos of him banging on his drums and singing with his toy Elmo and pretending to play golf.They decided that when Andrew was well enough, they would not return to their old home but begin a new life. They found a house in the nearby town of Atherton in the style of an English country manor, encircled by hedges and white rose bushes, that suggested privacy and safety. Andrew was too vulnerable to leave the apartment, so Esther could not go to see the house in person, but they bought it anyway, and she made plans with a decorator friend to create an airplane-themed room for Andrew.But on June 19, the medical team told Esther and Dan that there was bad news again: Andrew\u2019s cancer had returned. The number of cells was small but would inevitably grow, the doctors explained. The team presented a new plan: They would begin chemotherapy again in preparation for a second bone-marrow transplant, perhaps using cord blood this time.\u201cOh, God,\u201d Esther said, putting her head in her hands. She felt she could not go through it all again. And there was no reason to think it would work. The odds of success during the first transplant had been long; in a second attempt, they would be much more so. \u201cBut the odds that it would cause all of us more suffering were 100 percent,\u201d she told me.From the initial diagnosis, Dan had determined that their goal was not simply to help Andrew survive but to keep the family intact. To choose to move back into the hospital, where they believed Andrew would die, was \u201ca fundamental violation of every promise we made to ourselves and our kids that we would be together again,\u201d he told me. He felt the family had just started to heal from the months of separation. \u201cThe emotional scars of the experience,\u201d he said, \u201cwould be irreparable if we ripped them open and split our family apart again.\u201d They decided to stop treatment. They would move to their new house, where Andrew would spend whatever time he had splashing in their swimming pool and playing in the grass with Wills and Lea.The doctors were stunned. \u201cWe love you, and we love Andrew and we\u2019re not ready to give up,\u201d Jennifer Willert, the pediatric oncologist in charge of the transplant, blurted out. Lacayo and Willert argued for at least trying some palliative chemotherapy to prolong Andrew\u2019s life. Esther and Dan hesitated but ultimately declined. They called their decorator friend and told her to return the furniture for Andrew\u2019s new room. She was one of the first people to whom they told the news: Andrew was going to die.But quality time with a doomed child turned out to be impossible. The cancer cells were few enough that they were not yet making Andrew sick, but, Esther posted, \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything more painful than spending time with your precious baby knowing that he is going to die soon.\u201d Parenting is teleological; parents rear a child to become an adult. What were their goals for Andrew now? \u201cI am no longer \u2018raising\u2019 him to grow up to be a wonderful human being,\u201d Esther wrote. Should she let him eat junk food or watch videos on the iPad all day? Did it matter?Their older kids asked tormenting questions. Lea wanted to know whether they could buy Andrew a certain toy when he was 4 years old like her. Wills wanted to know why they had Andrew if they knew he was going to be sick all the time.Dan read them Mo Willems\u2019s book \u201cWaiting Is Not Easy!\u201d about an impatient elephant. As he read, he thought about the waiting that had engulfed them over the previous nine months. They had waited to get the right diagnosis; they had waited 100 days for the transplanted cells to grow; they had waited for the results from the bone-marrow tests to see if the cancer was gone. \u201cNow there are no more diagnoses,\u201d Dan wrote on Facebook. \u201cNo more tests. And no more milestones. But there is waiting. Maybe hours, or days, or weeks.\u201d This was the most agonizing of all: the wait for Andrew\u2019s death.On July 1, they moved into their new house, and Andrew became sick. By the holiday weekend, he was moaning or screaming in pain whenever he was awake. Dan took a leave of absence from work. Esther held Andrew at all times, his body draped over hers on the couch or the bed. Dan took food to her because she couldn\u2019t hold him and sit up at the dinner table. Her hair began to fall out because of the stress. \u201cIt was unbearable for him and for us,\u201d she says.The hospice team began to come every day to try to control the pain with high doses of opioids. Harvey Cohen, an oncologist and the medical director of the hospital\u2019s palliative-care program, explained to them that as the disease progressed, Andrew would not have enough platelets for his blood to clot. A hospice nurse told them to buy dark towels for Andrew\u2019s crib, so that if he started to bleed uncontrollably, the sight would be less frightening for his siblings and for them.During the second week of July, the hospice team told them to prepare for Andrew\u2019s imminent death. They called a rabbi, and thinking about how Andrew loved airplanes, they picked a Jewish cemetery near the airport. Not wanting him to be buried alone, they purchased grave sites for themselves as well. They established an Andrew Levy Memorial Fund to raise money for music therapy at the Lucile Packard Children\u2019s Hospital.The members of their medical team visited their home to say goodbye. Andrew had stopped eating. He was barely moving, his breathing raspy and his complexion sallow, with the particular look the team knew from other dying children. Sometimes he stopped breathing momentarily, and his body would become rigid, and his face turn blue. \u201cIt\u2019s O.K. for you to go,\u201d Esther told him. All she wanted now was for this to end quickly.They called Wills and Lea into the living room \u2014 a room the kids rarely entered. Esther pulled them close to her on the couch, and Dan sat on a cushion on the floor. They had rehearsed what they were going to say with Barbara Sourkes, a hospital psychiatrist with whom they had grown close, and they made an audio recording of this moment in case they needed to discuss it with her later.Dan told the children that the transplant had been a success, and that Wills\u2019s cells had done a great job, but that Andrew\u2019s cells needed to work on their own at some point, and they weren\u2019t. \u201cHis body is just not working,\u201d he said, as straightforwardly as he could manage.\u201cIs Andrew going to get better?\u201d Wills asked.\u201cThe doctors don\u2019t think so, Wills. No.\u201dSourkes had advised them to tell the children only what they needed to know so as not to overwhelm them, because the children needed emotional space to process things their own way. \u201cSo Andrew \u2014 Andrew is going to die at some point,\u201d Dan said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know when.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like that Andrew is going to die!\u201d Lea exclaimed and started crying.Wills pulled the hood of his sweatshirt over his face and said he didn\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201cAndrew is going to die, so that means we are only going to have four people in our family,\u201d Lea said unhappily. She asked if they could get a new baby to replace Andrew, and she and Wills began to fantasize about a new baby who would make everything all better.Esther returned to Andrew. \u201cI promise, I promise you, we are not going to forget him,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are always going to have a brother named Andrew because he is always your brother, now and forever.\u201d\u201cAndrew\u2019s pieces of love will always be in our heart,\u201d Lea said, and then they all agreed to watch Mickey Mouse together.At first the mirages were brief \u2014 Andrew would laugh when Lea showed him her bellybutton or would stack blocks for 10 minutes \u2014 and then he would lapse back into pained lethargy for the rest of the day. But soon these episodes began to lengthen. For Esther, the mirages did not feel like miracles but \u201cevil tricks.\u201d She went through intense surges of anger. \u201cI felt like, How many trials are we going to have to endure?\u201d she says. \u201cAre we being spared nothing?\u201dEsther started sending the medical team videos. \u201cAndrew is eating pizza, Andrew is sitting up, Andrew is laughing,\u201d Lacayo, their oncologist, recounts. \u201cAnd we are like, What?\u201dIn August, as the team struggled to account for what was happening, they theorized that in July, when everyone assumed Andrew was dying of cancer, he must have had a terrible infection instead, which passed. It didn\u2019t change the prognosis: The doctors stressed that, while Andrew might continue to recover from that infection as his new immune system took hold, the cancer cells were also growing and would eventually overwhelm him.After a blood test showed that his platelets were low, Cohen, the palliative-care doctor, urged them to accept transfusions to increase Andrew\u2019s platelets so that, even though he was going to die, it would not be from bleeding to death. But at the hospital, it turned out, mysteriously, that Andrew had more platelets than at his last blood test, so there was no need for a transfusion that day. When Dan suggested giving him vitamins, Esther snapped at him. He seemed to be taking the anomalous blood test to mean Andrew was getting better, when, she says, \u201cI had no hope, and I needed not to have hope in order to function.\u201d And then they both apologized.In September, Andrew began to walk again, and his appetite and energy and dark curls grew. Dan decided to return to work. Andrew turned 2 \u2014 a birthday his parents had never thought he would reach and knew would be his last. Esther recalls how friends urged them to enjoy every moment, and how she would tell them: \u201cNo, this is hell, and it sucks. He is still going to die, so there is nothing joyous about this time.\u201dWhen they first got Andrew\u2019s diagnosis, she told a night nurse that she just wanted to get her happy-go-lucky little boy back for a single hour. She had not understood then that any reprieve would only mean that they would have to go through losing him all over again \u2014 \u201cand each return will be harder than the last as Andrew grows and bonds with us,\u201d she wrote in a post.By October, Andrew was healthier than he had been in a year, running and playing ball with his siblings. None of the doctors had ever seen this kind of recovery before. They decided to bring him back to the hospital for a bone-marrow test.Michael Loken, who had analyzed Andrew\u2019s blood work, had not been surprised that Andrew\u2019s cancer returned. He had been working on a paper about R.A.M., the genetic marker that Andrew had. He had tracked 19 other cases of children with the phenotype; three years after the diagnosis, only two were still alive and healthy. When he examined Andrew\u2019s marrow this time, using a sample of 200,000 cells, he got goose bumps. He repeated the test with 500,000 cells. Then he called Lacayo with the news. The cancer had disappeared.The medical team grasped for a scientific explanation. Because Andrew had received no treatment over the summer, the answer had to lie in the bone-marrow transplant of Wills\u2019s cells. Their main theory was that the infection that nearly killed Andrew in July had triggered a huge increase in his new white blood cells \u2014 and that heightened immune response had attacked not only the infection but the cancer cells as well.The doctors theorized that the response was partly a product of timing: The cancer had returned just as Andrew\u2019s new immune system grew strong enough to destroy the cancer cells. A critical part of why transplants work is that some of the white blood cells, the T cells, that grow from the transplanted bone marrow will attack any lingering cancer cells, an effect known as graft versus leukemia. Chemotherapy rarely kills every last cancer cell, so it is believed that without graft versus leukemia, the cancer will eventually grow back. This is often spoken of as a model of so-called immunotherapy \u2014 stimulating the patient\u2019s own immune system to attack cancer cells \u2014 which is widely regarded as one of the most promising avenues for cancer treatment.Willert had made a key decision to depart from Stanford\u2019s protocol to increase Andrew\u2019s chances of getting a robust graft versus leukemia effect. Typically, a leukemia patient receives immune-suppressing drugs for at least 100 days (and often much longer) in order to avoid a serious side effect called graft versus host disease, in which new T cells attack not only the cancer cells but also the patient\u2019s skin, liver and gastrointestinal tract. The art of a transplant is said to be maximizing graft versus leukemia while minimizing graft versus host.Willert, who is now at the University of California, San Francisco, Benioff Children\u2019s Hospital, had advocated a rapid early taper of Andrew\u2019s immune-suppressing drugs on Day 60, as is the practice at U.C.S.F. and other places, because she felt that the benefits outweighed the risk of graft versus host. \u201cI fought for it because I have seen the power of getting rid of immune suppressants and letting the cells do their job,\u201d she says. \u201cAfter all, that\u2019s the whole point of a transplant!\u201dThe final, critical decision was made against medical advice: Esther and Dan\u2019s resolution to stop treatment and let Andrew die. Had they permitted more chemotherapy, the treatment would have killed Wills\u2019s cells, which were what ultimately enabled Andrew to live.She has not returned to work. \u201cMy full-time job is to help the kids feel safe again,\u201d she says. But it is hard for her to feel safe. The two years after a transplant are the riskiest time for a relapse; after two years that likelihood plummets, and after five years, a patient is considered cured. The two-year mark is still nine months away.\u201cThere are only two states after such a diagnosis: disease and uncertainty,\u201d Cohen had told them. \u201cEither he will die soon, and that\u2019s certain \u2014 or he will continue on, and you will live with that constant balance of hope and fear. But the balance will change as time goes on.\u201dOnly in the past few weeks, Esther says, has she been able to feel that she isn\u2019t testing fate by scheduling a dentist appointment for Andrew six months out or by feeling moments of joy watching him without being shadowed by fear of the future. \u201cDay by day,\u201d she says, \u201cwe are allowing ourselves to celebrate a little more.\u201dAn article on May 15 about a child with a rare form of leukemia gave an incomplete name for the website that the child\u2019s parents used to arrange play dates and meal deliveries. It is Lotsa Helping Hands, not Helping Hands.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: The Rise of the \u2018Matchmakers\u2019 of the Digital Economy", "Date": "2016-05-20", "News": "Supported byBook EntryMany of the young giants of the digital economy share a common characteristic. They are platforms that provide valued connections among their participants. The nature of those connections and the value they provide vary widely.Both Google and Facebook \u2013 together approaching $1 trillion in market value \u2014 are in the business of connecting advertisers to consumers, but their platforms and business models are very different.Another trillion-dollar pair, Apple and Microsoft, have followed similarly divergent paths in monetizing their respective platforms: Both own operating systems that connect application developers and users. And \u201cplatform\u201d businesses of various stripes seem to represent a disproportionate share of the market\u2019s hot tech start-ups, like Uber, Airbnb, Pinterest and Snapchat.A surprising number of business books have been published in the last few months that seek to explore the origins and implications of the emergence of the platform paradigm. The great virtue of the best of these, \u201cMatchmakers: The New Economics of Multisided Platforms\u201d (Harvard Business Review) by David S. Evans and Richard Schmalensee, is that it reminds us that there is nothing new about multisided platforms \u2013 which the authors call matchmaker businesses.The \u201cnew economics\u201d mentioned in the subtitle refers to what the authors misleadingly call the \u201cdiscovery\u201d of multisided businesses by fellow economists in 2000. Although the research cited was certainly important in understanding the dynamics of multisided markets, advertising-based media businesses have successfully operated in these environments for literally hundreds of years.An old-world media example quickly makes clear the unusual management challenges of operating multisided-platform businesses. To be successful, newspaper and magazine publishers need to attract both readers and advertisers, who represent the two sides of the platform. In most instances, however, to optimize overall profits, publishers must subsidize one side of the market. Rarely does the price of a subscription cover even the incremental cost of printing and distribution of the publication.This does not reflect a rookie mistake but a nuanced understanding of the tradeoffs between circulation and advertising revenue. If managers ignore the interaction between the different sides of a multisided market in developing pricing strategies, they will inevitably arrive at erroneous conclusions. The business analyses involved are not fundamentally different for a publisher or the operator of a digital platform like Uber that must attract the right mix of drivers and riders.But what has changed in the world to make these models apparently so much more prevalent? \u201cMatchmakers\u201d identifies \u201csix turbocharging technologies\u201d that it claims have \u201cturbocharged the ancient matchmaker model.\u201dSpecifically, the authors argue that the combined impact of improvements in computing power, bandwidth, networking and storage capacity have allowed the establishment of \u201ctwo foundational multisided platforms\u201d that support all the others that have rapidly emerged: Internet service providers (who provide the fixed and mobile connections among platform participants) and operating systems (which provide the common language that allow app developers to achieve mass adoption).History aside, the heart of \u201cMatchmakers\u201d is an entrepreneurial playbook of sorts for \u201cbuilding, igniting and operating matchmakers.\u201d The strongest part of the book is the detailed description of diverse platform business models, both new and old, some of which readers might not have even previously thought of as \u201cmatchmakers.\u201dFor instance, South Florida\u2019s upscale Aventura Mall is really a platform for commerce between retailers and shoppers. To succeed, the developer had to take into account land values, local demographics, nearby alternatives, which retailers and entertainment services to target and what and how to charge them, and the physical design. Similar complexity faced the founders of M-Pesa, a mobile money transfer service in Kenya that in the course of three years counted 42 percent of the adult population as registered users and transformed that economy.The problem with many of the books about the rise of the so-called platform economy is that they are filled with an unbridled optimism about the collective attractiveness of these businesses, particularly in their digital incarnations. Sure, they argue, incumbents will be disrupted, but in their stead will be bigger, stronger competitors in winner-take-all markets.They focus on \u201cnetwork effects,\u201d which can create a virtuous circle \u2013 sometimes called a flywheel effect \u2013 as new users on one side of a platform attract more on another and vice versa. The crucial attribute of network effects businesses is that every new participant increases the value of the network to existing participants.Alex Moazed and Nicholas L. Johnson are the consultants turned authors of \u201cModern Monopolies: What It Takes to Dominate the 21st Century Economy\u201d (St. Martins). Their book promises the same \u201cframeworks and insights we use to help our clients become modern monopolies.\u201d In their telling, the history of \u201cplatform capitalism\u201d appears to have started with eBay, which in part explains the inability of their \u201cframeworks\u201d to deliver on the assurance of market domination.\u201cPlatform Revolution: How Networked Markets Are Transforming the Economy and How to Make Them Work For You\u201d (Norton), another book written by industry consultants \u2014 these mostly with day jobs in academia \u2014 provides an even more expansive vision of the \u201crevolution\u201d wrought by the emergence of network effects as \u201cthe Internet-era source of market power,\u201d which \u201cis likely to strengthen a market\u2019s winner take all tendency.\u201dThe book\u2019s authors \u2014 Geoffrey Parker, Marshall W. Van Alstyne and Sangeet Paul Choudary \u2014 argue that the ascension of platform business models requires a fundamental rethinking of things as diverse as basic business strategy and government regulation. Their wide-ranging vision and predictions are undermined by frequent factual errors. For example, Sony does not own Time Warner movie and television studios, and Netflix does not have strong network effects.Even \u201cMatchmakers,\u201d which offers the most balanced picture of the challenges and opportunities of multisided platforms, plays down the structural fragility faced by all of the \u201cturbocharged\u201d matchmakers described. Mr. Evans and Mr. Schmalensee insist that \u201cnetwork effects power all multisided platforms.\u201d What\u2019s more, according to them, the digital developments recounted \u201chave resulted in a huge increase in the power and reach of these effects.\u201d Neither statement is true.First, plenty of multisided platforms do not have any significant network effects to speak of. A popular TV show attracts both viewers and advertisers, but it is the quality of the programming, not the presence of more advertisers, that keeps the audience coming back. TV and cable broadcasting networks, like most ad-based media businesses, are multisided platforms, but they have negligible network effects. Google, the mightiest exception to the digital fragility rule, is a platform business that does not benefit primarily from network effects but rather from traditional economies of scale.Second, the strength of network effects is often a function of the existence of reinforcing competitive advantages like economies of scale and, notably, customer captivity. The digital economy has undermined both of these barriers to entry by lowering both customer switching costs and the fixed-cost base that drives scale economies.So the Aventura Mall benefits from the long-term leases signed by retailers on the one hand and the fact that local shoppers need to go out of their way to find a comparable experience. Operators of digital malls, by contrast, rarely secure long-term commitments from either advertisers or sellers, and shoppers have multiple alternatives just a click away. And the fixed costs expended to build a traditional mall could easily fund many dozens of digital retail platforms.Even the authors of \u201cModern Monopolies\u201d concede that \u201ca modern monopoly\u2019s dominance\u201d is likely to be short-lived given \u201cthe competitive threat it faces from adjacent competitors and a constant onslaught of new entrants.\u201dAll three books provide useful, and mostly consistent, insights into how to build more resilient and valuable platforms. The diversity of businesses and outcomes described, however, suggest that the differences among platform businesses are far more important than their commonalities. This is at least good news for consumers who will benefit from multiplying innovations that reduce the annoying frictions of everyday life and the consultants who will be kept busy helping managers devise ways to prolong their increasingly tenuous perch as master of a modern monopoly.Jonathan A.

{"Headline": "Budweiser\u2019s New Campaign Taps Into Political Climate", "Date": "2016-05-15", "News": "Supported byAdvertisingIN RECENT years, Budweiser has taken to redesigning its labels for the summer season, evoking Independence Day with images of the Statue of Liberty or the American flag.This year, it went a little further, replacing the word Budweiser with \u201cAmerica,\u201d swapping out other parts of the text on can and bottle labels with lyrics from \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d and \u201cAmerica the Beautiful\u201d and putting the phrase \u201cE Pluribus Unum\u201d in the space that usually reads \u201cKing of Beers.\u201dA gesture that felt patriotic to some felt, in the midst of a polarizing election cycle, like pandering to others. Not a few people noted that Budweiser\u2019s corporate parent is the Belgian-Brazilian beverage conglomerate Anheuser-Busch InBev. The only common reaction the various parties had seemed to be the desire to express their opinions \u2014 colorfully, forcefully and with frequent assistance from the caps-lock key \u2014 on social media.\u201cI really don\u2019t know if they knew what they were getting themselves into,\u201d David R. Just, a professor at Cornell University who studies the intersection of food and marketing, said of Budweiser. \u201cIt caught me off guard that something like this could be politicized so easily.\u201dAnd that happened even before Donald J. Trump weighed in.Wednesday morning on Fox News, Mr. Trump was asked, \u201cDo you think you had something to do with Budweiser changing the name of their beer this summer?\u201d\u201cI think so,\u201d answered Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, whose campaign slogan is \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re so impressed with what our country will become that they decided to do this before the fact.\u201dAnheuser-Busch, for its part, said the creative elements of the \u201cAmerica\u201d campaign, which includes a new TV ad, digital content, billboards and retail marketing collateral, along with the redesigned labeling, had been in development for about the last year.\u201cI don\u2019t think they recognized the possibility for Donald Trump to abscond with their advertising campaign,\u201d Mr. Just said.The brand emphasized the patriotic intent of the campaign, saying the messaging aligned with Budweiser\u2019s advertising and sponsorship activities over the summer, including at the Summer Olympics in Brazil and the Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario soccer tournament.\u201cThe campaign is resonating with consumers because the timing is right \u2014 from the Olympics and Copa Am\u00e9rica to the U.S. presidential race, celebrations of patriotism will be at an all-time high this summer,\u201d Ricardo Marques, a vice president at Budweiser, said in a statement.Still, said Marcia Horowitz, a senior executive vice president at the publicity and marketing firm Rubenstein, \u201cputting \u2018America\u2019 on your can is not construed by many people as benign patriotism, not in this political season.\u201dMost brands try very hard to keep their ads politics-free. \u201cWhen brands try to jump into the middle of social issues, they can easily get into some trouble,\u201d said Timothy Calkins, a clinical professor of marketing at Northwestern University.With the America campaign, Mr. Calkins suggested Budweiser did intend to provoke a conversation, albeit not necessarily about Mr. Trump.\u201cThis is certainly an effort to get people to talk about Budweiser and give people a reason to reach for a Budweiser,\u201d he said, pointing out that the brand\u2019s ads have taken on a sharper edge in the recent past. In Super Bowl commercials for the last two years, for instance, Budweiser has taken jabs at hipsters and craft beer drinkers \u2014 a kind of us-versus-them narrative.\u201cBudweiser said, \u2018We\u2019re mad at everybody \u2014 we\u2019re mad at craft beers, at imported beer,\u2019 and that\u2019s a little bit in the spirit of Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Calkins said.As the debate unfolded on Facebook and Twitter, Budweiser stayed mostly silent at first. But as supporters began chiming in, its social media moderators have been working overtime, posting in response to both supportive and derisive comments pertaining to the beer\u2019s provenance that Budweiser is brewed at a dozen facilities in the United States in spite of its multinational corporate parent, asserting that Budweiser is a quintessentially American beer.Ted Marzilli, the chief executive of YouGov BrandIndex, which tracks brand perception, said he did not expect the details of Budweiser\u2019s corporate parentage to detract from sales. \u201cI think consumers who are upset about that have probably already stopped drinking Budweiser, if that was the reason,\u201d he said.In the first 48 hours after the announcement of the campaign (with Mr. Trump\u2019s interview on Fox occurring in the middle of that time frame), Budweiser amassed more than 1 billion impressions on news and social media, on par with a Super Bowl campaign. The brand said most of those were neutral to positive. YouGov BrandIndex data showed that three measurements of consumer sentiment \u2014 word of mouth, ad awareness and purchase consideration \u2014 all rose for Budweiser between Tuesday and Friday.Online, the brand has seemed to grow more confident. \u201cAmerica\u2019s greatness has always been achieved by people who give a damn, and we\u2019re proud to release this patriotic cans and bottles that embody that same spirit,\u201d a Budweiser representative said on Facebook in response to a positive comment.Marketing experts say this strange confluence of leadership and lager may wind up benefiting AB InBev, which this month reported to investors slipping sales of its flagship beer in the United States.\u201cWhen everything is said and done, this might work out just fine for Budweiser,\u201d Mr. Calkins said. \u201cPerhaps this is what the brand needs to be relevant in the world today.\u201dPurchase consideration \u2014 whether shoppers 21 and older would consider Budweiser the next time they bought beer \u2014 rose to 17 percent from 11 percent after the campaign was announced, according to YouGov BrandIndex data.Even if it was not Budweiser\u2019s intention, tapping into the polarization rife in American culture today could strengthen the brand\u2019s bond with core customers.\u201cIt alienates a certain group they didn\u2019t think was their audience, anyway,\u201d Mr. Just said, \u201cand they wanted to do that in a way so people who do identify with their brand are really going to see that as a positive.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Plan to Flood San Francisco With News on Homelessness", "Date": "2016-05-15", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 As the editor in chief of The San Francisco Chronicle, Audrey Cooper has overseen countless stories on homelessness. But the issue became personal three years ago when she was pushing her 6-month-old child in a stroller through the city\u2019s business district. A homeless couple in a tent on the sidewalk were having sex, tent flaps open, as their pit bull stood guard.\u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t have started yelling at them,\u201d she said in an interview in her fishbowl office in the heart of the Chronicle\u2019s newsroom. \u201cThey let their dog loose.\u201dSan Francisco residents have over decades become inured to encounters with the city\u2019s homeless population, the clumps of humanity sleeping on sidewalks under coats and makeshift blankets, or drug addicts shooting up in full view of pedestrians. There are also the tension-filled but common scenes of mentally ill men and women stumbling down streets, arguing with imaginary enemies or harassing passers-by.One particularly vocal group of residents, San Francisco\u2019s journalists, say they feel a sense of urgency in addressing the problem. They are banding together in an exasperated, but as yet vaguely defined, attempt to spur the city into action.Representatives from Bay Area television and radio stations, The Chronicle, The San Francisco Examiner, Mother Jones and online publications, among others, met last month to figure out a plan to share resources and content. They agreed to publish their reports on homelessness on June 29.\u201cWe are all frustrated,\u201d said Jon Steinberg, the editor in chief of San Francisco magazine, which is also taking part. \u201cWe are all fed up. We feel there is not enough movement and accountability on the issue.\u201d\u201cWe want the full force of the Fourth Estate to bear down on this problem,\u201d he added.Thirty news organizations have confirmed their participation. KQED, a public television and radio station, is also taking a lead role in the campaign.The premise of the effort is to create a \u201cwave\u201d of coverage that will force politicians to come up with solutions, Ms. Cooper said.\u201cYou will not be able to log onto Facebook, turn on the radio, watch TV, read a newspaper, log onto Twitter without seeing a story about the causes and solutions to homelessness,\u201d she said.Ms. Cooper said The Chronicle will run a week of coverage, including four articles that she described as something akin to a science project: putting forth a hypothesized solution and investigating it. The first proposal is that the city build a mental health center large enough to treat the mentally ill on the streets. The article will explore the cost and the feasibility of institutionalizing people.\u201cWe need to be a hell of a lot more creative about how we solve this problem,\u201d Ms. Cooper said. \u201cAnd we are probably going to have to break some dishes to do it.\u201d The paper\u2019s articles and photographs will be offered free to all participants. The paper will also run a front-page editorial with its conclusions on what solutions should be pursued.Advocacy is a longstanding taboo in American journalism, making reporters and editors wary of discussing solutions to the problems they highlight in their coverage. One rationale for this is that journalists who advocate causes might be selective in their reporting or biased in their coverage.In a city known for its liberal traditions, the question of whether San Francisco\u2019s journalists are crossing into activism has not come up, at least not in the initial meeting of news organizations last month.Ms. Kernan said her station plans \u201cblanket\u201d coverage on June 29, but will not propose solutions. \u201cI see what we are doing as pure journalism,\u201d Ms. Kernan said.Aaron Pero, news director of KRON-TV, a Bay Area television news station, said he planned to have a report on homelessness each day for a week, possibly profiles of homeless people.\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to try to figure out how to solve the homeless problem,\u201d Mr. Pero said. \u201cMy vision was to send a number of reporters out and to find a profile that we could do every single day.\u201dMr. Pero said it was \u201creally awesome that all these media outlets are coming together.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s been done anywhere else,\u201d he added.Only one local outlet, KCBS, a news radio station, declined to participate.\u201cIt\u2019s not because of any lack of interest in the homeless or any perception that the story is unimportant to our listeners,\u201d Jack Swanson, the director of news and programming at KCBS, said in an email. \u201cLike many media outlets in the Bay Area we cover the homeless situation in our communities and will continue to cover it, on a regular basis.\u201d(A New York Times reporter also attended the meeting. While The Times is not participating in the coordinated coverage, it has and will continue to cover homelessness as a major issue in the city.)Proponents of solutions-oriented journalism are applauding the initiative.\u201cThis is the kind of thing that is music to our ears,\u201d Ms. Martin said. \u201cWe have this bias in the media to think that our only job is the watchdog role.\u201dA journalist\u2019s job, she said, \u201cis not to pick a winner.\u201d\u201cYour job is to investigate solutions,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople want to read about how to fix broken systems.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Fortunately, he had ample opportunity to engage with creative young minds while running the Teen Council at the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston for several years.Mr. Cyrus, a member of the artist collective Otabenga Jones and Associates, was interested in the position because he was comfortable working with others. He was excited to collaborate with next-generation high achievers, and learned, during his tenure at the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, that coming of age in the 21st century has some obvious benefits.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sharper than we are,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust because of the total amount of information that they have access to. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re having to digest more complex ideas as part of having all that information. For those who can meet the challenge, it causes them to be better.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe students looked as much on culture as environment, including Danny Lyon photos from the civil rights era, a Tom Arndt picture of a Blackfoot teenager riding a bicycle in an anodyne Montana driveway, and an image by the FotoFest founders Fred Baldwin and Wendy Watriss, which depicts an East Texas Baptist preacher pointing skyward, midsermon.Although they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t physically hang the work on the wall, the teenagers handled all other aspects of contemporary curation, including selecting images, editing and sequencing, writing the gallery guide and speaking to the public during an exhibition walk-through.The curatorial assistant Haley Berkman, the Menil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s project leader, said the students culled through 3,000 images before ending up with a final 17. They had previously decided to elide color photographs, as the gallery space contained potentially damaging direct natural light. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs stewards of the photographs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to to put them through any undue harm. We want to protect them.\u00e2\u0080\u009dEli Winter, who joined the Houston council as a musician and writer and subsequently wrote the gallery guide, confirmed that it had that sort of impact. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe survey basically shows that teen councils are great incubators, not just for developing skills and connections in the art world, but also in terms of developing different personal skills,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPublic speaking, for example. Collaboration. Teamwork. Things you kind of take for granted.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Teen Council really took those abilities for me, the self-awareness of how I do those things, to the next level.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In particular, he mentioned that the Teen Council helped him break out of his introverted shell and gave him a sense of meaning and purpose.Alex Rodriguez, a transgender artist and fellow Teen Council member, also had a brilliant experience, after having to fight for a place in the group. Although rejected on a first attempt, Alex didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give up, displaying the determination required to make a living as a creative professional.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop me from wanting to keep trying,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Alex said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbecause it seemed like an amazing experience. I would consistently go to the events. Always help volunteer with cleanup, or whatever was needed. I would go to the artist talks and met with the person who was in charge of Teen Council and offered to help out.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMs. Berkman confirmed that Alex, through constant questions, soaked up as much knowledge as possible. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s understandable, as Alex grew up visiting Houston art museums, fantasizing about rearranging artwork on walls. Seeing the finished exhibition gave Alex a profound sense of comfort.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI guess if I was to compare it to something,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Alex said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost like the feeling when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been out for a long time and you just want to get home. And then you get home, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something really nice, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s someone you really wanted to see, maybe a really nice meal. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a satisfied feeling.

{"Headline": "One Week in April, Four Toddlers Shot and Killed Themselves", "Date": "2016-05-05", "News": "Supported byKANSAS CITY, Mo. \u2014 Sha\u2019Quille Kornegay, 2 years old, was buried in a pink coffin, her favorite doll by her side and a tiara strategically placed to hide the self-inflicted gunshot wound to her forehead.She had been napping in bed with her father, Courtenay Block, late last month when she discovered the 9-millimeter handgun he often kept under his pillow in his Kansas City, Mo., home. It was equipped with a laser sight that lit up like the red lights on her cousins\u2019 sneakers. Mr. Block told the police he woke to see Sha\u2019Quille by his bed, bleeding and crying, the gun at her feet. A bullet had pierced her skull.These are shooters who need help tying their shoelaces, too young sometimes to even say the word \u201cgun,\u201d killed by their own curiosity.They accidentally fire a parent\u2019s pistol while playing cops and robbers, while riding in a shopping cart, after finding it in the pocket of the coat their father forgot to wear to work. The gun that killed Sha\u2019Quille last Thursday was pointing up, as if being inspected, when it fired.With shootings by preschoolers happening at a pace of about two per week, some of the victims were the youngsters\u2019 parents or siblings, but in many cases the children ended up taking their own lives.\u201cYou can\u2019t call this a tragic accident,\u201d said Jean Peters Baker, the prosecutor of Jackson County, Mo., who is overseeing the criminal case in Sha\u2019Quille\u2019s death. Her office charged Mr. Block, 24, with second-degree murder and child endangerment. \u201cThese are really preventable, and we\u2019re not willing to prevent them.\u201dGun control advocates say these deaths illustrate lethal gaps in gun safety laws. Some states require locked storage of guns or trigger locks to be sold with handguns. Others leave safety decisions largely to gun owners.Gun rights groups have long opposed these kinds of laws. They argue that trigger locks can fail, that mandatory storage can put a gun out of reach in an emergency, and that such measures infringe on Second Amendment rights.\u201cIt\u2019s clearly a tragedy, but it\u2019s not something that\u2019s widespread,\u201d said Larry Pratt, a spokesman and former executive director of Gun Owners of America. \u201cTo base public policy on occasional mishaps would be a grave mistake.\u201dIn Kansas City, Sha\u2019Quille\u2019s family is trying to come to grips with her death and the murder charge facing Mr. Block. In interviews, several relatives said they did not believe he deserved to be convicted of felony murder, but some questioned his judgment in leaving a loaded gun out while he slept as well as his actions after he discovered that his daughter was grievously wounded.According to court records, Mr. Block told the police that immediately after the shooting, he went to the bathroom, wrapped the gun in a shirt and put it into a vent in the floor. He then ran outside carrying his dying daughter and yelled for a neighbor to call for help. He was also charged with evidence tampering.Sha\u2019Quille\u2019s mother, Montorre Kornegay, said that she had recently separated from Mr. Block after more than five years together, but that they remained close. She said he loved the girl, whose first word was \u201cDaddy.\u201d When he called Ms. Kornegay from jail, he told her he was sorry and talked about how much he missed Sha\u2019Quille.The girl was just 2, but wanted to be older, telling people she was already 5. She would run through the house, playing her own private game of peekaboo, relatives said. In a cacophony of squeaky children at home, relatives could always distinguish Sha\u2019Quille\u2019s low, raspier voice. One day, she\u2019ll be a singer, they told one another.\u201cWhat happened was wrong,\u201d Ms. Kornegay said. She said that she did not think Mr. Block deserved to face a murder charge, but that he had behaved irresponsibly. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you stay up and watch her?\u201dParents, police officers and neighbors from Georgia to California are asking similar painful questions this week. Here are some of their stories.In 2015, there were at least 278 unintentional shootings at the hands of young children and teenagers, according to Everytown\u2019s database. During the week in April when Sha\u2019Quille and the other children died, there were at least five other accidental shootings by children and teenagers. Alysee Defee, 13, was shot in the armpit with a 20-gauge shotgun she had used for turkey hunting in Floyd County, Ind. Zai Deshields, 4, pulled a handgun out of a backpack at her grandmother\u2019s home in Arlington, Tex., and shot her uncle in the leg.A child who accidentally pulls the trigger is most likely to be 3 years old, the statistics show.Holston Cole was 3, a boy crackling with energy who would wake before dawn, his pastor said. He loved singing \u201cJesus Loves Me\u201d and bouncing inside the inflatable castle in his family\u2019s front yard in Dallas, Ga.About 7 a.m. on April 26, he found a .380-caliber semiautomatic pistol in his father\u2019s backpack, according to investigators. The gun fired, and Holston\u2019s panicked father, David, called 911. Even before a dispatcher could speak, Mr. Cole wailed \u201cNo, no!\u201d into the phone, according to a redacted recording.Mr. Cole pleaded for his 3-year-old son to hold on until the ambulance could arrive: \u201cStay with me, Holston,\u201d he can be heard saying on a 911 tape, his voice full of desperation. \u201cCan you hear me? Daddy loves you. Holston. Holston, please. Please.\u201dHolston was pronounced dead that morning.The local authorities have been weighing what can be a difficult decision for prosecutors and the police after these shootings: Whether to charge a stricken parent or family member with a crime. While laws vary among states, experts said decisions about prosecution hinge on the specific details and circumstances of each shooting. What may be criminal neglect in one child\u2019s death may be legally seen as a tragic mistake in another.Officials with the Paulding County Sheriff\u2019s Office have suggested that they expect Mr. Cole to face, at most, a charge of reckless conduct.\u201cAnything that we do, criminally speaking, is not going to hold a candle to the pain that this family feels,\u201d said Sgt. Ashley Henson, a spokesman for the sheriff\u2019s office. Sergeant Henson said investigators had sensed early on that the shooting was accidental. \u201cYou want to be able to protect your family and take care of your family, but on the same hand, you\u2019ve got to be safe with your weapons,\u201d he said.Some gun control groups have urged states and district attorneys to prosecute such cases more aggressively, saying that, grief aside, people need to be held responsible for what are easily preventable deaths.Brent Moxey, the pastor who officiated at Holston\u2019s funeral, said the boy\u2019s father was already haunted. \u201cI think he runs the scenario over and over and over in his mind.\u201d Mr. Moxey said the family \u2014 which did not respond to a message left at their home seeking comment \u2014 was still asking for privacy.About 1,000 mourners attended Holston\u2019s funeral on April 30, remembering a boy who loved superheroes and would sometimes wrestle cardboard boxes. The day he died, he spent time alongside his mother, Haley, as she read the Bible, playing with the highlighter pen she used to note passages, Mr. Moxey said.\u201cThis little boy loved to tinker and to play, and he loved to get into things,\u201d Mr. Moxey said, describing the very impulse that probably led to Holston\u2019s death. \u201cHe loved to figure out how stuff works.\u201dIn Indianapolis, Kanisha Shelton would stay protectively near her 2-year-old son, Kiyan, watchful of the stray dogs known to roam through the neighborhood.But on the night of April 20, Ms. Shelton stepped away from the boy, leaving him in the kitchen while she was upstairs. She had placed her purse out of his reach on the kitchen counter, but when her phone started ringing, the boy apparently pushed a chair close to the counter, climbed onto it and reached for the purse, according to an account from a cousin, John Pearson. There was also a .380-caliber Bersa pistol in it.Just after 9 p.m., Ms. Shelton heard a loud bang and rushed downstairs. There, in the kitchen, she found Kiyan lying on the floor, bleeding from a gunshot wound to the chest. He was rushed to a local children\u2019s hospital, where he was pronounced dead.Ms. Shelton\u2019s mother, who answered her daughter\u2019s cellphone, said the family did not want to speak about the death. No criminal charges have been filed.The police in Indianapolis said such scenes were becoming more common. \u201cThe mother was obviously very shaken up,\u201d Capt. Richard Riddle said. Indeed, on Sunday night, another child, 10 years old, died in what the police say appears to have been another accidental shooting.\u201cThat doesn\u2019t stop them from playing with it,\u201d he said.Mr. Pearson said he sympathized with Ms. Shelton and thought of Kiyan\u2019s death as a tragic accident. \u201cIt was up on the counter, so I do think she thought she put the gun away, out of the baby\u2019s reach,\u201d Mr. Pearson said. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be in a living hell.\u201dEssie Jones, who lives across the street, said Ms. Shelton had recently taught Kiyan to ride a small bicycle with training wheels, guiding him on the bike in the driveway. \u201cThey\u2019d be up in the yard playing,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was very happy.\u201dIn a condolence book online, Dianna Mitchell-Wright, who identified herself as \u201cAuntie,\u201d wrote of her anguish over losing the boy she had nicknamed \u201cMy Main Man.\u201d\u201cAll I have are memories,\u201d she said, \u201cand your pictures in my cellphone.\u201dThe coffin that held Za\u2019veon was no bigger than a piece of carry-on luggage, and it was so light that two pallbearers easily carried it through the packed St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church in Bermuda, La.The police arrested a companion of the mother, Alverious Demars, 22, on charges of negligent homicide and obstruction of justice. Detective Greely said that the police believed that the pistol belonged to Mr. Demars, and that he hid it after the toddler shot himself. The police have not found the weapon.\u201cAs a responsible adult it\u2019s his obligation to secure that \u2014 to make sure a child does not get ahold of it,\u201d Detective Greely said, explaining why Mr. Demars had been arrested.The family declined to speak, but in a Facebook post, the boy\u2019s mother, Destiny Williams, wrote that she had not been able to sleep and was a \u201cuseless sad waste.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t take life,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhy is it so cruel and unrelenting and unforgiving.\u201dThe funerals for these children were filled with a similar anguish.At the funeral for Baby Zee, the wails and screams grew so loud during a final moment of goodbye that ushers closed the church doors to give the family privacy. In Georgia, Holston\u2019s father tearfully read a letter that reflected on how the family used to sing \u201cJesus Loves Me.\u201d At the Kansas City funeral for Sha\u2019Quille, family members crumpled as they looked into the coffin, shaking with tears or kissing her.The day after Sha\u2019Quille was buried, her maternal grandmother, Pamala Kornegay, reflected on the girl who was missing from the cluster of grandchildren who sat coloring on her living room floor. Ms. Kornegay said she was not angry with Sha\u2019Quille\u2019s father.\u201cWe\u2019re just upset,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was careless. It could have been prevented.\u201d So senseless, she said, because Mr. Block had loved his daughter so dearly.\u201cHe would take a bullet for her,\u201d she said.Jack Healy reported from Kansas City; Julie Bosman from Chicago; Alan Blinder from Dallas, Ga.; and Julie Turkewitz from Denver.

{"Headline": "Is Your Food \u2018Natural\u2019? F.D.A. to Weigh In", "Date": "2016-05-17", "News": "Can you define the word \u201cnatural\u201d?In fact, more than a hundred class action lawsuits have accused companies of misleading consumers by slapping the words \u201call natural\u201d on products that contain synthetic, artificial and genetically engineered ingredients. A number of federal judges have urged the F.D.A. to weigh in, saying that they cannot rule on whether companies improperly used the term on their products until the F.D.A. defines what it actually means.But can it?Until now, the F.D.A. has \u00e2\u0080\u009crespectfully declined\u00e2\u0080\u009d judges\u00e2\u0080\u0099 requests. It has mostly referred the public to an informal advisory it published more than two decades ago, which stated that natural means that \u00e2\u0080\u009cnothing artificial or synthetic,\u00e2\u0080\u009d such as color additives, has been added to a food that would not normally be expected to contain it.But that advisory is not legally enforceable, nor was it intended to address processing methods such as pasteurization and irradiation or, for that matter, genetic engineering.Among those who have called on the F.D.A. to take a stronger stance on the meaning of the word is Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York State attorney general, who wrote a letter this month urging the agency to adopt a definition that excludes synthetic and artificial ingredients, as well as genetically modified organisms, or G.M.O.s.Mr. Schneiderman asked the agency to restrict the definition to minimally processed foods like ground nuts and washed salads, or foods that were prepared using traditional techniques like roasting, drying, smoking and fermenting.Forbidding genetically modified foods to be called natural would be similar to the standards for organic labeling, which are tightly regulated by the United States Department of Agriculture and which exclude G.M.O. foods from carrying the organic certification.Under Mr. Schneiderman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definition, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnatural\u00e2\u0080\u009d would essentially mean not made by humans, and subjected to little or no processing.But other experts say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not so simple. For decades, countless varieties of crops that ultimately became supermarket staples were created through breeding practices that involved subjecting the crops to radiation to attain favorable genetic mutations \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including the ruby red grapefruit, said Michael Jacobson of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group in Washington.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think if you ask the average person they would say that ruby red grapefruits are natural,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Jacobson said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut ruby red grapefruits were derived decades ago from seeds that had been treated with irradiation. Some people would say that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s human intervention and so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not natural. There are plenty of reasons why the natural issue has gotten so messy and why the F.D.A. has run the other way from it.\u00e2\u0080\u009dTo avoid those issues, some argue that the definition should refer only to the post-harvesting period, so that foods that are plucked from the ground or produced by farms and brought to market as is are considered natural, while those that are subjected to extensive processing are not.All would agree, for example, that an organic peach at a farmer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s market is natural. But what about a peach that is sliced, dried and preserved with citric acid, an organic compound that can be isolated from lemons or made in a factory? What if the peach is sliced and preserved with sugar, and then sold in a can? And what if that sugar is high-fructose corn syrup, or cane sugar from G.M.O. crops?\u00e2\u0080\u009cEveryone is always going to have their own conception of what is natural,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Marsha Cohen, a law professor and expert on food law at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe most logical position is to say this word is never going to be meaningful enough to not be misleading to people.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWith so many nuances and thorny questions to address, the F.D.A. could choose to ban the use of the word natural from labels entirely. Food labels have become so crowded with information \u00e2\u0080\u0094 nutrition facts, organic certifications, claims about hormones, gluten, whole grains and G.M.O.s \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that for many people it is difficult to figure out what to focus on, said Margot Pollans, an expert on food law at the Elisabeth Haub School of Law at Pace University.After a while, all the label claims can start to seem like white noise. But while \u00e2\u0080\u009call natural\u00e2\u0080\u009d seems to confuse consumers even further, the F.D.A. is unlikely to forbid its use altogether.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe problem that the F.D.A. would then encounter is the First Amendment \u00e2\u0080\u0093 free speech,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ms. Cohen of U.C. Hastings. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe F.D.A. would have a very long road ahead of it to just ban the word completely.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn the end, that may not be necessary. The fear of litigation has already caused food industry giants like PepsiCo, Frito-Lay, Campbell Soup and others to abandon their use of the word on products, said Jason J. Czarnezki, the executive director of environmental law programs at Pace University. Across the food industry, the number of products claiming to be \u00e2\u0080\u009cnatural\u00e2\u0080\u009d fell to roughly 22 percent in 2013 from about 30 percent in 2010.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think companies are moving away from words that in some ways might be considered consumer fraud,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Czarnezki said.The F.D.A. should nonetheless issue a strict definition of \u00e2\u0080\u009cnatural,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said \u00e2\u0080\u0094 one that not only excludes artificial, synthetic and genetically engineered ingredients but that also restricts foods that have a large carbon footprint. Mr. Czarnezki said it is up to the agency to help consumers make sense of all the confusion.\u00e2\u0080\u009cEven the most educated consumer can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what the word means,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.Related:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

Wearing signature Cossack black-and-red fleece hats, the attackers yelled \u201coccupiers\u201d and \u201cget off our land.\u201dAfterward, one of the Cossacks argued on the Govorit Moskva radio station that, the shower of milk notwithstanding, a member of Mr. Navalny\u2019s group had started the fight. A review of the video of the confrontation does seem to back up the claim, with an activist in a red shirt throwing an elbow at an older man.Several police officers arrived on the scene, but seemed unable or unwilling to do much about the situation.

Trump denounced the Republican Party as a \u00e2\u0080\u009crigged\u00e2\u0080\u009d system of party insiders trying to control the levers of power.But with the nomination fight behind him, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign has moved to take advantage of the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s full array of assets, whether communications aides, a trove of data, a field operations staff or the ability to fund-raise jointly. That last piece is particularly important, as Mr. Trump turns to the task of raising hundreds of millions of dollars for the general election, probably against a well-funded Hillary Clinton and the outside groups supporting her.

{"Headline": "Obama\u2019s Vietnam Trip Follows Controlled Parliamentary Elections", "Date": "2016-05-20", "News": "Supported byHANOI, Vietnam \u2014 By the time President Obama arrives here Sunday night, all-day voting in tightly controlled elections for members of the rubber-stamp Parliament will have just finished.In this Communist-ruled nation, the names that were not allowed to appear on the ballots tell more of a story than the 870 scrupulously vetted candidates permitted to compete for 500 seats.After enduring harassment and denunciations orchestrated by the Communist Party, all of them were forced out during a pre-selection process.Among those who ran unsuccessful campaigns for office were Mai Khoi, 32, a popular singer-songwriter known as the Lady Gaga of Vietnam, and Nguyen Quang A, 69, a former member of the Communist Party, businessman and founder of the Civil Society Forum.Even a trusted member of the governing elite, the former deputy head of state-controlled Vietnam National Television, Tran Dang Tuan, did not pass the vetting committees run by Communist Party stalwarts.On paper, Vietnam\u2019s Constitution allows any citizen to run as a candidate. But in reality, the country remains a one-party state, with people allowed to vote only for the candidates handpicked by the party. \u201cWe want to change the fake right to participate in the elections into a real right,\u201d Mr. Quang A said.Mr. Obama\u2019s three-day visit also comes in the midst of mounting public anger over tons of dead fish that washed up on the shores of central Vietnam close to a newly opened steel plant. The police have quashed demonstrations in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City against the Taiwan-owned plant in the last month, and hundreds of protesters have been detained, organizers said.Last Sunday, leaders of the protests in both cities were blocked from leaving their homes by security guards posted outside, and more than 300 police officers watched 10 protesters hold banners on a street in Hanoi before arresting them.Vietnam remains one of the most repressive states in Asia, and while the Obama administration has called for the release of political prisoners and criticized the election process as \u201cneither free, nor fair,\u201d Washington is walking a delicate line.Almost all the people selected by the Front to participate in the vetting meetings were older, loyal party members, she said.In Ms. Mai Khoi\u2019s constituency, most of the party members involved in vetting were about 60, the singer wrote on her Facebook page. In the end, she was rejected, she said, because of her youth.Some candidates also faced intimidation. A month before the party called the meeting in Mr. Quang A\u2019s neighborhood to select the candidates, party propagandists made a video in which his neighbors were asked to denounce him. In the video, shown on a state-run website, he was called a reactionary aligned with foreign forces, he said.A few days before the selection meeting, in March, he was detained for six hours at a police station, he said.When he appeared at the meeting, called a \u201cvoters\u2019 conference,\u201d all 75 selectors were members of the Communist Party, veterans groups or the Fatherland Front, he said. \u201cI thanked them for gathering, even though I didn\u2019t agree with the process,\u201d Mr. Quang A said.Intimidation from the security forces frightened some of the independent candidates. When a Western ambassador asked some of the candidates to come to his residence, only Mr. Quang A, the most experienced, dared to turn up, a diplomat who arranged the invitation said.The next election for the General Assembly is not for another five years. After she was rejected as a candidate, the police closed down a concert planned by Ms. Mai Khoi. She has told supporters she is not sure what she will do next.But Mr. Quang A says he will continue to press forward in what he calls a \u201cdifficult but bright journey.\u201d He is not depending on support from the United States, he said. \u201cThey have many interests here,\u201d he said. \u201cPolitical and human rights is just one.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Must Suspicions About Personal Health Be Shared With an Insurer?", "Date": "2016-05-04", "News": "Supported byThe EthicistI have Parkinson\u2019s disease \u2014 at least, I think I do. I have a slight tremor in my right hand, my posture is becoming more stooped and I have a diminished sense of smell. I have not spoken about this with a physician. I have discussed it with a couple of other people who have the disease.I\u2019m 70 years old, and I have decided to apply for long-term-care insurance. If I am correct about my Parkinson\u2019s, I am statistically at much higher risk of needing long-term care than the average insurance applicant. I have answered all the questions on the insurance application honestly. One of the questions begins, \u201cHave you consulted a physician regarding any of the following conditions,\u201d and it lists many illnesses, including Parkinson\u2019s. Well, I have not consulted any physician about my condition. And I don\u2019t think I will until the symptoms become strong enough that I require the use of pharmaceuticals to help me manage.Because insurance takes on functions we consider basic to social welfare, it tends to be a heavily regulated industry. Federal statutes now mean that medical insurers generally can\u2019t charge more for a \u201cpre-existing condition\u201d or take genetic information into account. Long-term-care insurance, though, is a different creature. Here, insurers can sort applicants into different risk classes based on their medical histories and even their parents\u2019 medical histories. They can charge higher rates, or deny coverage altogether, to certain applicants.Which brings us to you. The insurer could have asked other questions and learned facts that would have been relevant to your policy\u2019s expected cost. Some questions go unasked because they\u2019re not legally permitted (your race or national origin) or because the company has no way of telling if you have answered truthfully (Do you sometimes wake up with leg cramps?). Even if you think the insurer would be better off knowing the answer to a question it didn\u2019t ask (Do you think you have Parkinson\u2019s?), you\u2019re under no obligation to disclose it.After all, insurers already know about you. In the aggregate, I mean. You exemplify what they call \u201cadverse selection.\u201d It\u2019s the tendency of individuals who think they may be at particular risk to seek to insure themselves against that risk. Actuaries and underwriters aim to factor in the existence of such people (albeit not always successfully). Research has shown that, say, people at risk for Huntington\u2019s are much more likely to have long-term-care policies. Underwriters stay in business by being students of human behavior. So you\u2019ve already been priced in.As long as you are truthful in your application, then, you\u2019re not the fly in the ointment. You are, so to speak, on the ointment\u2019s list of ingredients. All that said, the long-term-care insurance market doesn\u2019t work especially well these days. People are living longer, and ailing longer, than was anticipated two or three decades ago, when these products became available, and fewer policies have been dropped. Insurers have lost money; policyholders have faced sharp increases in rates; the overall market is small. Meanwhile, as more information about genetic susceptibilities becomes available to people, long-term-care insurers will want to know what applicants know.We could pass laws to prevent genetic discrimination (as we have with medical insurance), but knowing less than their applicants could drive insurers out of this market. In the end, I suspect, it\u2019s going to seem sensible to create publicly funded arrangements that cover everyone.Finally, some medical (rather than ethical) advice. You might want to get yourself to a doctor to see whether your amateur diagnosis is right. For all you know, your symptoms might be the result of a condition best treated soon.On the second front, each of us can do a little, but change will only come from the concerted actions of many. People who realize these views are not only false but also harmful should say as much when the occasion arises. In so doing, as you point out, we also express our solidarity with those who suffer as a result.But we have to do this carefully. The object is to try to change people\u2019s attitudes, not to make ourselves feel good. My bet is that your aunt doesn\u2019t recognize that she\u2019s a bigot. Some of her mistaken views may simply be the result of misinformation. Correcting facts can be more effective in changing a person\u2019s views than accusing the person of a vice, such as racism. And criticizing someone in public can be hurtful in a way that keeps the substance of what you are saying from being heard. So let me acknowledge a potential conflict between what will help your aunt be a better person and what will help improve the atmosphere on the web, which, at least in principle, may include taking issue with these views in front of third parties. Without wading into the debates over \u201ccall-out culture,\u201d I suspect that especially with a relative, there\u2019s a good case for \u201ccalling in,\u201d rather than calling out.You don\u2019t say how often you see your aunt in the flesh. When you do, it might be worth taking up these issues with her gently. Emails and Facebook comments are not very effective forms of communication about difficult issues. On the web, I\u2019m convinced that it\u2019s more productive to produce and pass on helpful, positive ideas than to keelhaul people with harmful, negative ones. Evidence suggests, however, that this is a minority view.Kwame Anthony Appiah teaches philosophy at N.Y.U.

{"Headline": "New Police Chief Seeks to Overturn Ferguson\u2019s Legacy of Turmoil", "Date": "2016-05-08", "News": "Supported byQ. and A.What are some of the challenges you expect to face in Ferguson?The department needs diversification. The department now has very few females in sworn positions. There\u2019s, I think, a total of 54 police officers, and I think three or four African-Americans.That could be a couple of things: One could be that the department didn\u2019t have a large turnover, people didn\u2019t leave. That could speak for a great working environment, but it could also be that there are biases in the hiring practice and how they\u2019re selective \u2014 or it could be that their recruitment efforts are not up to par in terms of diversification.How do you diversify in a city that\u2019s facing financial problems?There won\u2019t be a magic pill, when I suddenly go from this amount of African-Americans, this amount of women or this amount of whatever to this. But what I\u2019ll be looking at is how we do things with attrition, and other things that naturally occur, that cause officers not to be in the department anymore. Some may leave because they may not like their new boss. Police officers are inherently resistant to change.Are you nervous that, internally, there will be a sense of \u201chere\u2019s this new guy from out of town telling us what to do\u201d?Being the new guy from out of town, there\u2019s always going to be some pushback. Even when the guy comes from within, there\u2019s pushback, because there\u2019s resistance to change. I am not nervous about it, I expect it. The challenge will be to figure out how to work around it, or there are some people who will decide the Ferguson Police Department is not where they want to be.Besides diversification, do you have a list of things you know you want to do when you get there?Do you think there was a really tense relationship with the police in Ferguson, even before Michael Brown?I noticed that along certain racial lines there were different views of the police. Some people thought the police were great in their neighborhoods, some people thought police weren\u2019t so great. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as tense a powder keg as it\u2019s been perceived to be.I think a lot of what added to the situation there \u2014 not that there weren\u2019t problems \u2014 but a lot of what added to that was the backdrop of the national narrative, where if something happens in Iowa, it has a bearing on police in Miami.But it was a powder keg, it was a powder keg that blew.It was a powder keg that blew, but I think that could have happened anywhere.I don\u2019t discount anything in the D.O.J. report. I talked to people who verify some of those things. I am not saying it\u2019s \u201ceither/or,\u201d I am saying it\u2019s \u201cand.\u201d The national narrative says one thing, and so you get an incident that reinforces that.How do you think you would have handled the Michael Brown situation differently?I don\u2019t want to Monday morning quarterback how they handled it. I want to move forward. I don\u2019t really want to re-litigate the Michael Brown situation, but I will be looking at that situation top to bottom to see what lessons can be learned. I am not going to weigh in until I have had a chance to analyze it a lot more closely and listen to varying perspectives.You became a major without moving up through the ranks, being sergeant and lieutenant. How did that go over in the department?I am sure some people didn\u2019t like it, but it\u2019s almost like \u2014 what do they call it \u2014 there is a term for it when you are promoted at sea or in the middle of battle. What happened was that I was doing the job long before I got the actual rank.The city manager in Ferguson was quoted talking about how your media relations and community relations experience made you the strongest candidate. What about crime and police work?Well, what people don\u2019t realize is that the community relations aspect of it is very critical to solving crime. We not only solve crime, we prevent crime because of the relationship. When the relationship is bad, that suffers. Police officers come into a neighborhood 10 hours a day, but it\u2019s the people who live there who know what\u2019s going on. If they don\u2019t want to talk to the police or deal with the police, you\u2019re not going to solve anything and you\u2019re certainly not going to prevent anything.You talk a lot about leadership and how that can shape a police department.I took this job for a specific reason. I have said it time and again: I was mistreated by police officers. I saw the way police officers acted in my community. I was determined to be a better service provider than I had gotten.What crime problems does Ferguson face?Like the rest of the nation, we\u2019re seeing not so much an uptick in crime, but actually an uptick in crimes committed by younger people. The new phenomenon is with regard to social media, you disrespect me on social media, I\u2019ve got to do something dramatic so it can be posted on social media so I can get my street cred back. For a 51-year-old guy, that\u2019s kind of something new for me to wrap my head around. So it\u2019s important for me to keep listening to this generation of police officers who grew up attached to their cellphones and attached to Facebook and Snapchat and Instagram. We\u2019ve got to get their input, because they\u2019re the ones who are going to offer some solutions.Were there special challenges you faced as a black police officer, particularly starting out?The biggest challenge is that, ingrained in the American fabric there is a disconnect between the African-American community and the police department. A lot of it is for historical reasons, some of it is for things that happen that reinforce those old demons, and so as a police officer early on, both communities had a problem knowing how to look at you and how to perceive you.You think that\u2019s changed?I don\u2019t think it changed, but the challenges and reasons are different. Some things have happened because we do have police officers who don\u2019t do the job the way it\u2019s supposed to be done. You have police officers who bring their biases to the job. We can move the department ahead 100 steps, and you take one of those incidents \u2014 one incident, first of all, that\u2019s very real to the person \u2014 but also played to that historical narrative, and it\u2019s a whole lot steps back, more than you have been able to advance. I don\u2019t know how we get past that challenge. I don\u2019t know if that will happen in my lifetime. It is certainly my goal or my mission.Have you ever faced direct \u2014 or indirect \u2014 racism as a police officer? The law enforcement forum LeoAffairs.com has some pretty racist people on it, and they don\u2019t criticize you without mentioning in a negative way that you are black.LeoAffairs \u2014 I call it where cowards grow. So many things on there are the very thing the community has a problem with. It\u2019s very obvious from those posts there are people who are racist, people who are sexist, who are downright ignorant and they wear the badge. They prove themselves all the time there.It\u2019s one of the reasons I don\u2019t go on there. In a broader sense, LeoAffairs reinforces all those things that people say, negative about police.Anything you want to add?Ferguson is going to be an interesting challenge for me for a lot of reasons. One, even with all my experience, I am going into a city I don\u2019t know, with people I don\u2019t know. One of the things I learned a long time ago is, not everyone who comes up to you trying to be your friend, is. As chief, one of the things happens is there are people in your midst that covet the seat you sit in.It\u2019s more of a challenge for Ferguson. I am leaving Miami, where I still have a home, still have people who love me, and a community that\u2019s really supportive, and a pretty good size pension, so I can always come back. Ferguson can\u2019t come back to the beach in South Florida. It\u2019s incumbent upon the city of Ferguson, the people who really care, to work with me to help me succeed, so that we all succeed, so that three months from now, or a year from now, there is not some other chief sitting there going through the same challenges.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sorry, We Don\u2019t Take Obamacare", "Date": "2016-05-14", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisAMY MOSES and her circle of self-employed small-business owners were supporters of President Obama and the Affordable Care Act. They bought policies on the newly created New York State exchange. But when they called doctors and hospitals in Manhattan to schedule appointments, they were dismayed to be turned away again and again with a common refrain: \u201cWe don\u2019t take Obamacare,\u201d the umbrella epithet for the hundreds of plans offered through the president\u2019s signature health legislation.\u201cAnyone who is on these plans knows it\u2019s a two-tiered system,\u201d said Ms. Moses, describing the emotional sting of those words to a successful entrepreneur.\u201cAnytime one of us needs a doctor,\u201d she continued, \u201cwe send out an alert: \u2018Does anyone have anyone on an exchange plan that does mammography or colonoscopy? Who takes our insurance?\u2019 It\u2019s really a problem.\u201dThe goal of the Affordable Care Act, which took effect in 2013, was to provide insurance to tens of millions of uninsured or under-insured Americans, through online state and federal marketplaces offering an array of policies. By many measures, the law has been a success: The number of uninsured Americans has dropped by about half, with 20 million more people gaining coverage. It has also created a host of new policies for self-employed people like Ms. Moses, who previously had insurance but whose old plans were no longer offered.Yet even as many beneficiaries acknowledge that they might not have insurance today without the law, there remains a strong undercurrent of discontent. Though their insurance cards look the same as everyone else\u2019s \u2014 with names like Liberty and Freedom from insurers like Anthem or United Health \u2014 the plans are often very different from those provided to most Americans by their employers. Many say they feel as if they have become second-class patients.Some early studies of the impact of the Affordable Care Act plans are proving patients\u2019 grumbling justified: Compared with the insurance that companies offer their employees, plans provide less coverage away from patients\u2019 home states, require higher patient outlays for medicines and include a more limited number of doctors and hospitals, referred to as a narrow network policy. And while employers tend to offer their workers at least one plan that allows them coverage to visit doctors not in their network, patients buying insurance through A.C.A. exchanges in some states do not have that option, even if they\u2019re willing to pay higher premiums.Many of the problems may well be the growing pains of a young, evolving system, which established only broad standards for A.C.A. plans and allowed insurers \u2014 a large majority of them for-profit \u2014 considerable leeway in designing their exact offerings. The specific requirements and policing mechanisms vary by state, and are still works in progress.Daniel Polsky, executive director of the Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics at the University of Pennsylvania, is among the researchers who have been studying the law\u2019s effects on patients\u2019 access to care. \u201cWe hear lots of complaints, but we really don\u2019t know the extent of the problem because there\u2019s still very little data,\u201d he said.The legislation created four tiers of insurance \u2014 bronze, silver, gold and platinum. The different levels represent the amount of medical costs a patient could expect their insurance to contribute: 60, 70, 80 or 90 percent. But within each tier there are dozens of plan designs that give buyers the choice of different premiums, deductibles and networks of doctors, among other things. And the options are different in each state. The A.C.A.\u2019s target audience included both low-earning Americans \u2014 those too wealthy to qualify for Medicaid but too poor to afford commercial insurance \u2014 and those who could not buy insurance through an employer, either because they were self-employed or because their jobs for small companies didn\u2019t offer coverage.Some of the problems may have been predictable. When designing the new plans, for-profit insurers naturally tended to exclude high-cost, high-end hospitals with whom they had little clout to negotiate discounts. That means, for example, that as of late last year none of the plans available in New York had Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in their network \u2014 an absence that would be unacceptable to many New York-based employers buying policies for their employees. Another issue is out-of-state coverage, which many A.C.A. plans don\u2019t offer aside from emergencies, and which is routinely offered in policies from companies \u2014 especially large ones \u2014 with workers in more than one state.As a result, many parents who were excited that they would be able to keep their children on their policies until age 26 have discovered that this promise has gone unfulfilled. When Sara Hamilton of New York was shopping on the exchange for a plan to cover her and her two young-adult children \u2014 who live in distant states \u2014 she discovered that none of the plans covered doctor visits in those places.And when Simon F. Haeder of the University of Wisconsin and his colleagues studied the plans sold on the California exchange, they found that they included 34 percent fewer hospitals than those sold on the open market and tended to exclude the priciest medical centers, like Cedars Sinai, a highly regarded hospital that runs the largest heart-transplant program in the country.Plan size, of course, is not the only consideration. The research also showed that those limitations might not matter so much for patients\u2019 health: The distance traveled and the quality of the providers was similar under both types of policies. He acknowledged, however, that California\u2019s exchange, called Covered California, has higher standards for plans than others do, and those results may not be typical.For certain patients, narrower networks can be attractive because they tend to have lower premiums. A recent analysis by the management consulting firm McKinsey & Company found that premiums were 22 percent higher for plans with broad, as opposed to narrow, networks.Meanwhile, as researchers continue to evaluate the pros and cons of new exchange plans, patients are discovering the pitfalls.In 2013, Angie Purtell of Tega Cay, S.C., bought a gold plan offered by Coventry Health Care. When notified that the plan would double its monthly premium the following year, to nearly $1,000, she went shopping again on the state exchange and chose a Blue Cross silver plan for $500. It was branded \u201cChoice.\u201dBut when she tried to visit her longtime doctor using the new plan, she found she could not. The doctor\u2019s practice, while in South Carolina, was not covered because it is affiliated with the Carolina Medical Center, a few miles over the border in Charlotte, N.C.In order to make smart choices, patients need far clearer and more accurate information about the plans\u2019 restrictions as well as which doctors and hospitals are in the network. Yet such information is rarely available, and early research suggests that only a fraction of the doctors listed in some directories are available to see new patients.\u201cNow that you have the A.C.A., we really need to talk about what is an adequate network,\u201d Mr. Haeder said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t really talk about that until we know that the listings are accurate, and they\u2019re not.\u201dACROSS the country, lawmakers and regulators are refining the plans\u2019 requirements to make sure they work better. And regulators are trying to mandate better information, provided in a more consumer-friendly format.As of this year, the government requires all the plans listed on the national online exchange \u2014 used by 38 states \u2014 to provide accurate, up-to-date directories. But such directories are often hundreds of pages long, and there is little enforcement. Even the government advises consumers to double-check with their insurers.The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently proposed that states develop quantitative requirements for adequate networks \u2014 how many specialists of a certain type, for example, are necessary in a specific geographic area. But after protests from insurers and some states, the agency settled \u2014 for now \u2014 on a more limited fix that allows states and insurers more time to address the problem.Next year, the government will begin requiring insurers to label plans \u201cstandard\u201d (an average number of doctors for an exchange plan) versus \u201cbroad\u201d or \u201cbasic\u201d for those offering more or less choice. A few states are enacting their own laws.But health and consumer advocates say progress is too slow, often leaving patients in the dark as they struggle to buy and use the new plans. Even as conservatives in Congress and the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Donald J. Trump, have vowed to repeal the A.C.A., many consumers just want the system to work better.\u201cI\u2019m putting my energy into improving transparency and information,\u201d Dr. Polsky said. \u201cOtherwise, we\u2019re headed to a poorly implemented strategy that just ticks people off.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Graves of the Marines I Lost", "Date": "2016-05-28", "News": "Supported byOpinionIN his Pentagon office, Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has a picture of a war memorial in a working-class neighborhood of South Boston, his hometown. Dedicated in 1981, it commemorates local troops killed in Vietnam: 25 young men, several of them friends since childhood, died in combat there. Inscribed at the bottom of the polished black granite surface are the words \u201cIf you forget my death, then I died in vain.\u201dFew sentences better distill the spirit of Memorial Day. On Monday, President Obama is expected to place a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington National Cemetery, where, since 1864, more than 400,000 fallen troops have been interred. He may also pay homage to the troops still fighting in the nation\u2019s two longest wars, in Iraq and Afghanistan \u2014 neither officially declared, neither actually over.For those who have lost loved ones in battle, a different and quieter sort of memorializing is likely to take place in homes, churches and neighborhood cemeteries. \u201cI miss you\u201d posts will be left on Facebook pages remembering lost sons and daughters. Veterans will gather with their former units, recalling buddies over beer and burgers. Parents, children and spouses will lay wildflowers, notes and bottles of liquor near simple grave sites in remote towns. These are the places where so many service members come from and where so many return to in death.Created after the Civil War, Memorial Day is an odd holiday, at once a solemn commemoration of those killed in war and a day of beach outings and backyard barbecues celebrating the start of summer. Rarely does it serve as a time to reflect on the policies that led to all those deaths.While in Iraq and Afghanistan, I witnessed military officers and enlisted soldiers, at all ranks, being held accountable for their decisions. I have yet to see that happen with Washington policy makers who, far removed from the battlefields, benefit from our collective amnesia about past military and foreign policy failures.The commander in chief and the senior military brass should leave the manicured grounds of Arlington and visit some of those places where most of America\u2019s war dead are buried: farm towns, immigrant neighborhoods and working-class suburbs. At a time when fewer and fewer of us have any real ties to the military, how better to remind the nation that our troops are not just faceless volunteers, but people who live next door?Over the last four years, I have visited a dozen such cemeteries. One was in Newcastle, Wyo. (population 3,532, according to the last census), where Staff Sgt. Brian Bland was laid to rest on a hill overlooking an oil refinery and a Pizza Hut. His granite headstone is shaped like a mountain peak.Outside Cherokee, Iowa (population 5,253), at the Galva Veterans Memorial, I stood at Cpl. Nathan Schubert\u2019s grave, next to his father\u2019s, surrounded by green cornfields and grain silos. Etched on his headstone are pine trees and pheasants in flight.In Menard, Tex. (population 1,471), I located Capt. Paul Christopher Alaniz, buried alongside his mother. Colorful ceramic tiles adorned his grave\u2019s concrete plot, hand painted by his wife and children with the words \u201cLove\u201d and \u201cPapa, Happy Father\u2019s Day\u201d and \u201cA classy tie for a classy guy.\u201dI visited each one because I was directly involved in the decision that led to their deaths.In late 2004, Marine commanders in Al Anbar Province and I, the State Department representative in Falluja, needed a strategy to secure polling sites in violent western Iraq so that Iraqis, particularly Sunnis, would be able to vote. I argued that Marines should be sent to far-flung villages to protect local residents as they voted. Gen. Dunford, who was back then a brigadier general, wisely pushed for keeping Marines concentrated in the largest population centers. During a final meeting, I pulled civilian rank and overruled the headquarter staff officers. Within a few days, the election-support mission was widened to locations across Al Anbar.In the early hours of Jan. 26, 2005, one of two large Marine helicopters transporting troops for this expanded and therefore riskier mission crashed, killing all onboard: 30 Marines and a Navy corpsman. The accident would remain the single-largest casualty incident in either the Iraq or Afghanistan wars. On polling day, Jan. 30, only a small percentage of Sunnis voted in the vast province, just as Anbari leaders had predicted.I promised myself that night that I would visit all 31 grave sites. I needed to get a sense of where these military service members came from: the schools and churches they attended; the streets where they learned to drive; the neighborhoods where many of their families still lived. This now decade-old promise, I knew, would be only the beginning of a lifelong personal reckoning.Some grave sites I\u2019ve gone to are closer to home. After much searching, I found the tombstone of my great-uncle Harold, who served in the Battle of the Bulge and died, most likely a suicide, after returning from World War II with a drinking problem. He was interred in a ramshackle cemetery in Pinto, Utah (population fewer than a dozen), reachable only by washboard-rough dirt roads, where rattlesnakes, jackrabbits and lizards seek shade under sagebrush and juniper trees.During these visits, I also think of the hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and tens of thousands of Afghans who have died in our recent wars, a majority of them innocent civilians. They, too, remember the dead in personal ways and private rituals. Families and neighbors gather as the customary three days of mourning among Muslims begins. Food is shared. Stories about the deceased are told and retold. A friend born in Baghdad told me the Iraq war had led to \u201ccaravans of the dead\u201d being transported to cemeteries, adding, \u201cthere is a shortage of burial plots today because of so much death.\u201dPERHAPS it is surprising that some Iraqis and Afghans still hold favorable views of America. And yet I receive regular emails and calls from friends there. When the astronaut Neil Armstrong passed away in August 2012, the only note I received from anyone, including all my American friends and relatives, was from a young Afghan medical doctor, Jamshid. From Jalalabad, a dangerous city on the easternmost edge of Afghanistan in a region once frequented by Osama bin Laden, he wrote: \u201cSo sad about the death of nail armstrong he was the real poineer who had shown his heroism & persuade human to seek & try more and has made clear that nothing is impassable.\u201dIt took an Afghan friend to remind me of this enduring story. And it reminded me of my father, a zoologist and amateur astronomer. In Vietnam \u2014 like Iraq, another unnecessary war \u2014 he was an infantry sergeant flying between Saigon and Pleiku under a full moon when Armstrong took his famous step in 1969.That night in Iraq when I heard about the helicopter crash and the 31 servicemen who had died, I was devastated. It was late, but I went out on a run, hoping it would bring some calm. It did not. But a ritual of my own was born. Since returning home, I have learned that the best way to get to know America\u2019s war dead is to put on my running shoes before sunrise and pace along the quiet streets where they lived and loved before fighting and dying in America\u2019s longest wars.These are the places where America\u2019s war dead are best known and still mourned. Not just on Memorial Day, but every day.J. Kael Weston, the author of \u201cThe Mirror Test: America at War in Iraq and Afghanistan,\u201d was a State Department official in Iraq and Afghanistan from 2003 to 2010.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York Times Co. to Offer Buyouts to Employees", "Date": "2016-05-25", "News": "Supported byIn a bid to continue aggressive digital expansion while controlling costs, The New York Times will offer voluntary buyout packages to members of the newsroom and several business departments at the end of the month, the company announced on Wednesday.Members of The Times\u2019s executive committee, including Arthur Sulzberger Jr., the newspaper\u2019s publisher, and Dean Baquet, its executive editor, said in a memo to employees that the buyouts were a part of the company\u2019s larger mandate to build a more digitally focused newsroom and to reach its stated goal of doubling digital revenue by the year 2020.\u201cThese plans will no doubt lead to new initiatives and investments,\u201d the memo said. \u201cAt the same time, we will also need to make tough decisions about what to stop doing. Wherever we can reduce costs without damaging the values, and value, of Times journalism, we will do so.\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Baquet characterized the buyouts as \u201ca big step toward building The New York Times of the future.\u201d He said The Times was not planning layoffs this year but would take other measures to cut costs in some areas and dedicate resources to other areas.\u201cI don\u2019t want to speculate about next year,\u201d he said, addressing layoffs, \u201cother than to say I\u2019ve made it very clear the newsroom has to be somewhat smaller. Not radically smaller, but somewhat smaller.\u201dMr. Baquet also emphasized that The Times\u2019s news operation, which employs 1,300 people, would need to shift to accommodate more people with skills in visual journalism and more people from diverse backgrounds, while continuing its focus on deep reporting.\u201cOne of the goals of journalism is to play the world back to itself,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that if you don\u2019t look a little bit more like the world than we do.\u201dThe announcement on Wednesday did not specify the number of buyouts that would be offered, but it said packages would be distributed electronically to all eligible employees on May 31, who would then have until mid-July to consider the offer.As with previous buyouts, the company can accept or deny buyout applications.The Times is negotiating with the NewsGuild on a new contract, and both are still working out the final terms of the buyout offer.\u201cThis buyout offers an excellent opportunity for some employees to leave on their own terms,\u201d Grant Glickson, the chairman of the Guild unit at The Times, said in an email.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Conventions, a Debt to Donors", "Date": "2016-05-11", "News": "Supported byEditorialIndustries with business before the federal government have long found opening their checkbooks for the conventions to be one of the most efficient means for influencing an incoming administration and Congress in one quick action.Come July, some of America\u2019s best-known companies will pay to celebrate the nomination of Donald Trump, whose racist rants have in the past caused NBC, Macy\u2019s and Nascar to distance themselves from him. Progressive political groups like ColorOfChange.org and Credo Action are pressuring Coca-Cola, Walmart, Microsoft, Facebook and Google to cut off money for the Republican gathering. But the protest against Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t address the deeper problem of corporate influence over both parties.The ITT scandal prompted legislation that provided public financing for conventions, and limited their budgets to that amount. But the parties soon found multiple ways around that, including using \u201chost committees\u201d that operate in the cities where the conventions are held, soliciting unlimited amounts of convention money from corporations and wealthy individuals. These committees, established to skirt federal laws banning corporations from giving to political parties directly, should be abolished.The law shifted ever-escalating convention costs onto rich donors and corporations like Google, Facebook, Duke Energy, Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Bank of America, General Motors and AT&T, which were all past contributors. Corporations can give unlimited cash, services and swag to Democratic and Republican host committees for conventions that basically are four-day-long parties. Shareholders in these companies pick up the tab since the money comes directly from corporate coffers.This year, the two political parties together will most likely spend upward of $150 million on their conventions, all of it paid by private entities.Lawyers who advise corporations on campaign finance laws say that so far, most previous corporate donors will continue financing both conventions, eager to ensure that they\u2019re covered regardless of which party takes the White House in November. \u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous system that creates widespread opportunities for influence peddling,\u201d says Fred Wertheimer, who leads Democracy 21, a campaign finance watchdog group.Convention spending is part and parcel of the creeping corporate buyout of America\u2019s political system. In a year marked by voter anger at a political class out of touch with struggling Americans, one might expect both Republicans and Democrats to rein it in. But as with all political spending, the tendency is always toward more, not less. That publicly held companies seeking favors from the government will underwrite this excess is offensive, and entirely legal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Crowdsourcing to Get Ideas, and Perhaps Save Money", "Date": "2016-05-11", "News": "Supported bySome of the best business ideas are inspired by others, or so the wisdom of the crowd goes. That is leading more entrepreneurs to tap into other people\u2019s brains \u2014 rather than just their pocketbooks \u2014 to test new products, set pricing and bring ideas to market faster.But before Ms. Mayer took any steps to set up the company, she turned to the crowd for advice, sending out thousands of survey forms to answer one crucial question: Would people pay for this decorating service? Before quitting her job as a business strategist and spending thousands on a new venture, Ms. Mayer wanted some sign that the venture would succeed.\u201cYou want to make sure other people believe what you believe,\u201d said Ms. Mayer, who has an M.B.A. from Harvard and has worked as a consultant. \u201cThat takes some risk out of it.\u201dMs. Mayer, now chief executive of Havenly, has been turning to the masses for answers ever since, including testing her pricing, products and website design. (The interior decorator who didn\u2019t have enough clients is now her design director.) Development is costly, reasoned Ms. Mayer, who even learned coding to start the site, so it\u2019s important to make choices that are as right as possible.\u201cCrowdsourcing is fast, cheap and scruffy,\u201d she said, \u201cespecially when you need to move quickly.\u201dWhile well-established crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo dip into people\u2019s pockets, crowdsourcing taps into their brains. Experts say that turning to the masses can even yield sharper answers than other methods.UserTesting, for instance, helped Speek, a conference calling service, adjust its web design to make it more understandable. As a result, registrations jumped 60 percent, according to Speek.Ms. Mayer herself turned to UserTesting, which offers access to more than a million users, for ideas on Havenly\u2019s site design. Based on the feedback, one of the things she added was a budget calculator.\u201cEmployees don\u2019t question as much,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery decision feels more momentous in an innovate-or-die world.\u201dHarnessing the brain power of outside consultants and focus groups can be costly and time-consuming. But crowdsourcing gives companies a bigger toolbox. Companies can both test new products and develop customer loyalty, Ms. Gerber said.IdeaScale, whose client roster includes big companies like Xerox and Ikea, has even run crowdsourcing campaigns for the White House, yielding money-saving ideas like a high-tech tool lending library at NASA.Ms. Mayer, a self-proclaimed data geek, has turned to crowdsourcing repeatedly over the last two years. One of Havenly\u2019s web features is a style survey, using crowdsourced data, that walks customers through a fun, quick questionnaire that helps define their tastes. Havenly also crowdsourced the prices for its services. A $79 price seemed to be ideal for a \u201cmini-design\u201d of one room, based on surveying of users and nonusers alike.When harnessing the crowd, questions can\u2019t be broad, though. Focusing choices between different options, is crucial. Hone questions from a set of hunches, advised Ms. Mayer, and ask as many people as possible.Mr. Hicken suggested querying about 500 people. \u201cThat\u2019s the right sample size,\u201d he said. \u201cIf 75 percent say \u2018yes\u2019 to a product, you can be sure that they want it.\u201dThat user data helped her create an algorithm to allow customers to choose better-fitting bras that are also stylish. An online form helps match users to bras bought by similar women with similar preferences, minimizing the need for returns, Ms. Hashay said.Other online retailers are turning to crowds for the final say on which products to develop.\u201cWe suffered through the old retail model,\u201d he said, \u201cand the capital requirements. You can never guess right.\u201d And even using the crowdsourced model, some jacket or shirt designs that were shown online as prototypes didn\u2019t end up attracting enough buyers, he said.The company\u2019s new approach is simple, yet deeply cost-effective. A garment is designed and then posted on the site. If 100 people order it, for example, it goes into production. The result: zero inventory and zero waste. The system also allows the company, Mr. Gustin said, to offer jeans once priced at more than $205 for $81, and a $200 Japanese cotton button-down shirt for $69.Testing a garment\u2019s crowd appeal has yielded some surprises, Mr. Gustin said, like the demand for red denim. Over all, Mr. Gustin said, he no longer had to risk capital to innovate or fill up warehouses, and has experimented with 300 different types of denim in three years.\u201cRetail is old-fashioned,\u201d said Mr. Gustin, who used to work at technology software companies. \u201cBut we wanted to break every rule. We took nothing for granted.\u201dCrowdsourcing does have its risks, however. For example, trade secrets may be inadvertently revealed, said Ms. Gerber of Northwestern.To guard against that, entrepreneurs can survey small bites of information rather than reveal their entire strategies.Another benefit for companies is that crowds typically are not offered payment for their input, saving companies on market research costs.But the people in the crowd \u201cdo get bragging rights,\u201d she said. \u201cSo there are reputation benefits.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated last year\u2019s revenue for Brayola. It was $6 million, not $16 million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Australia Does Anxiety", "Date": "2016-05-30", "News": "Supported byMELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 Australia cruised through the 2008 global financial crisis on the back of a massive minerals boom. China could not get enough of its iron ore. The lucky country, rich enough to be a laid-back country, proved its good fortune once again. After agriculture and wool came coal and ore. Meltdowns were for losers.In the United States, there is the affectation of industriousness. People like to make it appear they work all the time. In Australia, as the environmentalist Tim Flannery observed, there is the affectation of effortlessness. People are determined to make it appear they are not working too hard. Sometimes that is the case.But some of the angst endemic to the developed world, with its lost manufacturing jobs and squeezed opportunities, has seeped of late into the irreverent Australian psyche. The minerals bonanza and commodities frenzy are over. Jobs in services are beginning to follow manufacturing offshore. For many young Australians the only way to get into the stratospheric Sydney housing market, inflated by rule-of-law-seeking Chinese buyers, is to wait for parents to die. Unemployment is not high, but underemployment is. Australia is America\u2019s ally in an increasingly Chinese neighborhood; that could be problematic. The next big thing is unclear.Could Australia\u2019s luck have run out? Is it ripe for the politics of anger that play well these days from the United States to Austria?\u201cThere has never been a more exciting time to be an Australian,\u201d insists the conservative Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. He\u2019s big on digital innovation, from which he made a fortune, and the convergence of great universities, scientific research and creative industries. Ministerial delegations troop off to Israel to learn how to turn \u201cshe\u2019ll-be-right\u201d Australia \u2014 a country that believes things work out somehow \u2014 into start-up Australia.That is troubling to some. \u201cFor a lot of people, innovation equals \u2018I am going to lose my job,\u201d\u2019 David Smith, a political scientist, told me. \u201cThey\u2019re asking why it\u2019s so exciting to be an Australian now.\u201dThis is the backdrop to a July election in which Turnbull and his conservative Liberal party confront Bill Shorten of the opposition Labor party. Turnbull promises a more entrepreneurial Australia, Shorten a fairer one. \u201cThere has never been a less exciting time to be an Australian voter,\u201d Michael Fullilove, the executive director of the Lowy Institute in Sydney, noted.The Labor party has committed to legalizing same-sex marriage and fighting climate change, issues Turnbull has shied away from. Climate change is nonsense for the flat-earth rightist wing of his Liberal party, whose figurehead is the former Prime Minister Tony Abbott. Turnbull took Abbott\u2019s job but has generally hewn to the Abbott line.Australia shows signs of the fundamental divide in developed societies today \u2014 between an international urban elite of progressive social values and angry nativists suspicious of the outsider, blindsided by globalization, wary of change, and unsure of their children\u2019s future.Humanity is showing its other face. The sway of neoliberal economics favoring the wealthy in Western societies, the departure offshore of manufacturing jobs, stagnant wages, large refugee flows from war zones, media outlets with tribal followings and the flourishing of violent anti-Western jihadi ideology in an Arab world of blocked political systems have created a near-perfect storm for rightist populists of the Abbott and Trump ilk. In the United States, two wars without victory that involved vast expenditure of blood and treasure \u2014 wars in which Australia (as ever) fought alongside America \u2014 have contributed to a mood of restive frustration. When the authority of a great power ebbs, and the tectonic plates of the global order shift, there is always a frisson of danger.Australia in its vastness, at once protected and troubled by the tyranny of distance, watches the American and European political dramas from afar. But it is not immune to the new anger \u2014 as Turnbull\u2019s deference to Abbott shows. That is a sign of the extreme vigilance needed in a world of violent volatility.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ads Evolve Into New Forms as Media Landscape Shifts", "Date": "2016-05-08", "News": "Supported byPeter Naylor, head of advertising sales at Hulu, stood on a stage before a roomful of advertising executives who were there to see what the popular streaming service had in store for the year. After trumpeting Hulu\u2019s new interactive ads, Mr. Naylor made another pitch. \u201cWe offer you the opportunity to become part of the creative process with us,\u201d he said.Meaning what, exactly?This kind of advertising through product placement is certainly not new. But Mr. Naylor\u2019s announcement \u2014 made during last week\u2019s Digital Content NewFronts, an annual sales event where companies like Hulu compete for digital advertising dollars \u2014 underscored a broader question running through the advertising industry: What exactly constitutes an ad these days?For decades, 30-second television commercials were the gold standard, and as online video proliferated, many digital ads were essentially repurposed from TV. But in the last several years, advertisers have become more sophisticated, creating digital ads that were divorced from traditional campaigns and were better suited to the many platforms that have become available, including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Snapchat. Now, online ads interrupt nearly everything.This explosion of online ads, however, has led to the rising use of ad blockers and turned \u201cadvertising\u201d into something of a dirty word. So advertisers and publishers are now looking for ways to make online ads less like ads. Many in the industry are even changing the way they talk about ads.During the NewFronts, Hulu and many other companies, often using a rhetorical sleight of hand, put forth the idea that ads are the products of symbiotic relationships, rather than frustrating invaders. Jennifer L. Wong, president of digital for Time Inc., told advertisers the company was \u201chelping brands develop original content\u201d and added, \u201cWorking with us is easy.\u201d Lisa Valentino, head of ad sales for Cond\u00e9 Nast, urged the audience to \u201ctake a look at the results when Cond\u00e9 Nast tells your story.\u201d Ze Frank, president of BuzzFeed Motion Pictures, said the company worked \u201cwith brands and agencies to develop original content.\u201dMany companies ran flashy videos that showcased examples of these partnerships, much like ad agencies pitching clients. BuzzFeed, for instance, promoted its Tasty channel as a successful example of how it could work with brands like Oster, which makes grills and other appliances.Publishers are \u201cno longer content to be the place where ads go,\u201d said Ben Winkler, chief investment officer for the agency OMD United States. \u201cWhat we\u2019re hearing at this NewFronts more than ever is this can be a two-way exchange.\u201dThe rhetorical gymnastics, however, also signal a deeper trend in the ad business. As companies seek to remove clutter from their sites while also bolstering their ad revenue, many are turning to so-called branded content, a widely used but vague industry term that generally means ads that look more like things people actually want to read or watch.Many publishers, including Vice and The New York Times, have formed what are essentially internal agencies that create ads for brands. And many already boast of success, or at least the promise of it.\u201cWe believe branded content and native solutions is a large-scale opportunity for Time Inc.,\u201d Joseph A. Ripp, chief executive of Time Inc., said on an earnings call last week. \u201cWe are increasingly hearing from C.M.O.s that they want to speak to their customers in the same way that Time Inc. talks to its audiences,\u201d he added in a reference to chief marketing officers.NBC, for example, announced last month that it was planning to cut about 30 percent of the ads from episodes of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d next season and allow advertisers to create original segments. Turner, which is part of Time Warner, and Viacom, which owns MTV and Comedy Central, have also said they plan to reduce the amount of commercials on their cable networks.With online ad spending growing, finding ways to stand out among the onslaught of other online ads has become more important for advertisers. And therein lies a possible conundrum: Advertisers want their ads to look less like ads even as they are fighting harder for attention.As Caty Burgess, senior vice president for media strategies at the CW television network, said, \u201cIs the question, \u2018What is an ad?\u2019 or \u2018What isn\u2019t an ad?\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Donald Trump and Bikers Share Affection at Rolling Thunder Rally", "Date": "2016-05-29", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Donald J. Trump, the Manhattan real estate mogul who boasts about his wealth, maintains a fleet of aircraft and sells his own brand of neckties, paid respects on Sunday to an incongruous constituency.\u201cLook at all these bikers,\u201d Mr. Trump, standing before a crowd in front of the Lincoln Memorial, said with admiration. \u201cDo we love the bikers? Yes. We love the bikers.\u201dMr. Trump was addressing a gathering at the 29th annual Rolling Thunder motorcycle run, a vast event over Memorial Day weekend that is dedicated to accounting for military members taken as prisoners of war or listed as missing in action.Bikers assembled at the Pentagon before riding en masse into the nation\u2019s capital, with many dressed in leather vests covered in patches, their bikes rumbling throughout the afternoon.For the blunt-spoken Mr. Trump, who likes to stress his desire to strengthen the military and improve how veterans are treated, the gathering provided a receptive audience, if one where he might otherwise seem out of place.\u201cHe speaks what\u2019s on his mind and means what he says,\u201d said Tom Christian, 43, a heating and air-conditioning contractor from Tennessee. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what a biker does. That\u2019s the way we are: We say what we think. If you like it, you like it. If you don\u2019t, go the other way.\u201dThe warm embrace from the crowd gave no hint of the controversy that Mr. Trump incited last year when he denigrated the military service of Senator John McCain of Arizona, a former prisoner of war in North Vietnam. Mr. Trump said Mr. McCain, a fellow Republican, was not a war hero, saying, \u201cI like people that weren\u2019t captured, O.K.?\u201dCampaigning in Wisconsin in March, Mr. Trump observed that Mr. Walker was \u201calways on a Harley.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not a huge biker, I have to be honest with you, O.K.?\u201d Mr. Trump added. \u201cI always liked the limo better.\u201dNancy Regg, a spokeswoman for Rolling Thunder, said the group had invited Mr. Trump to appear. The group did not extend an invitation to Hillary Clinton or Senator Bernie Sanders, she said.Richard McFadden, 58, an annual Rolling Thunder attendee from North Carolina, said Mrs. Clinton would not have been welcome.\u201cJust like asking Jane Fonda to show up, it\u2019d be a very, very bad thing,\u201d said Mr. McFadden, who works in computer support and wore a button that read, \u201cHillary for Prison 2016.\u201d\u201cI said, \u2018What are they all doing here?\u2019 and my people would say, \u2018They\u2019re here to protect you, Mr. Trump,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing thing. And I want to tell you, some of these people are tough.\u201dBut when he shakes their hands, \u201cthere is love, and it\u2019s an incredible feeling, and that\u2019s why I wanted to be with you today,\u201d he said.Wearing a red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat and forgoing a necktie, Mr. Trump pledged to rebuild the military and said George S. Patton and other deceased generals were \u201cspinning in their graves.\u201dHe lamented that veterans \u201chave been treated so badly in this country\u201d and asserted that in many cases, immigrants in the country illegally were taken better care of. He said that on Tuesday he will detail the money he had raised for veterans\u2019 groups.Standing before the reflecting pool with the Washington Monument offering a striking backdrop, Mr. Trump also expressed disappointment about the size of the crowd, which did not fill the space cordoned off in front of the Lincoln Memorial for the event.\u201cI thought this would be like Dr. Martin Luther King, where the people would be lined up from here all the way to the Washington Monument,\u201d he said.He seemed to blame event organizers, saying he passed enormous crowds along the roads on the way to the gathering, including \u201cthe most beautiful bikes I\u2019ve ever seen in my life.\u201dTwo retirees from New Jersey, Tom Gadosky and his companion, Marney Pratt, who are both 67, traveled to Rolling Thunder on their three-wheeled Harley-Davidson. Both plan to vote for Mr. Trump in November.\u201cA lot of the people, if you walk around, are baby boomers, like us,\u201d Ms. Pratt said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through it all. We want to have it back again.\u201dNeither of them was bothered by what Mr. Trump had said about Mr. McCain. People, Mr. Gadosky said, \u201chave very short memories.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Titans Raise Their Guard, Pushing Back Against News Media", "Date": "2016-05-27", "News": "Supported bySilicon Valley JournalWith its response, the tech community\u2019s message is clear: Treat us the way we want to be treated or we might retaliate. Even though Silicon Valley professes to be for free speech \u2014 this is where Twitter was invented, after all \u2014 the reaction opens a window into the thinking of the digerati, who are becoming more guarded and elusive even as their products make the world more transparent.Given Mr. Thiel\u2019s \u201cbeliefs and objectives, I can\u2019t fault him for his approach,\u201d Parker Thompson, a partner at the venture capital firm 500 Startups, said in an interview.Mr. Thompson was just one of dozens of techies in Silicon Valley who talked or tweeted their approval of Mr. Thiel and their disapproval, or worse, of Gawker and Valleywag in the last few days.Late Friday, First Look Media, which was founded by Mr. Omidyar, said that in keeping with its mission to protect the First Amendment, it would be helping to organize supporting briefs for Gawker\u2019s appeal.\u201cThe possibility that Gawker may have to post a bond for $50 million or more just to be able to pursue its right to appeal the jury\u2019s verdict raises serious concerns about press freedom,\u201d Lynn Oberlander, general counsel for First Look, said in a statement.\u201cWe welcome the support at the appellate level,\u201d Gawker said in its own statement.In some ways Silicon Valley\u2019s reaction is not surprising. A journalist\u2019s job, at least in theory, is to ask questions and print the truth, which means it is less than loved in citadels of power. But in Silicon Valley, even the media hates the media.For Ken Shotts, who teaches ethics and strategy at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, Mr. Thiel\u2019s secret campaign against Gawker brought to mind General Motors\u2019 pursuit of Ralph Nader 50 years ago. G.M. set private detectives on Mr. Nader to get the dirt on him that would nullify his criticism of its Corvair car. G.M. went beyond the pale, and was punished. The president of G.M. was forced to appear before Congress and apologize for harassing and intimidating the company\u2019s critic.\u201cCompanies face constraints,\u201d said Mr. Shotts. \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing. Individuals are less constrained, and billionaires hardly at all.\u201dFrom this perspective, what Mr. Thiel did was less of an aberration and more of that old Silicon Valley stand-by: a new product launch. It is now out of stealth mode and getting good reviews among potential users.As a result, Mr. Shotts said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see more cases like this.\u201dThe situation is complicated by the fact that these days rich tech companies, their owners or venture capitalists are as much the owners and producers of the media as the subject. With the traditional media in a weakened state, it is a trend that seems to be accelerating.Facebook and Andreesen Horowitz declined to comment.\u201cGawker tried to have it both ways,\u201d Venky Ganesan, managing director of the venture capital firm Menlo Ventures, said in an interview. \u201cThey wanted to be taken seriously as journalists, yet they didn\u2019t follow all the norms.\u201dTwenty-five years ago, tech coverage was the domain of geeks and trade reporters \u2014 people who understood their way around a motherboard, were excited by it and wouldn\u2019t dream of crossing certain boundaries. Now, with tech at its zenith, much of the coverage of the industry is still done by enthusiasts. Combine this with the need to get the power players to come to the media\u2019s conferences and there is a real reluctance to look behind the scenes.The result, she wrote, is \u201ca sense of entitlement in the industry where denizens of Silicon Valley expect the media to actively support them and any negative portrayals are met with real anger and resentment, even when they\u2019re 100 percent accurate.\u201dSam Altman, the president of Y Combinator, tried to chart a middle ground between Gawker and Mr. Thiel in a series of posts on Twitter.Danielle Ivory contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.But bringing around this vocal and defiant core of Sanders supporters may not be easy. One need only surf through the dozens of Reddit forums devoted to Mr. Sanders, or the comments on his Facebook page, to find countless examples of ambivalence, if not outright hostility, toward Mrs. Clinton.On Twitter, the hashtags #BernieOrBust and #StillSanders have been used more than a million times since January, according to Zignal Labs, an analytics company that tracks social media. Some Sanders supporters have even co-opted the Republican hashtag #NeverHillary.Already, some of the technology professionals who volunteered countless hours to the Sanders campaign are turning away from Mrs. Clinton and toward progressive candidates further down the ballot.\u201cIf Bernie doesn\u2019t win, we need to still carry that torch, as it were,\u201d said Jon Hughes, a developer who built voteforbernie.org and helped organize the campaign\u2019s digital volunteers. \u201cAnd there are a lot of great candidates out there that can do that.\u201d\u201cFor this campaign, social media hasn\u2019t just been about spreading a message,\u201d said Kenneth Pennington, Mr. Sanders\u2019s digital director. \u201cIt\u2019s been an avenue for broader participation.\u201dYet even an enthusiastic endorsement from Mr. Sanders may go only so far. For all the cooperation between the campaign and its online foot soldiers, they remain a sprawling, decentralized group over which Mr. Sanders exerts little control.\u201cIt\u2019s not an army, it\u2019s a swarm,\u201d said Micah L. Sifry, a founder of Personal Democracy Media. \u201cThey\u2019ve flocked to Sanders in response to the moment of opportunity he seized in the last year, but as the primary comes to its conclusion, they won\u2019t be commanded by Bernie or any other general.\u201dThey have already demonstrated their unruliness, with the rise of the so-called Bernie Bros, known for aggressive online harassment of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s supporters. And though Mr. Sanders\u2019s prospects have dimmed, the anti-Clinton rhetoric from some of his backers has grown more heated.Mr. Pennington, of the Sanders campaign, said it was too early to speculate about what Mr. Sanders\u2019s online supporters would do if he ended his campaign. But some of them are already beginning to lend their efforts to progressive candidates in different races.\u201cProgressive candidates usually do not have the same reach or accessibility towards apps or resources to help jump-start their campaign,\u201d said Rapi Castillo, a software developer and member of Coders for Sanders. \u201cWe could have a lot of impact.\u201dOf course, the more willing Mrs. Clinton is to incorporate some of Mr. Sanders\u2019s policy positions into her campaign, the more success she will have wooing his supporters \u2014 at least to a point.\u201cShe can win some of them with honey, but if she tries to command them, they\u2019ll just sting her,\u201d Mr. Sifry said. \u201cAs swarms may do.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Using Tweets and Posts to Speed Up Organ Donation", "Date": "2016-05-10", "News": "Supported byFixesFirst of two articles. In 2004, Rick Segal, a father of four living in Rye, N.Y., found his stamina inexplicably failing him as he did his regular runs. He went to see his doctor, and learned he had a genetic disease that enlarges and weakens the heart. Segal was about to turn 50, but his heart was pumping at one-eighth of a normal heart\u2019s effectiveness. He needed a transplant.He got on a waiting list, and for the next five years, he was in and out of hospitals while his heart deteriorated further. He underwent multiple 12-hour operations. A defibrillator was installed in his chest. Then came mechanical pumps for both ventricles. \u201cI got a belt from a police wholesale site to carry around these huge batteries,\u201d he said. Because the heart pumps had an 18-month life span, an imminent transplant became his only option.On Monday, Feb. 9, 2009, the 29th day of his 1A status, he and his wife were driving on the Hutchinson River Parkway to NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital to seek end-of life-counseling \u2014 \u201cWe had pretty much given up hope,\u201d he said \u2014 when the phone rang. \u201cThey said: Go home, pack your bags. A heart has been found.\u201d A 26-year-old intravenous drug user from Boston had overdosed. The next day his heart was pumping in Segal\u2019s body.\u201cThey tell you in six months, you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re 20 or something,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was true.\u201dWhat could be done to harness people\u2019s generous impulses more effectively to save lives?This approach is shaking up longstanding assumptions.In practice, legal registration may be overemphasized. It may be just as important to simply make your wishes known to your loved ones. When people tell relatives, \u201cIf something happens to me, I want to be an organ donor,\u201d families almost always respect their wishes. This is particularly important for minors, who cannot legally register as donors.If you post or tweet about organ donation, or include a hashtag like #iwanttobeanorgandonor, #organdonor, #donatemyparts, or any of a number of other relevant terms, Organize captures the information and logs it in a registry. In a year, it has gathered the names of nearly 600,000 people who declare support for organ donation. Now the big question is: Will it actually increase organ donation rates?We should begin getting an idea pretty soon. Organize has been working with the Nevada Donor Network to test its registry. And in the coming months, several other states will begin using it.\u201cIt\u2019s a moral imperative to help next of kin make the most educated decision about their deceased loved one,\u201d said Arnold, the Organize co-founder. \u201cThey\u2019re often desperately looking for a sign. Seeing \u2018I want to be an #organdonor\u2019 explicitly, in someone\u2019s own words, could be that sign.\u201dWhat\u2019s needed are more conversations among parents, spouses and children, so everyone can be fully informed and understand one another\u2019s convictions. \u201cThe beautiful thing about social media, especially Facebook, is that it\u2019s cross generational,\u201d says Arnold. \u201cWe target millennials in our marketing because they tend to be the earliest adopters of new technology, but we specifically feed them content to share with their parents.\u201dOf course, concerns arise from using social declarations to inform major decisions. Can identity be confirmed? Is a tweet a compelling indication of intent? In the end, families must decide these questions based on information available. Legally speaking, any \u201cstatement or symbol\u201d that indicates a donor\u2019s wish can serve as consent. \u201cThe law is written broadly enough that you could write it on a cocktail napkin,\u201d Greg Segal says.Since 2015, the Nevada Donor Network has been using Organize\u2019s registry experimentally, said Keith. \u201cIn 2015, we identified 10 additional matches that would have provided another 35 organs,\u201d he said. \u201cThat translates to an 11 percent increase over the 320 organs we transplanted that year. We\u2019re now at a point where if we get a match, we\u2019ll begin using the information in conversations.\u201dThrough Instagram, Arnold added, celebrities could share photos of transplant beneficiaries and reach millions of people in demographics that are largely untapped for organ donation education.\u201cThe game change of what Organize is doing \u2014 and I think it will save lives \u2014 is to build on the increasing acceptance of people making public declarations about their beliefs on a whole variety of things and applying that to their wishes about organ donation,\u201d said Sadler, who helped draft the original organ donation act. \u201cMost of us don\u2019t have these conversations. This could change the dynamic for grieving families \u2014 being able to acknowledge the wishes of their family member and find purpose in a tragedy.\u201dFor Rick Segal, as the recipient of a gift of life, there is a dimension to Organize\u2019s work that has brought an added measure of comfort. \u201cThere\u2019s something called survivor\u2019s guilt,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know that if you were given an organ, three other people didn\u2019t get it. You are walking around every day with the very thing that would have saved their lives \u2014 so you have this tremendous drive to prove that you are worthy. This phantom competition never leaves your mind. I feel that at least, by having what happened to me instill the vision and motivation in Greg and Jenna to take on this challenge, I\u2019m doing good in terms of payback.\u201dI\u2019ll continue to track Organize\u2019s work. And next week, I will report on efforts to increase living organ donation, an area of great potential.An earlier version of this article contained an erroneous spelling of the hashtag #donatemyparts.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Wet, Expensive Bike Ride: What\u2019s Not to Love?", "Date": "2016-05-05", "News": "Supported byI Was MisinformedI paid $341 to ride in the Five Boro Bike Tour, so though the forecast called for cold and rain, I had to do it to get my money\u2019s worth.What else could a sensible person do? Have a cozy Sunday indoors, with brunch or a movie, and kiss that $341 goodbye? When I have the opportunity to put on more foul-weather gear than Admiral Peary and risk collision with 32,000 other bikers?Sure, one could argue that this is the wrong way to look at it, that you are not getting the $341 back, no matter what, but that does not factor in the other investments I had made.I had sweated through countless spin classes at the Y.M.C.A., hanging around 15 extra minutes after each class so that there would be a better chance of someone calling 911 if I collapsed. I\u2019d paid $128 for new bicycle tires, which brought my Five Boro tab to $469. And of course, there was also that triumph-of-will thing: I wanted to put my finish photo on Facebook, where all endeavor, human and feline, is measured.No, just slow. The regular entry fee was $94 plus processing fees, but those slots sold out in 48 hours, leaving only the V.I.P. spots for $325 plus handling fees. I had seen the buff and jolly riders coming up Avenue of the Americas on glorious, blue-sky May days. So this year I thought: \u201cOh, hell, I can afford it. And they are throwing in a V.I.P. breakfast, which is sure to attract men who are not destitute; the investment banker-turned-sculptor demographic I so long to meet. And when these men see me in my hot, skintight bike clothing (I believe it has been two months since I mentioned I lost 26 pounds), my nights as a Jewish nun will be over.\u201dI wasn\u2019t worried about the actual course, which I had ridden before, until I realized I had ridden it 16 years ago, which meant, if you follow the medical literature on this stuff, that I was 16 years younger. Also, it turned out to be 40 miles, not 30 as I remembered. But I can do 25 or 30 miles easily, as long as they are flat miles, so I figured I could handle it. I borrowed some rain pants from a friend as well as a baggy jacket that she said had proved absolutely waterproof. (My beautifully cut bike jackets, selected from the Get Lucky line, are merely water-repellent.)The V.I.P. breakfast, near the starting line at Franklin Street and Avenue of the Americas in Lower Manhattan, seems to be bagels in bags, and I do not spot a single sculptor turned banker. (Later I am told by a spokesman for the event that I took a wrong turn and ended up in the volunteer area.) But we are all in luck with the weather. It doesn\u2019t start to drizzle until the sponsors finish talking.Off we go. I am at the front with the biking 1 percent, and it\u2019s great to be riding through Manhattan without fear of motorized vehicles. All you have to fear are the 32,000 other riders, but with this horrible forecast I am sure there are no more than 26,000.I\u2019m psyched. It is a bit embarrassing when a little person in her 30s passes me on her little bike, but I content myself with the thought that her legs are spinning so frantically that she will not possibly make it through Central Park, where they will find her crumpled body the next morning.Meanwhile, I\u2019m having a problem with my borrowed rain pants. They are so tight that they are affecting my breathing. This is creating something of a dilemma: Do I keep the pants on and remain dry and breathless, or take them off and get wet but oxygenated? I opt for the oxygen and peel the pants off at the Mile 18 Astoria Park rest stop.At Mile 32 I spot an exit ramp.The temptation to leave is strong. The N train, which can get me to my apartment in half an hour, is nearby. On the other hand, I am only eight miles from the finish. I know what I have to do.I am kind of sorry, though, that I didn\u2019t take a selfie in my hot bath and post it on Facebook. As a triumph-of-will kind of thing.An earlier version of this article mischaracterized the breakfast Joyce Wadler attended at the Five Boro Bike Tour. The takeout bags of bagels were provided for volunteers, not V.I.P.\u2019s, who were given a different meal at a different location.Advertisement"}

The growth near Ms. Alden\u2019s left ear was unrelated to that mishap, and was considered serious.At the time, Ms. Alden was a newlywed, having married a longtime beau the previous year. But while recovering from her surgery in September 2012 (the tumor proved to be benign), she found herself alone.By May 2013, her marriage ended, and her sunny demeanor, too, looked to be in danger. \u201cBut Jenny is able to roll with the punches,\u201d said Mr. Alden, who is the chief executive of Woodside Hotels, the family\u2019s business.So after a rough divorce, Ms. Alden recovered and started dating.She was scrolling around Facebook in early 2015 when a dark, good-looking man popped up in a list of \u201cpeople you may know.\u201d She didn\u2019t think she knew Kirk Spahn, but she wondered if she might want to.From his profile, she discovered that Mr. Spahn had attended Dartmouth, where Ms. Alden graduated. He had just moved to Los Angeles, so she messaged him: Did they know each other in college?Mr. Spahn, now 39, an accomplished tennis player who had competed for Dartmouth, had no problem recalling her \u2014 having harbored a mad crush. He had saved a photograph of her jumping into an icy New Hampshire pond in a leopard-print bikini.She had a college boyfriend and didn\u2019t have any idea that Mr. Spahn existed.\u201cYou look familiar,\u201d he messaged coolly, feeling anything but. They exchanged flirty texts over the next week, which led to a dinner date.Yet when Ms. Alden opened her front door, the gracious, easygoing Mr. Spahn, who counts internationally known businesspeople and world-class athletes among his intimate friends, froze entirely, his nerves a jumble.Ms. Alden, now working in client relations and digital strategy for Palo Alto Investors, a hedge fund focused on health care, was as beautiful \u2014 and effervescent \u2014 as he remembered.Over dinner, his freeze thawed \u2014 only too much so. Mr. Spahn gushed nonstop on life since college. He was a founder of a spirits company, TY KU Sake, along with the Institute for Civic Leadership, an educational nonprofit for youth, before starting ICL Academy in 2014, a high school focused on social impact and civic leadership for children in the performing arts.In fact, education was his family\u2019s business. His father, Stephen Spahn, is the chancellor of the Dwight School, a high school in New York City that also has international campuses.Ms. Alden, who could barely edge in a word, found Mr. Spahn\u2019s over-the-top enthusiasm about education and sports somewhat charming, but her divorce and a few years on the dating scene made her alert to red flags. Always direct, she asked if Mr. Spahn perhaps had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.He didn\u2019t, he simply buckled under pressure. At evening\u2019s end, when Ms. Alden gave him a perfunctory pat on the back, he was well aware he had blown it.Nevertheless, Mr. Spahn\u2019s competitive spirit was reignited along with his collegiate ardor. If Ms. Alden had seemed perfect for him at Dartmouth, she was more so now: sweet, smart and, in a city brimming with smoke and mirrors, without pretense. She was a city mouse who adored nature, an avid skier, and clearly \u2014 the A.D.H.D. comment \u2014 someone who did not lack candor.In matters of romance, they also had commonality. In 2013, he had ended a relationship with his fianc\u00e9e shortly before the wedding they\u2019d planned to have in the Caribbean. The breakup had been excruciating, but Mr. Spahn, who longed to start a family, felt that the marriage wouldn\u2019t have lasted.After the disastrous date with Ms. Alden, he was down but determined to fight his way back. A few days later, he showed up at a party she casually invited him to. To underscore her lack of romantic interest, Ms. Alden pointed out to Mr. Spahn the many single women in attendance.\u201cYou put me in the \u2018friend zone,\u2019 and I don\u2019t want to be in the \u2018friend zone,\u2019\u201d he told her. Then, with one hand on the nape of her neck, he kissed her. She, too, made a move out of character: She kissed him back.\u201cHis confidence excited me, and the kiss was perfect,\u201d said Ms. Alden, who recalled that the chemistry that was missing in their first encounter had \u201centirely combusted.\u201dThey talked until morning, but this time conversation was an easy volley, with Ms. Alden becoming captivated by Mr. Spahn\u2019s warm grin, kind manner, intelligence and passion, and quirky sense of humor. The next day, he boarded a plane, but he cut that trip short to return to Ms. Alden\u2019s side.\u201cWe\u2019re both silly but hard-working, and we love life passionately,\u201d Mr. Spahn said.Shiv Vasisht, a New Yorker and Mr. Spahn\u2019s best friend since high school, said, \u201cLike Kirk, Jenny has had a lot of opportunities in life but is amazingly grounded and generous.\u201d\u201cKirk is all action and loyalty,\u201d said Brandon Short, a former linebacker for the New York Giants, who cited Mr. Spahn as a pivotal player in his life. (After Mr. Short left professional football, Mr. Spahn coached him to go to business school, even helping with his application.)\u201cI know a lot of very inspiring people, but I\u2019ve never met anyone as inspiring as Jenny,\u201d Mr. Spahn said. \u201cShe makes the bar I\u2019ve set for myself even higher.\u201dOn May 7, the couple were married at Nestldown, a private estate in the Santa Cruz Mountains with acres of blooming gardens, California redwoods and koi-filled ponds. Two hundred guests, some who had flown in from as far as New Zealand, London, Madrid and Dubai, huddled under blankets beneath a threatening sky on the unseasonably chilly afternoon.The groom entered to the accompaniment of \u201cEye of the Tiger\u201d; \u201cIt\u2019s a classic, the one athletes listen to get pumped up,\u201d he said. Following him were a string of nine groomsmen including Mr. Short; Mr. Haas; Nirav Tolia, chief executive of Nextdoor.com; and a Saudi prince, whom the groom knows through his leadership work.The bride, in a sequined Ines Di Santo gown, walked delicately down a steep, slippery path to a lakeside clearing in the well-tended forest where Dr. Joon Yun, a radiologist who became a Universal Life minister for the event, for whom Ms. Alden works at Palo Alto Investors, waited to officiate. Dr. Yun thanked the couple for letting the guests \u201ccrash your wedding.\u201dIn his vows, the groom said, \u201cFrom the first glimpse of your smile, you were always with me even though you didn\u2019t know it,\u201d which evoked knowing laughter from the crowd. He thanked Facebook for the algorithm that brought them together. He said, \u201cTogether we will leave the world a better place.\u201dThe bride, in turn, called Mr. Spahn her \u201ctwin flame,\u201d and with characteristic optimism, said the obstacles that had kept them apart through the years were simply \u201csteppingstones\u201d to being together.The former tennis star Monica Seles, a friend of the groom, recited a blessing, urging the couple to offer each other \u201cshelter from the rain.\u201dSure enough, skies stayed bright through the evening, and despite the mud staining the hem of her dress, so did Ms. Alden\u2019s smile.Advertisement"}

But many in Mexico fear that the friendship would rupture should Mr. Trump win the election and follow through on his threats to undo the North American Free Trade Agreement, force Mexico to pay for the construction of a wall between the countries by interrupting remittances and deport the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States, about half of whom are Mexican.\u201cHis threat is cataclysmic, I think, for Mexico,\u201d Enrique Krauze, a Mexican historian and literary magazine editor, said in an interview. \u201cWhat it would mean for bilateral trade, in social terms, in the tearing of families, in the trauma, the collective panic, the opening of old wounds.\u201dHe added: \u201cI can use one of Trump\u2019s favorite words. Yes, this is huge. It\u2019s a huge danger.\u201dMexican officials, concerned about negative impressions of Mexico in the United States, have been rolling out a strategy to improve the image of their country and show how the relationship between the two nations has been of \u201cmutual benefit,\u201d said Paulo Carre\u00f1o, the newly appointed under secretary for North America in Mexico\u2019s Foreign Ministry.The strategy includes \u201ccultural diplomacy,\u201d grass-roots activism and the deployment of Mexican community and business leaders living in the United States, he said.As part of the strategy, the Pe\u00f1a Nieto administration shook up its diplomatic corps in the United States last month: The Mexican ambassador to Washington, Miguel Bas\u00e1\u00f1ez Ebergenyi, who had been in the job less than a year, was abruptly replaced by Carlos Sada Solana, a veteran diplomat. In addition, 26 consulates changed leadership.In addition, a few high-level government officials have reacted publicly to Mr. Trump, including Humberto Roque Villanueva, the Interior Ministry\u2019s under secretary for population, migration and migratory affairs. He told the newspaper El Universal this month that the Mexican government was analyzing \u201chow to confront what we would call the Trump emergency.\u201d\u201cI believe Mr. Trump speaks off the top of his head and doesn\u2019t have a clear idea about financial matters or international accords,\u201d he added. \u201cWe live in a globalized world. The United States would have to return to a kind of Middle Ages to prohibit remittances or charge tariffs that aren\u2019t charged in other parts of the world.\u201dIn general, however, the administration has mostly refrained from commenting on the candidate.That has frustrated many Mexicans, who have called on the government to come to the defense of Mexico and push back at Mr. Trump more forcefully.\u201cThey can package that in the traditional Mexican nonsense: We don\u2019t interfere in elections,\u201d said Jorge Casta\u00f1eda, a former foreign minister. \u201cThe real reason is that they have no idea what to do, so the default option is to do nothing.\u201dInstead, most of the Mexican agitation against Mr. Trump has come from the general public. At the beginning of his campaign, many Mexicans viewed Mr. Trump with a mixture of alarm and amusement. But the amusement has mostly fallen away.\u201cWhy should we worry?\u201d Mr. Krauze asked, rhetorically. \u201cI couldn\u2019t think of a reason not to worry, no?\u201d\u201cHis hate speech appeals to lower passions like xenophobia, machismo, political intolerance and religious dogmatism,\u201d the letter said.Explaining the American focus of this lobby, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to convince Mexicans how nasty Trump is, because everyone knows that. That\u2019s a done deal.\u201dMr. Fox\u2019s drumbeat of harangues against Mr. Trump began in February when he declared in a television interview, using a forceful expletive, that Mexicans would not build the candidate\u2019s proposed wall. He escalated from there, chiding Mr. Trump with language that sometimes devolved into schoolyard churlishness.He called the candidate \u201ca false prophet,\u201d \u201cdictator\u201d and \u201closer.\u201d He posted a selfie taken against the backdrop of a beach with this message: \u201cTrump, this beautiful Cancun. YOU ARE NOT WELCOME HERE.\u201d He posted photos from his wife\u2019s birthday party, taunting Mr. Trump: \u201cWhat do you know about love? Or you just know about hating. How sad!\u201dMr. Fox said in a telephone interview from his home in Guanajuato State that he was motivated to attack Mr. Trump by what he called \u201cpure love for that great nation, the United States.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t understand why the American public is buying this,\u201d he continued, pain in his voice. \u201cWe are partners, we are neighbors, and we should be friends. He\u2019s dividing not only American society, but he\u2019s dividing two nations.\u201cWhy does he pick on Mexico?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Political Bias at Facebook?", "Date": "2016-05-10", "News": "Supported byBitsIs Facebook two-faced?The social network claims it is in the business of connecting people and things, largely through powerful (and supposedly impartial) algorithms that focus on things like what other people are reading and talking about online, as well as a user\u2019s own interests.Gizmodo\u2019s story said a team of people assigned to post links and brief story descriptions to the Facebook \u201cTrending\u201d section suppressed stories about Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney and conservative gatherings, even though Facebook\u2019s computers flagged these as popular items. The site also said certain stories were inserted arbitrarily, and stories about Facebook itself were left off. These decisions appear to have been at the whim of managers and differed depending on who was in charge.It\u2019s not clear that there really is liberal bias inside Facebook. Mr. Herrman and Mr. Isaac report talking with other former employees on the \u201ctrending\u201d desk who said left-wing stories were also bounced, despite qualifying for a ranking.

{"Headline": "Lesbos, a Greek Refuge for the War Weary and Vacationers", "Date": "2016-05-24", "News": "Supported byPursuitsOn the island of Lesbos, the slow and rustic rhythms of Greek life rule. Sheep block traffic as they amble across mountain roads, bells clanking. At a seaside tavern, diners nibble on freshly caught calamari under the generous boughs of an old mulberry tree.This is a routine Sunday afternoon at Myrivilis\u2019 Mulberry tavern in Skala Sikaminias, a fishing village of about 100 residents on the northern tip of Lesbos, Greece\u2019s third-largest island. It\u2019s a sharp contrast from last autumn, when the restaurant\u2019s calamari fisherman was busy hauling sea-soaked asylum seekers to dry land, and waiters turned tables into makeshift hospital beds for shipwrecked survivors treated for hypothermia.Since last year, more than a million Middle Eastern migrants (mostly Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis) fleeing war and uncertain futures have risked their lives crossing the Aegean Sea from Turkey on flimsy boats to reach Greece. More than 1,100 people drowned on the way. Nearly 60 percent of migrants landed on Lesbos, thrusting a quiet vacation island into newspaper headlines.The people of Lesbos looked at the newcomers and saw themselves. Most locals are descendants of people who also braved the Aegean Sea, fleeing Turkey or forcibly displaced in the aftermath of World War I. The two brothers who run Myrivilis\u2019 Mulberry are the grandsons of a refugee. They and the majority of Lesbos\u2019 residents received the recent arrivals with almost bottomless generosity. \u201cEverybody asks why,\u201d said Lefteris Stylianou, a tavern owner. \u201cIt\u2019s normal. It\u2019s our mentality.\u201dIslanders call it philoxenia, Greek for \u201clove of the other,\u201d but it has come at a price: Summer tourism bookings are down about 70 percent. Potential tourists fear spending their vacation near refugee camps.They are making a mistake.Lesbos (locals pronounce it Lesvos) remains an enchanting getaway, attracting bird-watchers and orchid obsessives in spring and lesbians in September for the annual International Eressos Women\u2019s Festival at the birthplace of Sappho, the ancient poet who wrote about her love for women and inspired the term \u201clesbian.\u201dIn recent months, aid groups and thousands of international volunteers descended on Lesbos to feed and shelter the migrant arrivals, bringing a festival-like spirit to improvised camps \u2014 even importing food trucks and pagoda tents used in European festivals. \u201cWe saw the similarity between a refugee camp and a party event,\u201d said Adil Izemrane, a Dutch volunteer. \u201cPeople need to drink, people need to have food, people need to go to the toilet.\u201dPope Francis and celebrities like Angelina Jolie and Susan Sarandon also came to show their support. Yet new European Union steps to curb migration mean arrivals have plummeted to fewer than 100 a week, down from the thousands last fall, and many volunteers have packed up and moved to help the bulk of migrants marooned on mainland Greece. Now, even as the sun seekers have been scared away, many of the aid groups and volunteers who replaced them have moved on as well.Lesbos residents say this is a perfect time to visit. Vacationers should not feel as if they are being callous about a pleasure trip to a place still dealing with the migrant influx, residents say, because they would provide vital support to an economy doubly strained by a collapse in tourism and Greece\u2019s financial crisis. A tourist who knows where to look can find monuments to earlier dramas: the graveyard of discarded orange life jackets piled in a field, and a few small graveyards of migrants who drowned on the way.The roughly 4,000 migrants who remain on Lesbos are mostly detained in camps. There is still plenty to do to help. Travelers can volunteer in a large-scale effort to remove boat parts and life jackets from miles of beaches and sea floor, or help distribute food and clothing to migrants stuck on Lesbos. But most of the island remains tranquil, unaffected by the crisis.The two of us, American journalists reporting out of Jerusalem, wanted to meet the people fleeing wars on our doorstep. We felt a personal pull, too, as the descendants of Eastern European immigrants who crossed the sea for a better life in America. And we heard that the island\u2019s ouzo and sardines were among the world\u2019s best. We experienced both faces of Lesbos, an asylum seeker\u2019s portal and a sanctuary of slow Greek rhythms, and came away enriched.A 45-minute flight from Athens landed us in Mytilene, the capital of Lesbos, in late February. We rented a car and headed north for Molyvos, a picturesque town of stone homes and wisteria-covered alleyways that cascade down a hill under a Byzantine fortress, within sight of the Turkish coast. We ambled along the small harbor where octopus tentacles hang to dry before grilling, arriving at the seaside Captain\u2019s Table fish restaurant for dinner. Donations from tourists helped the restaurateur Melinda McRostie found the Starfish Foundation, one of the first grass-roots aid groups on the island. Volunteers unwind in the small dining room, where a bulletin board advertises yoga classes and sharing circles where volunteers can debrief one another about their experiences.The next morning, we joined a retired Canadian teacher, an Australian road tripper and other Starfish volunteers to greet about 50 Syrians and Iraqis in waterlogged shoes, brought ashore by the Hellenic Coast Guard. We distributed bottled water and dry socks, and activated an iPhone\u2019s Wi-Fi hot spot so Mahmoud Qadi, 21, could let his father in Syria know that he and his teenage brother had made it. Boat arrivals are rare now, so Starfish\u2019s international volunteers have been making about 1,000 sandwiches a day for migrants held at a closed facility in the village of Moria.Elsewhere in the Molyvos area, visitors can join the Dirty Girls of Lesvos Island, an islandwide laundry operation founded by an Australian tourist to wash and dry clothing and blankets for people in camps, or the Swedish group Lighthouse Relief, which is leading one of several efforts to clear the beaches of items migrants discarded on their arrival. A short walk from the Lighthouse home base is charming Skala Sikaminias, the village made famous by its fishermen\u2019s valiant rescues.We wound back to Mytilene, a bustling port city, to chop carrots and onions in a food truck that the Dutch group Movement on the Ground drives around Lesbos, serving hot curries at camps. Volunteers are still needed to cook and hand out food, said Mr. Izemrane, a founder of the group. Near Mytilene is the Kara Tepe camp, where the Humanitarian Support Agency seeks volunteers to distribute food, tea and supplies. Although hotel reservations have fallen in most of Lesbos, in Mytilene many budget hotels were filled with volunteers and aid workers.A short drive from Mytilene is Therma Spa Lesvos at the Gera Bay hot springs, one of the island\u2019s five natural thermal baths. We soaked in the quiet, stonewalled chambers, showered with a scented scrub and relaxed in an airy reception hall facing the bay. For five euros (about $5.50) each, it was a steal.We wanted to explore a quieter corner of Lesbos and gambled on Plomari on the southern coast. All we knew was that it is the source of some of Greece\u2019s best olive oil and aniseed-flavored ouzo. We called Myrta Kalampoka, who runs the organic Eirini Plomariou olive oil company with her husband, Nikos, to arrange a tour of their orchards. But when we pulled into the town square, she insisted we first meet them for a glass of ouzo at To Sokaki, a taverna on a narrow side street near the Aegean Sea.Take out your batteries, Ms. Kalampoka instructed, and get on Greek time. So we recharged her way, savoring the locally distilled Barbayanni ouzo alongside a steady march of mezze brought to our sun-drenched table: wild asparagus with eggs; smoked mackerel; and tiny fried red mullet, called barbounia, that we ate whole, head and all. The bill was 10 euros each.Slightly hazy, we climbed into the Kalampokas\u2019 pickup truck and drove to their hillside olive grove to taste their award-winning peppery oil. Ms. Kalampoka said marketing the oil as premium and organic kept their business afloat during Greece\u2019s financial crisis. We spent the evening watching the sun set over a pale blue chapel from the balcony of their simple guesthouse, the Irini Plomari Apartments, perched over a secluded part of the Plomari shore (40 euros).Our lazy getaway ended abruptly the next morning in a forest clearing where Sigrid van der Zee of Pandora Travel Lesvos urged us into her red Jeep for a boisterous ride through muddy mountain roads, beeping for fun as we splashed through puddles. She is a Greek-speaking veteran transplant to the island with a shock of cropped blond hair revealing her Dutch roots, and she wants visitors to experience Lesbos as an adventure, not a crisis. \u201cNo one will come for holidays just because they pity us,\u201d she said.Our first stop was the Myrsiniotissis Convent, built in 1523 and still home to a few elderly nuns. We hiked the hills, following in the footsteps of medieval monks along a weathered stone path lined with wildflowers, to reach the Limonos Monastery, the largest on Lesbos. We explored its tiny rooms where monks once lived and prayed, most notably St. Ignatius, who founded it in the 16th century and is a venerated figure on the island.Leaving the trail, we descended to verdant farmlands along the Gulf of Kalloni and stopped to photograph a flamboyance of pale flamingoes in seaside marshes. In the evening we pulled into Toumba Eco Farm, a cluster of comfortable stone cottages on a mountain overlooking the sea. Horses roamed near the reception lodge. Margarita Niziskioti, the innkeeper, poured us red wine next to a wood-burning stove before we burrowed under down comforters in our cabin for a deep night\u2019s sleep.We left the island just before Europe began to close its doors to migrants in March. The volunteer universe that sprang up on Lesbos has thinned out and largely moved with most of the migrants to mainland Greece. What remains is the warmth, the kind welcome that the locals of Lesbos extended to Middle Eastern strangers \u2014 and to us.Take Tony Petrou, a 75-year-old guesthouse owner. We met him at the Sarandos restaurant in Anaxos, a coastal village 20 minutes southwest of Molyvos. He was nursing a small bottle of Macedonian wine across from our table, and he ordered one for us. We struck up a conversation.Mr. Petrou said he was recovering from surgery at a Lesbos hospital when a Syrian in his 20s stumbled into his room, shivering after a four-hour swim from Turkey. So he gave the young man his jeans and sweater, several sizes too big. \u201cI wanted him to have something warm,\u201d he said. Then Mr. Petrou called his sister: Could she bring him some pants?Mr. Petrou shrugged off his act of kindness. But now that he faces a summer of reduced bookings, it is he who is looking for a lifeline: renewed tourism.\u201cWe need the help,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the island deserves it.\u201dAid groups ask volunteers to contact them in advance to see how they can help, and caution against \u201cvoluntourists\u201d arriving to take selfies rather than helping.These volunteer groups update their activities online and on Facebook:Daniella Cheslow and Daniel Estrin are American journalists covering the Middle East.

The bill, which is expected to win passage on the Senate floor on Thursday, represents an important first step in the effort by the Senate Republican majority to complete as many of the 12 regular appropriations bills as possible this year. The energy and water measure, however, had hit a major snag in recent days because of a dispute over an amendment put forward by Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, seeking to bar the United States from buying heavy water, which is used in producing nuclear energy and nuclear weapons, from Iran.The White House had threatened to veto the bill if the amendment was approved, and Senate Democrats said Mr. Cotton\u2019s proposal would undermine President Obama\u2019s agreement with Iran to limit that country\u2019s nuclear program. The dispute was ultimately resolved on Wednesday with Mr. Cotton\u2019s amendment failing on a procedural vote.Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, who is managing the floor debate on the bill, had urged a no vote on Mr. Cotton\u2019s amendment to avoid sinking the overall legislation. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it belongs on the bill,\u201d Mr. Alexander said. \u201cI think it ought to be considered first by the Foreign Relations Committee, Armed Services and Intelligence Committees because it\u2019s filled with national security implications.\u201d \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Social Media Finds New Role as News and Entertainment Curator", "Date": "2016-05-15", "News": "Supported byBy the end of last week, Mark Zuckerberg said that Facebook would conduct \u201ca full investigation\u201d into accusations that editors at the company prevented news stories from conservative outlets from appearing in a section of the social network\u2019s service.But the statement, issued after a weeklong crush of attention about the accusation, leapfrogged a perhaps more obvious question \u2014 one that Facebook\u2019s 1.65 billion monthly users around the world may not have considered.Facebook has editors?It does, and it isn\u2019t alone. Most major social media platforms have, in recent years, amassed editorial teams of their own, groups that select, tame and fill gaps in the material produced by users and media companies.The teams are often tiny compared with the rest of their sprawling organizations. But most of these employees \u2014 whether they are called curators, reporters, editors or something else \u2014 make editorial choices that reach huge audiences. How and why these decisions are made are generating new questions for the companies, and their users, to grapple with.\u201cMainstream news organizations have endured a skeptical public for decades,\u201d said Kjerstin Thorson, a professor at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism at the University of Southern California.Now, she says, social media companies may face similar, and perhaps jarring, scrutiny.Facebook declined to say how many people have editorial roles, as did Instagram, which Facebook owns. But several other companies provided some details about their operations that suggest the scope and variety of their editorial ambitions.Snapchat said it has around 75 people who produce content, collecting and annotating videos and photos of live events and sometimes adding on-the-scene reporting themselves. Twitter employs just under a dozen people in the United States and around two dozen worldwide to collect and describe postings about notable topics.Vine, the video service owned by Twitter, employs five to 10 people to highlight videos and producers that might have been overlooked by the audience, or that the company simply wants more people to see.\u201cWhere curation picks up,\u201d said Ankur Thakkar, the editorial lead of Vine, \u201cis that you need human eyes and ears to pick up on a cultural trend that a machine might not see.\u201dIn some cases, these teams coexist with media professionals working elsewhere on the platform. Peter Hamby, a former CNN political reporter, oversees a team of six journalists within Snapchat, while media companies \u2014 including CNN \u2014 produce content for the company\u2019s Discover feature.The novelty of these arrangements can obscure their straightforward influence. Such companies, with hundreds of millions of users, attract enormous amounts of human attention. People whose Snapchat videos are featured in a curated live event say they have had millions of views. A performer featured by Vine can expect a surge of new followers; a trend or meme given the same treatment can garner thousands of new responses from users.Facebook\u2019s Trending Topics, the feature that drew all the attention last week, is relegated to a small box in desktop browsers and users\u2019 search page on mobile devices. But the positioning provides confirmation, in the language of Facebook\u2019s own guidelines, \u201cthat the topic is tied to a current news event in the real world.\u201dThe report accusing suppression of news stories within Facebook\u2019s Trending Topics was published by the website Gizmodo last Monday, prompting a denial by Facebook followed by the release of its 28-page set of internal editorial guidelines. Facebook said on Thursday that its editorial guidelines \u201cdo not permit the suppression of political perspectives.\u201dFor the companies, adding additional curated or original editorial content has an obvious appeal, helping them extract more value from people already using the platform, as well as potentially attracting new ones. \u201cEach of these companies has to give people that aren\u2019t coming there a reason to come there \u2014 new users, or infrequent users,\u201d said Michael Pachter, an analyst for Wedbush Securities.But, Mr. Pachter said, the presence of editorial operations risks emphasizing just how significant the companies have become as gatekeepers for news and entertainment.\u201cTo edit it, and write it, and create it, and curate it, it\u2019s a big responsibility,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they realize what they\u2019re getting into.\u201dMany of these interrogations ended up in the same thorny thicket: Who designed the system this way, and why?

That has made privacy law a lucrative new area for class-action lawyers who can extract multimillion-dollar settlements just by bringing a case.Nevertheless, questions of how much tech companies should be allowed to do without notifying their users will multiply, especially as people adopt more live video and voice technologies that have already made it possible for tech companies to identify people who might not even use their services.\u201cIt\u2019s basically a company creating the ability to capture someone\u2019s identity when they might not want to reveal their identity,\u201d Mr. Rotenberg said.The Biometric Information Privacy Act was passed in Illinois in 2008 and has quickly become the bane of social media companies.

I would say, to anyone who believes that Gawker is just the gutter press, that those values are worth something even in the gutter.The distaste Gawker provokes is largely a result of the world it inhabits and reflects.

I will say this: No one could possibly object if that were the tape of a congressman. But even a pathetic D-lister like Hulk Hogan has more power to shape the world today than most congressmen. The world we live in has made a presidential nominee out of a reality television star. This is the world that Gawker predicted and took up arms against.But we are all living in a world in which the quality of sentences in a book matters less than the collar of the shirt you\u2019re wearing on the back cover.

The message was not made public, so as not to repeat the alleged insult, as is typical in such cases. The sender of the message, Burin Intin, 28, was arrested last month.Col. Olarn Sukkasem, the chief of the police\u2019s Technology Crime Suppression Division, told reporters that the authorities had enough evidence to show that the pair had \u201ccarried out things together.\u201d He did not provide specifics, saying the investigation was continuing.Human Rights Watch said Saturday that the military junta in Thailand had \u201carbitrarily and aggressively\u201d used the l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 laws to prosecute people for any speech deemed critical of the monarchy.Since the coup two years ago, the authorities have brought 57 cases under the law, 44 of them involving online commentary, the rights group said.At a news conference on Saturday, Colonel Olarn advised the public to exercise caution when communicating online.\u201cIf you share this offending information, you must take responsibility for your act, as well,\u201d he said.

Publishing false information can be considered an offense.\u201dMs. Patnaree was denied bail because the severity of her potential sentence made her a flight risk, Ms. Poonsuk said. Ms. Patnaree\u2019s son, Sirawith Seritiwat, a leading student activist, is out on bail on charges that he took part in a banned protest.At a protest outside a Bangkok police station on Saturday evening, Mr. Sirawith told his mother\u2019s supporters and the news media that the police had gone after her to get to him.\u201cShe\u2019s never expressed anything politically,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s never argued or debated with anyone.\u201dHe added: \u201cThe junta is using my mother as a hostage.

But he went on to say that law-enforcement officers cannot \u201cobtain an order that constrains the freedom of service providers to disclose information to their customers without making a particularized showing of need.\u201dA handful of cases have emerged in recent months laying bare the tensions between the government\u2019s desire to conduct criminal inquiries, sometimes secretly, and the rights of companies like Facebook to have autonomy over their businesses.In the case of Facebook, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn sought to cloak the existence of the subpoenas under the Stored Communications Act, which grants courts the power to prohibit tech companies from revealing the receipt of various government orders, like warrants or subpoenas, in order to protect the covert nature of criminal probes.Judge Orenstein wrote that the prosecutors had submitted 15 separate sealed requests to him, each bearing the title: \u201cApplication for order commanding [service provider] not to notify any person of the existence of subpoena.\u201dThe requests, all filed in Brooklyn, asked for permission to bar Facebook from mentioning the subpoenas to anyone except its lawyers out of a fear that the targets of the secret investigations might get wind of them and either flee or tamper with evidence.Judge Orenstein\u2019s ruling did not reveal the information the government wanted from Facebook. It also left open the possibility that he would agree to impose gag orders on Facebook if the prosecutors could convince him with more details.Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the ruling.The policy states that as Facebook receives requests from the police or other agencies, it vets them to establish whether they are within the bounds of the law and how compelling they are.

With their third child, they posted a photo on Facebook.To date, the video has garnered nearly 1.8 million views.Consider the modern couple who have just learned they\u2019re having a baby. How should they inform their friends and family? Write a note? So 1950s. Place a call? So 1970s. Send a mass email? So 1990s.These days, when couples want to let their loved ones know they\u2019re having a child, they often whip out their cellphones, shoot a video and post it on social media. Couples are putting their babies\u2019 names in lights even before their babies have names.Pregnancy announcement videos have become so popular they\u2019re becoming businesses all their own, with YouTube compilations, Pinterest pages and morning television segments.Given this exploding form, a little deconstruction may be helpful. Herewith a guide to five popular styles.By far the most common form of announcement videos involves startling unsuspecting future grandparents. Wannabe grannies, it seems, have a tendency to scream, shout, jiggle and whoop.Daniel Woods is a wedding videographer in Johnstown, Ohio. When his wife, Ciera, got pregnant, he asked unwitting family members to sit for an interview.\u201cI used various excuses,\u201d Mr. Woods said. \u201cI told Ciera\u2019s parents it was an anniversary video. I told my parents I needed to do a color correction.\u201dWith the camera rolling, Mr. Woods stepped forward with his clapper and announced, \u201cCiera\u2019s pregnant. Take one.\u201d He gave his in-laws a sign that read \u201cGrandparents Starting in April 2016.\u201dMr. Woods said, \u201cWe wanted there to be something our kid could look at and say, \u2018This is how everyone reacted.\u2019\u201dThe plot, \u201cbased on a true story,\u201d opens with a kissing couple in front of their home in California. But soon poltergeists invade, the cats starting freaking out and doors automatically open and close. A voice-over from Ms. Holt intones, \u201cI can feel it growing inside of me.\u201dMr. Murray, who shoots videos for the Assembly of God church where he works, warned that while music videos are catchy, they also present a particular challenge.\u201cI see all these parodies that just don\u2019t sound good,\u201d he said. In \u201cWe\u2019re Having One More Baby,\u201d he and his wife recorded the lyrics on a studio mike, then lip-synced during the shoot.\u201cAt that point it was just matching up the audio,\u201d he said.Caryn and Bryan Canatella of Austin, Tex., went even further. Mr. Canatella volunteered to scan his mother-in-law\u2019s old family photographs for Christmas.The couple then gathered her extended family, still dressed in holiday pajamas, to screen the compilation. Unbeknown to all, the video ended with a tease, \u201cAnd then there\u2019s more,\u201d followed by the audio of a heartbeat and a picture of Ms. Canatella\u2019s sonogram.The video has been viewed three-quarters of a million times on YouTube.Not all pregnancy announcement videos focus on the happy moment of revelation. The current vogue extends all the way to the moment of discovery. An entire subspecies involves filming the pregnancy test \u2014 or at least the reading of the test.Her \u201cnatural intercourse cycle\u201d has not worked, she says holding the pregnancy test tube. Then she breaks down in tears. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but all of a sudden out of nowhere I\u2019m getting very emotional,\u201d she says.For the next four minutes the couple weeps, hugs and shares the moment with their 54,000 viewers.So what\u2019s going on here? Why this sudden interest in pregnancy announcements?In many ways, it\u2019s not that complicated. For as long as humans have shared stories, those stories have focused on moments of beginnings and endings \u2014 births, deaths, marriages, graduations.What\u2019s new is that we have the means of documentation in our pockets at all times and the means of distribution at our fingertips just as quickly. The only innovation in pregnancy announcement videos is the video part.The shooter, Dana Griffin-Graves, is holding the camera, while her husband, Arkell Graves, is preparing dinner. \u201cThere\u2019s something in the oven, too,\u201d she says.He opens the door to find a bag of buns and two images of a sonogram.He quickly pivots and stares at the camera, hopeful. \u201cYou\u2019re pregnant? You\u2019re pregnant. You\u2019re pregnant!\u201d\u201cNineteen weeks. Almost five months. It\u2019s a boy.\u201dThe man covers his face with his shirt and sobs like the baby he soon will have.When their son, Kaleb Arkell Graves, was later born prematurely, at 24 weeks, the couple chronicled the experience on social media.In the booming world of everyday cinema, \u201cBuns in the Oven\u201d just may be the first blockbuster.Bruce Feiler\u2019s new book, \u201cThe First Love Story: Adam, Eve, and Us,\u201d will be published next year.

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "Thailand is among the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most dangerous countries in which to oppose powerful interests that profit from coal plants, toxic waste dumping, land grabs or illegal logging. Some 60 people who spoke out on these issues have been killed over the past 20 years, although few perpetrators have been prosecuted in a culture in which powerful people have the last word and professional killers are easy to find.A 2014 report by the environmental watchdog group Global Witness ranked Thailand as the eighth most dangerous country in which to defend land and environmental rights. It is the second most dangerous country in Asia, after the Philippines.The killings often involve small-scale conflicts in remote areas, and issues that might seem too narrow to carry assassination as a penalty. Few of them have received national coverage, and few of the names of those killed are widely known.\u201cIt is vital, for the victims and the families, that their fight and their death should not be forgotten and left unrecognized,\u201d Mr. Duggleby said in a statement accompanying his portfolio.The question was how to present them. The victims were dead, or in a few cases had been abducted and disappeared. The only records in some cases were in the memories of families and in the portraits they kept of their relatives, sometimes in a frame on the wall, sometimes at a Buddhist altar.It was these photographs that inspired the concept of his project: to place and photograph a portrait of the victim at the site of the murder or abduction. The result is a surprisingly moving set of photographs, mostly expressionless faces in formal photographs looking out from a field, a forest or rubber plantation or a roadside. In one case, the family had only an identification card picture, so Mr. Duggleby photographed and printed it to place at the scene.The silent portraits, looking small and vulnerable in their settings, seem like tiny, passive missives from the victims, looking back at the viewer from the scene of their last terrifying moments. In this way, in a very different context and with a very different aesthetic, they share a hollow resonance with the well-known black-and-white portraits of the dead that cover the walls of Tuol Sleng in Cambodia, the former prison where thousands of people were photographed before being tortured and killed.Tallying the disparate, barely reported killings in Thailand has been difficult, and the first comprehensive list has only recently been compiled by Protection International, a human rights nongovernmental organization. One of its members, Pranom Somwong, worked with Mr. Duggleby in researching many of the cases.For more than a year, Mr. Duggleby, who speaks fluent Thai, traveled with a Thai assistant throughout the country, covering by his calculation 10,000 kilometers, or more than 6,000 miles. He said he took great care not to endanger people or to make a situation worse.Some of the disputes and threats remained real; in some cases other people had stepped forward to continue the resistance. One victim, for example, Chai Boonthonglek, 61, who was shot dead on Feb. 11, 2015, was the fourth member of his community to be murdered in five years during a dispute over land rights with a palm-oil company.\u201cThe most important thing was the safety of the villagers,\u201d Mr. Duggleby said. \u201cWe made our presence very quiet and very quick. I\u2019d talk to them, spend a few hours with them, finish and drive on to the next place.\u201dThey were, in general, well received, and were guided to the place of the killing. In some cases, he said, it was too dangerous or sensitive to meet the family, so they simply talked by telephone, determined the site of the killing, and with the family\u2019s permission took an image from the Internet.In a country that, particularly in rural areas, is governed less by the rule of law than by impunity, the killers and the powerful forces behind them usually walk free. \u201cIn more than one case the assassin still lives in the village,\u201d Mr. Duggleby said. \u201cThey see them in the marketplace. They say hello in the morning. They know exactly who they are.\u201dIn traditional Thailand, a hierarchy of power and position generally binds society. People know their place and offer due deference.\u201cFor simple farmers to rise up against powerful people is really quite amazing, and daring,\u201d Mr. Duggleby said. \u201cWhat it comes down to is, it\u2019s their village. There\u2019s a real sense of home, and where they were born and live is very important; for most people that\u2019s all they have.\u201d"}

On the one hand the companies are playing nice, and on the other they\u2019re playing hardball. Why are they so dead set against fingerprinting?

My read, again: Uber just settled the giant class-action lawsuit that threatened to derail the company\u2019s entire business model. It is trying to put as many labor-issue headaches as it can behind itself, any way it can.As part of that settlement, the company agreed to a number of concessions, including a more direct line into listening to drivers and giving them certain things as part of recognizing these quasi unions. Discounts on legal aid, insurance, what have you.What drivers don\u2019t have is the real reason people want to join unions: collective bargaining abilities. Uber and the guild have said that there\u2019s nothing being left off the table for discussion. But I find it incredibly hard to believe Uber would ever, ever let drivers negotiate their pay if the company is not forced to do so.So what does Uber do? Start listening to drivers, which really, is something that any company with a sense of decency or compassion for its workers would have done from the outset. (Lyft, according to many drivers I speak to, has a much better reputation in this arena.) That will probably take some heat off Uber\u2019s back, and the unionization issue will be much less pressing. For now, at least.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Ghostbusters\u2019 Steps Right Into the Hostility of Gender Politics", "Date": "2016-05-23", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Sony Pictures needs to keep male moviegoers interested in its \u201cGhostbusters\u201d reboot after an Internet attack on its female cast. Hillary Clinton wants women to throw their support behind her presidential campaign.In a strange confluence, those agendas risk colliding this week on \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show.\u201dMs. DeGeneres is scheduled to tape Mrs. Clinton and the \u201cGhostbusters\u201d cast separately. That may help to minimize any alignment between film and her campaign, though Ms. DeGeneres\u2019s enthusiasm for both has already been obvious.But the not-quite-joint appearance came as less-than-welcome news to Sony, whose marketing team has been fighting to tamp down what it sees as a misogynistic, Internet-based assault on the movie. The first trailer for the new film, released in early March, became the most disliked trailer in YouTube history after a coordinated campaign by a group of mostly male naysayers.Amy Pascal, a producer of \u201cGhostbusters,\u201d declined to discuss the \u201cEllen\u201d booking or its potential perils for the film. Warner Bros., which produces \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show,\u201d said no one involved with the show would comment.In a statement, Tom Rothman, chairman of the Sony motion pictures group, made light of the film\u2019s brush with politics. \u201cAll this attention is great, but I hope they realize that Slimer is not a registered voter,\u201d Mr. Rothman said of those with an eye on the \u201cEllen\u201d appearance.Multiple people involved with the film, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of confidentiality strictures, said that Sony secured the \u201cEllen\u201d booking two months ago, and that the studio was thrilled with the chance to promote \u201cGhostbusters\u201d in such a positive, prominent setting. The date for the appearance was mandated by the schedules of two of the actresses, Ms. Jones and Ms. McKinnon, who portrays Mrs. Clinton as a humorous ball of unbridled ambition on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d which concluded its season over the weekend. Ms. McKinnon portrayed Mrs. Clinton on that episode, and the two appeared in a sketch together last year.Sony has traced hostility toward \u201cGhostbusters\u201d to a small number of fan sites that embedded the YouTube trailer. The studio found that a parallel trailer release on Facebook was overwhelmingly positive, and actually was seen by more men than women, according to people briefed on the film.Mrs. Clinton has leaned heavily on \u201cEllen\u201d to help humanize herself beyond policy speeches and personal attacks leveled on cable news. Tuesday\u2019s sit-down is the third time this cycle Mrs. Clinton will appear with Ms. DeGeneres. The appearance coincides with a new ABC News-Washington Post poll showing 53 percent of voters have an unfavorable opinion of Mrs. Clinton, compared to 60 percent who said the same about Mr. Trump.But in helping Mrs. Clinton reach women, the hit daytime show has inadvertently gotten in the way of Sony\u2019s efforts to hold young males, a vital component of the audience for all but a handful of summer blockbusters (like, for instance, \u201cSex and the City,\u201d in 2008).Sony has circulated online posters for \u201cGhostbusters\u201d with looks that are more provocative than the janitorlike outfits displayed on one the film\u2019s early promotional images. One set of dark, moody posters shows a shadowy Ms. Wiig in a profile reminiscent of the noir advertisements for the graphic novel-based movie, \u201cSin City.\u201dEven while swatting at armchair critics who dislike the notion of a female \u201cGhostbusters,\u201d Sony and its filmmaking team have been weathering accusations of racial bias. Those have come from commentators who note that the three white female \u201cGhostbusters\u201d are scientists or professionals, while the black partner, portrayed by Ms. Jones, is a transit worker.\u201cWhy can\u2019t a regular person be a ghostbuster?\u201d Ms. Jones responded on Twitter.Amy Chozick contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

Ms. Bruner called the Boy Scouts \u201ca homosexual organization\u201d and declared that because of her conservative views, Mr. Obama \u201chas had me investigated.\u201d She encouraged parents to home-school their children because that was \u201cthe only way you can be in control of what they are taught,\u201d and claimed that school shootings across the country had begun \u201cafter the schools started teaching evolution.\u201dOn Tuesday, Ms. Bruner was defeated by a wide margin by Keven M.

It was the first time the group had taken such an action, and many cited it as one reason Ms. Bruner lost the runoff.The executive director of Grassroots America \u2014 We the People, JoAnn Fleming, said in a statement that the endorsement had been withdrawn because of inaccurate oral and written statements that Ms. Bruner made at a meeting with superintendents on May 4.Ms. Bruner said nearly 50 percent of public school students were enrolled in special education programs and claimed that Texas would soon have a shortage of qualified teachers, citing a shortage of 91 teachers in one district.

{"Headline": "Donald Trump Releases List of Possible Supreme Court Picks", "Date": "2016-05-18", "News": "Supported byDonald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, released a list of potential Supreme Court nominees on Wednesday as part of an effort to quell concerns that he would not select conservative jurists.The unusual move comes as Mr. Trump is looking to unify the Republican Party behind him and win over critics who remain skeptical about his candidacy. While some Republicans who oppose Mr. Trump have considered supporting Hillary Clinton or sitting out the election, he has regularly reminded them that the future of the Supreme Court is at stake.Mr. Trump\u2019s selections consisted of six federal appeals court judges appointed by President George W. Bush and five state supreme court justices appointed by Republican governors. All are white, and eight of the 11 are men.They include several judges who are favorites of conservative legal scholars, like Dianne S. Sykes, a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit who was appointed by President Bush and had been mentioned as a potential Supreme Court nominee in his second term. Mr. Trump has said that he would consider her for a Supreme Court appointment.Several of the jurists previously clerked for conservative Supreme Court justices after law school. The federal appeals court judges on the list included Steven M. Colloton of the Eighth Circuit, a former clerk to Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, and Raymond M. Kethledge of the Sixth Circuit, who clerked for Justice Anthony M. Kennedy.The state supreme court justices included Joan Larsen of Michigan, a former clerk to Justice Scalia, and also Allison H. Eid of Colorado, David Stras of Minnesota and Thomas Rex Lee of Utah, all three of whom clerked for Justice Clarence Thomas. In addition, Judge Lee\u2019s father, Rex, served as solicitor general in the Reagan administration, and his brother, Mike Lee, is a Republican senator from Utah.They also included William H. Pryor Jr. of the 11th Circuit, whose appointment Senate Democrats had tried to block in part because, in his previous role as Alabama attorney general, he denounced Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that established a constitutional right to abortion, as having manufactured \u201ca constitutional right to murder an unborn child.\u201dThe next president could end up having to fill several Supreme Court vacancies, including the one left open by Justice Scalia\u2019s death. Mr. Trump has urged the Senate to delay voting on President Obama\u2019s nominee to fill that vacancy, Judge Merrick B. Garland, in hopes that he will have the opportunity to fill the opening.The initial reaction to the choices was mixed.Nan Aron, the president of the liberal Alliance for Justice Action Council, deplored Mr. Trump\u2019s choice of potential justices as \u201cdangerous,\u201d noting that her group had opposed several of the Bush appointees. Her group had not researched some of the state judges yet, she said.\u201cThe list includes some of the most extreme conservatives on the federal bench today,\u201d she said. \u201cTheir opinions demonstrate open hostility to Americans\u2019 rights and liberties, including reproductive justice and environmental, consumer and worker protections. They have ruled consistently in favor of the powerful over everyone else. They would move the needle even further to the right on the Supreme Court.\u201dEd Whelan, a former clerk to Justice Scalia and a conservative legal commentator, praised several of the names on the list but reserved judgment about whether conservatives should trust Mr. Trump to follow through on what he says he will do.\u201cIt\u2019s a good list of some of the outstanding judges who give ample sign of being faithful to the Constitution,\u201d Mr. Whelan said. \u201cWhether a President Trump could actually be counted on to pick folks like this is a different question.\u201dSome of Mr. Trump\u2019s most vocal conservative critics remained doubtful despite the credentials of the judges on the list. Erick Erickson, the conservative blogger who has been working to derail his campaign, insisted that Mr. Trump still could not be trusted with the court.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated what court Diane Sykes currently serves on; she is a federal appeals court judge, not a Wisconsin Supreme Court justice.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How I Learned to Love Snapchat", "Date": "2016-05-18", "News": "Supported byOn TechnologyIn the mid-\u201980s, a German engineer named Friedhelm Hillebrand helped devise a way for cellphones to send and receive text messages. Back then, mobile bandwidth was extremely limited, which meant that the messages needed to be as lightweight as possible. The story goes that Hillebrand experimented with a variety of greetings and phrases and concluded, in very German fashion, that most things that needed saying could be done so in an economical 160 characters or fewer. \u201cThis is perfectly sufficient,\u201d he said of his findings. Eventually the infrastructure improved so that there were no limits to how much text we could transmit at once. And by 2007, texting had surpassed voice calls as the preferred, if not default, mode of communication.As most rapid advances in technol\u00adogy tend to do, this transition inspired a low-grade, intergenerational moral panic. Many feared that we would become asocial creatures, misanthropes who would rather hide behind the safety of a screen than face the intimacy of a spoken conversation. And maybe there\u2019s some truth in that, but there\u2019s another way of looking at it. Maybe we didn\u2019t hate talking \u2014 just the way older phone technologies forced us to talk. Texting freed a generation from the strictures and inconvenience (and awkwardness) of phone calls, while allowing people to be more loosely and constantly connected.I thought about this shift recently when trying to make sense of the rise of Snapchat, the latest wellspring of techno\u00adsocial hand-wringing. Like texting, Snapchat flourished amid scarcity, though of an entirely different kind. We no longer live in Hillebrand\u2019s era, when there were hard limits on how much we could say over text; but words alone can be an imperfect technology. So much of what we mean lies not just in what we say, or in the exact words we choose, but also in the light that animates our eyes (or doesn\u2019t) when we de\u00ad\u00adliver them and the sharpness (or softness) of the tone we use. Text barely captures even a fraction of that emotional depth and texture, even when we can type as much as we want. Snapchat is just the latest and most well realized example of the various ways we are regaining the layers of meaning we lost when we began digitizing so many important interactions.Most efforts to approximate normal human behavior in software tend to be creepy or annoying. The oblong gray bubble that pops up when your conversation partner is typing (officially called the \u201ctyping awareness indicator\u201d) is no doubt intended to be helpful, the virtual version of watching someone inhale and then part their lips to speak. But it becomes panic-inducing if it appears and then disappears \u2014 an indication that someone wrote something, then, for any number of reasons, deleted it. Similarly, \u201cread\u201d receipts, designed to let you know that someone opened and read your message, are perhaps best at letting you know when you\u2019re being ignored. In a strange turn of events, texting has evolved to become almost as awkward as the phone calls it made obsolete.This is not to say that text is irredeemable. A significant humanization of our text interactions happened quietly in 2011, when emoji were introduced as part of an Apple iOS software update. They offered a palette of punctuation that clari\u00adfied intent. Tacking on emoji like hearts, skulls, grins and bugged-out eyes to a short message made it infinitely easier to confidently project sarcasm, humor, grief and love across a medium that had been, until then, emotionally arid. If you want proof that we see ourselves in the emoji we use, consider the ever-present disputes over emoji inclusivity: Initially, the characters all had the same skin tone, and even now, the only \u201cprofessional\u201d emoji are male. And though the catalog of emoji has expanded in response to user demand, it still struggles to keep up with the multiplicity of human experiences. As a result, a new bespoke-emoji economy has begun to emerge, in apps like Bitmoji, which let people create personalized avatars to adorn their text messages. If our emoji couldn\u2019t become us, we would become our emoji.But messages that include little actual messaging seem to be the wave of the future, and Snapchat is leading the way. The app, which allows users to send short videos and images that disappear after a short period of time, is intimate by design, something that sets it apart from its social-media peers. Most of the \u201csnaps\u201d I send and receive are tightly framed, with angles that could be considered unflattering. They\u2019re low resolution too, the images speckled with grain. Snapchat does have filters, but the dumb ones are the most fun, especially the ones that add a comically hideous effect \u2014 bloating your face into a red tomato, or distorting it into an animal mask.If we are to believe the theories about how people want to communicate nowadays \u2014 largely through anesthetized, hypermediated and impersonal ex\u00ad\u00adchanges \u2014 Snapchat\u2019s recent surge in popularity makes little sense. During the first few years of Snapchat\u2019s existence, the only people I knew using the service (beyond journalists like me who were trying to understand it) were my youngest relatives, still in high school and college. And of course there was the attendant moral panic: When it first blew up around 2012, the press seemed to assume it would primarily be used by horny teenagers swapping nudes.If that was ever the case, it has since expanded. Each time I check the app, I\u2019m surprised to see who else in my network has started using the service. My circle includes every demographic, age and locale: co-workers who send snaps of their dogs, friends on strange adventures in the desert, people I talk to mostly online sending videos from their travels. The videos are rarely elaborate: just a few seconds of my favorite people\u2019s faces on a large screen, smiling, or singing, or showing off their view, before they fade and disappear.Its entire aesthetic flies in the face of how most people behave on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter \u2014 as if we\u2019re waiting to be plucked from obscurity by a talent agent or model scout. But Snapchat isn\u2019t the place where you go to be pretty. It\u2019s the place where you go to be yourself, and that is made easy thanks to the app\u2019s inbuilt ephemerality. Away from the fave-based economies of mainstream social media, there\u2019s less pressure to be dolled up, or funny. For all the advances in tech that let us try on various guises to play around with who we are, it seems that we just want new ways to be ourselves. As it turns out, the mundanity of our regular lives is the most captivating thing we could share with one another.Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}

Butera, the executive director and chief executive of the association, created a firestorm after it circulated online. The association placed him on administrative leave on Tuesday while it investigated the allegations, and announced on Wednesday that its board and Mr. Butera had \u201cagreed that he will not be returning.\u201dHis departure comes as many sectors of the music industry \u2014 from leading orchestras to conservatories \u2014 have lagged in achieving diversity, particularly when it comes to hiring black and Hispanic musicians.The events that led to Mr. Butera\u2019s departure began at an April 26 meeting in Washington of arts service organization leaders arranged by the National Endowment for the Arts. Participants broke up into small groups to discuss diversity.\u201cI also mentioned that the field of music educators, much like the general population of educators, is skewed toward white individuals,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe have had ongoing and rich discussions in our association community about how best to address this issue, but have not yet been able to actualize a solution.

{"Headline": "For Facebook and Conservatives, a Collegial Meeting in Silicon Valley", "Date": "2016-05-18", "News": "Supported byMENLO PARK, Calif. \u2014 Cordiality reigned and pleasantries were exchanged. There was talk of virtual reality, a tour of Frank Gehry-designed buildings \u2014 and only a hint of disagreement.The t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate at Facebook\u2019s headquarters was an attempt by the company to mend fences with conservatives \u2014 and, by most accounts, it was a step in the right direction.The 90-minute meeting was described as mostly collegial, sympathetic and inquisitive by those in attendance. Some of the time was spent airing concerns and grievances \u2014 quite politely \u2014 with the group saying they felt conservatives did not have a true voice in the generally liberal area of Silicon Valley.To reassure attendees that Facebook is open to all perspectives, the company walked them through a technical presentation on how it surfaces the most popular news stories on the site.When the group raised the issue of ideological diversity \u2014 or a lack thereof \u2014 among employees at Facebook, who mostly lean left, there was a pause. Attendees struggled to come to an agreement over how to solve the issue.Some suggested adding more training and in-depth job interviews, but were rebuffed by those who saw that as not being in line with conservative principles.That was all left behind later, when the Republican group \u2014 including Dana Perino of Fox News and Barry Bennett, a campaign coordinator for Donald J. Trump \u2014 were taken on a tour of Facebook\u2019s campus, with its Frank Gehry-designed structures. The attendees were also given a demonstration of Facebook\u2019s Oculus virtual reality technology.\u201cI would actually commend Facebook for being the only one of the major tech groups in Silicon Valley that\u2019s willing to have conversations like this,\u201d Zac Moffatt, a co-founder of the political consultancy group Targeted Victory and a Republican digital strategist, said in an interview after the meeting. \u201cIt came about in a challenging way, but I actually think that Silicon Valley over all, it behooves them to all prepare for this and get ahead and have this type of engagement.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg was similarly effusive when the meeting concluded.The social network can ill afford to look like it only supports one side, however. In the last year it has stepped up its efforts to be a major force for Democrats and Republicans in this year\u2019s presidential election. The company has long planned to sponsor both this summer\u2019s Republican and Democratic National Conventions, and has worked with outlets like Fox News on the Republican debates.Alienating a particular political party \u2014 or its constituents \u2014 could potentially hurt Facebook\u2019s popularity over time with users and, perhaps more important, with advertisers and potential partners.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense for our mission or our business to suppress political content or prevent anyone from seeing what matters most to them,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said in his Facebook post on Wednesday.Facebook officials said they were looking forward to answering his questions in writing and would be responding.Many conservatives left the meeting encouraged, but also with a wait-and-see approach.\u201cWe\u2019ll see if the dialogue continues and if they work to really make improvements and to see how they can prevent these things from happening in the future,\u201d said Jenny Beth Martin, the co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots. \u201cThey sincerely seem to acknowledge that they have areas that they have to improve and they want to learn from those mistakes and be better in the future.\u201dArthur C. Brooks of the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, said he told Facebook \u201cthey need to think about more diversity of ideas, of religious groups and not be a monoculture and they understood this and were very sympathetic to this.\u201dAt least one Republican who attended will not be leaving Facebook: Rob Bluey, editor in chief of The Daily Signal, said in an interview with Fox News that he would not be changing how his website, which is part of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative organization, uses Facebook as a platform.\u201cAs it stands, Facebook reaches over a billion people,\u201d Mr. Bluey said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of conservatives who use it.\u201dMike Isaac reported from Menlo Park, Calif., and Nick Corasaniti from Washington.

He pairs them with T-shirts, polo shirts, even with a coat and tie. But the questions \u2014 which have more to do with his prosthetic legs, the most noticeable mark of his military service in Afghanistan, than with his sense of style \u2014 did not start until he decided to run for Congress.But when Mr. Mast, 35, announced the endorsement of Senator Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa and also a combat veteran, one commenter on his campaign\u2019s Facebook page expressed skepticism: Does Mr. Mast have to wear shorts to accommodate his prosthetics?\u201cOr is he purposely using his disability for his campaign?\u201d the commenter wrote. \u201cWhat I know of him, I like him, but this bothers me.\u201dIn a year when many voters are denouncing political correctness, military valor, often an almost unassailable political credential, is being scrutinized with the same frankness and, in some cases, even scorn as other aspects of a candidate\u2019s biography.But Mr. Feaver disputes the notion that Mr. Trump\u2019s aggressive posture signals an era in politics in which people can disrespect a veteran\u2019s military credentials with impunity.\u201cI don\u2019t know that anyone else doing that same thing would get away with it,\u201d he said.Still, more candidates use their military background as a foundation of a campaign. In the House of Representatives, about 18 percent of lawmakers are veterans, and about 20 percent of the Senate have served in the military. Strategists advise veterans hoping to make the jump from serving in one of the nation\u2019s most trusted institutions to serving in one of the least \u2014 Congress \u2014 to steel themselves for the scrutiny.Mr. Mast does not mind the questions about his legs if they are asked in the right spirit, he said on a sunny afternoon as he sat overlooking one of the numerous golf courses on Florida\u2019s Treasure Coast. His cane resting nearby, he had just finished playing in a tournament to benefit a veterans organization.\u201cPut your leg out straight, turn your foot up 90 degrees, leave your shoes on \u2014 because my shoes don\u2019t come off \u2014 and try putting on a pair of pants and see how that works out for you,\u201d he said.Mr. Mast was serving in Kandahar, Afghanistan, on the night of Sept. 19, 2010, when he took a wrong step while crossing a bridge and a roadside bomb tore through his body.\u201cI can remember it rattled my teeth,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know if I had teeth left in my mouth because the concussion of this explosion that took off both of my legs and nearly took off my arm.\u201dAbout a month later, Mr. Mast was lying in a hospital bed at Walter Reed Army Medical Center when he told his wife that he could not accept that perhaps the most meaningful work of his life was behind him. He decided to run for public office.Mr. Mast is one of 11 candidates over all for the seat now held by Representative Patrick Murphy, a Democrat. Mr. Murphy, who is running to replace Senator Marco Rubio, won his seat four years ago, beating Representative Allen West by fewer than 2,000 votes.Though he respects Mr. Mast\u2019s service, Mr. Perkins said veterans are not inherently more qualified than other candidates. But he knows criticizing a veteran, particularly when that critic has not served, can be fraught.\u201cI\u2019ve been told, be very careful when you\u2019re going to be talking about Brian,\u201d he said.Just a few miles from the sandy shoreline in Jupiter, a handful of customers chatted over coffee at a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts as Mr. Mast teed up. Mr. Trump, whose Mar-a-Lago estate is about 25 miles to the south, is popular. In March\u2019s primary, he ran away with about 53 percent of the vote in this district.The doughnut shop customers had not heard of Mr. Mast, they said; the congressional primary is still more than three months away.Bill White, 73, who briefly served in the Navy. He said he appreciated the commitment veterans had demonstrated to their country, a willingness to make sacrifices that spoke volumes about them.\u201cIf I don\u2019t know either candidate that was running for Congress, the veteran would get my vote,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Trump and Hillary Clinton are locked in tight races in three crucial states in November\u2019s general election, according to new polls that show men and women sharply divided on the presidential candidates and the likelihood of a close overall contest.\u201cAt this juncture, Trump is doing better in Pennsylvania than the G.O.P. nominees in 2008 and 2012,\u201d said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac Poll. \u201cAnd the two candidates are about where their party predecessors were at this point in Ohio and Florida.\u201dMr. Trump became the Republican Party\u2019s presumptive nominee last week after Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio dropped out of the race. Mrs. Clinton holds a substantial delegate lead over Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in the Democratic contest, but he is continuing to compete in coming primaries, including Tuesday\u2019s Democratic voting contest in West Virginia.The polls do offer some support for Mr. Sanders\u2019s argument to stay in the race, as he outperforms Mrs. Clinton in head-to-head matchups against Mr. Trump in the three states. The senator from Vermont tops Mr. Trump by two points in Florida and Ohio and by six points in Pennsylvania.In the expected general election contest between Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton, the divide between men and women is stark. She holds wide leads with women in Pennsylvania and Florida and a smaller one in Ohio, while Mr. Trump holds big leads with male voters in all three states.Voters generally think that Mr. Trump is better equipped to manage the economy and handle terrorism, but they view Mrs. Clinton as more intelligent and having \u201chigher moral standards.\u201d In all three states, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump receive low marks from prospective voters when it comes to their honesty and trustworthiness.Although Mr. Trump holds a wide lead among white men, some of his central proposals \u00e2\u0080\u0094 such as deporting all undocumented immigrants and building a wall along the Mexican border \u00e2\u0080\u0094 remain divisive. In Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania, most voters think that undocumented immigrants should be able to stay in the United States while applying for citizenship. Floridians are split on the merits of a wall, while most Ohio and Pennsylvania voters are against it.Mr. Brown noted that nonwhite voters in Florida are overwhelmingly against Mr. Trump\u2019s wall, but that his support among white men is keeping him competitive\u00c2\u00a0in the state.\u201cRepublicans\u2019 weakness among minority voters is well-known,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cBut the reason this race is so close over all is Clinton\u2019s historic weakness among white men.\u201d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

It could be thrilling to watch. And it could be dizzying to then cash a ticket.Over the years \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I was 14 that day at the Belmont, my dad at my side, a $2 win ticket in my hand \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the relationship, like all love affairs, had its ups and downs. The wagers could occasionally feel more important than the wonder. My devotion could feel cold, remote, cynical. The horses could come to be just numbers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00e2\u0080\u009cGet up, 6! Get up, 6!\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhen the 7 horse at Penn National broke down at the wire one night, most people at the Winner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Circle bar gasped. Not me. The horse having tumbled gruesomely across the finish line, I asked if my $20 win ticket was still good.The relationship, in truth, could be worse than sterile. It could be downright unhealthy. When you are delaying going to visit your premature twins in the neonatal intensive care unit until the eighth race at Santa Anita has gone off, you have to take some serious personal stock.Just before noon the horse was led haltingly into a van next to the stallion barn, and there a concentrated barbiturate was injected into his jugular. Forty-five seconds later there was a crash as the stallion collapsed. His body was trucked immediately to Lexington, Kentucky, where Dr. Thomas Swerczek, a professor of veterinary science at the University of Kentucky, performed the necropsy. All of the horse\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vital organs were normal in size except for the heart.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe were all shocked,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Swerczek said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen and done thousands of autopsies on horses, and nothing I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d ever seen compared to it. The heart of the average horse weighs about nine pounds. This was almost twice the average size, and a third larger than any equine heart I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d ever seen. And it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pathologically enlarged. All the chambers and the valves were normal. It was just larger. I think it told us why he was able to do what he did.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHow could one not be enchanted and enthralled by such a moment, such an appreciation? And thus how could one not be full of similar wonder upon seeing \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmerican Thoroughbred\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Twin Palms, 2016), Neil Latham\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gorgeous monograph? Mr. Latham, his admiration seemingly untainted by lost fortunes or misplaced priorities, does breathtaking justice to the physical specimens that race at our tracks and grace our imaginations.Mr. Latham had access to pricey racehorses at all hours and at a variety of venues. He slept in the groom dorms at Saratoga Race Course and camped in a tent in Kentucky. Along the way, he photographed A.P. Indy, Curlin, Tapit, Rachel Alexandra and Ghostzapper, famous racehorses all. The rare proximity allowed Mr. Latham to capture the behavioral and attitudinal flourishes of his subjects, including their mix of pride and arrogance. Mr. Latham, his work makes clear, experimented with photographic equipment, light, exposure and large-scale sets to gain his lasting and often radiant images. He shot only on film, and often with large-format cameras.His aim, in the end, was to capture \u00e2\u0080\u009cpure essence.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMission accomplished, in my eyes. Examining Mr. Latham\u00e2\u0080\u0099s photographs most reminded me of ESPN the Magazine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s annual Body Issue. Watching athletes in real time, at full extension, sometimes blinds us to the simple magnificence of their core blessings: their cut quads, their etched triceps, their supple shoulder blades. At rest, they are just as jaw-droppingly impressive.Mr. Latham says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs an artist, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m intrigued by the juxtaposition of strength and power with beauty and fragility.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cAmerican Thoroughbred\u00e2\u0080\u009d made me a 14-year-old again, the ground under my feet moving, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cmiracle\u00e2\u0080\u009d of a racehorse unspoiled by gambling.

{"Headline": "Facebook Moves to Repair Its Fractured Relationship With the Right", "Date": "2016-05-17", "News": "Supported byMr. Bennett said he suggested Facebook meet with prominent Republican politicians and pundits. Within days, Mr. Kaplan organized a meeting at the company\u2019s headquarters in Silicon Valley. Mr. Kaplan will preside over that meeting on Wednesday with Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, and nearly a dozen conservatives, including Glenn Beck of TheBlaze television network and Jim DeMint, a former South Carolina senator and a leading figure in the Tea Party movement.Mr. Kaplan is \u201cwalking a tightrope,\u201d said Mr. Bennett, who will also attend the meeting. \u201cFacebook is becoming such a powerful tool, everyone is watching it with a microscope.\u201dThe scramble by Mr. Kaplan, a little-known figure outside Washington politics, shows just how hard it is to meaningfully change the image of Facebook as a politically liberal organization strongly attached to the Democratic Party. That image \u2014 fostered by how outspoken Mr. Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, have been about their liberal beliefs \u2014 is increasingly important to change given the company\u2019s enormous influence with 1.65 billion members worldwide and its role as a distributor of news and information.Yet those efforts have been eclipsed by Facebook\u2019s executives and their political stances. Mr. Zuckerberg has waded into the fray on immigration by supporting citizenship for children of illegal immigrants. In April, he openly rebuked Mr. Trump\u2019s calls for stronger border control and the creation of a wall between the United States and Mexico. Ms. Sandberg, who began her career working for the Clinton administration, has hosted fund-raisers for President Obama and has contributed to Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.Mr. Kaplan, 47, declined requests for an interview. In a Facebook post over the weekend, he wrote, \u201cI have heard the claims of bias from friends and colleagues. But that is not the truth of Facebook.\u201d He added that conservative groups were thriving on the network.Mr. Kaplan, a former Marine, graduated from Harvard Law School and clerked for two conservative justices, Antonin Scalia of the United States Supreme Court and J. Michael Luttig of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. In 2000, he joined the Bush presidential campaign, working with Ted Cruz. At the White House, Mr. Kaplan served as Mr. Bush\u2019s deputy chief of staff from 2006 to 2009.Josh Bolten, former chief of staff for George W. Bush, described Mr. Kaplan as \u201ca consistent and strong voice for conservative principles.\u201dIn 2011, Mr. Kaplan joined Facebook at the urging of Ms. Sandberg, who knew him from Harvard. He is now Facebook\u2019s liaison to government leaders around the world, a role that requires moving between cultures.Mr. Kaplan has strengthened Facebook\u2019s ties with important Republican leaders. He has hosted House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Rand Paul of Kentucky and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich at the company\u2019s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif.Jodi Seth, a spokeswoman for Facebook, said that in hiring Mr. Kaplan, top executives \u201cthought it was important to have a senior Republican in the office who could bring a conservative perspective to the table for important policy discussions.\u201dEven with his deep ties to the Republican party, Mr. Kaplan faces a challenge in winning over a fractured right wing. His relationship with the George W. Bush administration has alienated some Republicans, who say that segment of the party does not speak for the working class and anti-trade conservatives who have emerged in this year\u2019s primary campaign.Mr. Kaplan \u201cis part of the conservative global elites who do not represent our constituents,\u201d said Alexander Marlow, editor in chief of Breitbart, which the Gizmodo article highlighted as one of the media outlets suppressed by Facebook\u2019s curators. Breitbart declined an invitation to Wednesday\u2019s meeting. The website has said it wants an interview with Mr. Zuckerberg to publicly explain how Trending topics decisions work.Conservatives will go into Wednesday\u2019s meeting with Mr. Zuckerberg having heard his open immigration calls and criticism of Mr. Trump, as well as his public support of marriage equality rights and policies to mitigate climate change.Mr. Bennett said he and other conservatives have complained to Mr. Kaplan specifically about Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s speech last month, when he referenced Mr. Trump\u2019s policies. They noted that the Republican Party was partnering with Facebook on many campaign events and said the site should appear more neutral.On Wednesday, Mr. Kaplan and Mr. Zuckerberg plan to explain how the Trending feature works and present guidelines for curators who write headlines and descriptions for it.Also invited to the meeting are Dana Perino of Fox News; S. E. Cupp of CNN; Kristen Soltis Anderson, a columnist for The Washington Examiner; and Arthur C. Brooks, president of the American Enterprise Institute.Advertisement"}

They said they considered themselves members of a newsroom-like operation, where editorial discretion was not novel but was an integral part of the process.Any \u201csuppression,\u201d the former employees said, was based on perceived credibility \u2014 any articles judged by curators to be unreliable or poorly sourced, whether left-leaning or right-leaning, were avoided, though this was a personal judgment call.The perception of Facebook as a more conventional news operation opens it to a more familiar line of criticism, which has been mounted against news organizations left and right, large and small, for decades. According to a report last year by Pew, only 17 percent surveyed said that technology companies had a negative influence on the country. For the news media, that number was 65 percent \u2014 and rising.\u201cThe agenda-setting power of a handful of companies like Facebook and Twitter should not be underestimated,\u201d said Jonathan Zittrain, a professor of computer science and law at Harvard University. \u201cThese services will be at their best when they are explicitly committed to serving the interests of their users rather than simply offering a service whose boundaries for influence are unknown and ever-changing.\u201dBy late Monday, users on the social network looking for more information about the Gizmodo report did not have to look far: It was among the top articles trending on Facebook.Nick Corasaniti contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An iPad Misplaced at the Airport Takes Its Own Vacation", "Date": "2016-05-01", "News": "Supported byBitsLast month, Shelby Bonnie\u2019s iPad vanished from his carry-on bag somewhere at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport after a red-eye flight from San Francisco. He figured he would never see it again.But sometimes our devices aren\u2019t ready to say goodbye.While Mr. Bonnie, an investment banker with Allen & Company, continued on his way to the Bahamas for a few days of relaxation, his iPad began a strange odyssey of its own, turning Mr. Bonnie into a digital gumshoe and the narrator of a personal thriller that played out on Facebook, to the delight of his online friends.\u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m definitely going to lose my iPad, but I\u2019m going to have some fun,\u2019\u201d Mr. Bonnie said in a phone interview.When Mr. Bonnie discovered the iPad was missing after he left the Fort Lauderdale airport, he turned on Find My iPhone and saw that his tablet was at Elvis Presley\u2019s Heartbreak Hotel at Graceland \u2014 in Memphis. The app represented the location of the device as a glowing green circle on an aerial map outside the hotel, with its distinctive heart-shaped pool.His best guess was that he had lost the iPad in the airport when he was stuffing a travel pillow back into his carry-on bag and that the device was now in the company of another traveler who had picked it up.That person had apparently decided not to turn in the device to the lost-and-found department at the airport. Through Find My iPhone, Mr. Bonnie sent a message, visible on the lock screen of the iPad, telling whoever had the device to call his cellphone for a reward. No one did.Over the next few days, Mr. Bonnie began providing regular updates on the iPad\u2019s whereabouts to his friends on Facebook, providing screen shots from Find My iPhone that showed the device headed to downtown Memphis and at the Links at Riverside, a golf course. \u201cIPad is on the move,\u201d one of his updates said.Most of his posts got more than 100 likes on Facebook and dozens of comments, as Mr. Bonnie\u2019s online acquaintances became more engaged in the story.\u201cPlease keep your fans informed as to the results of the mystery,\u201d one commenter said.By coincidence, Mr. Bonnie nearly bumped into his iPad on a short layover from the Bahamas. As he waited at Concourse C at the Fort Lauderdale airport for a flight back to his home in San Francisco, he saw on Find My iPhone that his iPad was on an airplane approaching Concourse C.He quickly located the gate for an Allegiant Air flight arriving from Memphis and looked over the passengers disembarking from the plane.He remembered he could use Find My iPhone to trigger a distress signal on his iPad. He activated the feature, but heard no sound. He told his Facebook fans he was within 100 feet of the iPad.\u201cThis is better than \u2018Game of Thrones,\u2019\u201d one commented.He concluded that the iPad must have been inside checked luggage that never entered the terminal. By the time he got to the correct baggage carousel the iPad had left the airport.Mr. Bonnie saw an opportunity for mischief when the iPad finally seemed to stay put in a residential neighborhood in Miami Lakes, a suburb of Miami. On a map, it looked like a nice home with a swimming pool, Mr. Bonnie said.He boarded his plane to San Francisco, ordered in-flight Wi-Fi access and spent $50 to have five Mylar balloons delivered to the house the next morning. On the card, he listed the occasion as \u201cThinking of You.\u201d\u201cFriendly yet slightly creepy enough for them to want that iPad out of their house,\u201d one of his Facebook friends said.A voice mail message left by a reporter for the phone number associated with the Miami Lakes address was not returned.The balloons appeared to have an effect. The next morning the iPad was on the move again \u2014 back to the Fort Lauderdale airport. Mr. Bonnie, in San Francisco, was watching the device traveling on the map when it occurred to him that whoever had it might be taking it to the airport\u2019s lost and found.He went to the airport\u2019s website and began filling out a missing item claim form when his phone rang. It was someone from lost and found.\u201cAs described by lost and found when they called a second ago, a fairly elderly woman came in a few minutes ago and said she had gotten the balloons and thought it would be a good idea to return the iPad to the airport,\u201d Mr. Bonnie wrote in a Facebook post. \u201cShe said to thank me for the balloons, but she didn\u2019t really want to call.\u201d\u201cBetter than \u2018Serial,\u2019\u201d a friend commented on Facebook. \u201cBetter than \u2018This American Life.\u2019 Better than everything.\u201dMr. Bonnie paid to have his iPad shipped home by UPS. He received it in San Francisco on Friday. He hung a banner saying \u201cWelcome Home\u201d on his front door.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ukraine\u2019s Eurovision Win Rouses a Chorus of Anger and Suspicion in Russia", "Date": "2016-05-16", "News": "Supported byThe result had barely been announced on Saturday night in Stockholm when the habitual Kremlin propaganda machine found its voice, with the main television news shows, various members of Parliament and even the Foreign Ministry weighing in to smear the contest.Yelena Drapeko, an actress turned member of Parliament, summed up the general mood by attributing the loss to what she called the demonization of Russia.\u201cPartly, this is a result of the propaganda and information war that is being waged against Russia,\u201d she was quoted as saying by the TASS news agency. \u201cWe are talking about the general demonization of Russia, about how everything with us is bad, about how our athletes are all doping, our planes are violating airspace, all of this.\u201dThe loss was the top news story on the weekly Sunday night news program hosted by Dmitry K. Kiselyov, the Kremlin\u2019s main propagandist. Mr. Kiselyov sees the dark arts of the United States operating everywhere in the world, and the Eurovision contest was no exception, never mind that it is not an American event.The Logo network, a cable channel supportive of gay rights, broadcast the event for the first time in the United States, and that was enough to give birth to a conspiracy theory in Russia.\u201cI don\u2019t exclude the fact that Americans\u2019 having bought broadcasting rights has changed the voting system,\u201d Mr. Kiselyov said. \u201cMoney talks, as they say, in this case in political interests.\u201dPoliticians were not the only ones crying foul, of course. Among the viewing public, Sergey Lazarev, the Russian singer, enjoys a staunch following among teenage girls. They were among the most vocal critics of his loss.But many observers felt Russia\u2019s basic problem was this: Before the show, Mr. Lazarev, a pop star in Russia, was favored to win, but the prize went to the Ukrainian, Susana Jamaladinova, who goes by the stage name Jamala.\u201cWhen strangers are coming, they come to your house, they kill you all and say we are not guilty, not guilty,\u201d says the opening verse of the song.The Moscow establishment has always coveted a winning entry in the Eurovision contest and was eagerly anticipating a moment of triumph after bookies established Mr. Lazarev as the favorite.This year, however, contest organizers changed the way the votes were tabulated, separating the votes by viewer polls and by a five-member jury in each participating country and making both tallies public, instead of presenting just the combined vote. Mr. Lazarev won the popular vote, but ranked fifth in the jury vote.In the tumultuous aftermath, Russia has suddenly emerged as the unexpected champion of a popular vote.Every Russian news program and various senior officials maintained that Mr. Lazarev, as the popular favorite, had been robbed in what they denigrated as a clearly political decision.Aleksei K. Pushkov, the head of the State Duma\u2019s committee on international affairs, said on Twitter that Eurovision had \u201cturned into a field of political battles\u201d and suggested that Russia now had the right to send a politically charged entry to the next contest.The winner gets to host the contest the following year, which means in 2017 it will be in Ukraine. That brought endless suggestions from Russia to either boycott the contest or send the most nationalistic crooners possible.Maria V. Zakharova, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, said that next year, Russia would come up with a song about President Bashar al-Assad of Syria that was sure to carry the day. \u201cAssad bloody, Assad the worst. Give me prize so that we can host,\u201d she wrote as a suggested lyric on her Facebook account.A deputy prime minister, Dmitri O. Rogozin, proposed sending Sergei V. Shnurov, the frontman for a popular rock band known for its use of foul language and celebration of alcoholism. Others suggested that Russia send its contestants to Ukraine next year on the back of tanks.Across the border, Ukrainians saw the win in political terms, too, but they were often jubilant about it. Many Ukrainians aspire to membership in the European Union, a goal that has driven their country into a civil war with Russian-backed separatists in the southeast, leaving more than 9,000 people dead.About a thousand fans, many bearing flowers, greeted Ms. Jamaladinova when she flew into the Kiev airport. \u201cCrimea is Ukraine!\u201d they shouted, and then sang the national anthem. Politicians starting with President Petro O. Poroshenko posted congratulations on social media.Of course, there were conspiracy theories in Ukraine, too. Given the high number of votes from within Ukraine for Mr. Lazarev, Ukrainian nationalists wondered if perhaps Russia had found a way to manipulate the vote across the border. Others took it as a \u201cKumbaya\u201d moment indicating that there should be no war between the two countries.Mikhail Pavliv, a Kiev-based political scientist, pointed out in a post on Facebook that while viewers in Russia and Ukraine had voted in favor of each other\u2019s singers, the jury in each country had given the other\u2019s contestant zero points.\u201cThis is better than any sociology,\u201d he wrote.An article on May 17 about the Eurovision Song Contest, in which a singer from Ukraine unexpectedly upset the odds-on favorite, a Russian, referred incorrectly to changes in the contest this year. Contest organizers changed the way the votes were tabulated: Votes by viewer polls and by a five-member jury in each participating country were presented separately, instead of being combined. The popular vote/jury vote system was not introduced this year.Alisa Sopova contributed reporting from Donetsk, Ukraine.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Finding Organ Donors Concealed in Plain Sight", "Date": "2016-05-17", "News": "Supported byFixesSecond of two articles.In August, Nathan received a transplant. He\u2019s had some complications, but nine months later, videos show him cruising happily with his walker.Nathan\u2019s case is not unique. \u201cThere have been several instances where people have posted a need for an organ for a baby or an adult and we\u2019ve had a massive outpouring,\u201d Baker said.Only one of the candidates ended up donating, of course. That left Baker wondering whether the others would be willing to give to someone else. So she asked them. \u201cAlmost 100 percent said yes,\u201d she said.Since the 1970s, the field of organ transplantation in the United States has focused primarily on deceased donors. Although 150 million Americans have registered as organ donors, the number of transplants has remained essentially flat for a decade. Today, the focus is shifting.\u201cLiving donation is the area most amenable to change,\u201d said Andrew Cameron, director of liver transplantation at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. \u201cIt\u2019s minimally invasive and proven safe, the organ you get from a living donor is a better organ, it works right away and lasts longer and, when polled, the majority indicate a willingness to donate.\u201dBut what if these conversations could be made easier?As a rule, it\u2019s easier to solicit help for someone else than for yourself. That recognition prompted researchers at the Comprehensive Transplant Center at Johns Hopkins Hospital to test the effectiveness of training a patient\u2019s family member or friend to serve as a \u201clive donor champion\u201d on the patient\u2019s behalf.Clearly, it helps to separate the patient and the advocate. Still, some champions found the process a lot of work, and many found it uncomfortable. Is there a way to make it easier?That question led researchers from the Hopkins center, working with Facebook and Organize, to develop a smartphone app to help patients construct a story about how a transplant could change their lives. \u201cIt asks what you\u2019re going through medically, what it\u2019s like to be on dialysis, and what you\u2019re up against in terms of needing a kidney,\u201d said Cameron. \u201cIt automatically creates a Facebook post and adds links to resources. It gives friends the opportunity to reply, share the story, or even go about initiating an evaluation for donation.\u201dIn an initial study, 54 patients, half of them African-Americans, used the app for six months. During that time, 18 donors contacted the transplant center, 11 offering kidneys and seven livers.Users of the app were 6.6 times more likely to have a donor come forward to help than were members of a control group who did not differ in demographics, prior Facebook use, number of Facebook friends, and familiarity with social media.\u201cEducation should begin when patients are first getting diagnosed with kidney disease,\u201d added Dianne LaPointe Rudow, who directs a center for living donation at the Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York. \u201cIt needs to be repeated by primary-care providers and nephrologists so that by the time patients get to dialysis they\u2019re prepared.\u201dThere is a lot of worry that \u201cpoor people are going to be somehow used in this scenario,\u201d she added. \u201cBut who are the people disproportionately dying on the waiting lists? It\u2019s poor minorities.\u201dMorrison went further: \u201cWe should treat kidney donation like a public service and have a G.I. Bill for living donors.\u201dThese days, Morrison says he rarely thinks about the missing organ on his left side. \u201cIf I stretch my hamstring I notice a tightness around one incision,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you were to puncture my remaining kidney it would be a lot worse than if I had two.\u201d Mainly, he says, when he thinks about his kidney, he comes back to the fact that he was able to use it to save someone\u2019s life, a person named John Mendes from Boston, whom he did not meet until three months after the transplant.\u201cIt seems amazing to me,\u201d he said, \u201cand it makes me really happy and joyful.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inner Peace? The Dalai Lama Made a Website for That", "Date": "2016-05-06", "News": "Supported byROCHESTER, Minn. \u2014 The Dalai Lama, who tirelessly preaches inner peace while chiding people for their selfish, materialistic ways, has commissioned scientists for a lofty mission: to help turn secular audiences into more self-aware, compassionate humans.\u201cIt is my duty to publish such work,\u201d the Dalai Lama said.Dr. Ekman\u2019s daughter, Eve, a post-doctoral fellow in integrative medicine research, worked on the project as well, with the goal of producing a guide to human emotions that anyone with an Internet connection could study in a quest for self-understanding, calm and constructive action.\u201cWe have, by nature or biologically, this destructive emotion, also constructive emotion,\u201d the Dalai Lama said. \u201cThis innerness, people should pay more attention to, from kindergarten level up to university level. This is not just for knowledge, but in order to create a happy human being. Happy family, happy community and, finally, happy humanity.\u201dThe Dalai Lama paid Dr. Ekman at least $750,000 to develop the project, which began with a request several years ago.Dr. Ekman recalled the Dalai Lama telling him: \u201cWhen we wanted to get to the New World, we needed a map. So make a map of emotions so we can get to a calm state.\u201dBased on the survey, Dr. Ekman concluded that there were five broad categories of emotions \u2014 anger, fear, disgust, sadness and enjoyment \u2014 and that each had an elaborate subset of emotional states, triggers, actions and moods. He took these findings to a cartography and data visualization firm, Stamen, to depict them in a visual and, he hoped, useful way.\u201cIf it isn\u2019t fun, it\u2019s a failure,\u201d Dr. Ekman said. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be fun for people to use.\u201dStamen\u2019s founder, Eric Rodenbeck, has created data visualizations for Google, Facebook and MTV, as well as maps showing climate change and rising oceans. But he said the Atlas was the most challenging project he had worked on because it was \u201cbuilt around knowledge and wisdom rather than data.\u201dNot surprisingly, getting scientists to reach a unified understanding of human emotions was difficult.Although Dr. Keltner took part in Dr. Ekman\u2019s survey, the two are not in complete agreement on the number of core emotions. Still, Dr. Keltner said he saw the project as a good step.\u201cThe survey questions could have allowed for more gray areas,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s important to take stock of what the scientific consensus is in the field.\u201dDr. Ekman emphasized that the Atlas was not a scientific work intended for peer review.\u201cIt is a visualization for what we think has been learned from scientific studies,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a transformative process, a work of explanation.\u201dThe Dalai Lama wants to keep religion out of it.\u201cIf we see this research work as relying on religious belief or tradition, then it automatically becomes limited,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if you pray to God, pray to Buddha, emotionally, very nice, very good. But every problem, we have created. So I think even God or Buddha cannot do much.\u201dThe Dalai Lama said he hoped the Atlas could be a tool for cultivating good in the world by defeating the bad within us.\u201cUltimately, our emotion is the real troublemaker,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to know the nature of that enemy.\u201dThe Dalai Lama said he had been encouraged by President Obama\u2019s reaction to the project when he told him about it in India.\u201cObama seems, I think, to show more interest about our inner value,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the past, compassion was something of a sign of weakness, or anger a sign of power, sign of strength. Basic human nature is more compassionate. That\u2019s the real basis of our hope.\u201dWhile excited about the Atlas, however, the 80-year-old Dalai Lama will probably not be clicking around the interactive site. He is much more comfortable turning the printed pages of a version that was custom-made for him.\u201cTechnology is for my next body,\u201d he once quipped to the researchers.Advertisement"}

Over the past year, however, as allegations of mismanagement and unsustainability have grown \u2014 Square went public for approximately half its last private valuation; Fidelity and other large mutual funds wrote down their positions in Dropbox, MongoDB, and Snapchat; and both Zenefits and Theranos were accused of deceptive practices \u2014 that confidence has come to look more like hubris.This past January, after a long autumn of minor misfortune left the market in a stall, I spent a week loitering in the command concourse of American V.C., Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, Calif., where the soft, spruce-filtered sunlight falls through plate glass into quiet offices of beige on beige. There was some selection bias at work, as all my introductions were brokered by a smart and thoughtful friend, but not a single investor I talked to fit the description of the supercilious techno-optimist \u2014 and most, in private, didn\u2019t hesitate to concede Palihapitiya\u2019s point. Of course they believed private valuations had become preposterous; of course the run in private tech stocks couldn\u2019t possibly last; and of course, many start-ups, especially those of the \u201cUber for garden-gnome rearrangement\u201d variety, are in fact largely worthless.Where they differed from the naysayers, however, was in their rating of the \u00adcauses\u00ad and consequences; the fault, they said, didn\u2019t belong to the technological elite but to everybody else: What has driven inflated valuations, in a time of extremely low interest rates and meager returns elsewhere, is \u201cdumb money,\u201d all the alien capital that has flowed into the Valley in recent years. Dumb money is a hedge-funder who\u2019s jealous of a V.C. Dumb money is sovereign wealth. Dumb money is an Emirati home office. Dumb money is a Facebook millionaire in a Maserati who wants to look like a player. Dumb money wants to get in on tech because it\u2019s a box to check off. Dumb money isn\u2019t in it for the long run. Dumb money doesn\u2019t actually care about the technology. Dumb money doesn\u2019t create value. Dumb money thinks what you lose on the margin you\u2019ll make up for in volume. Dumb money wants to get in on Uber at any price, and will accept a \u201climited-edition private offer\u201d to join the scarce ranks in a \u201cspecial purpose vehicle\u201d that bears all the risks of one company with none of the hedging benefits of a portfolio. Dumb money is those pinkish guys with bull necks in Zegna suits. The weird thing about dumb money, unfortunately, is that it can act with fiendish intelligence, insisting on stipulations that guarantee returns at the expense of founders, employees and other investors.Luckily for the American economy, the dumb money this time around is no longer a mob of deluded pensioners waist-deep in Webvan. (It\u2019s also, the V.C.s noted, a lot less money in total, and at least in theory it\u2019s coming from people who can afford the losses; the last dot-com crash erased an estimated $6.2 trillion in household wealth.) So the coming correction will allow the smart money to roll up its brushed-microfiber sleeves and get back to basics. A lot of $10 billion companies will become $1 billion companies, and $1 billion companies will be acquired for $100 million, and the dumb money will slink away. Operating expenses and burn rates will come way down, and companies that didn\u2019t worry about profitability or unit economics will. There will be layoffs, sure, but the only serious effects will be that the traffic on I-280 will no longer back up three exits, it\u2019ll be easier to get a table at the Village Pub and engineers three minutes out of Stanford will no longer expect $150,000 a year and backlit fountains of complimentary fruit water.Defenders of that system argue that all they really need are the expected half-dozen mega-I.P.O.s (Slack, Palantir, Snapchat, Uber, Airbnb) to make enough cash returns to offset the losses. But that fantasy math holds for only a tiny cohort of V.C. firms. It also overlooks the well-being of tens of thousands of employees, especially support staff, who have worked for years for a share in the wealth they\u2019ve created. Perhaps worst of all, it betrays a callow belief that the genuinely transformative long-term endeavors that V.C.s have come to support \u2014 erstwhile academic research into artificial intelligence, bioengineering and sustainable energy \u2014 will be somehow insulated from an industry downturn. An exploded bubble could very well mean that those \u201ctotally audacious\u201d bets will go unfunded entirely. That might seem like a satisfying comeuppance for the imperious Valley, but it\u2019s not something to be smug about. Smart money convinces itself of its highly differentiated intelligence at what might prove to be all of our expense.Gideon Lewis-Kraus is a contributing writer for the magazine.

Trump, has a new role, according to a confidant: emissary from Mr. Trump to the remaining holdouts from the Republican primary field.The confidant, Armstrong Williams, said on Thursday that Mr. Carson had been placing calls and \u00e2\u0080\u009creaching out to everyone,\u201d and planned to make the case that despite Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s insults in the primary race, the party needs to come together.The outreach would include Senator Ted Cruz, Senator Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush, all of whom were frequent targets of insults from Mr. Trump during the primary campaigns. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe can say, \u2018He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s done nothing to you that he has not done worse to me,\u2019\u200a\u201d Mr. Williams said, referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s mockery of Mr. Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, before the Iowa caucuses this year.Hope Hicks, Mr. Trump\u2019s spokeswoman, did not respond to an email about Mr. Carson\u2019s role.Mr. Carson, who endorsed Mr. Trump in March a week after ending his White House bid, has had multiple roles in the Trump campaign, including identifying potential vice-presidential candidates and as a go-between with Representative Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, who met with Mr. Trump on Thursday in search of party unity. Mr. Carson stepped away from the committee vetting vice-presidential possibilities after it was reported on Tuesday that Corey Lewandowski, Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign manager, would head up that operation, Mr. Williams said. He added that it was Mr. Carson\u2019s decision \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not that of Mr. Trump or Mr. Lewandowski, who has been reported to be jostling with other senior advisers for primacy in the campaign.  \u201cTrump wanted to give Dr. Carson the title of heading it up, but he didn\u2019t want it,\u201d Mr. Williams said, referring to the vice-presidential committee. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe enjoys the freedom of having his life back and being an adviser.\u201d\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen the announcement came out of who was heading it up, it was a surprise,\u201d he added, referring to Mr. Lewandowski\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role.The campaign has yet to formally comment on whether Mr. Lewandowski is heading the vice-presidential search, which was first reported by The Washington Post. Mr. Trump told The Associated Press after that report that a team of people on the campaign would be involved. \u201cHonestly, we\u2019re all running it. It\u2019s very much a group effort,\u201d Mr. Trump told The A.P., adding in that interview that Mr. Carson would be involved. Mr. Williams, who is Mr. Carson\u2019s business manager, said that Mr. Carson gave Mr. Trump several names for vice president \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but not his own. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is not interested at all\u00e2\u0080\u009d in being vice president, Mr. Williams insisted.  On Tuesday, Mr. Carson spoke by phone with Mr. Ryan to try to overcome the speaker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hesitancy to endorse Mr. Trump. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat Dr. Carson took his time to do was tell Speaker Ryan what a good listener Mr. Trump was,\u201d according to Mr. Williams.Mr. Carson maintained a mild manner throughout his presidential run even in the face of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ridicule of his biography, parts of which Mr. Trump implied were concocted.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe world laughed at him when he endorsed Mr. Trump,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd still, he was determined to unify the party.\u201dIn reaching out to other defeated candidates, Mr. Williams said that Mr. Carson planned to argue that they should come on board to prevent a Democratic president from naming future Supreme Court justices.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Former Exeter Official Charged With Sexual Assault From 1970s", "Date": "2016-05-13", "News": "Supported byBOSTON \u2014 A former admissions officer at Phillips Exeter Academy, a prestigious boarding school in New Hampshire, turned himself in to the Exeter police on Friday in connection with sexual assault charges stemming from the 1970s.Arthur Peekel, 74, who now lives in Palatine, Ill., was an admissions officer at Exeter from 1967 to 1974. The police said that between November and December 1973, he assaulted a prospective student at the school.It was the latest charge to emerge as a raft of private, independent schools across New England confront past allegations of sexual misconduct. In most of those cases, the statute of limitations ran out long ago, and few people have been charged.But Mr. Peekel left New Hampshire shortly after the reported encounters, which essentially stopped the clock on the statute of limitations, Chief William Shupe of the Exeter police said.As a result, the charges against Mr. Peekel constitute the first set of criminal charges to be brought against a teacher or administrator at Exeter.Mr. Peekel did not return calls on Friday seeking comment.Had Mr. Peekel stayed in New Hampshire, the statute of limitations would have expired in the late 1990s, 22 years after the 18th birthday of the accuser, Lawrence Jenkens. Mr. Jenkens, 56, is the head of the art department at the University of North Carolina in Greensboro. He told his story publicly in late March on Facebook after Exeter announced that Rick Schubart, a longtime Exeter teacher, had admitted to earlier instances of sexual misconduct.This prompted several alumni to report numerous other episodes involving other staff members and students.\u201cI wanted to add my voice to the stories of victims who were coming forward,\u201d Mr. Jenkens said in an interview on Friday.He was 14 when he visited the Exeter campus in 1973 as a prospective student, Mr. Jenkens said, and Mr. Peekel insisted he sleep in his room. During the night, Mr. Jenkens said, Mr. Peekel reached under the covers and fondled him. He said Mr. Peekel also used the boy\u2019s hand to stimulate himself.He took a leave of absence and resigned in 1974 from Exeter, saying he had to care for his mother in Illinois. He continued to teach and in 1991-92 was named Illinois Teacher of the Year.He was arrested and charged Friday with two counts of sexual assault and released on $25,000 bail. Arraignment is set for July 5.Each charge carries a prison term of up to one year and a fine of up to $2,000 or both.In a statement, the school said it would refrain from commenting on Mr. Peekel\u2019s case because it did not want to jeopardize it.But it added, \u201cWe are in open and active discussion with our community about how to come to terms with this disturbing part of our past and address the needs of those who have been harmed.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a man who has accused Arthur Peekel of sexually assaulting him when he was a prospective student at Phillips Exeter Academy. He is Lawrence Jenkens, not Jenkins.Advertisement"}

Cars with steering wheels that were prone to fail and cause a crash.Two trends are driving the increase, consumer advocates and regulators say. First, the high number of recalls is in some ways a sign of improvements in attention to public safety. Some manufacturers will always cut corners or make mistakes, but better detection tools and stricter safety rules mean that problems that once went undetected are now more often spotted and traced back to their source.\u201cThat kind of testing wasn\u2019t done 15 years ago,\u201d said Gene Grabowski, a crisis communications specialist who has worked on more than 175 product recalls, including CRF\u2019s. \u201cYou would just get a 24-hour flu or a stomach ache, and nobody questioned it. Now it\u2019s being identified.\u201dBut sales and manufacturing changes, including many industries\u2019 reliance on fewer, more widely shared suppliers, also make today\u2019s recalls larger and more complicated than before.\u201cI clearly would prefer to be driving my Honda, but when you get a letter saying, \u2018Your car could kill you and the passengers you\u2019re driving,\u2019 you pay attention,\u201d he said.Mr. Osborn contacted his local BMW service center, as the letter suggested, but he was turned down when he asked for a substitute car to drive until his was fixed. Without another transportation option, he nervously, and reluctantly, continues to drive the BMW.\u201cI live near the ocean; it\u2019s humid here. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve figured out: This much time plus this much moisture equals exploding airbag,\u201d Mr. Osborn said. \u201cThe letter I got is not very comforting. It offers scary possibilities, but no concrete details about \u2018Here\u2019s what to do, or not do, in the meantime.\u2019\u201dRebecca Kiehne, a spokeswoman for BMW of North America, declined to provide specifics on the company\u2019s policy on loaner cars.\u201cWe have authorized our service centers to provide adequate customer assistance. If support is required, we will do our best to provide that support,\u201d she said. \u201cParts are not rapidly available. We\u2019re trying to address it as quickly as we can.\u201dMany recalls, including some of the largest, had minimal customer impact. The record for sheer unit numbers was a 2004 recall of toy jewelry imported from India and sold for 75 cents or less apiece in vending machines nationwide. Some of the jewelry contained lead, prompting a recall of 150 million pieces, but not a single instance of harm or sickness was reported, said Patty Davis, a spokeswoman for the Consumer Product Safety Commission.That puts the onus on manufacturers to be aggressive and creative in reaching their customers. With more traceable purchases, like automobiles and prescription medications, companies will typically use letters, emails, phone calls and sometimes even text messages to spur people into action.\u201cIt almost looks like a marketing campaign,\u201d said Mr. Pollack of Stericycle. \u201cWe may contact an owner 10 to 20 times to get them to bring an item in.\u201dBut for car owners like Mr. Osborn, automakers\u2019 outreach efforts are a cold comfort until parts for fixes are available.\u201cI\u2019ve had my airbag deployed before; a few years ago, I was in an accident,\u201d he said. \u201cThe risk crosses my mind every time I get in the car.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Do Our Online Avatars Reveal About Us?", "Date": "2016-05-10", "News": "Supported byFirst WordsEvery time I send an email, I see myself staring back at me. I always have a slight, knowing smile on my face, even if the content of my email is confused, distressed or brimming with unrestrained glee. I chose the image (maybe unconsciously) because it seemed professional and direct, and also because my hair looked good. Smug email me is not my only online incarnation. There are dozens more of my avatars scattered across the web.The word \u201cavatar\u201d originates in Hinduism, where it refers to a god descending to the earth in mortal form. In Hindu theology, Vishnu assumes various earthbound avatars \u2014 among them a fish; a tortoise; a half-man, half-lion \u2014 in an effort to restore order at times when humanity has descended into chaos. Now we\u2019re the gods, reinventing ourselves online in the hope of bringing order to a realm we can\u2019t quite keep under our control.Our avatars represent a self-image that\u2019s fractured across dozens of sites and text bubbles and email chains. We present ourselves differently on Twitter and Tumblr and Slack depending on the norms built into each space. On Facebook, I\u2019m posed by a professional photographer, waist contorted into a slimmed line, eyes peering up out the window of a skyscraper. On Snapchat, I\u2019m burrowed into my office chair, blankly blinking my eyes open and closed. On Candy Crush, I\u2019m a cartoon man-otter. I don\u2019t particularly know why I\u2019ve selected these avatars as my representatives; it\u2019s some combination of my read on the platform\u2019s sensibility, my emotional state at the time of upload and the suite of photos I had on my phone at that moment.But as I traverse the Web, I naturally scan for subtle clues in the avatars chosen by friends and strangers, reading their U.S.A.-themed scrapbooks and cat GIFs like leaves at the bottom of a teacup. On Twitter, an avatar flipped to Beyonc\u00e9 in \u201cLemonade\u201d or Prince reads like a pledge to a newly materialized online club; a bizarre cartoon points to a person who tweets frequently and with open self-loathing; an unhatched egg that appears automatically upon profile creation has become its own anti-avatar avatar. The latest avatar trend turns you into a cartoon character in your own life. With the Bitmoji app, you can conjure a comic-strip image of yourself to emote over email, Twitter and text. And Mii\u00adtomo, a new mobile game from Nintendo, makes the gamification of our social lives explicit \u2014 in it, when your impish avatar socializes, you win piles and piles of digital coins for your trouble.Before avatars became a technological, almost bureaucratic form of self-presentation, \u201cavatar\u201d was used to single out a rarer embodiment of culture and art. As Britain colonized the Indian subcontinent in the 19th century, the Hindu word became a fashionable metaphorical flourish among the British literati. In \u201cThe Life of John Milton,\u201d a seven-volume work published from 1859 to 1894, the literary critic David Masson conjured \u201cavatar\u201d to anoint poets who embodied the spirit of the time, elevating them into something like gods among men. A century later, the word jumped from writers who captured the spirit of the age to geeks who did the same.The technological use of \u201cavatar\u201d emerged via a spontaneous burst of coinages in the late 1980s and early \u201990s, at the dawn of personal computing. It appeared in the video game Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar in 1985; the dial-up computer community Habitat in 1986; the tabletop role-playing game Shadowrun in 1989; and Neal Stephenson\u2019s breakout novel, \u201cSnow Crash,\u201d in 1992, about a futuristic, anarcho-capitalist Los Angeles in which people projected themselves into a virtual public square called the Metaverse.The coincidence of a bunch of American video-game, fantasy and science-fiction authors cribbing from Hinduism 101 speaks to the need to describe a truly novel phenomenon. But it also hints at a similar worldview among the men \u2014 and they were all men \u2014 who came to define it. As Stephenson told me, \u201cThat was a time when people had more idealistic notions of what digital technology was going to do for us, sometimes bordering on the mystical.\u201d For socially marginalized science-fiction fans and computer geeks, the virtual world could help people enjoy a level of social status and acceptance they lacked at home. Using a computer granted them a level of godlike power, because they had skills most people lacked. In advertisements for Habitat, the early online community was billed as a \u201cplace full of drama and adventure,\u201d where each user could seize the rare opportunity to \u201creflect his real self-image, from toe to head.\u201d A player could literally snap off his avatar\u2019s head and pop a new one on.The technological co-opting of the word replicated the power dynamic in the original avatar myth \u2014 the avatar helps a higher being interact with a lesser realm, one he or she controls. But it also retained the idea of the avatar\u2019s task of delivering righteousness to a lawless world. Richard Garriott, creator of the Ultima games, said he came across the Hindu concept while looking for a way to encourage moral behavior in gaming. He was disturbed by players who took the easiest possible route to win the game. \u201cThey weren\u2019t acting like heroes,\u201d Garriott told me. \u201cThey would kill all the local villagers if it meant gaining enough power to kill the bad guy.\u201d So Garriott started framing his hero as an \u201cavatar\u201d instead of a \u201ccharacter.\u201d He served players with a personality test to imbue the avatar with the player\u2019s own attributes and build elements of personal accountability into the gameplay. In James Cameron\u2019s 2009 film \u201cAvatar,\u201d another avatar injects human empathy into a virtual interaction. In the film, an ex-Marine sent to colonize the planet Pandora grows to identify with its native people through his occupation of a body that looks and feels like theirs.But if an avatar was once a projection of the human body and human values, as the Internet grew in popularity it was flattened into a mask. It became the standard term for a simple image that accompanied a screen name in a chat room or discussion group. In discrete gaming worlds, value systems were strangely authentic: Everyone was building his or her mini-me in the same system and playing by the same rules. But in the mixed-use spaces of the Internet \u2014 where some people were playing themselves and others were hoping to play tricks \u2014 avatars became ambiguous. Bad actors could sulk under the cover of the Web while they pasted reputation-killing content on a message board or terrifying threats on Twitter. Avatars became tools for stoking chaos instead of enforcing order.When social networking arose, mammoth platforms like Facebook and Linked\u00adIn chose to strip the mask away. The idea of the avatar doesn\u2019t factor into their self-conception, and the word doesn\u2019t appear in their promotional copy. These are \u201cplatforms\u201d with \u201cprofiles\u201d and \u201caccounts.\u201d On Facebook, you\u2019re supposed to just be \u201cyou\u201d \u2014 no particular technological prowess required, and no avatar necessary to translate yourself to the new medium.That\u2019s the new tech fantasy, anyway. But of course, on Facebook, our profile pictures are avatars, too: emblems of our success, our good grooming, our unflap\u00adpable happiness. In fact, proliferating online platforms have prompted us to create more and more conceptions of ourselves to send off into the world. Showing up, looking good, being clever and seeming like you really care in all these different spaces can feel like a video game set to the hardest level, except you only get one life. In Sanskrit, \u201cavatar\u201d is related not only to \u201cdescending\u201d; it also means \u201cto make an appearance.\u201d When that becomes too much, your avatar \u2014 a being who is endlessly malleable \u2014 takes over.Amanda Hess is a David Carr fellow at The New York Times.Advertisement"}

In another, he offered a lengthy tirade on Ms. Tsai\u2019s personal life, noting that her father had had several wives.\u201cAll in all, Tsai Ing-wen has a conspicuous duplicity to her personality and her politicking,\u201d General Wang wrote. \u201cShe is doomed to dwell in this contradiction for a lifetime.\u201dGeneral Wang could not be reached for comment on Wednesday, and a spokesman for Ms. Tsai declined to comment.Throughout her political career, Ms. Tsai, a 59-year-old former law professor, has faced questions about her decision to remain single and not have children. In Chinese society, the pressure to marry can be intense, and families often look down on women who remain single into their late 20s.\u201cIn a traditional society, a woman who never marries would be regarded as less whole,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut in modern society, what marriage provides is also available outside of marriages, isn\u2019t it?\u201dFor many Taiwanese, General Wang\u2019s article reinforced an image of a China out to discredit Taiwan by any means possible.Alain Guilloux, a visiting scholar at City University of Hong Kong, said China\u2019s leaders would have to walk a fine line in dealing with Ms. Tsai.\u201cIf they do attack her personally or engage in character assassination or whatever, they know it might backfire,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have to keep in mind that the vast majority of Taiwanese want the status quo and are asking neither for independence nor for reunification anytime soon.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Zoo\u2019s Killing of Gorilla Holding a Boy Prompts Outrage", "Date": "2016-05-30", "News": "Supported bySpeaking to reporters, Thane Maynard, the zoo\u2019s director, forcefully rejected the second-guessing of what he called \u201cMonday morning quarterbacks\u201d over the decision to kill the gorilla, one of an endangered species, instead of using a tranquilizer dart.\u201cThe child was being dragged around,\u201d Mr. Maynard said. \u201cHis head was banging on concrete. This was not a gentle thing. The child was at risk.\u201dMr. Maynard said a tranquilizer would have taken precious minutes to knock out the western lowland gorilla, weighing more than 420 pounds, while the impact of the dart might have startled him, posing an even graver danger.Mr. Maynard said the animal was capable of crushing a coconut with his hands. The boy was lucky that Harambe had not done so to him, if only out of carelessness, he said, noting that the gorilla had become agitated and disoriented by screams from the crowd.Neither the child nor his mother has been publicly identified. But the boy\u2019s family, in a statement released through a public relations firm, said on Monday that he was doing fine after being treated at a hospital and released on Saturday.\u201cWe are so thankful to the Lord that our child is safe,\u201d the family said. \u201cWe extend our heartfelt thanks for the quick action by the Cincinnati Zoo staff. We know that this was a very difficult decision for them, and that they are grieving the loss of their gorilla.\u201dIn hundreds of comments on the petition, supporters said Harambe, an innocent animal, had not deserved to die.Witnesses at the zoo\u2019s popular Gorilla World enclosure on Saturday said the boy had somehow slipped past its wire and wood barriers, then scurried through brush before falling about 10 feet into a small moat.For about 10 minutes, Harambe held onto the boy, at times standing over him in what appeared to be a protective posture, but at others darting across the moat while yanking the child violently by the ankle. A woman could be heard yelling, \u201cMommy loves you!\u201dOn Monday, Mr. Maynard defended the enclosure\u2019s barriers. He said they had passed regular checks by an accrediting agency and had not been breached since the exhibit opened in 1978.\u201cThe barriers are safe,\u201d he said. \u201cThe barriers exceed any required protocols. The trouble with barriers is that whatever the barrier is, some people can get past it.\u201dAsked by reporters who was then to blame, Mr. Maynard reiterated that the barrier was adequate, then added, \u201cWe all need to work to make sure that our families and our kids are safe, whether you\u2019re visiting the zoo or you\u2019re visiting the shopping mall.\u201dHe repeatedly declined to blame anyone.\u201cI would expect that through the process of a review that we may find that we need to have more stringent protocols related to gorilla enclosures, and that\u2019s the direction we\u2019ll head,\u201d he said.Some people have come to the mother\u2019s defense.Kevin Figueroa Torres, who set up a Facebook page in support of the mother, said he had learned how slippery small boys could be when he helped run a preschool for four years. People do not get that, he said.\u201cIt just bothers me,\u201d Mr. Torres, 23, said in an interview on Monday. \u201cThey\u2019re acting like kids don\u2019t run off, like kids don\u2019t do sneaky stuff like that.\u201dBrittany Nicely was standing nearby on Saturday when the boy fell into the pen. She said it had all happened very fast. The mother, she said, had not been neglectful.\u201cShe had three other kids that she was with. She had a baby in her arms,\u201d said Ms. Nicely, 29, who has two children of her own.The boy had made his move and was in the pen in \u201cthe blink of an eye,\u201d she said.Mr. Maynard said on Monday that the zoo was going through a tough time, but that it had also received plenty of support.\u201cWe\u2019ve heard from thousands of people around the world, colleagues all the way to Jane Goodall, zoo directors from all over the world, with both sympathy and with support for a difficult decision,\u201d he said.Zoo workers gathered early Monday to share stories about Harambe. Some tears were shed, Mr. Maynard said.\u201cWe\u2019re the ones who took the loss on this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t affect anyone as much as it does the people here at the zoo.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Nearly three months after Mr. Trump won the primaries in New Hampshire and South Carolina, if he wins on Tuesday night, he could effectively lock in a path toward achieving the 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the nomination by the beginning of June. Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main remaining rival, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, has described Indiana as a crucial state. He has maintained that there is still a path forward even with a loss, as most public polls suggest is likely, and he has vowed to keep going until California votes on June 7. But even Mr. Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s allies acknowledge that a loss would effectively obliterate any remaining path.The anti-Trump forces, which once roared loudly, appear to be petering out. For the most part, groups opposed to Mr. Trump did not start buying television airtime to run ads against him in the relatively cheap Indiana markets until the last two weeks, giving him room to make a push with voters at a string of rallies in the last few days. A win in a state with a more conservative electorate, whose governor endorsed Mr. Cruz, would allow Mr. Trump to look toward the convention and leave his mark as planning gets underway now, and for the general election. As for the Democrats, Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont appear to be in a closer contest. Mr. Sanders, despite laying off hundreds of campaign workers and facing a substantial delegate gap, might feel emboldened by a win. Still, Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s path is also essentially gone, short of a vast amount of support from the superdelegates whose backing he once frowned on.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

The Soviet Union seized the islands at the end of the war. There were 17,000 Japanese living there at the time; today, there are 30,000 Russians.The dispute is not just a matter of national pride. Control of the islands means gaining access to fish-rich waters and oil and gas fields.Japanese people migrated to the islands in the 18th century, and an 1855 treaty gave Japan ownership of the four southern islands and Russia everything that lay north.The 1951 San Francisco Peace Treaty, which formally ended World War II, didn\u2019t clearly establish ownership of the four islands.The informal talks are not expected to bring a peace accord to formally end their World War II hostilities right away.

{"Headline": "Sandy Weill\u2019s Wine Country Retirement, With Notes of Rue and Chagrin", "Date": "2016-05-18", "News": "Supported bySONOMA, Calif. \u2014 Sanford I. Weill, who built Citigroup into a too-big-to-fail colossus and dominated the New York charity and social circuit more than a decade ago, lately can be found relaxed in jeans attending local wine country social events or riding his John Deere farm utility vehicle across his property to visit the neighbors.Mr. Weill, a quintessential Brooklyn native, and his wife, Joan, have decamped for Sonoma, where the rolling sun-dappled hills are often compared to Italy\u2019s Tuscany region. The Weills spend more than half of their time here now, far from Wall Street\u2019s high-octane environment \u2014 and its critical onlookers.Of course, parts of Mr. Weill\u2019s new life still look similar to his old one back East.On the lawn of his 360-acre hilltop estate, named Casa Rosa, sit two stainless steel sculptures of roses, each more than 20 feet tall, by the New York artist Will Ryman. Mr. Weill bought them after noticing them in 2011, when they were part of a public art installation adorning Park Avenue.The couple\u2019s Manhattan-based interior designer, Mica Ertegun, updated the Sonoma estate\u2019s 11,600-square-foot mansion, which they bought in 2010 for $30 million. The property includes a vineyard that produces syrah under the \u201cWeill a Way\u201d label. And Mr. Weill arranged for Breguet, whose $23,600 wristwatches he wears, to become the official timepiece of a concert hall named after the Weills at nearby Sonoma State University, a project he helped finish with a $12 million donation in 2011.\u201cI think he kind of enjoys it out here. Probably he finds it a bit more of a quieter lifestyle than the hustle and bustle of the city,\u201d said Leslie Vadasz, a retired Intel executive whose 200-acre estate is next door to Casa Rosa. The two have become friendly, but there are some topics that are still off limits, it seems.\u201cIn a way, he was quite a pioneer on Wall Street,\u201d Mr. Vadasz said in a recent interview, seated in the spacious living room of his own hillside mansion. \u201cBut when I mentioned it, either Sandy or Joan said, \u2018Look what happened.\u2019 He was not particularly happy about it.\u201d Mr. Weill does not appear to enjoy discussing the topic, Mr. Vadasz added. \u201cThere are subjects that I don\u2019t poke at and he doesn\u2019t volunteer.\u201dIn an interview in an office he keeps in New York, where he still spends a quarter of his time, Mr. Weill acknowledged that the fate of Citigroup, and the role of giant banks in the financial crisis of 2008, do not get discussed much out West.Explaining the couple\u2019s move, Mr. Weill said, \u201cThe two most interesting places in the U.S. are New York City and the Bay Area, and we spent more than 50 years of our married life in New York.\u201d He added that the draws to the San Francisco Bay Area are the exciting innovation and entrepreneurship there, as well as the weather, the food and wine, and the lack of concrete.In recent years, the couple has retired from board leadership roles at three New York institutions they continue to back: Weill Cornell medical school, Carnegie Hall and the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. But until the latest gift was announced, few New Yorkers familiar with Mr. Weill\u2019s storied Wall Street history knew that they had moved.In his heyday in the 1990s, Mr. Weill was \u201ca Sun King \u2014 one of the most powerful and successful financial individuals in New York,\u201d said Roy Smith, a finance professor at New York University business school. Mr. Weill gained that status as a deal maker, with a series of ever-larger mergers culminating with Citicorp and the Travelers Group forming the behemoth Citigroup in 1998. The last deal helped knock down the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act, which separated banking from the riskier securities business.But then he and Citigroup suffered a series of setbacks. He stepped down as Citigroup\u2019s chief executive in 2003, a few months after a bruising regulatory probe of biased Wall Street research uncovered his personal efforts to get the star telecommunications analyst Jack Grubman to reconsider a tepid neutral rating on AT&T stock at a time when AT&T\u2019s chief executive was a Citigroup director; though Mr. Weill was not charged, Citigroup paid the largest fine of any Wall Street company.And he and Citigroup were cited as contributors to the 2008 financial crisis by Time magazine and the Oscar-winning documentary \u201cInside Job.\u201d Knocking down Glass-Steagall helped spawn \u201cswollen banks\u201d that \u201care now one of the country\u2019s major economic problems,\u201d Time said, noting that Citigroup itself required multiple government rescues costing $45 billion. In 2010 testimony before a congressional panel investigating the meltdown, Mr. Weill minimized the role of Glass-Steagall\u2019s repeal, saying it \u201chad nothing to do with the financial crisis.\u201dWhen he retired as Citigroup chairman in 2006, Mr. Weill held 16.6 million Citigroup shares, then worth $768 million. At his peak in 2007, Forbes listed his net worth at $1.8 billion. But the stock lost more than 90 percent of its value after his handpicked successor allowed Citigroup to build up a huge exposure to toxic subprime assets.Sensitive to his image, cultivated through business success, philanthropy and a penchant for putting the Weill name on buildings and institutions, Mr. Weill \u201cmay feel somewhat diminished,\u201d said Mr. Smith of N.Y.U. But Mr. Weill says New York \u201ccontinues to be very welcoming to us.\u201d And he disputed suggestions advanced by two friends in interviews that the move west was motivated partly to get away from \u201call the noise around Citi.\u201dMike Conway, Mr. Weill\u2019s chief of staff, said, \u201cThe Weills are not running away from anything. They are just trying to expand their horizons.\u201dMs. Weill said the couple often enjoyed time they spent on business trips to Carmel, Calif., and once considered buying \u201ca pink house\u201d there but decided it would be \u201ca pain in the neck\u201d to get back and forth while he was still working full time. The idea of the Bay Area came back in mid-2010 during a trip to Napa Valley. She recalls saying, \u201cGee, it\u2019s really nice here. Maybe we should think about this.\u201dIn 2011, Mr. Weill sold his 10-room apartment at 15 Central Park West for $88 million. In 2012, he sold a 200-foot yacht for about $50 million. He has held on to a 12-room mansion in Greenwich, Conn., plus spreads in the Adirondacks and Bahamas. But nowadays, friends say, when he spends the night in Manhattan, he usually stays at a hotel.Sonoma, population 11,000 and situated 40 miles north of San Francisco, stands apart from Silicon Valley to the south, which teems with venture capital investors, start-ups and technology juggernauts like Apple and Facebook. The Weill estate is a few miles to the west of town, reachable via roads dotted with rusting pickup trucks, a Jack in the Box fast-food franchise and a furniture consignment store.Going to California helped Mr. Weill \u201crestart the clock,\u201d said Mr. Banga, who hosted an informal 83rd birthday celebration for Mr. Weill in March at a New York restaurant. \u201cHe\u2019s a good guy. He\u2019s gone through a lot, good and bad. I\u2019ve heard him say you have to go through bad experiences to learn how to handle them and come out of them so you can better deal with the good times.\u201dMichael de la Merced contributed reportingAdvertisement"}

From my Sydney hotel window I gaze at an urban landscape similarly transformed. I watch joggers at water\u2019s edge. They wear the same gear. They use the same devices. They are into wellness in the same way.I lose myself in the silvery play of moonlight on water. Where on earth am I? I have traveled a long way through time zones over a vast ocean to find myself in the same place. My Twitter feed looks the same. My Facebook friends have not changed. My little universe with all its little excitements and aggravations is still at my fingertips. My bills are maddeningly accessible. Through an immense displacement nothing has been left behind.

But today\u2019s trap, fashioned through technology, is of a different nature. The homogenization of experience is also an insidious invitation to conform.Experience, like journalism, withers without immersion in place. At some level, the truly lived moment involves the ability to get lost \u2014 lost in a conversation, or in the back alleys or Naples, or in silence, or in the scents and inflections of a new city. There is no greater thrill than being lost in this way because self is left behind, a form of liberation.Yet a world is taking form that wants you never to be lost, never to feel displaced, never to be unanchored, never to be unable to photograph yourself, never to stand in awe before mystery, never to exit your safety zone (or only in managed fashion), never to leave your life behind: a world where you travel for 24 hours to your point of departure.How reassuring! How desperate!There may be no choice but to head for the Outback, the vast and empty interior of this continent-sized land where everyone hugs the coast, or perhaps eat Vegemite, apparently a singular experience. I will keep you posted, dear reader, should I survive either.At least Australians speak a different language. A colleague tells me to \u201csing out\u201d if I need something. A problem is met with the reassuring \u201cShe\u2019ll be right.\u201d She? Who? I am asked if \u201cthere\u2019s anything else I can get you, AT ALL.\u201d I eat brekkie. Those joggers, apparently, are on a footpath, not a sidewalk, and if I need gas when I head for the Outback I\u2019ll find it at the \u201cservo.\u201d Every sentence seems to end with a kind of upward-rising lilt that turns it into a half-question to which I have no answer.So I am somewhere else after all. Surely I am. I wake at night, sleep by day, and find myself altogether lost in translation.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. Policy Puts Iran Deal at Risk", "Date": "2016-05-06", "News": "Supported byPerhaps nothing is more important to President Obama\u2019s foreign policy legacy than the success of the Iran nuclear deal. It bears his personal imprimatur and will stand or fall on whether it prevents Iran from producing a bomb over the 15-year term of the agreement and beyond.If an Iranian hard-liner returns to power in the presidential election next year, replacing President Hassan Rouhani, the likelihood of the deal unraveling will increase. The balance between the reformist Rouhani and the hawkish Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei produced the political conditions in which the accord became possible.But today America is undermining that balance, reinforcing Iranian hawks and putting the hard-won deal that reversed Iran\u2019s steady advance to the nuclear threshold at risk. It\u2019s a shoot-yourself-in-the-foot policy after a major diplomatic achievement.The growing cry in Tehran is that Rouhani and his foreign minister Javad Zarif were had by Washington because Iranian concessions \u2014 the slashing of the number of centrifuges and its uranium stockpile \u2014 have not produced promised economic benefits. Hard-liners are baying: \u201cWhere\u2019s the beef?\u201dThe chief problem is that European banks are terrified that if they provide financing to Iran they will fall foul of United States sanctions that are still in place. Many of these banks \u2014 including BNP Paribas, Commerzbank and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u2013 have paid hefty fines in recent years. In all, European banks have handed over more than $15 billion since 2012 for infringement of U.S. financial sanctions on Iran. From a risk-reward standpoint no European bank can make enough revenue in Iran to offset the possibility of being slapped with a big fine.Secretary of State John Kerry attempted to break the logjam last month by saying that, \u201cWe have no objection and we do not stand in the way of foreign banks engaging with Iranian banks and companies, obviously as long as those banks and companies are not on our sanctions list for non-nuclear reasons.\u201dBut the ownership structure of Iranian corporations is often opaque, making it difficult for European companies to be sure there is not, for example, a Revolutionary Guard Corps interest. Knowing exactly who the customer is may be arduous.One international businessman based in Tehran told me he\u2019d received a letter from United Against Nuclear Iran, an American advocacy organization, warning him that he might be working with the Revolutionary Guards and could get into trouble. \u201cYou can be sure that letter is going to all the European banks,\u201d he said.Most international transactions are dollar-denominated, so they have to transit the U.S. banking system before being settled. Because the U.S. trade embargo on Iran remains in place, making it illegal, with limited exceptions, for Americans or American companies to deal with Iran or its government, this is very problematic. A bank may be located in Europe but unable to demonstrate that a proposed Iran contract does not involve its United States subsidiary at some level.In an e-mail, Hamid Biglari, an international financier and a former vice-chairman at Citigroup, wrote: \u201cWe\u2019ve turned what should have been a win-win opportunity for greater engagement into a lose-lose outcome where neither Iran can truly benefit nor American firms can compete on a level international playing field.\u201dIn an earlier conversation, Biglari told me, \u201cThe irony of the nuclear deal is that we did the heavy lifting in terms of the negotiation and then opened it up to European companies to do business with Iran\u201d while blocking American firms.Airbus has already concluded multi-billion dollar deal with Iran, but in general the Iranian market remains fraught with obstacles.Short of lifting the U.S. trade embargo \u2014 which would make political sense because nothing will undermine the Revolutionary Guards and the hard-liners faster than a more open and competitive Iranian economy where IRGC monopolies are eliminated \u2014 there are steps that should be taken as fast as possible. (Opposition in Congress makes an end to the embargo inconceivable.)On the American side, Kerry needs to keep pressing his message encouraging European banks. The Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) needs to be aggressive in granting licenses of the kind that has enabled Boeing to hold talks with Iran. Technocrats need to come up with a way to insulate from potential fines Iranian transactions by European banks that involve \u201cround-trip\u201d dollar clearing.Iran, in turn, must bring their banks up to international compliance standards when it comes to money laundering. Opaque ownership structures need to be cleared up so that European companies know whom they are dealing with. Iranian transparency is an oxymoron right now. That has to change.The next Iranian presidential election is in June 2017. If Rouhani has nothing to show by then for his nuclear diplomacy, his chances of gaining a second term will be slim. That in turn will put Obama\u2019s biggest foreign policy achievement at risk.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Facebook Warps Our Worlds", "Date": "2016-05-21", "News": "Supported byTHOSE who\u2019ve been raising alarms about Facebook are right: Almost every minute that we spend on our smartphones and tablets and laptops, thumbing through favorite websites and scrolling through personalized feeds, we\u2019re pointed toward foregone conclusions. We\u2019re pressured to conform.But unseen puppet masters on Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s payroll aren\u2019t to blame. We\u2019re the real culprits. When it comes to elevating one perspective above all others and herding people into culturally and ideologically inflexible tribes, nothing that Facebook does to us comes close to what we do to ourselves.\u201cAnd one of the things we want is to spend more time with people who think like us and less with people who are different,\u201d Haidt added. \u201cThe Facebook effect isn\u2019t trivial. But it\u2019s catalyzing or amplifying a tendency that was already there.\u201dBy \u201cthe Facebook effect\u201d he didn\u2019t mean the possibility, discussed extensively over recent weeks, that Facebook manipulates its menu of \u201ctrending\u201d news to emphasize liberal views and sources. That menu is just one facet of Facebook.More prevalent for many users are the posts we see from friends and from other people and groups we follow on the network, and this information is utterly contingent on choices we ourselves make. If we seek out, \u201clike\u201d and comment on angry missives from Bernie Sanders supporters, we\u2019ll be confronted with more angry missives from more Sanders supporters. If we banish such outbursts, those dispatches disappear.That\u2019s the crucial dynamic, algorithm or whatever you want to call it. That\u2019s the trap and curse of our lives online.The Internet isn\u2019t rigged to give us right or left, conservative or liberal \u2014 at least not until we rig it that way. It\u2019s designed to give us more of the same, whatever that same is: one sustained note from the vast and varied music that it holds, one redundant fragrance from a garden of infinite possibility.A few years back I bought some scented shower gel from Jo Malone. I made the purchase through the company\u2019s website. For months afterward, as I toggled through cyberspace, Jo Malone stalked me, always on my digital heels, forever in a corner of my screen, a Jo Malone candle here, a Jo Malone cologne over there. I\u2019d been profiled and pigeonholed: fan of Jo Malone. Sure, I could choose from woody, citrus, floral and even fruity, but there was no Aramis in my aromatic ecosphere, and I was steered clear of Old Spice.So it goes with the fiction we read, the movies we watch, the music we listen to and, scarily, the ideas we subscribe to. They\u2019re not challenged. They\u2019re validated and reinforced. By bookmarking given blogs and personalizing social-media feeds, we customize the news we consume and the political beliefs we\u2019re exposed to as never before. And this colors our days, or rather bleeds them of color, reducing them to a single hue.We construct precisely contoured echo chambers of affirmation that turn conviction into zeal, passion into fury, disagreements with the other side into the demonization of it. Then we marvel at the Twitter mobs that swarm in defense of Sanders or the surreal success of Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy, whose historical tagline may well be \u201cAll I know is what\u2019s on the Internet.\u201dThose were his exact words, a blithe excuse for his mistaken assertion that a protester at one of his rallies had ties to Islamic extremists. He\u2019d seen a video somewhere. He\u2019d chosen to take it at face value. His intelligence wasn\u2019t and isn\u2019t vetted but viral \u2014 and conveniently suited to his argument and needs. With a creative or credulous enough Google search, a self-serving \u201ctruth\u201d can always be found, along with a passel of supposed experts to vouch for it and a clique of fellow disciples.Carnival barkers, conspiracy theories, willful bias and nasty partisanship aren\u2019t anything new, and they haven\u2019t reached unprecedented heights today. But what\u2019s remarkable and sort of heartbreaking is the way they\u2019re fed by what should be strides in our ability to educate ourselves. The proliferation of cable television networks and growth of the Internet promised to expand our worlds, not shrink them. Instead they\u2019ve enhanced the speed and thoroughness with which we retreat into enclaves of the like-minded.But there\u2019s no argument that in an era that teems with choice, brims with niche marketing and exalts individualism to the extent that ours does, we\u2019re sorting ourselves with a chillingly ruthless efficiency. We\u2019ve surrendered universal points of reference. We\u2019ve lost common ground.We\u2019re less committed to, and trustful of, large institutions than we were at times in the past. We question their wisdom and substitute it with the groupthink of micro-communities, many of which we\u2019ve formed online, and their sensibilities can be more peculiar and unforgiving.Facebook, along with other social media, definitely conspires in this. Haidt noted that it often discourages dissent within a cluster of friends by accelerating shaming. He pointed to the enforced political correctness among students at many colleges.\u201cFacebook allows people to react to each other so quickly that they are really afraid to step out of line,\u201d he said.But that\u2019s not about a lopsided news feed. It\u2019s not about some sorcerer\u2019s algorithm. It\u2019s about a tribalism that has existed for as long as humankind has and is now rooted in the fertile soil of the Internet, which is coaxing it toward a full and insidious flower.An earlier version of this article misstated a word in a quote by Jonathan Haidt. Mr. Haidt said the Facebook effect was \u201ccatalyzing or amplifying\u201d a tendency already there (not \u201cmetabolizing or amplifying\u201d).Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Transgender Bathroom Debate Turns Personal at a Vermont High School", "Date": "2016-05-17", "News": "Supported byCHESTER, Vt. \u2014 The way A J Jackson tells it, he kept his head ducked down and pretended to fiddle with his cellphone as he walked into the boys\u2019 bathroom and headed for a stall at Green Mountain Union High School here.But the way some of his classmates see it, A J was still Autumn Jackson, a girl in boys\u2019 clothing, who had violated an intimate sanctum, while two boys were standing at a urinal, their private parts exposed.\u201cIt\u2019s like me going into a girls\u2019 bathroom wearing a wig,\u201d Tanner Bischofberger, 15, a classmate of A J Jackson\u2019s, who was not one of those in the bathroom, said this week. \u201cIt\u2019s just weird.\u201dBut this week, there was a counterprotest by students like Mr. Bischofberger wearing T-shirts showing the male and female figures commonly used to label bathrooms, over the words \u201cStraight Pride.\u201dAnd the dispute has driven apart young people who grew up together and were once friends.Some say the new rule opens the door to sexual predators disguised as someone they are not. Others say it just violates tradition. A society has rules for a reason, and this is one of those rules, that\u2019s just the way it is, they say.That idea of a minority\u2019s ruling unfairly is what motivated the father of one student to order the \u201cStraight Pride\u201d T-shirts online last week and send them to school with his daughter, who declined to be interviewed.The T-shirt-wearing students say gay people are being celebrated at the expense of straight people.\u201cI just want to be clear: I accept everybody being proud,\u201d said Daniel Baldwin, a 17-year-old junior. Sitting at a table in the school hallway, a copy of \u201cThe Catcher in the Rye\u201d open in front of him, he wore a \u201cStraight Pride\u201d shirt pulled over a shirt dedicated to Slayer, a thrash-metal band. \u201cEverybody has the right to be who they are.\u201dMr. Baldwin said he thought people should use male or female bathrooms depending on what was written on their birth certificates. But he also said he would defend A J if someone tried to bully him for being transgender, or even for using the boys\u2019 bathroom. \u201cI would step up for A J,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re Americans. We\u2019re supposed to be civil.\u201dListening to him, Mr. Jackson said he was dismayed by how they had been torn apart. \u201cOh, my God, we used to talk for hours about music,\u201d he said.More broadly, the issue here has pitted resident against resident, often along social and economic lines. This is a place where big-city transplants wearing Birkenstocks and artsy jewelry mingle with working-class people in dirt-encrusted boots who know how to handle a shotgun and proudly inhabit the homes of their ancestors. Despite Vermont\u2019s image as a place of bucolic egalitarianism, home of the avowedly socialist candidate for president, tensions over privilege and tradition simmer just under the surface, and the bathroom wars have brought them to the fore.\u201cI go in and do my thing and leave, but I have a concern about child molesters and pedophiles,\u201d Joe Kopacz, 48, who runs a rock-crushing operation, said as he stopped into Lisai\u2019s Chester Market.Society does not change on a dime, especially small-town society, said Deb Brown, a member of the Green Mountain Union High School board, speaking in MacLaomainn\u2019s, a pub and popular gathering spot that she owns with her husband. For people like her daughter, who was on girls\u2019 sports teams with A J when he was Autumn, this is intensely personal, not just philosophical.\u201cAs we move forward as a community, there has to be compassion on both sides,\u201d Ms. Brown said. \u201cHe needs to understand that this has been 15 years that students have known him one way. It\u2019s obviously his choice, but maybe he should have respect for his classmates right now.\u201dMr. Jackson has gradually been making the transition from a vivacious girl with a big smile and long wavy locks to a husky boy with chopped hair dyed several shades of green, snakebite piercings in his lips and gauges embedded in his earlobes. His chest is visibly bound, and because he has not yet started taking male hormones \u2014 he plans to do that, and also to have \u201ctop surgery,\u201d he says \u2014 his face is smooth and still has feminine contours. He once thought he was lesbian, and is still attracted to girls.His mother, Tracy, a case manager for children with developmental disabilities, and his father, Scott, a mechanical engineer, came to Vermont from Connecticut to try it out 20 years ago and stayed. They brought up A J and his older brother in a log cabin in the woods, where they raise chickens and ducks, including a duck named Bernie, for you know who.\u201cA typical American family,\u201d his mother said, smiling.He was in sixth grade when he realized he was meant to be a boy, he said, and came out to the school last year in ninth grade, sending emails to teachers. When he entered Green Mountain in seventh grade, \u201cI was using the female bathroom because, I really don\u2019t know, I was still kind of back and forth about my identity,\u201d Mr. Jackson said. \u201cThis year is the year I started using the men\u2019s bathroom, because I already felt like way more comfortable in who I was.\u201dThere were practical issues. When he had his period, he wondered if he should revert to the girls\u2019 bathroom, because there was no place to throw away his used tampons. But he had started feeling like an intruder in the girls\u2019 bathroom, and the single bathrooms were so far out of the way it was hard to get to class on time.So he stuck with the boys\u2019 bathroom.\u201cI use a stall, and I wait till everybody\u2019s gone to get up and leave,\u201d Mr. Jackson said. \u201cThe guys, they look at me like I\u2019m some kind of freak, or they\u2019re concerned or scared.\u201dThe only classmate who talks to him when he sees him in the bathroom is his childhood friend Connor Rose, a leader of the school\u2019s gay-straight alliance.Mr. Jackson feels safe in the boys\u2019 bathroom at school, he said, whereas in public places, like Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, he is afraid to go to the men\u2019s restroom for fear of being attacked by straight men.He said he understood the concerns of some of his classmates.\u201cThere probably are some transgender people that are bad people, just like there are probably a whole bunch of gay people or straight people that are bad,\u201d he said.He had been using the boys\u2019 bathrooms for less than a month \u2014 trying to go in during lunch or recess when he would not be noticed \u2014 when someone complained. No one knows for sure who complained, but a widespread rumor holds that it was a middle schooler.Hank Mauti, a school board member and retired sawmill worker from Andover, said he wondered why Mr. Jackson would feel compelled to use a boys\u2019 bathroom when there were six single-use gender-neutral bathrooms in the school.\u201cWhat about the little boy that reported it?\u201d asked Mr. Mauti\u2019s wife, Wanda, repeating the rumor, in an interview in their home, under a trophy of a moose that Mr. Mauti shot. \u201cAs far as I can tell, his discomfort hasn\u2019t been addressed.\u201dTom Ferenc, the principal, called Mr. Jackson\u2019s mother the night of the complaint and told her that he was going to ask A J to use the gender-neutral bathroom, she recalled. The next Monday, A J and about 30 supporters walked out of the school in protest. Three days later, the district announced the new policy.Mr. Ferenc was happy to get some \u201cclarity\u201d about the proper policy, as he put it, and proud of his school. \u201cIt reminded me of Rosa Parks, honestly,\u201d he said.Besides the \u201cStraight Pride\u201d T-shirt counterprotest, the decision has set off a storm of discussion, sometimes nasty on both sides, on Facebook. Also, someone taped a sign to a trash can this week that said, \u201cReserved for Mariah and Tanner,\u201d referring to Mariah Lique and Mr. Bischofberger, two student leaders of the counterprotest, who are dating.Ms. Lique said that she and Mr. Bischofberger were just saying what a lot of other students think but are afraid to say because if they did, \u201cyou\u2019d get hated.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re considered more conservative,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause we\u2019re outspoken,\u201d Mr. Bischofberger interjected, finishing her sentence.Two of their favorite teachers are openly gay, they said, and the students misunderstand where they are coming from. \u201cThey see us as \u2026\u201d Mr. Bischofberger began, \u201chating their sexuality,\u201d Ms. Lique finished.But that is not true, they said. Part of what troubles them is that Mr. Jackson is still anatomically female. \u201cAutumn, A J, whatever you call them, hasn\u2019t had any hormone or sex change yet,\u201d Mr. Bischofberger said. \u201cThis opens up opportunities for other kids to do stuff they\u2019re not supposed to.\u201dWhile everyone seems to sympathize with the gay students, they seem to have a license to make him feel ostracized and attacked, and it hurts, Mr. Bischofberger said: \u201cThey\u2019re calling me a cisgendered, hypocritical homophobe.\u201dJack Begg contributed research.Advertisement"}

Although the company used social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook to promote its content, none of it was available online.Circulation reportedly fell from around 150,000 copies a day in early March to as low as 30,000 by last month. Although it had initially shunned subscriptions, The New Day experimented with a paid \u201ce-edition\u201d via a mobile app in mid-April, but that failed to generate significant sales, Ms. Holloway said.Analysts said the main challenge for The New Day was changing the habits of readers, who have become used to a cornucopia of free content online, as well as the convenience of being able to read it on mobile phones and other devices.In the end, Ms. Holloway said, \u201cit proved too big of an ask to get a critical mass of people to change their behavior frequently enough to make it viable.\u201dNick Tjaardstra, a deputy director of the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers in Frankfurt, described The New Day as a \u201cbrave mass-market pitch,\u201d but he stopped short of saying that its failure pointed to the inevitable demise of print.\u201cU.K. papers like The Mail and The Telegraph that have a clearly defined audience, which has not yet fully migrated to other channels, will continue to sustain very attractive, albeit slowly declining, profits\u201d from print products, Mr. Tjaardstra said in an email, referring to two major daily British newspapers with high circulations.He added, \u201cThe interesting takeaway from New Day is that they probably saw the venture as much less risky than a digital-only pitch where their content would have had no paid value and digital ad revenue would have been low without scale or targeting.\u201dAdvertisement"}

While these algorithms also use data, math and computation, they are a fountain of bias and slants \u2014 of a new kind.If a bridge sways and falls, we can diagnose that as a failure, fault the engineering, and try to do better next time. If Google shows you these 11 results instead of those 11, or if a hiring algorithm puts this person\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 at the top of a file and not that one, who is to definitively say what is correct, and what is wrong? Without laws of nature to anchor them, algorithms used in such subjective decision making can never be truly neutral, objective or scientific.Programmers do not, and often cannot, predict what their complex programs will do. Google\u2019s Internet services are billions of lines of code. Once these algorithms with an enormous number of moving parts are set loose, they then interact with the world, and learn and react. The consequences aren\u2019t easily predictable.Our computational methods are also getting more enigmatic. Machine learning is a rapidly spreading technique that allows computers to independently learn to learn \u2014 almost as we do as humans \u2014 by churning through the copious disorganized data, including data we generate in digital environments.However, while we now know how to make machines learn, we don\u2019t really know what exact knowledge they have gained. If we did, we wouldn\u2019t need them to learn things themselves: We\u2019d just program the method directly.With algorithms, we don\u2019t have an engineering breakthrough that\u2019s making life more precise, but billions of semi-savant mini-Frankensteins, often with narrow but deep expertise that we no longer understand, spitting out answers here and there to questions we can\u2019t judge just by numbers, all under the cloak of objectivity and science.If these algorithms are not scientifically computing answers to questions with objective right answers, what are they doing? Mostly, they \u201coptimize\u201d output to parameters the company chooses, crucially, under conditions also shaped by the company. On Facebook the goal is to maximize the amount of engagement you have with the site and keep the site ad-friendly. You can easily click on \u201clike,\u201d for example, but there is not yet a \u201cthis was a challenging but important story\u201d button.This setup, rather than the hidden personal beliefs of programmers, is where the thorny biases creep into algorithms, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s perfectly plausible for Facebook\u2019s work force to be liberal, and yet for the site to be a powerful conduit for conservative ideas as well as conspiracy theories and hoaxes \u2014 along with upbeat stories and weighty debates. Indeed, on Facebook, Donald J. Trump fares better than any other candidate, and anti-vaccination theories like those peddled by Mr. Beck easily go viral.The newsfeed algorithm also values comments and sharing. All this suits content designed to generate either a sense of oversize delight or righteous outrage and go viral, hoaxes and conspiracies as well as baby pictures, happy announcements (that can be liked) and important news and discussions. Facebook\u2019s own research shows that the choices its algorithm makes can influence people\u2019s mood and even affect elections by shaping turnout.Software giants would like us to believe their algorithms are objective and neutral, so they can avoid responsibility for their enormous power as gatekeepers while maintaining as large an audience as possible. Of course, traditional media organizations face similar pressures to grow audiences and host ads. At least, though, consumers know that the news media is not produced in some \u201cneutral\u201d way or above criticism, and a whole network \u2014 from media watchdogs to public editors \u2014 tries to hold those institutions accountable.The first step forward is for Facebook, and anyone who uses algorithms in subjective decision making, to drop the pretense that they are neutral. Even Google, whose powerful ranking algorithm can decide the fate of companies, or politicians, by changing search results, defines its search algorithms as \u201ccomputer programs that look for clues to give you back exactly what you want.\u201dBut this is not just about what we want. What we are shown is shaped by these algorithms, which are shaped by what the companies want from us, and there is nothing neutral about that.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook, Facing Bias Claims, Shows How Editors and Algorithms Guide News", "Date": "2016-05-12", "News": "Supported byFacebook describes a list of processes it uses to display some of the most popular content across the network, including relying on algorithms to detect up-and-coming news trends as well as a team of editors who, much like a newsroom, direct how those topics are presented and decide what should be displayed to people who regularly use the service.As the guidelines make clear, at practically every point in the process, a human editor is given the leeway to exercise his or her editorial influence.Since those claims surfaced, Facebook has been questioned by news sites across the political spectrum and by legislators in Washington. On Thursday, critics urged the company to consider the biases of its editors.\u201cAs long as Facebook is hiring editors who lean left politically, those stories are going to get preferential treatment,\u201d Erick Erickson, former editor in chief of the conservative website RedState and founder of another conservative site called The Resurgent, said in an email. \u201cI\u2019d hope that Facebook would take care to consider all views and all news.\u201dThe company has continued to deny accusations of political bias and pointed to editorial rules that discourage Trending Topics staff members from taking one viewpoint or another.As Facebook has noted several times this week, algorithms drive much of the decision-making for its Trending Topics, according to the documents. And the company said it has not found evidence that any editor intentionally manipulated the section to suppress conservative content.But the guidelines, which have never before been made public, give insight into how editors guide and discover news items being shared widely across the social network, and how those editors decide what to promote inside the Trending Topics section.While algorithms determine the exact mix of topics displayed to each person, based on that user\u2019s past actions on Facebook, a team of people is largely responsible for the overall mix of which topics should \u2014 and more important, should not \u2014 be shown in Trending Topics.For instance, after algorithms detect early signs of popular stories on the network, editors are asked to cross-reference potential trending topics with a list of 10 major news publications, including CNN, Fox News, The Guardian and The New York Times.Editors are also entrusted to spot potentially large news stories bubbling up outside Facebook by using an algorithm that trawls more than a thousand automated feeds, up to and including competitors like YouTube and Reddit, along with traditional news sites.These editors can then introduce those trends into the Topics box, in order to \u201cconnect people to conversations on Facebook about newsworthy events as quickly as possible,\u201d according to Facebook.One former Facebook Trending Topics editor, who spoke under condition of anonymity because this person had signed a nondisclosure agreement with the company, said it was up to the editors\u2019 discretion to promote newsy topics that were not quite percolating on Facebook.The guidelines were first created in 2014, according to a Facebook spokeswoman, and have continuously been updated over the last year and a half.Facebook said it planned to address Senator Thune\u2019s questions, and that it was \u201ccontinuing to investigate whether any violations took place.\u201d\u201cImagine going back in time to the 1950s and building a machine-learning algorithm, based on historical data at the time, to decide who would be \u2018successful\u2019 in their jobs,\u201d said Cathy O\u2019Neil, a data scientist and author of the forthcoming book \u201cWeapons of Math Destruction,\u201d a study of how algorithms exacerbate inequality. \u201cIt would be only white men, because the data it had was picking up the sexism and racism of the time, and the data was informing the definition of success.\u201dFacebook\u2019s stance, as it made clear on Thursday, is that the best way to handle these issues is with a mix of both human and machine input.Nick Corasaniti contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Reassessment, 24 Years in the Making", "Date": "2016-05-06", "News": "Supported byVowsMarilyn Snell craved time to herself in the summer of 2012 so that she could take stock of the emotional losses enveloping her life in San Francisco.She found that time on the Greek island of Kythira, at a friend\u2019s early-19th-century home. There, she stayed in a room that was once a bakery, white-walled with a curved ceiling and a fireplace that had served as the bakery oven.A close friend and co-worker had died of cancer in 2010, after months of her caring for him. She was still struggling with sadness and the lessons he had taught her about death and human connections. Her mother, too, needed care during that time after two open-heart surgeries.\u201cI was in a moment where I needed to survive, and figure things out,\u201d said Ms. Snell, now 57 and a freelance environmental journalist.Long single, she favored solitude. Yet, alone in that white space and remembering her late friend\u2019s belief in the lasting strength of relationships, she concluded, \u201cI needed to think of unfinished beginnings and set miscommunications straight.\u201dAt the top on that list was Gregory Williams, a man with whom she had had a relationship until he broke it off 24 years earlier. She knew nothing about his life since then other than that he had married.Before departing for Greece, she had attempted to reach out to him through Facebook. His response to her inquiry offered little encouragement. \u201cIt was just kind of, \u2018Thank you,\u2019\u201d she recalled.Back home in San Francisco, stronger and healthier, she signed on to Facebook and tried reaching out again.Her earlier relationship with Mr. Williams, which spanned five years, began in 1984, while they were commuting from Berkeley on Bay Area Rapid Transit to downtown San Francisco. Mr. Williams, a newly minted architect, couldn\u2019t help looking her way one night when the two found themselves the sole passengers on a train car rumbling under San Francisco Bay.\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to just sit there,\u201d recalled Mr. Williams, now also 57, who crossed the car to introduce himself. By the time he disembarked, they had exchanged phone numbers. Lunch followed, and then museum visits, reggae concerts and road trips. They shared a passion for the arts and nature.He was raised in Los Angeles and Cerritos, Calif., where his mother, Julietta, taught in the Cerritos public schools for 33 years, and his father, Amos, a Korean War veteran, retired after 36 years as a mail carrier in Los Angeles. Ms. Snell is from Phoenix, where her father, Richard, had been the chairman of Pinnacle West Capital, which owns Arizona\u2019s largest electricity utility, and where her mother, Alice, was, among other things, deputy associate superintendent in the vocational division of the Arizona Department of Education.\u201cHe\u2019s quiet, and an independent, deeply creative thinker,\u201d Ms. Snell said of Gregory Williams, who was later a founder of Mass Architecture & Design, a Los Angeles firm with commissions that have included several notable homes and restaurants and the Coffee & Milk cafe at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. \u201cI love the way he helps me see the world from a different angle.\u201dFor his part, Mr. Williams said, \u201cWe\u2019ve always had very similar spirits, similar life views, whether they\u2019re social, political, family values.\u201dWhen she entered a graduate journalism program at the University of Southern California, he left his job at a San Francisco urban historic preservation group to join her in his hometown, where they lived briefly with his parents, who invited Ms. Snell to stay in a spare room for a few months during her studies.\u201cThey just really epitomize to me what a loving relationship should be,\u201d Mr. Williams\u2019s mother said. \u201cThey hold hands. It\u2019s so warm.\u201d With regard to the biracial nature of the relationship, Mrs. Williams said that she and the young couple did not blink, although even today some people outside their families and friends \u201cstill blink, they still do,\u201d at the notion of interracial marriage.In time, Ms. Snell\u2019s journalism career took root when she worked at a Los Angeles-based political and cultural journal. \u201cShe has got this profound sense of empathy that seems to affect everything she does,\u201d said Omar Dajani, a friend.Over time, however, irritants began building. They faced the same challenges that many young couples do, with communication lapses, self-centeredness and thoughts that there might be something better out there.The couple say that they also lacked the insight to discuss race and class, particularly at a time when acceptance was harder to come by.\u201cI wanted to be my own person, not having her family\u2019s position dictating things,\u201d Mr. Williams said of his decision to break off their earlier relationship. He began dating other women a year later, and, after two years lapsed, he called to tell her he was getting married.\u201cIt broke my heart,\u201d said Ms. Snell, who returned to San Francisco. \u201cHe had always been the one for me.\u201d Over time, she had a series of relationships, some serious, she said, but \u201cI came to love my solitary life.\u201dShe threw herself into work as executive editor at the Utne Reader, followed by eight years as senior writer at Sierra, a national magazine published by the Sierra Club.When she sought to contact Mr. Williams on Facebook in 2012, she did not know that during the year before he had separated from his wife of 18 years, with whom he has two sons.Mr. Williams responded more positively to her second Facebook inquiry, telling her, \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking of you.\u201d He soon flew to San Francisco, hopeful but apprehensive. \u201cI was thinking, I will get into her car, and we will have nothing to say, and it would be horrible.\u201dBut they clicked immediately, and after seeing a play, they went dancing at a bar called the Make Out Room, where, as Ms. Snell put it, the sparks started flying.\u201cHe\u2019s self-confident without being egoistic,\u201d Ms. Snell said. \u201cHe\u2019s his own man.\u201d She also found that the responsibility of fatherhood had changed him.It was in a rented cottage in Point Reyes, Calif., that they began working off those 24 years of hurt and separation and quickly came to realize how close they still were, Mr. Williams said. After dinner, they wrapped themselves in blankets and sat side by side on a long side porch, staring out at the dark forest and talking about their past insecurities and poor communication.\u201cI grew up Catholic, and it was kind of like confession,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cYou don\u2019t see the person. You just spill out your soul. I told her, \u2018Let\u2019s see if there\u2019s something here.\u2019 And the only way we could do this was to see each other exclusively and see if there\u2019s something there that\u2019s worth rebuilding.\u201dMs. Snell said: \u201cI just felt it was a sacred moment. I realized then, I really want this.\u201d The next day, walking on the beach, Mr. Williams asked how she saw herself growing old.\u201cI said I had always thought I\u2019d live by myself in a shack in the desert,\u201d she said. \u201cHe said: \u2018That\u2019s terrible. You\u2019re not going to be by yourself. You\u2019re going to be with me.\u2019\u201dHe suggested a larger shack, a nurturing space with an interior courtyard. She began talking solar panels and rain barrels. They envisioned a future that would bring their two passions of design and nature together.They began being in touch every day, mostly by text, morning, afternoon and night, and they usually spoke by phone at night, he said.Cognizant of their parents\u2019 ages and building health issues, they began discussing marriage 18 months ago. Mr. Williams met with her parents in Phoenix and asked for permission. They agreed.\u201cHe wanted to make the formal request,\u201d Alice Snell said later. \u201cIt was refreshing.\u201dHe proposed to Ms. Snell in a courtyard at the back of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. For her engagement ring, Ms. Snell chose a family ring missing a stone, which was fitted with a garnet that she and Mr. Williams found for $9 in downtown Los Angeles in the Jewelry District.They were married April 22 in the chapel at the Beverly Hills Courthouse, with Ronald L. Engen, a deputy commissioner of civil marriages for Los Angeles County, presiding. It was a simple ceremony, with the bride, the groom and Mr. Williams\u2019s sister, Cynthia Williams, who served as witness.They followed that up with a celebration on April 30 at the Snell home in Phoenix, attended by 150 guests, including Mr. Williams\u2019s two sons, Gyasi Amos Williams, now 22, and Kwame Clyde Williams, now 15.The couple plans to build a home in the Williamses\u2019 old neighborhood, south of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, a version of the shack they designed while in Point Reyes. It will have commercial space on the bottom floor: They want a community where people know each other.\u201cStrangely, we are very different people, and we came apart because of our differences,\u201d Ms. Snell said. \u201cBut when we came together, we found a way to build things.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fitbit Strives to Escape the Shadow of Apple", "Date": "2016-05-02", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Earlier this year, Fitbit invited guests to a Las Vegas hotel to witness something that it promised would \u201cignite the world of health and fitness.\u201dThe event, held during the International CES in January, was intended to make a splash for the wearable tech company\u2019s new product, the Blaze, a $200 smartwatch that measures a wearer\u2019s steps, heart rate and sleep.\u201cI was going in thinking, \u2018This is going to be awesome,\u2019\u201d James Park, Fitbit\u2019s chief executive, said of the Blaze introduction in an interview last month. \u201cI was definitely pretty surprised when I looked at some of the aftermath of it.\u201dThe reaction to the Blaze encapsulates the predicament facing Fitbit, the young company that has been a leader in wearable technology: In many people\u2019s eyes, it lives in the shadow of Apple, the Silicon Valley behemoth whose touch-screen smartwatch could potentially stomp its smaller rival out of existence.This even though Fitbit has been trying to do everything right \u2014 and has largely succeeded.Yet the fact that Fitbit\u2019s products focus on one thing \u2014 tracking your fitness \u2014 is not helping the company\u2019s image in this era of Swiss Army knife devices, where products like the iPhone and Apple Watch can do multiple things. History has been unkind to single-purpose gadgets, many of which have flopped, like Cisco\u2019s Flip camcorder, or have struggled, like the action camera from GoPro.As a result, Fitbit\u2019s stock has fallen about 10 percent since it went public last June. \u201cThere were concerns around competition, particularly from Apple,\u201d Katy Huberty, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said of investor skepticism around Fitbit.Mr. Park said \u201cit actually does not bother me at all\u201d when people frequently compare his company to Apple. He said the Apple Watch serves a different market than Fitbit\u2019s $60 to $250 accessories that focus on health monitoring.\u201cWe look at it from a consumer point of view,\u201d Mr. Park said. Apple Watch \u201cis a computing platform, but that\u2019s really the wrong way to approach this category from the very beginning.\u201dAn Apple spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment.Indisputably, Fitbit is growing, both in staff and sales. At the company\u2019s San Francisco headquarters, a timeline on the wall in the fifth-floor hallway illustrates the firm\u2019s history. In 2007, when Mr. Park, a Harvard dropout who had worked on photo-sharing software, founded Fitbit with his business partner Eric N. Friedman, who is now Fitbit\u2019s chief of technology, the start-up had just two employees. By 2015, it had 1,101.Inside the offices, furnished in midcentury modern style, employees are constantly shuffling in and out of conference rooms for meetings. On a recent visit, a group of new hires was touring the headquarters.Still, a concern among investors is whether Fitbit can extract more money from existing customers. Most of its sales are from people who buy Fitbit devices for the first time, not those who upgrade.In addition, many people may end up leaving their Fitbit devices in a drawer. Of those who bought a Fitbit device in 2015, 28 percent stopped using it by the end of the year, according to the company.\u201cThat means that many people who buy Fitbits don\u2019t use them for long, and presumably aren\u2019t going to buy another Fitbit device,\u201d said Jan Dawson, an independent technology analyst. \u201cThey have to constantly find new people to sell Fitbits to, whereas most consumer electronics companies can rely on a good amount of repeat business.\u201dAddressing some of these concerns falls partly to Woody Scal, Fitbit\u2019s chief business officer, who oversees sales and marketing for the company. Last year, Fitbit acquired FitStar, which makes apps offering video instructions on workouts. The apps charge a monthly subscription fee for access to exercise programs, an example of how Fitbit could eventually collect money from software services.The big picture for Fitbit, Mr. Scal said, is its evolution into a digital monitoring platform to discover and prevent health problems. Fitbit has teamed up with corporations that offer wellness programs for employees. BP, for example, offers Fitbits to more than 23,000 employees, partly to ensure they are getting enough sleep before they work on oil rigs. Mr. Scal said the data from sleep monitoring, a feature built in to all Fitbit devices, could lead to new health revelations.\u201cI believe we\u2019ve tracked more nights of sleep than have ever been tracked in the history of man,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can actually now compare it to normative data that we have and we can identify irregularities.\u201dAs for Apple, though Mr. Park said he was not bothered by the rival company, it has long been in his sights. When Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, introduced the iPhone 4S in 2011, for example, Mr. Park had a realization.At the time, the new iPhone added a capability to synchronize with wireless accessories using the standard called Bluetooth. Fitbit trackers back then lacked Bluetooth connectivity, but Mr. Park wanted them to be able to synchronize data immediately with the iPhone.\u201cIt could enable a lot of possibilities in terms of real-time feedback,\u201d he said.So Mr. Park gathered a few top employees into a conference room. They decided to re-engineer the Fitbit products to support the new feature. The decision set product releases back about six months, but the revised devices became best sellers.Mr. Park said Fitbit was poised to innovate products to stay competitive. Sensors are getting more sophisticated, so he imagined a situation where high-end Fitbit devices could eventually support mobile payments or control smart home products like Internet-connected light bulbs.Yet the products will stop short of resembling the Apple Watch.\u201cWe\u2019re going to be very careful with how we include these things over time,\u201d Mr. Park said. \u201cI think one of the general knocks against smartwatches is that people still don\u2019t know what they\u2019re good for, so they\u2019ve crammed everything in.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified who introduced the iPhone 4S in 2011. It was Timothy Cook, who was the company\u2019s chief executive then, not Steve Jobs.Advertisement"}

During elaborate presentations at some of the city\u2019s most celebrated locations, TV networks present their slate of programming for the next fall season to advertisers. The goal this year: Attract what could amount to more than $9 billion in advance ad sales.Perhaps those with the most power at this event are ad buyers, who work for agencies on behalf of companies like Coca-Cola and Royal Caribbean. Their decisions help determine which networks win and which lose. For them, the week doesn\u2019t just mean presentations. It also means lunches (sometimes two in one day), drinks with clients, fancy dinners and plenty of schmoozing.Carrie Drinkwater, director of investment activation for the agency MullenLowe Mediahub, has been attending the upfronts for two decades. For her, Monday was a day spent running all over town, some of the time with a New York Times reporter in tow.10:45 a.m., NBCUniversal Upfront at Radio City Music HallMs. Drinkwater arrives at the 50th Street entrance to Radio City after taking a 5:20 a.m. train from Boston, where she works.

The presentation begins shortly after 11 a.m. \u201cIt\u2019s a celebration of TV,\u201d Ms. Drinkwater says about the upfronts as the lights dim. She takes a sip of water. Here we go.Jimmy Fallon begins the show dressed like a character from the Broadway show \u201cHamilton.\u201d \u201cI love him,\u201d Ms. Drinkwater whispers. The presentation also includes a sizzle reel of NBCUniversal\u2019s new shows, grouped into buckets with titles like \u201cLaugh Out Loud\u201d and \u201cRule Breakers.\u201d The presentation does indeed last about two hours, apparently much to everyone\u2019s relief. As she makes her way out of Radio City, Ms. Drinkwater says one new show in particular caught her attention: \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d starring Mandy Moore and Milo Ventimiglia, about people whose link seems to be that they share a birthday. She will have to think about whether any other shows work for her clients. 1 p.m., lunch at Valbella, a white-tablecloth Italian restaurant in Midtown\u201cThe upfront madness isn\u2019t that mad anymore,\u201d he says.Over pear and endive salad and halibut, Ms. Drinkwater and Mr. Olsen discuss how her clients, which include Scotts Miracle-Gro and Royal Caribbean, could use A&E\u2019s programming and ad offerings. They try to organize drinks with another advertising executive on Wednesday. (\u201cJust email her,\u201d Ms. Drinkwater says.)This is a week for networking. Mr. Olsen mentions that on one day, he has not one, but two client lunches.3:20 p.m., in the back of a taxiFox\u2019s upfront is on the Upper West Side, so Ms. Drinkwater hops in a taxi with Mr. Johnson. NBC is already advertising its new shows on the taxi TV.Since Ms. Drinkwater is an upfront veteran, she is well positioned to opine on the changes. \u201cThe biggest evolution over time was the disruption of the space,\u201d she says. People now watch shows, oftentimes without ads, on their computers, smartphones and tablets. Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Snapchat have prompted advertisers to come up with new ways to promote their products.She predicts that this year, the upfronts will see a 2 percent increase in ad-spending commitments compared with last year, when the total was considered fairly weak.Will the upfronts ever disappear? \u201cI think they will be around for as long as there is demand for the supply,\u201d she says. About television, she adds, \u201cIt\u2019s still a mass vehicle.\u201d3:35 p.m., Fox Upfront at the Beacon TheaterThe taxi lets Ms. Drinkwater out a few blocks away from the theater. A crowd has already formed, and Ms. Drinkwater searches for clients from National Geographic. More hugs and handshakes. As she waits for the presentation to begin, she recalls her first \u2014 and perhaps most memorable \u2014 upfront. She was at Lincoln Center for NBC\u2019s upfront waiting at the open bar. When she got her drink, she turned around, and there was George Clooney.Fox promotes its hit show \u201cEmpire,\u201d and a number of new shows, including \u201cPitch,\u201d about a woman who is a baseball player, and \u201cThe Exorcist,\u201d which looks terrifying.\u201cI really think they have a great slate,\u201d Ms. Drinkwater says after reflecting on the presentation. She is also impressed that so many shows have diverse casts. In particular, she says she likes \u201cPitch\u201d and \u201cStar,\u201d a new drama from Lee Daniels, a creator of \u201cEmpire.\u201d6:50 p.m., NBC N.F.L. Dinner at Maloney & Porcelli, a Midtown expense account stalwartBefore heading to dinner, Ms. Drinkwater grabs a drink at Upstairs, a rooftop bar in Midtown, with representatives of Bose, a client. She orders a glass of red wine, but says she \u201cprobably had three sips.\u201d The upfronts require pacing. She and her companions discuss who is going to be at the NBC dinner.When they arrive at the dinner, where NBC gives advertising executives a glimpse of the coming football season, cocktail hour is in full swing. Ms. Drinkwater talks to Linda Yaccarino, chairwoman for advertising sales and client partnerships at NBCUniversal, and Seth Winter, executive vice president for ad sales for NBC Sports Group.A platter of shellfish awaits everyone as they take their seats. Ms. Drinkwater sits next to Rodney Harrison, a former football player and NBC football analyst. They discuss their children. She passes on the filet and orders salmon.10:45 p.m., Fox party at Wollman Rink in Central ParkMs. Drinkwater gets in an Uber and makes her way to Fox\u2019s party, which started around 6 p.m. after the network\u2019s upfront ended but is still going strong. Hours earlier, people sipped grapefruit mojitos (one agency executive described it as overly leafy) and munched on sushi, hot dogs, macaroni and cheese, and warm chocolate chip cookies.Ms. Drinkwater finally leaves around midnight. But her upfronts are far from over \u2014 there are still three days to go before she heads home to reflect on how her clients should spend their money.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Needles Clinton and G.O.P. Field at Correspondents\u2019 Dinner", "Date": "2016-04-30", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama poked fun at Hillary Clinton\u2019s lack of appeal among young people Saturday night, joking at the annual White House press corps dinner that Mrs. Clinton was like an aging relative who cannot figure out how to use Facebook.\u201cDid you get my poke? Is it on my wall?\u201d he said, imagining Mrs. Clinton trying to use the popular social media site. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m using this right. Love, Aunt Hillary.\u201dMr. Obama also needled Mrs. Clinton for paid speeches she gave for Goldman Sachs. He noted that if his comedy routine, during his final appearance at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner, was successful, he could earn \u201cserious Tubmans\u201d \u2014 a nod to Harriet Tubman, the American abolitionist whose image will be printed on future $20 bills.He referred to Senator Bernie Sanders, who was in the audience, as \u201ccomrade,\u201d a reference to his political status as a democratic socialist.But the president reserved his most biting commentary for the Republicans running for president, repeatedly turning to the party\u2019s chaotic nominating contest for comedic fodder.Mr. Obama mocked Senator Ted Cruz for calling a basketball hoop a \u201cbasketball ring\u201d while campaigning in Indiana.\u201cWhat else is in his lexicon?\u201d Mr. Obama asked, working hard to contain a broad smile. \u201cBaseball sticks? Football hats?\u201dHe paused, then added: \u201cBut sure, I\u2019m the foreign one.\u201dThe president showed a picture of Gov. John Kasich of Ohio eating pancakes as he noted that \u201csome candidates aren\u2019t polling high enough to qualify for their own joke tonight.\u201d And he tweaked Republicans in the audience for their search for an alternative candidate, noting that the options for dinner were steak or fish.\u201cA whole bunch of you wrote in Paul Ryan,\u201d he said. \u201cYou may not like steak or fish. But that\u2019s your choice.\u201dAnd then there was Donald Trump. Mr. Obama riffed at length about Mr. Trump, the billionaire-turned-front-runner, who was not in attendance. The president wondered aloud why Mr. Trump had chosen not to be there.\u201cYou\u2019ve got a room full of reporters, celebrities, cameras, and he said no,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cIs this dinner too tacky for the Donald?\u201dHe joked that Mr. Trump had some foreign policy experience because \u201che has spent years meeting with leaders from around the world: Miss Sweden, Miss Argentina, Miss Azerbaijan.\u201dAnd he noted that Mr. Trump may be the best person to succeed in closing the prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba.\u201cTrump knows a thing or two about running waterfront properties into the ground,\u201d Mr. Obama said.The president delivered his remarks with deft comic timing in a lengthy monologue that was both ironic and introspective.Members of the news media did not escape the president\u2019s acerbic sense of humor. He joked that the movie \u201cSpotlight,\u201d about The Boston Globe\u2019s investigation into sexual abuse by Catholic priests and holding the powerful accountable, was \u201cthe best fantasy film since \u2018Star Wars.\u2019\u201d And he tweaked the news media for giving Mr. Trump \u201cthe appropriate amount of coverage, befitting the seriousness of his candidacy.\u201dMr. Obama\u2019s most personal jab at a journalist was aimed at Jake Tapper, the host of \u201cThe Lede\u201d on CNN. He noted that several journalists had left the White House beat in recent years, and then added: \u201cJake Tapper left journalism to join CNN,\u201d prompting Mr. Tapper to raise a wine glass.As has been his habit, Mr. Obama made fun of himself. He joked about his age \u2014 and the common maladies that afflict men over 50 \u2014 suggesting that he felt far older than he did when he became president.\u201cHillary once questioned whether I\u2019d be ready for a 3 a.m. phone call,\u201d he recalled. \u201cNow I\u2019m awake anyway because I\u2019ve got to go to the bathroom.\u201dHe also noted that he had spent two days in London recently having lunch with Queen Elizabeth II, playing golf with Prime Minister David Cameron, and seeing a Shakespeare performance at the Globe Theater.\u201cJust in case anyone is debating whether I\u2019m black enough, that should settle the debate,\u201d he said.Perhaps the most surprising moment of the president\u2019s appearance came in a video produced by the White House showing Mr. Obama considering how to spend his time after leaving office.In the video, Mr. Obama first turns to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. for advice. But then the president decides to call someone else for help \u2014 former House Speaker John A. Boehner, a Republican who was once a fierce adversary.The video shows the president and Mr. Boehner sitting in the White House movie theater watching the ending of \u201cToy Story.\u201d Mr. Boehner notes that he finally got the \u201cgrand bargain\u201d that had eluded the two leaders during budget talks.\u201cOn a sweet Chevy Tahoe,\u201d Mr. Boehner says, pulling out a pack of cigarettes and offering one to Mr. Obama, who has spent his presidency chewing nicotine gum to try to kick his smoking habit. The president\u2019s eyes go wide.Mr. Obama closed his appearance on a serious note, saluting Jason Rezaian, the Washington Post reporter who had been held in an Iranian prison, and who attended the dinner Saturday night. He promised that his administration would \u201ccontinue to fight\u201d for journalists held against their will.And he praised the Washington press corps for trying to resist the commercial pressures to dumb down journalism, saying that \u201cthere are so many of you who are pushing against those trends.\u201dHe then offered just two words: \u201cObama out.\u201d He dropped his microphone, and turned from the podium.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Subtle Empire", "Date": "2016-05-21", "News": "Supported byIN one story people tell about the news media, we have moved from an era of consolidation and authority to an era of fragmentation and diversity. Once there were three major television networks, and everyone believed what Walter Cronkite handed down from Sinai. Then came cable TV and the talk radio boom, and suddenly people could seek out ideologically congenial sources and tune out the old mass-culture authorities. Then finally the Internet smashed the remaining media monopolies, scattered news readers to the online winds, and opened an age of purely individualized news consumption.How compelling is this story? It depends on what you see when you look at Facebook.In one light, Facebook is a powerful force driving fragmentation and niche-ification. It gives its users news from countless outlets, tailored to their individual proclivities. It allows those users to be news purveyors in their own right, playing Cronkite every time they share stories with their \u201cfriends.\u201d And it offers a platform to anyone, from any background or perspective, looking to build an audience from scratch.Who\u2019s right? Well, Beck is right that Facebook is different in kind from any news organization before it, and that traditional critiques of media bias \u2014 from the Chomskyite left as well as from the right \u2014 don\u2019t apply neatly to what it\u2019s doing.Between the algorithmic character of (much of) its news dissemination, the role of decentralized user choice, and the commercial imperatives of personalization, there\u2019s little chance that the Facebook experience will ever bear the kind of ideological stamp that, say, the Time-Life empire bore in Henry Luce\u2019s heyday.But the more plausible (and inevitable) exercise of Facebook\u2019s power would be basically unconscious \u2014 as, I suspect, any suppression of conservative stories may have been.Human nature being what it is, a social network managed and maintained by people who tend to share a particular worldview \u2014 left-libertarian and spiritual-but-not-religious, if I judge the biases of Silicon Valley right \u2014 will tend to gently catechize its users into that perspective.Virtual architecture tells stories no less than the real variety: Like stained-glass windows in a medieval cathedral, even what seem like offhand choices \u2014 like Google\u2019s choice of its Doodle subject, to cite a different new media entity \u2014 point people toward particular icons, particular ideals.So even if you don\u2019t particularly care how Facebook treats conservative news sources, you should still want its power constantly checked, critiqued and watched \u2014 for the sake not just of its users\u2019 politics, but their very selves and souls.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Drawing Up a Hit List to Erase Traces of a Hostage Siege in Queens", "Date": "2016-05-29", "News": "Supported byCrime SceneIn the house in Queens that morning, a telephone rang.A stranger with a gun stood nearby, his face hidden behind a ski mask. He pointed the gun at one of the men who lived there.\u201cPick up the phone,\u201d he said, according to a criminal complaint. \u201cSpeak in English. Anything other than English, I\u2019ll shoot you.\u201dThe hostage answered.The events on that March day last year, with police officers arriving in droves to an armed robbery in one home and a standoff in another, rattled the predominantly Bangladeshi block in Jamaica, a block that breathed a collective sigh of relief when the suspect surrendered that afternoon.But that relief disappeared last week with the disclosure by prosecutors of a far more sinister scheme in connection with that day, one meant to ensure that the suspect\u2019s trial would end in his favor. The addresses of both homes and the names of people inside had been jotted on a list. The list was for a hit man, the police and prosecutors said, with instructions to kill everyone on it so they could not testify.A young man outside one of the homes brushed off a reporter on Wednesday.\u201cIt\u2019s still going on,\u201d he said, before driving away.It all began on March 16, 2015, a Monday, around 8 a.m. A man in a ski mask knocked on the front door of an attached house on a block of 168th Street, one of several nearly identical homes in a row. But the door was not chosen at random.The man\u2019s name was Edward Leasure, 35, the police said. He had been in prison twice after convictions for theft and robbery. A woman answered his knock, and Mr. Leasure stepped inside, according to the criminal complaint. He led the woman and her husband into a bedroom.\u201cWhere\u2019s the safe?\u201d he asked the husband, according to the complaint. \u201cYou had a big party Saturday night. I know you have a safe. Show me the safe or I\u2019ll shoot your wife in the foot.\u201dThe woman grabbed some cash, $300, and handed it to Mr. Leasure. Then he left, not through the front door, but through an exit that led to the roof, said a neighbor, Arman Hossain, 37. He climbed over the short partitions that separated the rowhouses, passing over one house, then another and another, stopping at the fourth.The police were coming. The couple from the first house had called 911, and officers arrived in cars and vans and, from above, a helicopter.Mr. Leasure entered the second home and punched a woman in the shoulder, according to the complaint. He gathered her and two other people in a room at gunpoint. \u201cBe calm. Don\u2019t scream,\u201d he said, according to the complaint. \u201cI\u2019m just going to wait until the police leave.\u201dThat is when the phone rang. It was the hostage\u2019s brother calling, at the urging of the police. Officers, suspecting that Mr. Leasure was hiding inside, had instructed the brother about what to say on the phone.Speaking in their native Bengali, the brother asked, \u201cIs there a man in there with a gun?\u201d the complaint states. \u201cIf there is, say, \u2018O.K., see you for dinner.\u2019\u201dThe hostage, careful to obey his captor, answered in English. \u201cO.K., O.K., O.K.,\u201d he said. \u201cYes. Dinner.\u201dThe call ended. Mr. Leasure took a pair of pants from the house and stashed his own in a pile of laundry, the complaint states. He also hid his ski mask, jacket, boots and, in a dresser drawer, his gun.Two floors below, in the basement, Mr. Hossain, the neighbor, was unaware of the situation upstairs and why the police were outside. \u201cI hear \u2018boom, boom boom\u2019 on my door,\u201d he said last week. \u201cSWAT team.\u201d Officers hurried him outside to a van.His trial was set for next month. Last week, prosecutors announced the arrests of Mr. Leasure\u2019s girlfriend and his father and described the murder-for-hire plot.One month ago, the father, Eddie Marcus, 53, approached a man in Jamaica, the same neighborhood the standoff was in, and offered to pay him to kill witnesses who would be testifying against his son, according to another criminal complaint. Mr. Marcus gave the man the list of names, the complaint states.A few days later, Mr. Marcus introduced the man, who is not identified in the complaint, but who cooperated with the Queens district attorney\u2019s office, to his son\u2019s girlfriend, Latisha Larrymore, 31. Ms. Larrymore said she knew someone who would sell him a gun and a silencer, the complaint states.On May 12, in a telephone call monitored by the police, Ms. Larrymore told the man she had asked a friend for money, but the friend had refused, the complaint states. She discussed forms of collateral.The plot ended there. Ms. Larrymore and Mr. Marcus were arrested on May 23 and charged with conspiracy and solicitation to commit murder. Ms. Larrymore, according to the complaint, said that Mr. Leasure, from jail, had instructed her to meet his father because his father had found \u201ca lawyer who will take care of the situation,\u201d which she said was code for a hit man\u201cI can\u2019t believe it, because she\u2019s a churchgoing person,\u201d her grandfather, Wendell Larrymore, 81, said on Friday. \u201cShe got mixed up with the wrong person.\u201dMr. Leasure has not been charged in the conspiracy. His scheduled trial date in June \u2014 and its list of witnesses \u2014 remains unchanged.Advertisement"}

The country is starved to see its two major parties do big hard things together again. And getting a glimpse \u2014 even just a pretend one \u2014 of Obama and Boehner teaming up reminds you what\u2019s been lost.I think what\u2019s propelling Donald Trump\u2019s success more than anything is the feeling of many Americans that our politics are totally stuck. There is an overwhelming sense of \u201cstuckness\u201d \u2014 and the fantasy that Trump plays to, and plays up, is that he can pull the sword from the stone and do deals. No one was more responsible for this \u201cstuckness,\u201d though, than today\u2019s Republican Party. When Mitch McConnell, the G.O.P. leader in the Senate, said in October 2010 that \u201cthe single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president,\u201d he described the Republicans\u2019 dominant strategy since 2008. The party stopped thinking seriously about market-based alternatives. Into that emptiness entered Trump, like an invasive species.This was a really bad time for us to be stuck. I\u2019m just finishing writing a new book, which is partly about the inflection point we hit around 2007. In 2007, Apple came out with the iPhone, beginning the smartphone/apps revolution; in late 2006 Facebook opened its doors to anyone, not just college and high school students, and took off like a rocket; Google came out with the Android operating system in 2007; Hadoop launched in 2007, helping create the storage/processing power for the big data revolution; Github, launched in 2007, scaling open-source software; Twitter was spun off as its own separate platform in 2007. Amazon came out with the Kindle in 2007. Airbnb started in 2007.That was the real grand bargain we needed. Instead, we had the 2008 economic meltdown, which set off more polarization, and way too much gridlock, given how much rethinking, reimagining and retooling we needed to do. In this vortex a lot of the public got unmoored and disoriented, opening the way for populists with simple answers. Get rid of immigrants, end trade with China or eliminate big banks and all will be fine. It\u2019s nonsense.But if you\u2019re for these things only as they now exist, you\u2019re also wrong. Each one needs retooling. It\u2019s clear: Free trade with China has hurt more people than originally thought. It\u2019s clear: Low-skilled illegal immigration has hurt more American workers than we\u2019ve fully understood. (And more high-skilled immigration in a knowledge age would enhance our economy more than most people understand.) It\u2019s clear: Social Security, Medicare and Obamacare all need fixes to remain sustainable. It\u2019s clear: Capitalism driven more by machines and robots poses new challenges for both white-collar and blue-collar workers.Every one of these challenges can be met if we put our heads and hands together. For that to happen, though, this version of the Republican Party had to be destroyed, so a thinking center-right party can emerge. If that is what Trump has done, he\u2019s done the Lord\u2019s work. We also need Democrats to be a center-left party, though, and not let Bernie Sanders pull them to the far left. If both happen, maybe something good can actually emerge from this crazy election.Advertisement"}

At the time, her husband was working long hours, so they agreed she would stay home with their three young children.But returning to work two years later when her youngest daughter began preschool wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t so easy.

In addition to traditional positions, it offers options that can help people transition back to work including contract consulting projects, temporary jobs and unpaid pro bono work. The site was co-founded by Jennifer Gefsky, former deputy general counsel for Major League Baseball, who struggled to return to work after an eight-year career break, and Niccole Kroll, who had left her job as a New York University dietitian and researcher.

These are companies that understand that there are many reasons, economic and personal, for stepping out of the work force \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and for returning. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSome women are financially motivated, and some are personally motivated, and both make good employees,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.Workers who can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find a formal midlife internship can still create their own internship-style path back to work. Erin Gibson Allen, a lawyer in Pittsburgh, created an unpaid internship with Judge Lisa Lenihan, a magistrate judge for the United States District Court in the Western District of Pennsylvania. After spending six months looking to re-enter the legal profession and with no formal re-entry programs in Pittsburgh, her plan was to get work experience and network in the legal community, rather than to find permanent employment with her judicial boss.  Her efforts paid of: After nine months with the judge she accepted a job at a law firm, and then moved to a Pittsburgh firm, Marcus & Shapira, where she now works in the area of competition law. She chose her internship experience wisely: Ms. Allen said the judge, a mother herself, appreciated the challenges of managing both a family and a legal career. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe judge was my biggest advocate,\u201d she said. \u201cShe introduced me to attorneys around town and included me in as many legal events as possible. My time with her was priceless.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHelen Wolter of  Mountain View, Calif, describes her career path before having children as \u00e2\u0080\u009ctypical liberal arts major.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She taught high school, she did outdoor education, she worked in film and video. When her son was born, she was a high school social studies teacher. She made it work for a year, but went through \u00e2\u0080\u009cthree nannies and a day care\u00e2\u0080\u009d trying to find an affordable and flexible fit.Ms. Wolter began her journey back to work by pursing a master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s degree in public administration. To keep it affordable, avoid the need to hire babysitters in order to attend classes and maintain the flexibility she needed, she completed an online program through the University of Colorado. Now a graduate, with a son in first grade, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s taken an internship approach \u00e2\u0080\u0093 opting for a six-month contract position with a political re-election campaign as her first job after seven years as a caregiver. She hopes it will lead to permanent work. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI checked with a career counselor to ask if I should take that, or wait for something more permanent,\u201d Ms. Wolter said, \u201cand she told me, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Grab it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so much easier to find a job if you have a job.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009dHow do you create your own midlife internship? Those returning to work without the benefit of an organized program can use such internships as a model for both how they approach and talk to potential employers, look for the support they need, and find ways to expand their skills.

{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton Widens Lead Over Donald Trump in Poll", "Date": "2016-05-04", "News": "The CNN/ORC poll, released Wednesday morning, shows\u00c2\u00a0Mrs. Clinton with 54 percent of respondents\u2019 support, compared with 41 percent for\u00c2\u00a0Mr. Trump, a lead that is\u00c2\u00a0one percentage point above her showing in\u00c2\u00a0a similar survey in March.The poll suggested that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s support is driven heavily by aversion to\u00c2\u00a0a Trump candidacy: 51 percent of her supporters say their backing comes\u00c2\u00a0more from\u00c2\u00a0opposition to Mr. Trump than from\u00c2\u00a0a preference for the Democratic candidate. But the same is\u00c2\u00a0true for those who said they supported Mr. Trump: 57 percent said\u00c2\u00a0their backing\u00c2\u00a0was\u00c2\u00a0driven by an\u00c2\u00a0opposition to Mrs. Clinton.The poll shows that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, would hold an even wider lead over Mr. Trump than Mrs. Clinton: In a hypothetical matchup, Mr. Sanders\u00c2\u00a0would beat Mr. Trump by 16 percentage points, the poll suggested.Mr. Sanders has seized on his strong performance against Mr. Trump in polls as a main\u00c2\u00a0argument for keeping his candidacy alive despite\u00c2\u00a0Mrs. Clinton\u2019s lead in delegates.Both Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton hope to clinch their parties\u2019 nominations by getting the required\u00c2\u00a0majority of their parties\u2019 delegates by the last round of state contests, on June 7.The CNN/ORC poll of 1,001 adults had a margin of sampling error of 3.5 percentage points.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

While established stars have carried Ms. Bourelly\u2019s songs far, she will now be expected to make hits for herself, even though her nimble writing and earnest rebel image defy the easy categorization preferred by radio and marketing professionals.\u201cI\u2019m the type of person who really wants to exist and live honestly, to just say what I have to say and be who I am and do what I want,\u201d Ms. Bourelly said over lunch in Manhattan on her release day. \u201cFortunately and unfortunately, what I love entails, and makes, a lot of money.\u201dShe is also aware of her squirminess when it comes to being boxed in by genre labels. \u201cThat\u2019s so easy for everyone to do to me, not only because of my pen, but because of how I look \u2014 because I\u2019m black and I\u2019m honest and I\u2019m emotional,\u201d said Ms. Bourelly, who ordered a chardonnay to chase her elaborate sushi order. \u201cThe world is going to do that to me, but I\u2019m not going to do that to myself.\u201dMs. Bourelly, who is of Haitian and Moroccan descent, grew up bouncing between Berlin, where her guitarist father, Jean-Paul Bourelly, lived while not on tour, and the Washington area, where she stayed with an aunt and uncle. High school was a constant struggle, and college never an option, she said, having decided her life\u2019s purpose by puberty.While she was at home in Germany, her adolescent interest in Beyonc\u00e9, Britney Spears and the Jonas Brothers mixed with her dad\u2019s love of jazz-fusion and A Tribe Called Quest. \u201cWe would alternate days in the car,\u201d Ms. Bourelly said. \u201cThat\u2019s how my taste was really formed.\u201dAt 19, she moved to Los Angeles to work with a producer she met on Facebook. There, she quickly found a manager whose connections \u2014 along with her strong demos \u2014 put her into a room with Kanye West and Rihanna.The release of \u201cBitch Better Have My Money\u201d in March 2015 got Ms. Bourelly\u2019s name circulating. But first there was the sketch for \u201cHigher,\u201d a title now tattooed in casual script in the middle of Ms. Bourelly\u2019s right forearm. \u201cThat song changed my life,\u201d she said.Still, having made it first as a songwriter in the shadows was \u201cbittersweet,\u201d Ms. Bourelly explained. \u201cIt was awesome because I was writing for one of the biggest artists in the world after four months in L.A.\u201d However, \u201cit\u2019s hard to give your songs away,\u201d she added.In what might be Rihanna\u2019s finest vocal performance to date, she stretches on \u201cHigher\u201d to find the plaintive voice cracks that are Ms. Bourelly\u2019s specialty. The opportunity gave this young songwriter a chance to make her mark on a major album, and provided her with a front-row seat to the necessary operation of a superstar, with cameras constantly watching and ceaseless scrutiny. \u201cI needed to learn how that worked behind the scenes in order to understand how to be an artist,\u201d Ms. Bourelly said.For now, she exists in a strange limbo, having met her heroes, scored hit songs and performed on \u201cThe Tonight Show,\u201d but not yet having broken out on her own.This transitional period can raise a set of specific conundrums for Ms. Bourelly, like deciding when is the right time to get a second cellphone (\u201cI\u2019m not even popping enough to have a burner\u201d) and whether she\u2019ll be touring in a van or a bus. (\u201cStill a van,\u201d her manager, Pete Dinero, chimed in.)Ms. Bourelly plans to release a second EP this summer \u2014 \u201cThe generic answer is that they\u2019re two different chapters to my life, but the truth is, I just have too many songs,\u201d she said \u2014 followed by an album later this year or early in 2017.She has already written more than 300 songs, but insists it\u2019s the creation, not the career strategizing, that drives her.\u201cI live life to make songs,\u201d Ms. Bourelly said. \u201cIf I go out to a party, it\u2019s because I don\u2019t have [expletive] to write about. If I talk to a new guy, it\u2019s because the old guy bores me, and I already wrote a bunch of songs about him.\u201dAs for becoming a fully formed pop star, \u201cIt\u2019s a work in progress,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not ready yet, but I\u2019m not supposed to be.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Before a Larceny Arrest, a \u2018Cry for Help\u2019 on Facebook", "Date": "2016-05-15", "News": "Supported byCrime SceneOn the screen, a young woman, just awake, smiled and rose from bed, chatting to her audience about starting her day, pausing occasionally to take long drags from an electronic pipe, pronouncing herself to be high.She was using Facebook Live, the new feature that invites friends to watch a user \u201cgo live.\u201d Her name was Shaniah Lord, 19, from the Lower East Side of Manhattan, and she was a frequent and enthusiastic chronicler of the mundane (\u201cSunday, fun day, nothing better to do. I\u2019m bored.\u201d) who sometimes tried to scare up some excitement (\u201cLet\u2019s go get drinks,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m by mad bars.\u201d)On this day, March 26, her live feed took some strange turns. Looking back, her sister, Shaquana Lord, 28, called it \u201ca cry for help.\u201dIn the video, Ms. Lord reached for something off-camera. It was a woman\u2019s New Jersey driver\u2019s license, and she held it up to the screen.\u201cAnybody know a white girl that looks like this?\u201d she asked. \u201cWe could get money.\u201dSeveral minutes later, she approached the camera again, this time with a black purse, and pulled out a handful of gift cards.\u201cHoller at me,\u201d she sang, \u201cif you need a giftie.\u201dThen she seemed to catch herself, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t need to be on Facebook like this. I\u2019m not that type of person.\u201d She added, \u201cPeople don\u2019t like me because I get money.\u201dHer sister said the pictures Ms. Lord frequently posted suggesting a glamorous life \u2014 a new ring, new nails, selfies in boutiques \u2014 hid a need for attention. She was running around with the wrong crowd, her sister said, and her actions in the video may have been for show.\u201cJust because she had them doesn\u2019t mean it was hers,\u201d Shaquana Lord said.When, a few days after the video, Ms. Lord was arrested again, it turned out to be a case of mistaken identity. A woman had stolen a wallet from the Once Upon a Tart cafe in SoHo, but after Ms. Lord was arrested, it became obvious from security video that the thief was a different, much taller woman. Ms. Lord returned home and to Facebook as if nothing had happened.On the day she was released from jail, she seemed to have celebrated an older cousin\u2019s birthday, posting a picture and adding, \u201cIt ain\u2019t over yet thoooo!\u201d A few days later, she wrote, \u201cLife is really beginning to pick back up for me. I love it.\u201dBut away from Facebook, things were very different, the police said. In fact, life seemed more to resemble the March 26 video, with the gift cards and license, than the posts expressing hope. Looking back, that video seemed to all but announce, like an overture to a concert, the direction in which she was headed.On April 21 around 2 a.m., a woman in the Greenwich Treehouse bar in the West Village realized her purse was gone, her iPhone with it, the police said. The woman used the Find My iPhone app and tracked it to an address on West 14th Street \u2014 another bar, McKenna\u2019s Pub. She went there and recognized a woman from the first bar, she told the police. She told a doorman, who alerted the police.The suspect was arrested. It was Ms. Lord. The police recovered the woman\u2019s purse and more.There was a backpack that had been reported missing two hours earlier from Bill\u2019s Bar and Burger on Ninth Avenue, with a laptop and wallet. Its owner had been eating, the bag on the floor, and looked down to find it missing. Officers also found property from a purse that had been taken from a couch at Gaslight Lounge in the meatpacking district the night before, the police said.\u201cIn the family, she\u2019s the one that\u2019s full of life,\u201d Shaquana Lord said. \u201cShe got a whiff of the outside world, and she was going to do what she was going to do.\u201dMs. Lord would seem to agree. In that video, she raised one more item to the camera: a passport. She flipped through the pages and sang, \u201cCome see the world with me.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Coloring Your Way Through Grief", "Date": "2016-05-16", "News": "Jane Brody on health and aging.There is no disputing the adage that \u00e2\u0080\u009cinto each life, a little rain must fall,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the occasional need for a protective umbrella, but what do you do when the shower becomes a downpour that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to quit?One shattering loss can be enough to derail a person for years, even for life. But tragedy seems to stalk some people, and it is reasonable to wonder how one goes on in the face of repeated painful losses.Deborah S. Derman, a professional grief counselor in suburban Philadelphia, has clearly suffered more than her fair share. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe field of grief counseling sort of found me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbecause I had such a long history of loss.\u00e2\u0080\u009dShe weathered her first devastating loss at age 27, when the boyfriend she had broken up with retrieved the vacuum cleaner she had borrowed, attached the vacuum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hose to the exhaust pipe of his car and killed himself.Fast-forward a decade: Now happily married and mother of a toddler, she was waiting at the airport for her parents to arrive when the private plane her father was piloting dropped from the sky and crashed in front of her, killing all four passengers aboard.Four years later, while playing rugby, her husband died of a heart attack, leaving her a widow at age 39 with two young children and a third on the way. Then a few years later, she learned she had a rare form of breast cancer. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s when I felt I had a target on my back,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she told me. Her biggest fear, she said, was that if she died, her children would be orphans.But she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t die. Instead, she managed to bring up the three children, marry again \u00e2\u0080\u009ca wonderful man\u00e2\u0080\u009d who adopted them, and earn a Ph.D., writing her dissertation on grief and attachment in young widowhood.Dr. Derman has since been in private practice as a grief counselor, able to bring far more than professional training to the therapy she provides for those who have suffered losses. She has helped families on Staten Island who lost loved ones on 9/11, counseled breast cancer survivors, and conducted support groups for people weathering all manner of loss and grief.She knows firsthand how important it is to say the right thing early on to someone who is hurting and vulnerable. When her former boyfriend committed suicide, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI felt like I was an accessory to his death,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she told me. Her mother helped to assuage her guilt by reassuring her that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis is not your fault.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut when her husband died, her parents were no longer around with wise words. She recalled, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was in so much pain, the grief felt physical. I was unable to concentrate on anything \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t read a book or hold a conversation. The only thing I could read were self-help books on loss and grief, looking for answers to how to get through the anguish I felt. I was so isolated and frustrated. No one knew what to do with me.\u00e2\u0080\u009dShe couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even feel happy when two months after her husband died, she was accepted into a doctoral program in psychoeducational processes at Temple University. Advised to speak to another young widow, she was beaten down even further when the woman said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDebby, do you know how you feel that your life is over? Well, it is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which she said prompted her to take to her bed.But she decided to get up and try a different approach after her sister said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne day, Debby, this will be your past,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which made her realize that she might indeed have a future. She said she switched her field of study to grief and loss \u00e2\u0080\u009cbecause I never wanted another widow to feel as isolated as I did. I wanted to know how a person heals, so I can help others heal.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHealing is a lifelong process, and elements of grief can occur at any time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been widowed now for 24 years, but when my son got into medical school, I cried because my husband and parents weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t there to see it. My daughter is about to graduate from college, and we will both cry because she never even knew her father. Her grief is different, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not absent.\u00e2\u0080\u009dOpposite each illustration, designed by Lisa Powell Braun, is a blank page with the heading \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy palette \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 my words \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 my thoughts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d to prompt people to write down the feelings the words and phrases in the illustration evoke.Dr. Derman said she had kept a journal after her husband died. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen you have to write something down, it really clarifies your thoughts and helps you know how to proceed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn a journal, you can say whatever you want. No one else has to read it \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s private.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhile art therapy has been used for decades to help people express what they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t put into words, filling in the spaces of a coloring book has a different kind of benefit: enabling people to relax and be more focused. Marygrace Berberian, a clinical assistant professor in art therapy at New York University, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cResearch has shown that art making can have a profound impact on a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s physical and psychological well-being. And coloring within an outlined structure can help to contain and organize feelings of distress and helplessness.\u00e2\u0080\u009dDr. Derman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s idea for her book was prompted by a coloring book she received for her birthday last Christmas. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI colored one space, then another, and another, and realized this is how I proceeded through my life \u00e2\u0080\u0094 one small step at a time. This is a good paradigm for how a person gets through loss, one day at a time. After my husband died, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I could make it through a whole day. I looked at my watch \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it said 10 a.m. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and made a deal with myself to make it to 11, then 12, then half a day.\u00e2\u0080\u009dDr. Derman emphasized, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a recipe book. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t dictate how people should feel. We all go through grief and loss in very unique ways. One thing I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learned from my life and the hundreds of people I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve counseled: Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t try to pretend it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen and walk away fast.\u201dRelated:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.
