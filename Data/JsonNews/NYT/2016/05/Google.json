{"Headline": "Artificial Intelligence Is Far From Matching Humans, Panel Says", "Date": "2016-05-25", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Never mind Terminator-like killer robots. Artificial intelligence researchers are grappling with more realistic questions like whether their creations will take too many jobs from humans.Eight years after leading artificial intelligence scientists said their field did not need to be regulated, the question of government oversight has re-emerged as the technology has rapidly progressed.On Tuesday, at an event sponsored by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, legal specialists and technologists explored questions about autonomous systems that would increasingly make decisions without human input in areas like warfare, transportation and health.Still, despite improvement in areas like machine vision and speech understanding, A.I. research is still far from matching the flexibility and learning capability of the human mind, researchers at the conference said.\u201cThe A.I. community keeps climbing one mountain after another, and as it gets to the top of each mountain, it sees ahead still more mountains,\u201d said Ed Felten, a computer scientist who is a deputy chief technology officer in the Office of Science and Technology Policy.The half-day program, co-sponsored with the University of Washington School of Law and the university\u2019s Tech Policy Lab, was the first of four events the White House has planned that will focus on law and policy, as well as the social and economic implications of autonomous machine research.\u201cThese issues of A.I. and machines learning were popping up all over the government, and there was an opportunity to get more coordinated in how we address them,\u201d Dr. Felten said.After 25 artificial intelligence researchers met in 2009, the group, sponsored by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, reported that there was no imminent danger from a technology that had prompted fears of Hollywood-style weapons and advanced economies that were devoid of human workers.Leading technologists and scientists have also pondered the possibility that artificial intelligence, like genetic engineering, might soon constitute an existential threat to the human race.In recent years, the debate has spread to the broader social impact of autonomous programs that will perform tasks like driving cars and offering medical and financial advice.One challenge for A.I., according to a number of the researchers who spoke, is that the public perception about the threat of A.I. has largely been shaped by Hollywood.\u201cCertainly, Hollywood has played a tremendous role with vision like Skynet,\u201d the computer network that turns on humans in the \u201cTerminator\u201d movies, said Oren Etzioni, chief executive of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, a nonprofit research group funded by the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much always the case in science fiction that A.I. is this monolithic entity that is scheming to take over.\u201dHe cautioned that attention-getting feats like Google\u2019s AlphaGo program, which defeated a human champion in the board game Go, had plenty of humans behind the machine doing the work.At the same time, despite the consensus about the limits of today\u2019s technology, many of the panelists wrestled with new challenges presented by A.I. systems that were appearing in virtually all walks of life, including services delivered by smartphones and algorithms that guide missiles.Kate Crawford, a principal researcher at Microsoft Research, called on the industry to add ethics to the professional training of engineers. \u201cWe need to start changing the skill set of the people who are going to be the data scientists of the future and the A.I. creators of the future,\u201d she said.A.I. systems are pervasive, Ms. Crawford said, pointing to a doll like Hello Barbie, which speaks and listens.\u201cYou might think that\u2019s a fantastic toy, that\u2019s really wonderful,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat you don\u2019t realize is that it is the front to this huge data ingestion machine that is taking all of those statements by that child and then using them for a whole range of purposes.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Are You Laughing?", "Date": "2016-05-14", "News": "Supported byOVER the past month, I have analyzed what is probably the most comprehensive data set ever compiled on when and how people seek out laughter: our Google searches. This allowed me to look into ancient questions. Do we turn to humor because we are happy or sad?I thought we used humor to deal with the horror of human existence. Many famous comedians have experienced trauma and depression. Personally, I turn to comedy when I am unhappy. Granted, I\u2019m almost always miserable and almost always looking to laugh, so that doesn\u2019t tell us much.I am not alone in thinking pain and humor are connected. Soren Kierkegaard wrote, \u201cThe more one suffers, the more, I believe, has one a sense for the comic.\u201d Or as Charlie Chaplin put it, \u201cLaughter is the tonic, the relief, the surcease from pain.\u201d Mark Twain felt the same way: \u201cThe secret source of humor itself is not joy but sorrow. There is no humor in heaven.\u201dOur collective Google searches can\u2019t tell us whether pain and sorrow drive professional comedians, but the database does give some clues about the rest of us.There are many potential humor-related searches you can make \u2014 \u201cDaily Show clips,\u201d \u201cLouis C. K. stand-up,\u201d \u201cKnicks highlights.\u201d To keep it simple, I counted any search that included the word \u201cjokes,\u201d though I also checked the results against a broader set of searches.There are more than 100 million searches every year in the United States that include the word \u201cjokes.\u201d Americans make more searches for \u201cjokes\u201d than they do for \u201csweaters,\u201d \u201cwhiskey\u201d or \u201cvitamins.\u201dI looked first at searches for jokes by day of the week. Monday, psychological and sociological evidence suggests, is the most miserable day of the week. If we seek humor to alleviate suffering, we should search for jokes most frequently on Mondays.But Monday is actually the day we are least likely to search for jokes. Searches for jokes climb through the week and are highest on Friday through Sunday. This isn\u2019t because people are too busy with work or school on Mondays. Searches for \u201cdepression,\u201d \u201canxiety\u201d and \u201cdoctor\u201d are all highest on Mondays.Second, I compared searches for jokes to the weather. I did this for all searches in the New York City area over the past five years. Rain was a wash, but there were 6 percent fewer searches for jokes when it was below freezing. There were also 3 percent fewer searches for jokes on foggy days.Sure, some other entertainment searches, like \u201cmusic\u201d and \u201cshopping,\u201d also dropped after the bombing. Declines in these searches, however, were smaller than declines in searches for jokes, and some entertainment searches, like \u201cgames,\u201d actually rose during the manhunt.Google searches can also give us new clues on the content of jokes. Do people look for jokes that relate to the darkness and void of human existence? Sometimes, but not that often. About 53 percent of searches Americans make for jokes are for light or corny jokes \u2014 searches like \u201cfun jokes,\u201d \u201ckids jokes\u201d or \u201cdad jokes.\u201dAbout 29 percent are for vicious jokes \u2014 those making fun of other people. In the United States, the most common target of vicious jokes is African-Americans.The remainder of jokes \u2014 18 percent \u2014 directly deal with taboo subjects. Popular joke topics include physical deformity (\u201cHelen Keller jokes\u201d), uncomfortable subjects (\u201cpoop jokes\u201d) and inappropriate topics (\u201cdirty jokes\u201d).Perhaps the clearest evidence that jokes can be used to deal with taboo subjects is the popularity of \u201cdead baby jokes.\u201d In the United States, \u201cdead baby jokes\u201d are now the 13th most popular joke topic, with about 600,000 Google searches every year. Searches for \u201cdead baby jokes\u201d have nearly caught up in popularity to \u201cblonde jokes\u201d and are within an order of magnitude of \u201cknock knock jokes.\u201dInterestingly, Americans do not seem to seek out dark jokes even when they are suffering. Searches for jokes on uncomfortable topics are also lowest on Mondays. They also fell sharply after the Boston Marathon bombing.There is more evidence that distance from trauma is a necessary condition for joking about trauma. Return to \u201cdead baby jokes,\u201d but this time consider search rates around the world. The higher a country\u2019s infant mortality rate, the less it searches for \u201cdead baby jokes.\u201d In countries with the lowest infant mortality rates, 1 in 180 jokes searches is for \u201cdead baby jokes.\u201d In countries with the highest infant mortality rates, about 1 in 1,300 jokes searches is for \u201cdead baby jokes.\u201dIt is not clear exactly how to interpret this relationship, since Internet users in developing countries are not a representative sample. But the relationship is so strong, it does at least suggest that some exposure to a horror can substantially curtail jokes about it.Another interesting data point on the relationship between trauma and jokes is a search unusually popular among Hebrew speakers about one of history\u2019s most horrific events, which wiped out nearly half of my family. In Israel, \u201cHolocaust jokes\u201d is the 12th most popular Hebrew-language search for jokes.Holocaust jokes are extremely crude. An example \u2014 and this joke will disturb many readers: \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between a ton of coal and a thousand Jews? Jews burn longer.\u201dThe Google data shows that Jews seek out these jokes far more than anybody else. This seems to support a view of humor as helping people deal with extreme suffering and fear. But the timing of these searches reveals a more nuanced story.Hebrew-language searches for Holocaust jokes tend to be lowest when threats to Israel are highest. In June 2014, after three Israeli teenagers were kidnapped by Hamas operatives, Israelis\u2019 searches for Holocaust jokes dropped to their lowest level in more than five years.Our Google searches represent a small slice of how we consume humor. We also get laughs from TV shows, Facebook posts and even, I am told, face-to-face interaction. Other researchers will undoubtedly extend, clarify or overturn some of my findings.Even though these results are preliminary and sometimes contradictory, much of the data clearly does not fit with some traditional views of humor. Twain claims that there is no humor in heaven, and it may well be true that most comedians end up in hell. But if that\u2019s where they\u2019re headed, the joke will be on them. There is probably a greater demand for comedy in heaven.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "New York City Casts a Net to Catch the Next Big Start-Up", "Date": "2016-05-01", "News": "Supported byFor years, New York \u2014 a city not accustomed to being second banana \u2014 has looked on as Silicon Valley has solidified its influence over the technology industry.But the big hit \u2014 the next Google or Facebook or even Salesforce, a powerhouse in online services for business \u2014 has proved elusive.Tech:NYC has no set agenda yet. But its approach, said Julie Samuels, the executive director, will be to work early with city, state and federal officials on issues that affect tech companies, before laws are passed. Some broader issues like taxes, schools and affordable housing also help determine whether people want to work and live in a city.\u201cNew York is in a competition to be where start-ups are going to locate and bigger tech companies are going to grow second and third offices,\u201d Ms. Samuels said.The new organization arrives at a time when the path ahead for the local tech economy is uncertain. New York, it seems, has become fertile ground for start-ups, but has very few breakout winners.Silicon Valley venture firms suffered some of the biggest losses on those New York start-ups.Start-ups are inherently risky. That is why venture capital firms invest in a broad portfolio of companies, so a few winners can make up for the losers.In New York, it is not the setbacks that stand out as much as the scarcity of lucrative paydays \u2014 start-ups sold to the public or to other corporations for $1 billion or more.There have been a few over the years. In 2007, for example, Google paid $3.1 billion for DoubleClick, an online ad-serving service. In 2013, Yahoo bought Tumblr, a microblogging platform, for $1.1 billion. Last year, Etsy, an online marketplace for handmade and vintage goods, went public at a valuation of $1.8 billion, and traded above that for a while but has since retreated.Yet those are exceptions. \u201cBig exits really haven\u2019t happened yet in New York,\u201d said Fred Wilson, co-founder of Union Square Ventures, a New York venture capital firm. \u201cIt\u2019s a valid criticism.\u201dThat should gradually change, he argued, as the New York tech community matures. Mr. Wilson also said that New York entrepreneurs were influenced by the trading culture of Wall Street. They are more inclined, he said, to build a company, sell it, cash in and move to the next one than some Silicon Valley entrepreneurs who dream bigger and view their company as their life\u2019s work.New York ranked second over all, but was way behind by some measures. Compass estimated the value of all Bay Area start-ups \u2014 including sales to companies, public offerings and private valuations \u2014 at $264 billion to $323 billion. The comparable estimate for New York start-ups was $41 billion to $50 billion.Still, the New York tech economy has shown impressive job growth. An analysis by Jason Bram, a researcher at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, concluded that from 2007 to 2015 New York tech employment grew by more than 60 percent, to 126,170 workers. By contrast, tech employment in the Bay Area was more than 370,000 as of 2014, the most recent figure in the Fed analysis.The gap is hardly surprising, given Silicon Valley\u2019s decades-long head start and singular focus. \u201cTechnology innovation and entrepreneurship \u2014 that\u2019s our business in the Valley,\u201d said Steve Blank, an entrepreneur who lectures on technology and innovation at Stanford, Columbia and New York University.In New York, Mr. Blank said, \u201ctech start-ups have been layered on top of the city\u2019s existing industries,\u201d including advertising, media and finance.And tech giants like Facebook, Google and IBM have been aggressively hiring engineering talent for their New York outposts.Nathan Richardson, chief executive of Trade It, a financial technology start-up in New York, has worked in the Bay Area and in New York. Until recently, New York was regarded in Silicon Valley as a place to find business, advertising and web design talent.\u201cBut you didn\u2019t recruit engineers in New York,\u201d Mr. Richardson said. \u201cThat\u2019s changed dramatically.\u201dSprinklr works closely with the New York advertising and marketing community. \u201cWe\u2019re an ideal company to be here,\u201d said Ragy Thomas, its founder and chief executive. His start-up has raised $125 million in venture funding and is valued at $1 billion.So Infor was destined to relocate, and since it had hundreds of developers in the Bay Area, the board assumed the move would be there. \u201cThey thought I was crazy choosing New York, but they went along with it,\u201d recalled Mr. Phillips, once a senior executive at Oracle.New York, he figured, was closer to many of its corporate customers, making in-person meetings more convenient. And because Infor\u2019s software was being overhauled for ease of use, he has hired software developers from New York advertising companies and fashion houses as well as the Parsons School of Design and the Fashion Institute of Technology.\u201cWe\u2019ve picked up some great programmers who understand design,\u201d Mr. Phillips said. \u201cAnd I wanted my engineers to be around people who weren\u2019t all engineers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That includes Spain, where officials have demanded the company not inform websites when links to web pages are removed from certain online searches, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because discussions with the regulator were continuing. Google has made a practice of informing websites when links are removed, which critics contend is an effort to rally support against Europe\u2019s privacy ruling. Google has not yet complied with the Spanish demands.A spokesman for the Spanish privacy regulator declined to comment.In France, Google\u2019s appeal, which will be heard by the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat, the country\u2019s highest administrative court, in the coming months, is unlikely to resolve the continuing standoff over people\u2019s right to privacy online. A decision in the case is expected next year.Speaking at a conference in Berlin last month, Peter Fleischer, Google\u2019s global privacy counsel, said that he believed Europe\u2019s highest court would eventually have to rule on whether the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d decision should be applied worldwide.\u201cThe European Court of Justice has established itself as a formidable institution in the privacy debate in Europe and the rest of the world,\u201d he said.A decision, and potential fine, in the antitrust search case may be announced as soon as next month.Advertisement"}

On average, Europeans pay roughly half as much for their monthly cellphone contracts as Americans do, according to the GSMA, an industry group.\u201cThe collapse of the deal leaves both Three and O2 in a precarious position with uncertain futures in the U.K.,\u201d said Kester Mann, a London-based analyst with the research company CCS Insight. \u201cIt also casts serious doubt over the future structure of a European telecoms sector that had banked on the tie-up paving the way to further consolidation.\u201dSuch deals, however, remain mostly out of bounds in Europe, where lawmakers have prioritized consumer choice, including access to at least four telecom operators in many countries, over consolidation.As part of its decision on Wednesday, the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, said the takeover would have \u201cremoved an important competitor.\u201d It added that \u201creduced competition\u201d would probably have led to higher prices and lower quality on mobile services.Telef\u00f3nica and Hutchison Whampoa had offered concessions, including allowing access to their networks to competitors, in an effort to win approval for the deal.Hutchison Whampoa said in a statement that it was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by the commission\u2019s decision, and that it would consider a legal challenge.The decision to block the merger has already prompted other telecom and cable operators to circle O2. Companies that appear interested in picking up the British carrier include Liberty Global, the cable operator controlled by the American billionaire John C. Malone; and Iliad, a French carrier.In a conference call with analysts last week, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda \u00c1lvarez-Pallete L\u00f3pez, Telef\u00f3nica\u2019s executive chairman, said that, regardless of the commission\u2019s decision, his company had a \u201cvery comfortable\u201d cash position that meant it would not need to rush into deciding what to do with O2.Raphael Minder contributed reporting from Madrid.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Leaked Questions Rekindle Debate Over Common Core Tests", "Date": "2016-05-24", "News": "Supported byThe questions, taken from a Common Core fourth-grade reading test, came to a Columbia professor in an email from an anonymous teacher, part of a blistering critique of the exam. The professor put the questions and the critique on her blog, and before she knew it, her posting ignited on the Internet, fueling a new round of anger about nationwide standardized testing.As fast as the company that manages the tests played Whac-a-Mole, trying to get the questions taken down, teachers, parents and education experts kept spreading them on blogs and Twitter \u2014 despite the fact that the questions are still being used in testing. Some argued that robust public discussion of test items and their shortcomings was the best way to ensure better tests.\u201cFair testing cannot exist if test questions are publicly available before the tests are administered,\u201d she said.\u201cWhen items leak, it costs a lot to come up with new items,\u201d Mr. Petrilli said.He added that he was puzzled by the continued anti-testing backlash, given that, under the new law, most states are not using test results for teacher evaluations or school quality judgments.The opponents of standardized testing also say PARCC Inc.\u2019s push to remove items from Google and Twitter was overreaching because many of the posts on Twitter and later on blogs only referred or linked to the questions and did not include their actual language.Ms. Reams said the company was trying to protect the integrity of the questions by cutting off access to the links to them.The teacher who leaked the questions said in the original post that she was providing the material anonymously over concerns about \u201cintense legal ramifications,\u201d but felt compelled to tell others how \u201cthe high-stakes accountability system has deformed teaching and warped learning in many public schools across the United States.\u201dThe teacher said the questions were inappropriate for fourth graders, exceeding any reasonable grade-level standards.For example, the teacher wrote, one question prompted children to write an essay using passages from a book on sharks that is considered at sixth- or seventh-grade reading level, and of interest to students in the ninth to 12th grade.Ms. Reams said that, although the book in question was for older children, the passage was grade appropriate.Professor Oyler said in an interview that she had not thought much about the fact that the test was still in use when she posted the questions.\u201cI was so angry when I saw the items that I wasn\u2019t thinking about protecting the company. I was thinking about the importance of the public knowing what is going on in the name of accountability,\u201d she said.\u201cThese tests can determine which middle school you get into, whether you graduate, whether you\u2019re retained for a year, so people need to know that the criteria we\u2019re using for these huge life decisions are valid,\u201d she said.Ms. Reams said PARCC Inc. had the highest degree of transparency of any of the companies developing state assessment tests, with 800 past questions released. She said the group planned to release one-third of this year\u2019s questions, once the testing season has ended.Still, the chief executive of PARCC Inc., Laura McGiffert Slover, emailed Professor Oyler on May 12 asking her to remove the items, which she said were covered by copyright, and offering to waive any damage claim if the professor would turn over information about the anonymous teacher. Professor Oyler removed the questions from her blog but did not identify their source.\u201cA lot of people are upset that they\u2019re making such a fetish of this,\u201d Dr. Ravitch said. \u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019re trying to put a blanket over any discussion of their test.\u201dRobert A. Schaeffer, the public education director of FairTest, the National Center for Fair and Open Testing, shared the PARCC Inc. critique on email lists reaching thousands of teachers.

{"Headline": "Giving New Doctors the Tools They Need", "Date": "2016-05-12", "News": "They say if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. I wonder, then, why my toolbox often seems so inadequate for fixing my patients.I open one recent afternoon in clinic with a middle-aged man I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come to know well. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s drunk. His breath smells of alcohol and he slurs his words. He tells me his brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in jail, his mother died, and he punched a neighbor who tried to steal his wallet. In the past year, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been admitted to the hospital countless times for everything from falling to getting injured in a fight to failing to take his medications.I search for mental health and substance use resources we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t yet exhausted. I speak briefly with a psychiatrist and case manager and a social worker who is arranging transportation back to the housing he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in danger of being thrown out of.\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaybe we increase his mood-stabilizer?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I offer, mostly just to say something. When all you have is a hammer\u00e2\u0080\u00a6The afternoon doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get easier. I see a patient whose heart failure had been in good control with a telemedicine service that had checked his weight at home and adjusted his medications accordingly. But the service has been cancelled, and now he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in our clinic, gasping for air as fluid fills his lungs.He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s followed by an older man who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been on opioid painkillers for a decade \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and who I now suspect is selling extra pills on the street. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m running 45 minutes late by the time I greet an understandably frustrated woman who, a computer alert informs me, is overdue for her first colonoscopy. She balks when I bring it up, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the words or the time to convince her otherwise.The afternoon was not unusual. At the end of most days, I find myself searching for nails that I can hammer.Part of the problem is the tool kit we assemble during medical training. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re educated largely in a biomedical framework. We diagnose disease with textbook knowledge and prescribe medications because those are the hammers we have.But consider the skills I would need to be more effective in just this one clinic session: understanding social issues that contribute to health; marshaling support resources like case management, social work and rehabilitation centers; exploring my patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 values and goals and encouraging behavior change; leading interdisciplinary care teams; employing new technologies and methods of patient engagement like telemedicine; and appreciating how health systems fit together to influence an individual patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s care \u00e2\u0080\u0094 from home care and community centers to clinics and hospitals. None have traditionally been emphasized in medical education \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and, unsurprisingly, doctors in training like myself are often ill-equipped to practice in today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health care environment.Medicine has long been a discipline predicated on memorization, which made sense in a world of textbooks, microscopes and information monopoly. But rooting medical training primarily in knowledge acquisition is increasingly insufficient and inefficient. In an era of big data, Google and iPhones, doctors don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t so much need to know as they need to access, synthesize and apply. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re increasingly asked to consider not just patients, but communities. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re expected to practice not as individuals, but as team members. And now \u00e2\u0080\u0094 liberated from carrying every diagnostic and treatment detail around in our heads \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we have both the responsibility and the luxury of deciding what a doctor should be in the 21st century.Some medical educators are trying to figure it out, with a greater emphasis on new technologies, collaborative care, wellness and community health.Instead of traditional lecture halls, Dell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s students will learn in collaborative workspaces with a curriculum that emphasizes team-based management of patients. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take weekly classes with pharmacy, nursing, social work and engineering students.

Then say, O.K., given those needs, what should doctors and the medical system look like in the future?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe recognize the importance of providing care in alternate settings,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Dr. Edward Ellison, who is helping to oversee the creation of the school. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take care of you when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sick. But we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll also help you stay healthy when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re home.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhile most medical schools are trying to get students out of lecture halls and into hospitals, Kaiser Permanente hopes to get students out of hospitals and into communities. Students will visit patients in their homes to see how they live and what behavior change looks like in living rooms instead of hospital rooms. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll also be trained as emergency medical technicians \u00e2\u0080\u0094 riding in ambulances alongside other medical professionals, responding to accidents, violence and trauma in their communities.Older physicians, medical educators, policy makers and patients will continue to debate what doctors should be taught and what they should know.

{"Headline": "Oracle-Google Dispute Goes to Heart of Open-Source Software", "Date": "2016-05-19", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The Greek philosopher Aristotle described man as a rational animal. If only software were so easy to define.On the witness stand in the federal courthouse here Thursday morning, Larry Page, the chief executive of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, offered metaphysical musings regarding the nature of software as a lawyer for Oracle Corporation questioned him about the creation of the world\u2019s most popular smartphone operating system, Android.Oracle says Google, the search giant, uses copyrighted material in 11,000 of its 13 million lines of software code in Android, and wants $9 billion from Google. Google says it made fair use of that code and owes nothing.Mr. Page, known for his love of big technology ideas, questioned whether lines of software that declare how the rest of its actions will work are really software.\u201cFor me, declaring code is not code,\u201d he said, offering a philosophical view of software that may be common among Google engineers but stands a good chance of confounding nearly everyone else.The copyrights that are crucial to the trial are related to open-source software, which is created and shared for general use. Open-source technology is at the heart of many current innovations, from Google\u2019s Android to the hardware going into giant cloud-computing data centers.\u201cThe open-source community will heave a huge sigh of relief if Google wins, and will be very worried if Oracle wins,\u201d said Pamela Samuelson, professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cIt will have a chilling effect.\u201dShould Oracle prevail, Mr. Page could lose a significant chunk of his company\u2019s $75.3 billion in cash. Since Android became a product in 2007, Oracle estimates Google has made $21 billion in profit from it. A verdict in favor of Oracle could also lead to a new way for older companies that built giant businesses from licensed software to make money.Speaking on the witness stand earlier in the week, Safra A. Catz, the co-chief executive of Oracle, called Java, the open-source product Google is accused of taking, \u201cthe single most important asset Oracle acquired\u201d in its 39-year history, and spoke of billions in lost revenue as a result of Google\u2019s actions. Oracle picked up Java when it purchased Sun Microsystems for $7.4 billion in 2010.The fight between Oracle and Google began that year as a patent and copyright dispute, and in one phase or another it has involved many of the best-known names of Silicon Valley.The initial case was decided largely in favor of Google in 2012, and the patent claims were dismissed. But in 2014 a federal appeals court found certain parts of Java were protected by copyright. When the Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal of that decision last year, the case was sent back to federal court.This trial, which began last week, has followed a tangle of careers as well as code. Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Alphabet, testified on his time working on Java when he was at Sun, and his knowledge of Apple\u2019s iPhone developments when he sat on the Apple board. Andy Rubin, who led the Android efforts at Google and also testified, had worked at Apple early in his career, and used Java at Danger, another phone company he co-founded. Mr. Rubin has since left Google, and is working on robots and artificial intelligence.Lawrence J. Ellison, co-founder and now executive chairman of Oracle, appeared in a taped deposition about acquiring assets of Sun. Though it was not mentioned in the testimony, Sun fell on hard times after the dot-com boom largely because of competition from another open-source software project, Linux.Mr. Ellison was also close friends with Steven P. Jobs, Apple\u2019s co-founder, who was outraged when Google revealed its plans for an iPhone competitor that looked a lot like the iPhone.There were even glimpses of frosty social exchanges. Ms. Catz testified to running into Google\u2019s corporate lawyer at a bat mitzvah. \u201c\u2018Google is a very innovative company,\u2019\u201d she recalled him saying. \u201c\u2018The old rules do not apply to us.\u2019\u201d\u201cI immediately said, \u2018Thou shalt not steal,\u2019\u201d she said on the stand.The jury was allowed to spend the weekend with what appeared to be notebooks full of notes on code, corporate strategy and the economics of software. Whatever the jurors decide, both sides have indicated another appeal is likely.Ultimately, Ms. Samuelson said, the Supreme Court should hear some aspect of the case, if only to clarify what she termed \u201cincredibly important, the first significant software copyright case in 10 years.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Podcasts Surge, but Producers Fear Apple Isn\u2019t Listening", "Date": "2016-05-07", "News": "Supported bySteven P. Jobs put his talent as a master salesman to the test when, in 2005, he introduced new Apple software for downloading digital audio shows. The format was so incipient that he struggled to describe it.\u201cIt\u2019s sort of like TiVo, for radio, for your iPod,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the \u2018Wayne\u2019s World\u2019 of radio, but real radio is jumping onto this.\u201dBut he was clear about the potential. \u201cIt\u2019s getting very, very exciting,\u201d he said.He was talking about podcasting \u2014 radio-style shows made for the Internet that have, in recent years, exploded in popularity. These days, many amateur podcasters are going professional. Major media organizations, searching for answers and bright spots in a fast-changing and confusing digital world, are releasing new shows every week. Advertisers are starting to follow them, and so are millions of dollars of venture capital.It is, in other words, an industry now, one that Apple essentially gave life to and still dominates. Yet at this moment of triumph for podcasting, concerns are growing in the community about how much Apple actually cares.Interviews with over two dozen podcasters and people inside Apple reveal a variety of complaints. The podcasters say that they are relegated to wooing a single Apple employee for the best promotion. That sharing on social media is cumbersome. And that for podcasters to make money, they need more information about their listeners, and Apple is in a unique position to provide it. The problems, they say, could even open up an opportunity for a competitor.\u201cThe lack of podcast data is kind of shocking,\u201d said Gina Delvac, the producer of \u201cCall Your Girlfriend,\u201d a popular show about pop culture and politics.Late last month, Apple brought seven leading podcast professionals to the company\u2019s campus in Cupertino, Calif., to air their case to a room full of employees, according to two people who were there. The people would speak only on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. The company made no promises, the people said, but several pressing issues for podcasters were discussed in frank terms.After the presentations concluded, Eddy Cue, the executive at Apple who oversees software and services, arrived for a closed session with the company\u2019s employees, according to the attendees.\u201cI think everyone who\u2019s seriously involved in this space, they\u2019d at least like to know what the endgame is,\u201d said Chris Morrow, the chief executive of the Loud Speakers Podcast Network. \u201cPeople think there\u2019s another shoe that\u2019s going to drop.\u201dBut podcasting is a product of a different era for digital media \u2014 and for Apple. When Mr. Jobs introduced the updated podcast software in 2005, the company was still in comeback mode, driven by iPods. The iPhone wouldn\u2019t come out for two more years.Now Apple is the biggest public company in the world, but podcasts bring Apple virtually nothing in direct revenue. Perhaps as a result, the iTunes podcasting hub that Mr. Jobs introduced remains strikingly unchanged. Sharing on social media, which basically didn\u2019t exist in 2005, takes multiple clicks.Promotion within iTunes, which is still one of the only reliable ways to build an audience, particularly for a new show, is decided by a small team that fields pitches and does its own outreach. Interviews with people inside and outside the company make it clear that Apple\u2019s small podcast team has been hearing \u2014 and assuaging \u2014 such concerns for years.The question for podcasters \u2014 and for Apple \u2014 is about what comes next. Apple has at least two obvious choices: to rush to accommodate an industry that is quickly outgrowing its origins, or to let podcasting be, at the risk of losing its claim over a medium that owes its very name to the company.Even podcasters are conflicted; a hands-off Apple retains some appeal. \u201cSome would argue that it could have advanced in certain ways,\u201d said Andy Bowers, chief content officer of Slate\u2019s Panoply podcast network. But since 2005, he said, \u201cthey\u2019ve provided a remarkably level playing field.\u201dIn a statement, Mr. Cue of Apple said, \u201cWe have more people than ever focused on podcasting, including engineers, editors and programmers.\u201d He added, \u201cPodcasts hold a special place with us at Apple.\u201dIn terms of revenue, podcasting is still minuscule compared with the technology and entertainment industries. In the early days, hobbyists grew passion projects into businesses and full-time jobs. Now a few established podcast networks and popular podcasters have millions in revenue.Podcasters can sell advertisements at rates ranging from $20 to $100 for every thousand listeners. For podcasts with hundreds of thousands of listeners \u2014 and, in rare cases, millions \u2014 those numbers add up. The spending on advertisements will generate hundreds of millions of dollars for the industry this year, said Matt Lieber, a co-founder of Gimlet Media, a podcasting start-up that has raised $7.5 million from venture capitalists.Expanding the industry much more, though, gets tricky. Apple does not allow shows to charge people to download episodes, for example, and does not support paid subscriptions, as many podcasters would like. Apple has stuck with an advertising model for podcasting that looks almost exactly like what Mr. Jobs predicted onstage in 2005.Measuring how many people listen is also inconsistent and a regular source of frustration. Podcasters know how many times their podcasts are downloaded, for example, but they don\u2019t know how many people actually listened, or how far those listeners might have gotten.With data like listener counts and listening duration \u2014 similar to what Apple provides app developers \u2014 the industry could accelerate quickly, said Ms. Delvac of \u201cCall Your Girlfriend.\u201dBut unlike with downloads of music, movies and apps \u2014 sources of billions of dollars of revenue for Apple, which takes a cut from sales and subscriptions \u2014 the company\u2019s financial incentive in podcasting is limited. The company takes no cut from podcast advertising, and all podcast downloads are free, so there is no cut to take from that, either. As it stands, podcasting is effectively just one more free feature to help the company sell hardware.And it\u2019s a popular one. Apple\u2019s service now contains over 325,000 podcasts. The company expects users to listen to 10 billion episodes in its apps \u2014 on computers, mobile devices and on Apple TV \u2014 by the end of the year.\u201cApple built this village 10 years ago,\u201d Mr. Lieber said. \u201cThere\u2019s really interesting things in the village, and interesting characters. But the village now has the population of a city \u2014 and when a village becomes a city, you need new infrastructure.\u201dApple\u2019s conservative approach may be creating an opportunity for competitors, as has happened before. Apple\u2019s iTunes software helped popularize online music, only to watch streaming services like Spotify and Pandora create compelling alternatives. Apple pressured the television and film industries to sell, and rent, their content online; then Netflix built subscription streaming into a business worth nearly $40 billion.Google abandoned a podcast app in 2012, but this year it added a podcast features to its music app, which is included with smartphones that run the company\u2019s Android operating system. Todd Cochrane, chief executive of RawVoice, a company that tracks podcasts, said Apple\u2019s share of podcast listeners is now about 65 percent, down from 70 percent a year ago. He attributed that change almost entirely to an \u201cupsurge\u201d in listening on Android.In January, Spotify, the streaming music service, began rolling out an ambitious slate of podcasts. Among the company\u2019s promises to podcasters: hosting, streaming and extensive listening data. Audible, the audiobook service owned by the notoriously aggressive Amazon, is investing heavily in original audio content under the guidance of Eric Nuzum, a former vice president at National Public Radio. (The New York Times is among the partners working with Audible.)\u201cWe\u2019re actively distributing our content in many different places right now,\u201d said Laura Walker, president and chief executive of New York Public Radio, whose podcasts include \u201cRadiolab,\u201d \u201cFreakonomics\u201d and \u201c2 Dope Queens.\u201d \u201cEverything is growing.\u201dApple\u2019s stance as the giant of the industry remains undisputed, though, and podcasters are left to navigate a complicated relationship with the company. Most send messages to the company at a general email address. To those who have direct contact, their relationship centers on one person: Steve Wilson.Mr. Wilson, podcasters say, acts as Apple\u2019s de facto podcast gatekeeper. Attention from him can be the difference between a hit and a dud \u2014 and between a podcast that pays and one that doesn\u2019t.The most consistent major source of new listeners \u2014 in some cases, tens of thousands \u2014 is a top spot on iTunes and Apple\u2019s podcast app. That is the real estate that Mr. Wilson helps oversee, and that podcasters covet. (Mr. Wilson directed a request for an interview to a company publicist, who declined to make him available for an interview.)\u201cAs far as I can tell they\u2019re huge podcasts enthusiasts,\u201d said Jody Avirgan, who hosts and produces podcasts for the ESPN data journalism site FiveThirtyEight. \u201cBut you\u2019re trying to cram thousands of new shows into, what, six things that get featured on the home page?\u201dMr. Wilson\u2019s identity and contact information are shared among podcasters like a juicy secret, and his podcast preferences are furtively debated in the industry, as are those of his boss, James Boggs. Mostly, it makes podcasters wonder: At a company the size of Apple, what does it mean that American podcasters are left to lobby a single person?From Apple\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s not that simple. Of the more than 150 iTunes podcast portals around the world, 29 have hand-edited selections and Steve Wilsons of their own. Any change to the way Apple handles podcasting could have wide ramifications.Additionally, the \u201cTop Podcast\u201d list within iTunes is also the subject of constant speculation among podcasters.

{"Headline": "After a Round With the Widowmaker, a Golfer Enjoys a More Familiar Grind", "Date": "2016-05-07", "News": "Supported byCHARLOTTE, N.C. \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d Jason Bohn told his caddie on Friday as he rummaged through his golf bag outside the Quail Hollow clubhouse. \u201cI\u2019m planning to stick around for a while.\u201d Bohn was referring to his plans in the immediate aftermath of a missed cut at the Wells Fargo Championship, but he might have been talking about his long-term prognosis after a heart attack at the Honda Classic in February. As chilling as it is for Bohn to consider, if he had failed to make the cut at the Honda at the end of February, he very likely would not have survived to celebrate his 43rd birthday on April 24. He said that had he not parred the last four holes at PGA National, a treacherous stretch, to make the cut with no strokes to spare, he would have showered, packed his suitcase, checked out of his room at the on-site hotel and headed to the airport for the next flight to Atlanta, where he lives in the suburbs with his wife, Tewana, and their sons, Conner and Cameron. \u201cI would have never gotten checked out if I hadn\u2019t made the cut,\u201d Bohn said. \u201cI just didn\u2019t think it was severe enough.\u201dBut with two more rounds ahead of him, Bohn asked to see a doctor, hoping for an infusion of energy. He expected to be sent on his way after receiving an antibiotic for the bronchitis that had laid him low the week before. But when the paramedics arrived at his side and looked at an electrocardiogram, they said they needed to get him to the hospital posthaste. Further testing at the catheterization laboratory at Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center revealed that Bohn\u2019s left anterior descending artery, commonly known as the widowmaker, was 99 percent blocked.The next day, instead of playing his third round, Bohn underwent a procedure in which a stent was used to open his blocked artery. After a six-week convalescence, Bohn, a two-time PGA Tour winner, returned and has made one cut in three starts.\u201cMy physicians said that if I hadn\u2019t asked for a doctor, I probably would have died either in the hotel room or on the plane,\u201d Bohn said. \u201cYou hear of people saying, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t feel real well, I\u2019m just going to go lay down,\u2019 and then they never wake up. That\u2019s kind of the position I was in.\u201dIn retrospect, Bohn said, he should have known his heart might be a ticking bomb. After his first round of the Honda Classic, he experienced a tightness in his chest that caused him to type \u201cchest pressure\u201d in a Google search. He stopped scanning the results when his eyes fell on what he thought was the most plausible explanation. \u201cIt said when bronchitis turns to pneumonia there can be that sensation of pressure in your chest,\u201d Bohn said. \u201cI didn\u2019t notice anything about a heart attack.\u201d Then again, you do not see what you are not looking for. His family had no history of heart disease, Bohn said. Or so they thought. After his hospitalization, Bohn\u2019s 72-year-old mother, Carol, decided to move up her annual checkup. She has a healthy diet and an exercise regimen that includes daily walks. \u201cShe\u2019s the last person you\u2019d expect to have anything wrong with her heart,\u201d Bohn said.His mother had an EKG and an echocardiogram. Neither showed any abnormalities. Her doctor recommended an exercise stress test, which she completed the week her son returned to competition at the RBC Heritage in Hilton Head Island, S.C. Bohn had just grinded to shoot a 69 to make the cut when he received a call from his mother. \u201cShe said, \u2018I\u2019m in the hospital, my doctors are saying I have a lot of blockage,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. Three days later, Bohn\u2019s mother underwent triple bypass surgery.Bohn became emotional at the thought that his health scare might have indirectly saved his mother\u2019s life.\u201cI\u2019d have a heart attack every week to save my mom,\u201d he said.Since Bohn\u2019s return to golf, friends and strangers alike have told him that his health scare motivated them to get physicals. His fellow competitors have wrestled with their own mortality.Johnson Wagner, who played in a group with Bohn in the first two rounds of the Honda Classic, said: \u201cI remember seeing him in the locker room after the second round, and he looked exhausted, like he had grinded on a tough golf course to make the cut on the number. Then I found out an hour and a half later he had had a heart attack and actually was in the middle of it the entire time.\u201dWagner recalled Bohn\u2019s approach on 17 in the second round of the Honda Classic. It was a gutsy shot to a difficult pin that Bohn pulled off. He reacted by clutching his chest and stumbling backward. At the time, Wagner had assumed Bohn was playing to the gallery \u2014 and on Friday, Bohn said he had been \u2014 but from now on, whenever he sees a competitor react like that, he will involuntarily shudder.Wagner was so shaken, he vowed to give up tobacco because it elevates his heart rate. But what can he do about competition, which also makes his heart race?\u201cI feel like, since Jason\u2019s incident, I\u2019ve been on the cut line every week, and I feel like I\u2019m having a heart attack,\u201d he said. \u201cNot to make light of his situation, but it makes me wonder. I\u2019ve actually panicked about it a little bit. I think, Am I having a heart attack or is it just nerves and the moment?\u201d While he was away, Bohn missed the tingling limbs, the lightheadedness, the feeling of the club resting heavy in his hands as he prepared to pull off a difficult shot in the heat of competition. \u201cIn Hilton Head, I was really grinding to make the cut,\u201d Bohn said, \u201cand, man, I really felt it.\u201dThat sensation, he added, is what he loves most about golf.\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily the wins, because you come out on top very few times unless you\u2019re some people,\u201d Bohn said. \u201cI think it\u2019s the feelings of the grind, when you have a difficult shot and you execute it. That\u2019s what everyone is so hooked on.\u201dIn moments of high stress on the golf course, Bohn said, he does not worry that what he is feeling is the onset of another heart attack.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty amazing,\u201d he said. \u201cMy cardiologists and everybody have built me a great level of comfort to know that I probably will never have another one.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated when the Honda Classic occurred. It was in February, not March.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Prevails as Jury Rebuffs Oracle in Code Copyright Case", "Date": "2016-05-26", "News": "Supported byA jury ruled in favor of Google on Thursday in a long legal dispute with Oracle over software used to power most of the world\u2019s smartphones.Oracle contended that Google used copyrighted material in 11,000 of its 13 million lines of software code in Android, its mobile phone operating system. Oracle asked for $9 billion from Google. Google said it made fair use of that code and owed nothing.The victory for Google cheered other software developers, who operate much the way Google did when it comes to so-called open-source software. Unlike traditional software created by corporations and tightly held, open-source products are released, often with some restrictions, for anyone to use and modify.\u201cGreat news for progress and innovation,\u201d Chris Dixon, a technology investor with Andreessen Horowitz, the venture capital firm, posted on Twitter after the verdict.Android relies in part on Java, an open-source software language that Oracle acquired when it bought Sun Microsystems for $7.4 billion in 2010. Oracle argued that Google executives violated Oracle\u2019s copyright by using aspects of Java without permission.William Fitzgerald, a Google spokesman, said in a statement that the verdict \u201crepresents a win for the Android ecosystem, for the Java programming community and for software developers who rely on open and free programming languages to build innovative consumer products.\u201dThe courtroom fight was something of a watershed for technology and could offer clarity on legal rules surrounding open-source technology, which is used in everything from smartphones and digital recording devices to the software that runs many of the world\u2019s biggest data centers.People who work with open-source technology worried that a victory for Oracle would have led other companies to make similar demands of open-source products.While there is an expectation in open-source projects that the software tweaks of others will be given back to the community working on the software, open source often requires a license as well.But where software licenses typically forbid touching code or sharing code with anyone, open-source licenses usually insist on sharing. They detail what can and cannot be used by other companies in their products. And they often require people to share their work with other developers.The idea is that, collectively, people working at many companies or even out of their homes or college dorms can build better technology than what is created behind the closed doors of one corporation.From the start, this was a trial neither side intended. Oracle first sued Google in 2010, accusing it of patent and copyright violations in Android. The outcome of that case, which was decided in 2012, was largely favorable to Google.But in 2014, a federal appeals court found that certain parts of Java were protected by copyright, providing Oracle with fresh ammunition. When the Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal of that decision last year, the case was sent back to the lower courts to hear the copyright aspect of the case again.In this iteration of the courtroom fight, Eric E. Schmidt, executive chairman of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, testified that Sun knew Google was using Java and approved of that use even though Google did not obtain a license. Jonathan Schwartz, who was chief executive of Sun before Oracle bought it, backed up that view, and a blog post he wrote praising Android was a major piece of evidence in the trial.Oracle provided a series of emails and meeting documents that countered that view, suggesting that Larry Page, a founder of Google and chief executive of Alphabet, had pressed the Android team to develop the product quickly. Mr. Page denied the suggestion on the stand.The particular areas of copyright protection in Java involved the so-called declaring code in Application Programming Interfaces, or A.P.I.s., which have become the common way that networked programs on the Internet share data.Declaring code establishes standards and meanings by which future lines of software, the actual effects the software seeks to create, will operate. This distinction compelled the 10 jurors \u2014 eight women and two men \u2014 to hear extensive testimony by engineers and economists about the nature of code, and the copyrightable implications of this type of creativity.Dorian Daley, Oracle\u2019s general counsel, said the company planned to appeal. \u201cWe strongly believe that Google developed Android by illegally copying core Java technology to rush into the mobile device market,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cOracle brought this lawsuit to put a stop to Google\u2019s illegal behavior.\u201dSome lawyers cautioned against viewing the verdict as a green light for the type of software development Google performed, saying that the earlier federal appeals court decision validated the idea that A.P.I.s can be copyrighted.\u201cI don\u2019t think the industry can sit back and rely on this decision and exhale and say these things won\u2019t be protected,\u201d said Christopher Carani, a lawyer at McAndrews, Held & Malloy. \u201cI think what you\u2019re still going to see is a lot more attention paid to securing approval to use other copyrights before the fact.\u201dFor spectators, the historic trial was also a rare look at Silicon Valley history. Not only did Mr. Schmidt work at both Sun and Google, he sat on the board of Apple Computer when Apple was developing the iPhone, leading him to say he recused himself from knowledge of the iPhone when it was clear Android would be a competing product.Andy Rubin, who led the Android project at Google, worked at Apple early in his career and later developed a type of multifunction phone, which had a Java license. Oracle\u2019s executive chairman, Lawrence J. Ellison, who appeared in video testimony, was friends with Steve Jobs, who led development of the iPhone, and Scott McNealy, a founder and the chief executive of Sun before Mr. Schwartz.While the jury may now rest, the court fight will probably continue. The case could go to the Supreme Court, though it was unclear whether the court would rule definitively on copyright, said Pamela Samuelson, a professor at the School of Law and the School of Information at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cThey don\u2019t usually like to go against what the appeals court established,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

A movie that will make a stop at the Cannes Film Festival but will not be shown until 2115. A tour of a chateau.These may sound like itinerary ideas for a particularly upscale European jaunt, but each is actually an advertisement for a high-end liquor company. In an attempt to attract customers, especially much-desired millennials, premium spirit brands are often eschewing traditional marketing in favor of more imaginative promotions.Millennials are \u201cnot about acquiring products, but about acquiring experiences,\u201d said Mauricio Vergara, the chief marketing officer in North America for Bacardi.The concept of a French bakery that transforms into a Riviera beach club is a main feature of a new campaign that begins on Monday from Grey Goose, a superpremium brand from Bacardi.Titled \u201cGrey Goose Boulangerie Bleue,\u201d the bakery-beach clubs are popping up in over 20 locations around the world through September, including the Cannes Film Festival; the United States Open in New York; and summer hot spots like the Hamptons, Ibiza and Marbella. Chefs identified by Slow Food International will prepare brunch, lunch and dinner dishes served with Le Grand Fizz, Grey Goose\u2019s first signature summer cocktail, made with elderflower liqueur, lime juice and soda. Admission to the clubs will be by invitation only.\u201cHow you connect with people these days is different than five years ago,\u201d said Dan Leahy, global content director for Johnnie Walker. \u201cThere\u2019s a rightful expectation that you can play with brands, interact with brands, and the brands should take a point of view, they should contribute tangibly to the world. It\u2019s a natural evolution from television being the primary medium, one-way. The Internet allows more access to information, more ways to participate.\u201dAccording to Dan Sanborn, senior vice president of culture and partnerships for Diageo North America, which counts Johnnie Walker as one of its brands, one advantage of the spirits category is that the drinks are often \u201cexperienced at a bar, a football game, at home with friends,\u201d and therefore \u201cpart of celebratory moments.\u201dBecause the brands connect with consumers in varied places, \u201cit\u2019s forced us to think about new and different ways to engage\u201d with them, he said.Since the movie was announced in November, the safe housing it has been touring the world; it will be displayed at the Majestic Hotel in Cannes later this month and then travel to Johannesburg, Chicago and Dallas before returning to Cognac.According to Ludovic du Plessis, global executive director for Louis XIII, the film was inspired by the fact that the cognac\u2019s creators never experience the fruits of their labor. Although he said its promotion is aimed at drinkers of all ages, it is a \u201cway to talk to millennials by not giving them instant gratification. It provokes their imagination. With Google, you can find everything. We are forcing them to stop everything and think.\u201dLouis XIII also is giving its aficionados the opportunity \u2014 for 1,000 euros, or about $1,140, per person \u2014 to visit its estate and tour its blending and aging cellars.Similarly, Courvoisier cognac, a less-expensive brand from Beam Suntory, is offering new tours of Paris and expanded tour options at its chateau in Jarnac, France, the latter priced from \u20ac12 to \u20ac250.Last year, \u201cKeep walking,\u201d the longstanding advertising tag line of Johnnie Walker, inspired Daniel Titz and Dorian Lebherz, two German film school students, to make a 90-second commercial as part of their coursework. The film, about two Scotch-drinking brothers on the Isle of Skye in Scotland, has been viewed more than four million times on YouTube.Mr. Leahy, who said Johnnie Walker was not aware the students were making the spot, called it a \u201creally beautiful piece of work.\u201d Johnnie Walker did not pay the students for the commercial, but Mr. Leahy said the brand and the students \u201cwere committed to each other\u201d to collaborate in the future.MaryLeigh Bliss, chief content officer of Ypulse, a youth-oriented market research company, said it was \u201cvery smart\u201d for Johnnie Walker \u201cto look at the kind of marketing young creatives are making themselves, to use that and make it part of their brand\u2019s process.\u201dSeveral years ago, the company released a report saying that millennials generally pass over \u201cmaterial luxury goods\u201d in favor of \u201csocial experiences.\u201d The report concluded that \u201cwhat has stood the test of time as both a symbol of status and luxury for this generation is experiences, and fundamentally, broadcasting them,\u201d through social media.And while millennials are having these experiences, liquor companies are hoping they will have a drink, too.Advertisement"}

An outsider\u2019s insider, in other words.The night had started five hours earlier.Mr. Hilton, who has a closely shaved head, faintly bounced into the dining room. He was clad, as always, in a T-shirt (this one was black, festooned with white flecks that appeared, at a distance, to be stars), blue corduroys and red-striped white sneakers that bore the label Crowdpac \u2014 the nonpartisan political-crowd-funding site that Mr. Hilton founded with two partners.The room quickly filled with journalists, pollsters and think-tank pundits. A C-Span cameraman jostled for position.\u201cSuch an illustrious crew \u2014 it reminds me of something,\u201d Mr. Hilton said, as guests pressed up against a table laden with sushi. He began to read: \u201cWhen the corporate bosses, the members of Congress, the journalists \u2014 and the authors of books like this \u2014 all go to the same dinner parties and galas and live in the same neighborhoods of Washington, New York and San Francisco, an insular ruling elite precipitates. \u2026 Regardless of who\u2019s in office, the same people are in power.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s great to see you all here,\u201d he deadpanned, looking up. The crowd laughed.Mr. Hilton said that his book calls for radical change, from top-down government (more power to ultralocal, neighborhood government) to schools (no \u201cfactory schools,\u201d a reconsideration of testing). A single social worker, for example, for a family in need.It opens with an anecdote about a JetBlue flight trapped on the tarmac and regulations that required a mother to deny her young daughter the bathroom. Mr. Hilton, the son of Hungarians who fled Communism, invoked Hannah Arendt and inhuman systems, before turning to questions.\u201cWho are the enemies of your ideas?\u201d Steve Clemons of The Atlantic asked.Mr. Hilton spoke about decentralizing concentrations of power, including, perhaps, breaking up banks, health insurance, \u201cgiant agriculture\u201d and telecom companies.A British compatriot, Richard Reeves, who was the director of strategy for the former British Deputy Prime Minister (and Liberal Democrat) Nick Clegg, spoke up. \u201cThe people you want to give power to aren\u2019t in the structure at the moment and don\u2019t have a locus to bring about change,\u201d he said.Mr. Hilton vigorously agreed. The book, he said, calls for new blood in office. He segued into a pitch for Crowdpac, which allows for fund-raising \u201cwithout depending on big party machinery which traps people in the existing power structures.\u201dMr. Reeves, now at the Brookings Institution, said Mr. Hilton was \u201cone of the most vibrant thinkers on the center right in British politics.\u201d The book, he added, \u201cauthentically captures not just his political philosophy but his moral philosophy, which is that the bigness and centralized expertise of the modern state and the modern company is something he instinctively rebels against.

She shook back her mane of black hair with its singular white stripe and swept Mr. Hilton into a hug.Ms. Haddad, who consults for the HBO show \u201cVeep,\u201d barreled into a story about \u201cThe Thick of It,\u201d the British precursor to \u201cVeep.\u201d \u201cSo you have to watch it \u2014 what happens is the whole season is an election, in the U.K.,\u201d she said.

{"Headline": "Moore\u2019s Law Running Out of Room, Tech Looks for a Successor", "Date": "2016-05-04", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For decades, the computer industry has been guided by a faith that engineers would always find a way to make the components on computer chips smaller, faster and cheaper.But a decision by a global alliance of chip makers to back away from reliance on Moore\u2019s Law, a principle that has guided tech companies from the giant mainframes of the 1960s to today\u2019s smartphones, shows that the industry may need to rethink the central tenet of Silicon Valley\u2019s innovation ethos.Chip scientists are nearly at the point where they are manipulating material as small as atoms. When they hit that mark within the next five years or so, they may bump into the boundaries of how tiny semiconductors can become. After that, they may have to look for alternatives to silicon, which is used to make computer chips, or new design ideas in order to make computers more powerful.It is hard to overstate the importance of Moore\u2019s Law to the entire world. Despite its official sound, it is not actually a scientific rule like Newton\u2019s laws of motion. Instead, it describes the pace of change in a manufacturing process that has made computers exponentially more affordable.In 1965, the Intel co-founder Gordon Moore first observed that the number of components that could be etched onto the surface of a silicon wafer was doubling at regular intervals and would do so for the foreseeable future.That iPad 2, mind you, is slow compared to newer models.Without those remarkable improvements, today\u2019s computer industry wouldn\u2019t exist. The vast cloud-computing data centers run by companies like Google and Amazon would be impossibly expensive to build. There would be no smartphones with apps that allow you to order a ride home or get dinner delivered. And scientific breakthroughs like decoding the human genome or teaching machines to listen would not have happened.Signaling their belief that the best way to forecast the future of computing needs to be changed, the Semiconductor Industry Associations of the United States, Europe, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan will make one final report based on a chip technology forecasting system called the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors.Nearly every big chip maker, including Intel, IBM and Samsung, belongs to the organization, though Intel says it is not participating in the last report.To replace what the semiconductor industry has done for nearly 25 years, a professional organization called the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers announced on Wednesday that it will a create a new forecasting system, called the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems, that is intended to track a wider range of computer technologies.\u201cThe end of Moore\u2019s Law is what led to this,\u201d said Thomas M. Conte, a Georgia Institute of Technology computer scientist and co-chairman of the effort to draw up a new set of benchmarks to replace the semiconductor reports. \u201cJust relying on the semiconductor industry is no longer enough. We have to shift and punch through some walls and break through some barriers.\u201dPredicting the end of Moore\u2019s Law has for years been a parlor game in Silicon Valley, and not everyone in the industry believes that what it has come to represent is nearly over. Intel, the world\u2019s largest chip maker, is a notable contrarian and predicts it has the means and know-how to push further into the atomic level.In a statement on his company\u2019s website last month, Brian Krzanich, Intel\u2019s chief executive, played down concerns. \u201cI have witnessed the advertised death of Moore\u2019s Law no less than four times,\u201d he wrote.Intel, however, faces its own problems because of a long slump in PC sales and an inability to sell many chips to smartphone makers. Last month, the company announced plans to lay off 12,000 workers \u2014 roughly 11 percent of its work force \u2014 and take a $1.2 billion charge.The industry saw signs that Moore\u2019s Law was running out of steam as far back as 2005, when researchers began to worry that computer processors were becoming so hot that they would soon match the surface of the sun in heat output.But the industry managed to fix the problem by worrying less about increasing speed and instead splitting tasks among many processors. In effect, it kept things cool by finding a way to share the load.By walking away from a task they have managed for so long, the chip makers other than Intel \u2014 the Silicon Valley giant says it is no longer formally contributing to the forecasting process \u2014 are posing broader questions about their businesses.\u201cAs you look at Intel saying the PC industry is slowing and seeing the first signs of slowing in mobile computing, people are starting to look for new places to put semiconductors,\u201d said David Kanter, a semiconductor industry analyst at Real World Technologies in San Francisco.In addition to the impending physical limits of transistors, other barriers are looming. For example, most of the semiconductor industry now insists that the per-transistor cost of computer chips has stopped falling. That had been one of the factors leading to rapid development of new computer technologies.Many executives and analysts in the computer industry are skeptical about Intel\u2019s ability to keep Moore\u2019s Law going. They point out that if the chip maker were able to continue to reduce costs, it would have been able to make larger inroads into the mobile computing world of smartphones.

{"Headline": "The Aspiring Novelist Who Became Obama\u2019s Foreign-Policy Guru", "Date": "2016-05-05", "News": "FeatureHow Ben Rhodes rewrote the rules of diplomacy for the digital age.Supported byEverything changed that day. But the way it changed Ben Rhodes\u2019s life is still unique, and perhaps not strictly believable, even as fiction. He was in the second year of the M.F.A. program at N.Y.U., writing short stories about losers in garden apartments and imagining that soon he would be published in literary magazines, acquire an agent and produce a novel by the time he turned 26. He saw the first tower go down, and after that he walked around for a while, until he ran into someone he knew, and they went back to her shared Williamsburg apartment and tried to find a television that worked, and when he came back outside, everyone was taking pictures of the towers in flames. He saw an Arab guy sobbing on the subway. \u201cThat image has always stayed with me,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause I think he knew more than we did about what was going to happen.\u201d Writing Frederick Barthelme knockoffs suddenly seemed like a waste of time.\u201cI immediately developed this idea that, you know, maybe I want to try to write about international affairs,\u201d he explained. \u201cIn retrospect, I had no idea what that meant.\u201d His mother\u2019s closest friend growing up ran the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, which then published Foreign Policy. He sent her a letter and included what would wind up being his only piece of published fiction, a short story that appeared in The Beloit Fiction Journal. It was titled \u201cThe Goldfish Smiles, You Smile Back.\u201d The story still haunts him, he says, because \u201cit foreshadowed my entire life.\u201d\u201cBlitzer!\u201d a man calls out. A small figure in a long navy cashmere overcoat turns around, in mock surprise.\u201cYou don\u2019t write, you don\u2019t call,\u201d Wolf Blitzer, the CNN anchorman, parries.Unnoticed by the reporters, Ben Rhodes walks through the room, a half-beat behind a woman in leopard-print heels. He is holding a phone to his ear, repeating his mantra: \u201cI\u2019m not important. You\u2019re important.\u201dThe Boy Wonder of the Obama White House is now 38. He heads downstairs to his windowless basement office, which is divided into two parts. In the front office, his assistant, Rumana Ahmed, and his deputy, Ned Price, are squeezed behind desks, which face a large television screen, from which CNN blares nonstop. Large pictures of Obama adorn the walls. Here is the president adjusting Rhodes\u2019s tie; presenting his darling baby daughter, Ella, with a flower; and smiling wide while playing with Ella on a giant rug that says \u201cE Pluribus Unum.\u201dAs the deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, Rhodes writes the president\u2019s speeches, plans his trips abroad and runs communications strategy across the White House, tasks that, taken individually, give little sense of the importance of his role. He is, according to the consensus of the two dozen current and former White House insiders I talked to, the single most influential voice shaping American foreign policy aside from Potus himself. The president and Rhodes communicate \u201cregularly, several times a day,\u201d according to Denis McDonough, Obama\u2019s chief of staff, who is known for captaining a tight ship. \u201cI see it throughout the day in person,\u201d he says, adding that he is sure that in addition to the two to three hours that Rhodes might spend with Obama daily, the two men communicate remotely throughout the day via email and phone calls. Rhodes strategized and ran the successful Iran-deal messaging campaign, helped negotiate the opening of American relations with Cuba after a hiatus of more than 50 years and has been a co-writer of all of Obama\u2019s major foreign-policy speeches. \u201cEvery day he does 12 jobs, and he does them better than the other people who have those jobs,\u201d Terry Szuplat, the longest-tenured member of the National Security Council speechwriting corps, told me. On the largest and smallest questions alike, the voice in which America speaks to the world is that of Ben Rhodes.Like Obama, Rhodes is a storyteller who uses a writer\u2019s tools to advance an agenda that is packaged as politics but is often quite personal. He is adept at constructing overarching plotlines with heroes and villains, their conflicts and motivations supported by flurries of carefully chosen adjectives, quotations and leaks from named and unnamed senior officials. He is the master shaper and retailer of Obama\u2019s foreign-policy narratives, at a time when the killer wave of social media has washed away the sand castles of the traditional press. His ability to navigate and shape this new environment makes him a more effective and powerful extension of the president\u2019s will than any number of policy advisers or diplomats or spies. His lack of conventional real-world experience of the kind that normally precedes responsibility for the fate of nations \u2014 like military or diplomatic service, or even a master\u2019s degree in international relations, rather than creative writing \u2014 is still startling.Part of what accounts for Rhodes\u2019s influence is his \u201cmind meld\u201d with the president. Nearly everyone I spoke to about Rhodes used the phrase \u201cmind meld\u201d verbatim, some with casual assurance and others in the hushed tones that are usually reserved for special insights. He doesn\u2019t think for the president, but he knows what the president is thinking, which is a source of tremendous power. One day, when Rhodes and I were sitting in his boiler-room office, he confessed, with a touch of bafflement, \u201cI don\u2019t know anymore where I begin and Obama ends.\u201dStanding in his front office before the State of the Union, Rhodes quickly does the political math on the breaking Iran story. \u201cNow they\u2019ll show scary pictures of people praying to the supreme leader,\u201d he predicts, looking at the screen. Three beats more, and his brain has spun a story line to stanch the bleeding. He turns to Price. \u201cWe\u2019re resolving this, because we have relationships,\u201d he says.Price turns to his computer and begins tapping away at the administration\u2019s well-cultivated network of officials, talking heads, columnists and newspaper reporters, web jockeys and outside advocates who can tweet at critics and tweak their stories backed up by quotations from \u201csenior White House officials\u201d and \u201cspokespeople.\u201d I watch the message bounce from Rhodes\u2019s brain to Price\u2019s keyboard to the three big briefing podiums \u2014 the White House, the State Department and the Pentagon \u2014 and across the Twitterverse, where it springs to life in dozens of insta-stories, which over the next five hours don formal dress for mainstream outlets. It\u2019s a tutorial in the making of a digital news microclimate \u2014 a storm that is easy to mistake these days for a fact of nature, but whose author is sitting next to me right now.Rhodes logs into his computer. \u201cIt\u2019s the middle of the [expletive] night in Iran,\u201d he grumbles. Price looks up from his keyboard to provide a messaging update: \u201cConsidering that they have 10 of our guys in custody, we\u2019re doing O.K.\u201dWith three hours to go until the president\u2019s address to Congress, Rhodes grabs a big Gatorade and starts combing through the text of the State of the Union address. I peek over his shoulder, to get a sense of the meta-narrative that will shape dozens of thumb-suckers in the days and weeks to follow. One sentence reads: \u201cBut as we focus on destroying ISIL, over-the-top claims that this is World War III just play into their hands.\u201d He retypes a word, then changes it back, before continuing with his edit. \u201cMasses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks, twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages \u2014 they pose an enormous danger to civilians; they have to be stopped. But they do not threaten our national existence.\u201dWatching Rhodes work, I remember that he is still, chiefly, a writer, who is using a new set of tools \u2014 along with the traditional arts of narrative and spin \u2014 to create stories of great consequence on the biggest page imaginable. The narratives he frames, the voices of senior officials, the columnists and reporters whose work he skillfully shapes and ventriloquizes, and even the president\u2019s own speeches and talking points, are the only dots of color in a much larger vision about who Americans are and where we are going that Rhodes and the president have been formulating together over the past seven years. When I asked Jon Favreau, Obama\u2019s lead speechwriter in the 2008 campaign, and a close friend of Rhodes\u2019s, whether he or Rhodes or the president had ever thought of their individual speeches and bits of policy making as part of some larger restructuring of the American narrative, he replied, \u201cWe saw that as our entire job.\u201dHaving recently spent time working in Hollywood, I realize during our conversations that the role Rhodes plays in the White House bears less resemblance to any specific character on Beltway-insider TV shows like \u201cThe West Wing\u201d or \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d than it does to the people who create those shows. And like most TV writers, Rhodes clearly prefers to imagine himself in the company of novelists.\u201cWhat novel is this that you are living in now and will exit from in eight months and be like, \u2018Oh, my God\u2019?\u201d I ask him.\u201cWho would be the author of this novel?\u201d he asks.\u201cThe one you are a character in now?\u201d\u201cDon DeLillo, I think,\u201d Rhodes answers. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you feel about Don DeLillo.\u201d\u201cI love Don DeLillo,\u201d I answer.\u201cYeah,\u201d Rhodes answers. \u201cThat\u2019s the only person I can think of who has confronted these questions of, you know, the individual who finds himself negotiating both vast currents of history and a very specific kind of power dynamics. That\u2019s his milieu. And that\u2019s what it\u2019s like to work in the U.S. foreign-policy apparatus in 2016.\u201dRhodes\u2019s mother and father are not interested in talking about Rhodes. Neither is his older brother, David, who is president of CBS News, an organization that recently revived the effort to declassify the contents of the redacted 28 pages of the Sept. 11 report on the eve of Obama\u2019s visit to Saudi Arabia, on which Rhodes, as usual, accompanied the president. The brothers are close, but they often go months without seeing each other. \u201cHe was like the kid who carried the briefcase to school,\u201d Ben says of his brother, who worked at Fox News and Bloomberg before moving to CBS. \u201cI actually didn\u2019t do that great in high school because I was drinking and smoking pot and hanging out in Central Park.\u201dRhodes\u2019s impassioned yet depressive vibe, which I feel in his stray remarks and in the strangeness of his decision to allow me to roam around the White House, stems in part from feeling overloaded; he wishes he had more time to think and write. His mother is Jewish from the Upper East Side, and worships John Updike, and reads The New Yorker. His father is a Texan lawyer who took his sons to St. Thomas Episcopal Church once a month, where Rhodes felt like the Jewish kid in church, the same way he felt like a \u201cJewish Christian\u201d at Passover Seders. His New York City prep-school-kid combination of vulnerability, brattiness and passionate hatred for phonies suggests an only slightly updated version of what Holden Caulfield might have been like if he grew up to work in the West Wing.Rhodes\u2019s windowless back office, which doesn\u2019t have a TV screen, is an oasis of late-night calm in a building devoted to the performance of power. The walls are painted a soft creamy color, which gives it the feel of an upscale hotel room with the drapes closed. He arrives here every morning between 8 and 9 from a modest two-bedroom apartment in a grad-student-type building in an unpretentious Washington neighborhood around the corner from his favorite post-collegiate bar. Before coming to work, he walks his 1-year-old daughter to day care. Then he drives to work in his Beamer, which appears to be the one grown-up luxury he and his wife, Ann Norris, who works in the State Department and longs to return to her childhood home of California, can afford. When his wife takes the car, he rides the bus, which offers him a touch of the anonymity he craves. His days at the White House start with the president\u2019s daily briefing, which usually includes the vice president, National Security Adviser Susan Rice, Deputy National Security Adviser Avril Haines and Homeland Security Adviser Lisa Monaco.The books on his shelves are a mix of DeLillo novels, history books, recondite tomes on Cuba and Burma and adventure-wonk stuff like Mark Mazzetti\u2019s \u201cThe Way of the Knife.\u201d C. S. Lewis makes an appearance here, alongside a volume of Lincoln speeches (Obama tells all his speechwriters to read Lincoln) and George Orwell\u2019s \u201cAll Art Is Propaganda.\u201d I have seen the same books on the shelves of plenty of Brooklyn apartments. Yet some large part of the recent history of America and its role in the world turns on the fact that the entirely familiar person sitting at the desk in front of me, who seems not unlike other weed-smokers I know who write Frederick Barthelme-type short stories, has achieved a \u201cmind meld\u201d with President Obama and used his skills to help execute a radical shift in American foreign policy.So I wonder: How did he get from there to here?The editor at Foreign Policy who read \u201cGoldfish,\u201d which Rhodes attached with his query letter, said that the young M.F.A. would be bored with fact-checking. Instead, he suggested that he apply for a job with Lee Hamilton, the onetime congressman from Indiana, who was looking for a speechwriter.\u201cI was surprised,\u201d Hamilton remembered. \u201cWhat the hell does a guy who wanted to write fiction come to me for?\u201d But he had always found writers useful, and Rhodes\u2019s writing sample was the best in the pile. So he hired him on at the Wilson Center, a nonpartisan think tank. Though Rhodes never said a word in meetings, Hamilton says, he had a keen understanding of what was going on and a talent for putting the positions of distinguished participants down on paper. \u201cI immediately understood that it\u2019s a very important quality for a staffer,\u201d Hamilton explained, \u201cthat he could come into a meeting and decide what was decided.\u201d I suggested that the phrase \u201cdecide what was decided\u201d is suggestive of the enormous power that might accrue to someone with Rhodes\u2019s gifts. Hamilton nodded. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he said.The notes go on and on. They have ideas with subsets of ideas and reactions to ideas indented beneath the original ideas. The handwriting is perfect. The representation of what happened in the meetings immaculate, like a mirror\u2019s reflection after it has been scrubbed clean. I have a reputation for my notes.Rhodes served as Hamilton\u2019s staff member on the 9/11 Commission, where he met Denis McDonough, another Hamilton prot\u00e9g\u00e9, who had gone on to work for Tom Daschle in the Senate. Rhodes then became the chief note-taker for the Iraq Study Group, the bipartisan commission that excoriated George Bush\u2019s war in Iraq. He accompanied Hamilton and his Republican counterpart on the group, former secretary of state and Bush family intimate James Baker, to their meetings with Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice, Stephen Hadley, David Petraeus and many others (Vice President Dick Cheney met with the group but didn\u2019t say a word). According to both Hamilton and Edward Djerejian, Baker\u2019s second on the I.S.G., Rhodes\u2019s opinions were helpful in shaping the group\u2019s conclusions \u2014 a scathing indictment of the policy makers responsible for invading Iraq. For Rhodes, who wrote much of the I.S.G. report, the Iraq war was proof, in black and white, not of the complexity of international affairs or the many perils attendant on political decision-making but of the fact that the decision-makers were morons.One result of this experience was that when Rhodes joined the Obama campaign in 2007, he arguably knew more about the Iraq war than the candidate himself, or any of his advisers. He had also developed a healthy contempt for the American foreign-policy establishment, including editors and reporters at The New York Times, The Washington Post, The New Yorker and elsewhere, who at first applauded the Iraq war and then sought to pin all the blame on Bush and his merry band of neocons when it quickly turned sour. If anything, that anger has grown fiercer during Rhodes\u2019s time in the White House. He referred to the American foreign-policy establishment as the Blob. According to Rhodes, the Blob includes Hillary Clinton, Robert Gates and other Iraq-war promoters from both parties who now whine incessantly about the collapse of the American security order in Europe and the Middle East.Boost thinks very highly of me. My notes are so impressive that they have taken on the form of ideas, he feels. I capture other people\u2019s words in a manner that not only organizes them, but inserts a clarity and purpose that was not present in the original idea. Connections are made between two opposing ideas that were not apparent in the meeting. I have gotten at not only the representation of things, but the way that the mind actually works.Jon Favreau, then the campaign\u2019s lead speechwriter, felt as if he could use a foreign-affairs expert who could write. \u201cForeign-policy advisers kept changing all the language that made Obama sound like he wasn\u2019t part of the Democratic foreign-policy establishment,\u201d he remembers. \u201cThe idea of someone with a masters in fiction who had also co-authored the Iraq Study Group and 9/11 Commission reports seemed perfect for a candidate who put so much emphasis on storytelling.\u201d The two young speechwriters quickly found themselves to be in sync. \u201cHe truly gives zero [expletive] about what most people in Washington think,\u201d Favreau says admiringly of Rhodes. \u201cI think he\u2019s always seen his time there as temporary and won\u2019t care if he\u2019s never again invited to a cocktail party, or asked to appear on \u2018Morning Joe,\u2019 or inducted into the Council on Foreign Relations hall of fame or whatever the hell they do there.\u201dI sit next to Boost in the meetings. The ideas fly like radio waves. I am silent in these meetings, taking notes.\u201cHe was easily underestimatable,\u201d Samantha Power recalls, of Rhodes\u2019s arrival on the Obama campaign in 2007. Herself a writer, whose history of America\u2019s responses to genocide, \u201cA Problem From Hell,\u201d won the Pulitzer Prize, Power went to work in Obama\u2019s Senate office in 2005. Power is now the American ambassador to the United Nations. Her attire suggests a disingenuous ambivalence about her role in government that appears to be common among her cohort in the Obama administration, with a cardigan made of thick, expensive-looking cashmere worn over a simple frock, along with silver spray-painted rock \u2019n\u2019 roll sneakers. See, I\u2019m sympatico, the sneakers proclaim.Early on, what struck her about Rhodes was how strategic he was. \u201cHe was leading quietly, initially, and mainly just through track changes, like what to accept and reject,\u201d she says. When I ask her where Rhodes\u2019s control over drafts of the candidate\u2019s speeches came from, she immediately answers, \u201cObama,\u201d but then qualifies her answer. \u201cBut it was Hobbesian,\u201d she adds. \u201cHe had the pen. And he understood intuitively that having the pen gave him that control.\u201d His judgment was superior to that of his rivals, and he refused to ever back down. \u201cHe was just defiant,\u201d she recalls. \u201cHe was like: \u2018No, I\u2019m not. That\u2019s bad. Obama wouldn\u2019t want that.\u2019\u2009\u201dObama relies on Rhodes for \u201can unvarnished take,\u201d in part, she says, because \u201cBen just has no poker face,\u201d and so it\u2019s easy to see when he is feeling uncomfortable. \u201cThe president will be like, \u2018Ben, something on your mind?\u2019 And then Ben will have this incredibly precise lay-down of why the previous half-hour has been an utter waste of time, because there\u2019s a structural flaw to the entire direction of the conversation.\u201dThe literary character that Rhodes most closely resembles, Power volunteers, is Holden Caulfield. \u201cHe hates the idea of being phony, and he\u2019s impetuous, and he has very strong views.\u201dIn Afghanistan the Taliban dynamites enormous statues of Buddha, the ancient material imploding and crumbling to the ground, small specks of men can be seen watching in the foreground. This is somewhere else. Far away.The job he was hired to do, namely to help the president of the United States communicate with the public, was changing in equally significant ways, thanks to the impact of digital technologies that people in Washington were just beginning to wrap their minds around. It is hard for many to absorb the true magnitude of the change in the news business \u2014 40 percent of newspaper-industry professionals have lost their jobs over the past decade \u2014 in part because readers can absorb all the news they want from social-media platforms like Facebook, which are valued in the tens and hundreds of billions of dollars and pay nothing for the \u201ccontent\u201d they provide to their readers. You have to have skin in the game \u2014 to be in the news business, or depend in a life-or-death way on its products \u2014 to understand the radical and qualitative ways in which words that appear in familiar typefaces have changed. Rhodes singled out a key example to me one day, laced with the brutal contempt that is a hallmark of his private utterances. \u201cAll these newspapers used to have foreign bureaus,\u201d he said. \u201cNow they don\u2019t. They call us to explain to them what\u2019s happening in Moscow and Cairo. Most of the outlets are reporting on world events from Washington. The average reporter we talk to is 27 years old, and their only reporting experience consists of being around political campaigns. That\u2019s a sea change. They literally know nothing.\u201dIn this environment, Rhodes has become adept at ventriloquizing many people at once. Ned Price, Rhodes\u2019s assistant, gave me a primer on how it\u2019s done. The easiest way for the White House to shape the news, he explained, is from the briefing podiums, each of which has its own dedicated press corps. \u201cBut then there are sort of these force multipliers,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe have our compadres, I will reach out to a couple people, and you know I wouldn\u2019t want to name them \u2014 \u201d\u201cI can name them,\u201d I said, ticking off a few names of prominent Washington reporters and columnists who often tweet in sync with White House messaging.Price laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll say, \u2018Hey, look, some people are spinning this narrative that this is a sign of American weakness,\u2019\u2009\u201d he continued, \u201cbut \u2014 \u201d\u201cIn fact it\u2019s a sign of strength!\u201d I said, chuckling.\u201cAnd I\u2019ll give them some color,\u201d Price continued, \u201cand the next thing I know, lots of these guys are in the dot-com publishing space, and have huge Twitter followings, and they\u2019ll be putting this message out on their own.\u201dThis is something different from old-fashioned spin, which tended to be an art best practiced in person. In a world where experienced reporters competed for scoops and where carrying water for the White House was a cause for shame, no matter which party was in power, it was much harder to sustain a \u201cnarrative\u201d over any serious period of time. Now the most effectively weaponized 140-character idea or quote will almost always carry the day, and it is very difficult for even good reporters to necessarily know where the spin is coming from or why.When I later visited Obama\u2019s former campaign mastermind David Axelrod in Chicago, I brought up the soft Orwellian vibe of an information space where old media structures and hierarchies have been erased by Silicon Valley billionaires who convinced the suckers that information was \u201cfree\u201d and everyone with access to Google was now a reporter. Axelrod, a former newspaperman, sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s not as easy as standing in front of a press conference and speaking to 70 million people like past presidents have been able to do,\u201d he said. The bully pulpit by and large doesn\u2019t exist anymore, he explained. \u201cSo more and more, over the last couple of years, there\u2019s been an investment in alternative means of communication: using digital more effectively, going to nontraditional sources, understanding where on each issue your constituencies are going to be found,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they\u2019ve approached these major foreign-policy challenges as campaign challenges, and they\u2019ve run campaigns, and those campaigns have been very sophisticated.\u201dIn the narrative that Rhodes shaped, the \u201cstory\u201d of the Iran deal began in 2013, when a \u201cmoderate\u201d faction inside the Iranian regime led by Hassan Rouhani beat regime \u201chard-liners\u201d in an election and then began to pursue a policy of \u201copenness,\u201d which included a newfound willingness to negotiate the dismantling of its illicit nuclear-weapons program. The president set out the timeline himself in his speech announcing the nuclear deal on July 14, 2015: \u201cToday, after two years of negotiations, the United States, together with our international partners, has achieved something that decades of animosity has not.\u201d While the president\u2019s statement was technically accurate \u2014 there had in fact been two years of formal negotiations leading up to the signing of the J.C.P.O.A. \u2014 it was also actively misleading, because the most meaningful part of the negotiations with Iran had begun in mid-2012, many months before Rouhani and the \u201cmoderate\u201d camp were chosen in an election among candidates handpicked by Iran\u2019s supreme leader, the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The idea that there was a new reality in Iran was politically useful to the Obama administration. By obtaining broad public currency for the thought that there was a significant split in the regime, and that the administration was reaching out to moderate-minded Iranians who wanted peaceful relations with their neighbors and with America, Obama was able to evade what might have otherwise been a divisive but clarifying debate over the actual policy choices that his administration was making. By eliminating the fuss about Iran\u2019s nuclear program, the administration hoped to eliminate a source of structural tension between the two countries, which would create the space for America to disentangle itself from its established system of alliances with countries like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Israel and Turkey. With one bold move, the administration would effectively begin the process of a large-scale disengagement from the Middle East.The nerve center for the selling of the Iran deal to Congress, which took place in a concentrated three-month period between July and September of last year, was located inside the White House, and is referred to by its former denizens as \u201cthe war room.\u201d Chad Kreikemeier, a Nebraskan who had worked in the White House Office of Legislative Affairs, helped run the team, which included three to six people from each of several agencies, he says, which were the State Department, Treasury, the American delegation to the United Nations (i.e., Samantha Power), \u201cat times D.O.D.\u201d (the Department of Defense) and also the Department of Energy and the National Security Council. Rhodes \u201cwas kind of like the quarterback,\u201d running the daily video conferences and coming up with lines of attack and parry. \u201cHe was extremely good about immediately getting to a phrase or a way of getting the message out that just made more sense,\u201d Kreikemeier remembers. Framing the deal as a choice between peace and war was Rhodes\u2019s go-to move \u2014 and proved to be a winning argument.The person whom Kreikemeier credits with running the digital side of the campaign was Tanya Somanader, 31, the director of digital response for the White House Office of Digital Strategy, who became known in the war room and on Twitter as @TheIranDeal. Early on, Rhodes asked her to create a rapid-response account that fact-checked everything related to the Iran deal. \u201cSo, we developed a plan that was like: The Iran deal is literally going to be the tip of everything that we stand up online,\u201d Somanader says. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to map it onto what we know about the different audiences we\u2019re dealing with: the public, pundits, experts, the right wing, Congress.\u201d By applying 21st-century data and networking tools to the white-glove world of foreign affairs, the White House was able to track what United States senators and the people who worked for them, and influenced them, were seeing online \u2014 and make sure that no potential negative comment passed without a tweet.As she explained how the process worked, I was struck by how na\u00efve the assumption of a \u201cstate of nature\u201d must seem in an information environment that is mediated less and less by experienced editors and reporters with any real prior knowledge of the subjects they write about. \u201cPeople construct their own sense of source and credibility now,\u201d she said. \u201cThey elect who they\u2019re going to believe.\u201d For those in need of more traditional-seeming forms of validation, handpicked Beltway insiders like Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic and Laura Rozen of Al-Monitor helped retail the administration\u2019s narrative. \u201cLaura Rozen was my RSS feed,\u201d Somanader offered. \u201cShe would just find everything and retweet it.\u201dRhodes\u2019s messaging campaign was so effective not simply because it was a perfectly planned and executed example of digital strategy, but also because he was personally involved in guiding the deal itself. In July 2012, Jake Sullivan, a close aide to Hillary Clinton, traveled to Muscat, Oman, for the first meeting with the Iranians, taking a message from the White House. \u201cIt was, \u2018We\u2019re prepared to open a direct channel to resolve the nuclear agreement if you are prepared to do the same thing and authorize it at the highest levels and engage in a serious discussion on these issues,\u2019\u2009\u201d Sullivan remembers. \u201cOnce that was agreed to, it was quickly decided that we resolve the nuclear agreement in two steps, the interim agreement and the final agreement.\u201d Subsequent meetings with the Iranians followed, during which he was joined by Deputy Secretary of State Bill Burns. \u201cBill and I had a huge amount of license to explore what the terms would look like, within the negotiating parameters,\u201d Sullivan says. \u201cWhat the precise trade-offs would be, between forms of sanctions relief and forms of restraints on their programs, that was left to us to feel out.\u201dThe fact that the president largely let his surrogates do the talking and the selling of the Iran deal \u2014 and even now, rarely talks about it in public \u2014 does not reflect his level of direct engagement. Sullivan and Burns spent hours before and after every session in Oman with the president and his closest advisers in the White House. When the president wasn\u2019t present, Rhodes always was. \u201cBen and I, in particular, the two of us, spent a lot of time thinking through all the angles,\u201d Sullivan says. \u201cWe spent three, four, five hours together in Washington talking things through before the meetings.\u201d In March 2013, a full three months before the elections that elevated Hassan Rouhani to the office of president, Sullivan and Burns finalized their proposal for an interim agreement, which became the basis for the J.C.P.O.A.The White House point person during the later stage of the negotiations was Rob Malley, a favored troubleshooter who is currently running negotiations that could keep the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in power. During the course of the Iran talks, Malley told me, he always kept in close contact with Rhodes. \u201cI would often just call him and say, \u2018Give me a reality check,\u2019\u2009\u201d Malley explained. \u201cHe could say, \u2018Here is where I think the president is, and here is where I think he will be.\u2019\u2009\u201d He continued, \u201cBen would try to anticipate: Does it make sense policywise? But then he would also ask himself: How do we sell it to Congress? How do we sell it to the public? What is it going to do to our narrative?\u201dMalley is a particularly keen observer of the changing art of political communication; his father, Simon Malley, who was born in Cairo, edited the politics magazine Afrique Asie and proudly provided a platform for Fidel Castro and Yasir Arafat, in the days when the leaders\u2019 words might take weeks to travel from Cuba or Cairo to Paris. \u201cThe Iran experience was the place where I saw firsthand how policy, politics and messaging all had to be brought together, and I think that Ben is really at the intersection of all three,\u201d Malley says. \u201cHe reflects and he shapes at the same time.\u201dAs Malley and representatives of the State Department, including Wendy Sherman and Secretary of State John Kerry, engaged in formal negotiations with the Iranians, to ratify details of a framework that had already been agreed upon, Rhodes\u2019s war room did its work on Capitol Hill and with reporters. In the spring of last year, legions of arms-control experts began popping up at think tanks and on social media, and then became key sources for hundreds of often-clueless reporters. \u201cWe created an echo chamber,\u201d he admitted, when I asked him to explain the onslaught of freshly minted experts cheerleading for the deal. \u201cThey were saying things that validated what we had given them to say.\u201dWhen I suggested that all this dark metafictional play seemed a bit removed from rational debate over America\u2019s future role in the world, Rhodes nodded. \u201cIn the absence of rational discourse, we are going to discourse the [expletive] out of this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had test drives to know who was going to be able to carry our message effectively, and how to use outside groups like Ploughshares, the Iran Project and whomever else. So we knew the tactics that worked.\u201d He is proud of the way he sold the Iran deal. \u201cWe drove them crazy,\u201d he said of the deal\u2019s opponents.Yet Rhodes bridled at the suggestion that there has been anything deceptive about the way that the agreement itself was sold. \u201cLook, with Iran, in a weird way, these are state-to-state issues. They\u2019re agreements between governments. Yes, I would prefer that it turns out that Rouhani and Zarif\u201d \u2014 Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran\u2019s foreign minister \u2014 \u201care real reformers who are going to be steering this country into the direction that I believe it can go in, because their public is educated and, in some respects, pro-American. But we are not betting on that.\u201dIn fact, Rhodes\u2019s passion seems to derive not from any investment in the technical specifics of sanctions or centrifuge arrays, or any particular optimism about the future course of Iranian politics and society. Those are matters for the negotiators and area specialists. Rather, it derived from his own sense of the urgency of radically reorienting American policy in the Middle East in order to make the prospect of American involvement in the region\u2019s future wars a lot less likely. When I asked whether the prospect of this same kind of far-reaching spin campaign being run by a different administration is something that scares him, he admitted that it does. \u201cI mean, I\u2019d prefer a sober, reasoned public debate, after which members of Congress reflect and take a vote,\u201d he said, shrugging. \u201cBut that\u2019s impossible.\u201dObama\u2019s particular revulsion against a certain kind of global power politics is a product, Rhodes suggests, of his having been raised in Southeast Asia. \u201cIndonesia was a place where your interaction at that time with power was very intimate, right?\u201d Rhodes asks. \u201cTens or hundreds of thousands of people had just been killed. Power was not some abstract thing,\u201d he muses. \u201cWhen we sit in Washington and debate foreign policy, it\u2019s like a Risk game, or it\u2019s all about us, or the human beings disappear from the decisions. But he lived in a place where he was surrounded by people who had either perpetrated those acts \u2014 and by the way, may not have felt great about that \u2014 or else knew someone who was a victim. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been an American president who had an experience like that at a young age of what power is.\u201dThe parts of Obama\u2019s foreign policy that disturb some of his friends on the left, like drone strikes, Rhodes says, are a result of Obama\u2019s particular kind of globalism, which understands the hard and at times absolute necessity of killing. Yet, at the same time, they are also ways of avoiding more deadly uses of force \u2014 a kind of low-body-count spin move.He leans back and opens a drawer in the file cabinet behind his desk, and removes a folder. \u201cI was going to show you something,\u201d he says, removing a sheaf of yellow legal paper covered in longhand. \u201cJust to confirm for you that he really is a writer.\u201d He shows me the president\u2019s copy of his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech, a revision of an original draft by Favreau and Rhodes whose defining tension was accepting a prize awarded before he had actually accomplished anything. In his longhand notes, Obama relocated the speech\u2019s tension in the fact that he was accepting a peace prize a week after ordering 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan. King and Gandhi were the author\u2019s heroes, yet he couldn\u2019t act as they did, because he runs a state. The reason that the author had to exercise power was because not everyone in the world is rational.We sit for a while, and I examine the president\u2019s thoughts unfolding on the page, and the lawyerly, abstract nature of his writing process. \u201cMoral imagination, spheres of identity, but also move beyond cheap lazy pronouncements,\u201d one note reads. Here was the new American self \u2014 rational, moral, not self-indulgent. No longer one thing but multiple overlapping spheres or circles. Who is described here? As usual, the author is describing himself.Valerie Jarrett has been called the president\u2019s work wife and is the only member of the West Wing staff who knew Obama before he began contemplating a run for the presidency. What I want to understand better, I tell her, are the swirls of the president\u2019s emotional fingerprint, which I saw in the longhand draft of his Nobel speech. We talk for a while about being American and at the same time being from somewhere else, and the split-screen experience of reality that experience allows. Jarrett was born in Iran and spent her early childhood there.\u201cWas it a point of connection between you and the president that you had each spent some substantial part of your childhoods living in another country?\u201d I ask. Her face lights up.\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she answers. The question is important to her. \u201cThe first conversation we had over dinner, when we first met, was about what it was like for both of us to live in countries that were predominantly Muslim countries at formative parts of our childhood and the perspective it gave us about the United States and how uniquely excellent it is,\u201d she says. \u201cWe talked about what it was like to be children, and how we played with children who had totally different backgrounds than our own but you would find something in common.\u201d She recalls her very first dinner together with the new fianc\u00e9 of her prot\u00e9g\u00e9e Michelle Robinson. \u201cI remember him asking me questions that I felt like no one else has ever asked me before,\u201d she says, \u201cand he asked me from a perspective of someone who knew the same experience that I had. So it felt really good. I was like, \u2018Oh, finally someone who gets it.\u2019\u2009\u201d\u201cHe is a brilliant guy, but he has a real problem with what I call the assignment of bad faith,\u201d one former senior official told me of the president. \u201cHe regards everyone on the other side at this point as being a bunch of bloodthirsty know-nothings from a different era who play by the old book. He hears arguments like, \u2018We should be punching Iran in the nose on its shipments of arms, and do it publicly,\u2019 or \u2018We should sanction the crap out of them for their ballistic-missile test and tell them that if they do it again we\u2019re going to do this or we\u2019re going to do that,\u2019 and he hears Dick Cheney in those arguments.\u201dAnother official I spoke to put the same point more succinctly: \u201cClearly the world has disappointed him.\u201d When I asked whether he believed that the Oval Office debate over Syria policy in 2012 \u2014 resulting in a decision not to support the uprising against Assad in any meaningful way \u2014 had been an honest and open one, he said that he had believed that it was, but has since changed his mind. \u201cInstead of adjusting his policies to the reality, and adjusting his perception of reality to the changing realities on the ground, the conclusions he draws are exactly the same, no matter what the costs have been to our strategic interests,\u201d he says. \u201cIn an odd way, he reminds me of Bush.\u201d The comparison is a startling one \u2014 and yet, questions of tone aside, it is uncomfortably easy to see the similarities between the two men, American presidents who projected their own ideas of the good onto an indifferent world.One of the few charter members of the Blob willing to speak on the record is Leon Panetta, who was Obama\u2019s head of the C.I.A. and secretary of defense and also enough of a product of a different culture to give honest answers to what he understands to be questions of consequence. At his institute at the old Fort Ord in Seaside, Calif., where, in the days before he wore Mr. Rogers sweaters, he served as a young Army intelligence officer, I ask him about a crucial component of the administration\u2019s public narrative on Iran: whether it was ever a salient feature of the C.I.A.\u2019s analysis when he ran the agency that the Iranian regime was meaningfully divided between \u201chard-line\u201d and \u201cmoderate\u201d camps.\u201cNo,\u201d Panetta answers. \u201cThere was not much question that the Quds Force and the supreme leader ran that country with a strong arm, and there was not much question that this kind of opposing view could somehow gain any traction.\u201dI ask Panetta whether, as head of the C.I.A., or later on, as secretary of defense, he ever saw the letters that Obama covertly sent to Khamenei, in 2009 and in 2012, which were only reported on by the press weeks later.\u201cNo,\u201d he answers, before saying he would \u201clike to believe\u201d that Tom Donilon, national security adviser since 2010, and Hillary Clinton, then secretary of state, had a chance to work on the offer they presented.As secretary of defense, he tells me, one of his most important jobs was keeping Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his defense minister, Ehud Barak, from launching a pre-emptive attack on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities. \u201cThey were both interested in the answer to the question, \u2018Is the president serious?\u2019\u2009\u201d Panetta recalls. \u201cAnd you know my view, talking with the president, was: If brought to the point where we had evidence that they\u2019re developing an atomic weapon, I think the president is serious that he is not going to allow that to happen.\u201dPanetta stops.\u201cBut would you make that same assessment now?\u201d I ask him.\u201cWould I make that same assessment now?\u201d he asks. \u201cProbably not.\u201dHe understands the president\u2019s pivot toward Iran as the logical result of a deeply held premise about the negative effects of use of American military force on a scale much larger than drone strikes or Special Forces raids. \u201cI think the whole legacy that he was working on was, \u2018I\u2019m the guy who\u2019s going to bring these wars to an end, and the last goddamn thing I need is to start another war,\u2019\u2009\u201d he explains of Obama. \u201cIf you ratchet up sanctions, it could cause a war. If you start opposing their interest in Syria, well, that could start a war, too.\u201dIn Panetta\u2019s telling, his own experience at the Pentagon under Obama sometimes resembled being installed in the driver\u2019s seat of a car and finding that the steering wheel and brakes had been disconnected from the engine. Obama and his aides used political elders like him, Robert Gates and Hillary Clinton as cover to end the Iraq war, and then decided to steer their own course, he suggests. While Panetta pointedly never mentions Rhodes\u2019s name, it is clear whom he is talking about.\u201cThere were staff people who put themselves in a position where they kind of assumed where the president\u2019s head was on a particular issue, and they thought their job was not to go through this open process of having people present all these different options, but to try to force the process to where they thought the president wanted to be,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019d say, \u2018Well, this is where we want you to come out.\u2019 And I\u2019d say \u2018[expletive], that\u2019s not the way it works. We\u2019ll present a plan, and then the president can make a decision.\u2019 I mean, Jesus Christ, it is the president of the United States, you\u2019re making some big decisions here, he ought to be entitled to hear all of those viewpoints and not to be driven down a certain path.\u201dBut that can\u2019t be true, I tell Panetta, because the aides he is talking about had no independent power aside from the authority that the president himself gave them.\u201cWell, that\u2019s a good question,\u201d Panetta allows. \u201cHe\u2019s a smart guy, he\u2019s not dumb.\u201d It\u2019s all part of the Washington blame game. Just as Panetta can blame young aides in order to avoid blaming the president for his actual choices, the president used his aides to tell Panetta to take a hike. Perhaps the president and his aides were continually unable to predict the consequences of their actions in Syria, and made mistake after mistake, while imagining that it was going to come out right the next time. \u201cAnother read, which isn\u2019t necessarily opposed to that,\u201d I continue, \u201cis that their actual picture is entirely coherent. But if they put it in blunt, unnuanced terms \u2014 \u201dPanetta completes my sentence: \u201c \u2014 they\u2019d get the [expletive] kicked out of them.\u201d He looks at me curiously. \u201cLet me ask you something,\u201d he says. \u201cDid you present this theory to Ben Rhodes?\u201dThere is something dangerously na\u00efve about this kind of talk, in which words like \u201cbalance,\u201d \u201cstakeholders\u201d and \u201cinterests\u201d are endlessly reshuffled like word tiles in a magnetic-poetry set, with little regard for the immutable contingencies that shaped America\u2019s role in the world. But that\u2019s hardly fair. Ben Rhodes wanted to do right, and maybe, when the arc of history lands, it will turn out that he did. At least, he tried. Something scared him, and made him feel as if the grown-ups in Washington didn\u2019t know what they were talking about, and it\u2019s hard to argue that he was wrong.What has interested me most about watching him and his cohort in the White House over the past seven years, I tell him, is the evolution of their ability to get comfortable with tragedy. I am thinking specifically about Syria, I add, where more than 450,000 people have been slaughtered.\u201cYeah, I admit very much to that reality,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a numbing element to Syria in particular. But I will tell you this,\u201d he continues. \u201cI profoundly do not believe that the United States could make things better in Syria by being there. And we have an evidentiary record of what happens when we\u2019re there \u2014 nearly a decade in Iraq.\u201dIraq is his one-word answer to any and all criticism. I was against the Iraq war from the beginning, I tell Rhodes, so I understand why he perpetually returns to it. I also understand why Obama pulled the plug on America\u2019s engagement with the Middle East, I say, but it was also true as a result that more people are dying there on his watch than died during the Bush presidency, even if very few of them are Americans. What I don\u2019t understand is why, if America is getting out of the Middle East, we are apparently spending so much time and energy trying to strong-arm Syrian rebels into surrendering to the dictator who murdered their families, or why it is so important for Iran to maintain its supply lines to Hezbollah. He mutters something about John Kerry, and then goes off the record, to suggest, in effect, that the world of the Sunni Arabs that the American establishment built has collapsed. The buck stops with the establishment, not with Obama, who was left to clean up their mess.It is clearly time for me to go. Rhodes walks me out into the sunlight of the West Wing parking lot, where we are treated to the sight of the aged Henry Kissinger, who has come to pay a visit. I ask Rhodes if he has ever met the famous diplomat before, and he tells me about the time they were seated together at a state dinner for the president of China. It was an interesting encounter to imagine, between Kissinger, who made peace with Mao\u2019s China while bombing Laos to bits, and Rhodes, who helped effect a similar diplomatic volte-face with Iran but kept the United States out of a civil war in Syria, which has caused more than four million people to become refugees. I ask Rhodes how it felt being seated next to the embodiment of American realpolitik. \u201cIt was surreal,\u201d he says, looking off into the middle distance. \u201cI told him I was going to Laos,\u201d he continues. \u201cHe got a weird look in his eye.\u201dThere is nothing snarky about his delivery. Rhodes just was bothered by seeing legless kids and unexploded cluster bombs in the jungle. He is not Henry Kissinger, or so his logic runs, even as the underlying realist suspicion \u2014 or contempt \u2014 for the idea of America as a moral actor is eerily similar. He is torn. As the president himself once asked, how are we supposed to weigh the tens of thousands who have died in Syria against the tens of thousands who have died in Congo? What power means is that the choice is yours, no matter who is telling the story.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Students at Fake University Say They Were Collateral Damage in Sting Operation", "Date": "2016-05-05", "News": "Supported byFor foreign-born students desperate to stay in the United States, the University of Northern New Jersey seemed like the perfect solution: They did not have to go to class, but they could get coveted student visas and still work at their dream jobs.They just needed to pay a broker anywhere from $3,000 to $12,000. Over the last three and a half years, more than a thousand agreed.That was their mistake.Twenty-five students were listed as anonymous co-conspirators, but officials say all of them knew they were committing fraud by not going to class. Within days, 1,076 of them were ordered to appear in immigration court, facing deportation or even a lifetime ban from the United States.\u201cThey were 100 percent fully aware,\u201d said Alvin Phillips, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security. \u201cAll purported students are recorded at some point or another fully going along with the pay-to-stay scheme.\u201dThere are both audio and video recordings from the president\u2019s office in New Jersey, when students called or visited, Mr. Phillips said. He personally witnessed some of these exchanges, and heard students admit they knew the university would not have classes.But in interviews, more than a dozen students insisted that they were collateral damage in the sting operation, duped by both the brokers and the government.In some cases, their efforts to verify the university or even transfer were rebuffed by the brokers, they say. In other instances, the students point to what they say was active deception by the government: in-person meetings with the university\u2019s supposed president, letters confirming they could work instead of go to class, and Twitter messages about classes canceled because of bad weather.In October, A., a young man from Shanghai living in New York City, was so frustrated when the university had not sent a needed eligibility form that he rented a car and drove to the campus. (A., like most of the students, insisted on being identified only by an initial because their immigration cases were still pending or their families back home did not know their situation.)At the university\u2019s office in a nondescript building off the Garden State Parkway in Cranford, a man presenting himself as the institution\u2019s president, Steve Brunetti, signed the form. He told A. how proud he was of all \u201chis students\u201d and gave him a souvenir.It was a slick T-shirt with the letters UNNJ on the front. On the left sleeve was an American flag.A. said he did not think the experience was odd. \u201cI just figured that was the way it was done,\u201d he said.Winona Sun, an art therapist in Brooklyn, learned of the sting operation while she was in China visiting her parents, when her visa to re-enter the United States was revoked. \u201cI feel it\u2019s over-punishment,\u201d she said in a telephone interview from China. \u201cIf the target is for the brokers, why do they want to tear people down and lie to me?\u201dThe federal government accredits 8,687 educational institutions in the United States to enroll international students; 1.18 million are currently studying here. The students enrolled at the University of Northern New Jersey had all come to the United States legally and had earned degrees from schools including the University of Chicago, the University of Michigan and Fordham.A number of the students failed to get an H-1B and seemed out of options \u2014 with jobs at Facebook, Google and Morgan Stanley on the line. Others were seeking to transfer from colleges they heard were under investigation to stay one step ahead of immigration officials.That is when the University of Northern New Jersey beckoned.According to some students, brokers assured them that they could immediately earn credit hours for their work experience in a program called Curricular Practical Training, without taking classes.Most of the students were from China and India, where working with brokers is a familiar way of doing business. But in retrospect, they seem to have ignored what should have been red flags, whether because they were overly trusting, willfully ignorant or willing participants in visa fraud.Ms. Sun, 29, earned a master\u2019s degree in art therapy at a Massachusetts college and moved to New York to work for a nonprofit social services agency. (She declined to name the college or the organization because she did not want to endanger her application for a waiver to return to the United States.)Her employer applied for an H-1B visa for her, but she faced a gap of several months before it would come through.Ms. Sun said her broker told her she could work instead of taking classes, but referred her to the university. In February 2015, after she enrolled, Ms. Sun said she called there approximately 20 times; no one responded.\u201cIf one person called me back and told me it was fake, I would not have gone to the University of Northern New Jersey,\u201d Ms. Sun said. \u201cWhat else can I do? I don\u2019t know the American system.\u201dZ., who is 27 and also from China, did not win the H-1B lottery. He found the University of Northern New Jersey online without a broker. \u201cHow risky will it be for obtaining full-time C.P.T. without attending any classes?\u201d he wrote to the university in an email he showed to The New York Times, referring to Curricular Practical Training.Without a direct answer, Z. said he fell back on the university\u2019s government accreditation. A year passed.When he asked how he would provide evidence for another H-1B application, the university suggested making up classes from a template, and to send it in with $620.That was the final flag. Unlike students who were listed as co-conspirators, Z. did not fabricate school transcripts. Instead, he transferred.But on April 5, his student status was terminated because he had been enrolled at the fake university for more than 45 days.K., a 30-year-old from China who earned an M.B.A. in New England, began to suspect something about the university after he had worked for a year and did not hear about the start of classes. \u201cI was wondering if there was a lecture or something I could attend,\u201d he said. His broker told him online classes were coming soon.K. said that he, too, relied on the university\u2019s accreditations. \u201cIf the government is not trustworthy, who should we trust?\u201d he said.His girlfriend, S., 26, whom he met at business school, was accepted to the university the next year, in January 2016. But she said the broker told her that her authorization form and the school schedule would be delayed while the university expanded to two more campuses.The couple went to the campus in Cranford in March, only to find the doors locked, supposedly because it was spring break.Then at 8:20 a.m. on April 5, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents knocked on the door of their rural New England home.K. and S. were detained in separate cells for several hours. The next day, K. resigned from his job at a local company. They are both waiting for hearing dates.Like the other students, they were notified that they needed to leave the country or apply for reinstatement of their student visas. But students have said that few colleges, if any, have been willing to sponsor them after they were tainted by the University of Northern New Jersey. Reinstatement ultimately depends on the government\u2019s approval.The students say they have been put in an untenable position financially. They paid thousands of dollars either to brokers or directly to the university. Eight students alone said they spent a combined $46,000. Some paid the university via PayPal or cash, with the money going to a holding company listed on some students\u2019 invoices: Waterfall Properties.As they wait for a hearing in immigration court that could take a year or longer, they cannot legally work.\u201cTypically in any fraud investigation, it is our policy that we do not refund any money,\u201d Mr. Phillips, the Homeland Security spokesman, said.\u201cAbsolutely there was a message,\u201d Mr. Phillips added. \u201cWe welcome international students in America, but they must do so according to the standards, the right way.\u201dThe brokers may have recognized the University of Northern New Jersey as a visa mill, Mr. Nassirian said, but he could see how some students could be deceived by its certifications. \u201cCan you really blame a student,\u201d he said, \u201ceven if they are a little greedy, a little gullible, or a little too hopeful?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Top C.E.O. Pay Fell \u2014 Yes, Fell \u2014 in 2015", "Date": "2016-05-27", "News": "Supported byA mere $19.3 million.That\u2019s how much compensation Wells Fargo\u2019s chief executive, John G. Stumpf, was awarded last year, making him perfectly representative of the best-paid chief executives in the country.Among the 200 highest-paid chief executives at American companies with annual revenue of at least $1 billion that filed proxies by April 30, the average pay was, give or take a few thousand dollars, equivalent to Mr. Stumpf\u2019s own: a cool $19.3 million.Yet by the topsy-turvy standards of corporate pay, what\u2019s remarkable is not how big that number is, but how small.By other measures, too, chief executive compensation declined. Cash and stock awards, the main components of pay packages, fell last year. Among the companies in the Equilar 200, the biggest pay package, worth $94.6 million, went to Dara Khosrowshahi of Expedia. That meant that for the first time since 2012 no company in the rankings awarded its chief more than $100 million.All of which raises a tantalizing prospect: Has executive pay finally peaked? Have the C.E.O.s and the compensation committees that set their pay discovered something approaching modesty?Some experts say that is the case. \u201cWe\u2019re hearing a great deal more concern from compensation committee chairs about absolute pay,\u201d said Kenneth Daly, chief executive of the National Association of Corporate Directors, a trade group for board members. \u201cThey seem to have a lot more steel in their backs.\u201dMaybe. What is certain is that last year\u2019s weak stock market pulled down the value of executive pay packages. After posting fairly consistent gains for years, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average each fell slightly in 2015. Because the average compensation package was 69 percent stock, lower share prices meant less pay for C.E.O.s.But the relation between pay and performance remains tenuous at best. Some executives\u2019 pay fell, despite gains in the price of shares of their companies. And several C.E.O.s reaped huge windfalls, even while presiding over precipitous declines in total shareholder return.Take Philippe Dauman, the embattled chief of the media conglomerate Viacom. Mr. Dauman was awarded $54.1 million last year, a 22 percent raise from 2014. Over the year, Viacom shares plunged 43 percent.Or consider Stephen A. Wynn, the Las Vegas casino magnate. Using the Equilar criteria, he made $20.7 million as C.E.O. of Wynn Resorts last year, down 19 percent from 2014. That may seem like an appropriate haircut in a difficult year, but his shareholders fared even worse. Shares of Wynn Resorts plunged 54 percent, wiping out half the company\u2019s value. Total shareholder return, which includes dividends, was down almost as much, at 51 percent.Such flagrant disparities \u2014 chief executives are paid tens of millions of dollars for running troubled companies \u2014 rile critics.\u201cMoral outrage is the right term,\u201d said Heather Slavkin Corzo, director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.\u2019s investment office. \u201cThe rules of our economy have been written to allow the rich and powerful to keep getting richer and more powerful, while the rest of us are fighting for the scraps. It\u2019s reprehensible.\u201dPresidential candidates are talking about high C.E.O. pay in equally charged terms. For Democrats and Republicans alike, stagnant wages and income inequality have emerged as reliable rallying cries. The sentiments that fueled the Occupy Wall Street movement and were given academic heft through the work of the French economist Thomas Piketty have become talking points for Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.\u201cThe inequality movement has created a whole backlash against C.E.O. pay,\u201d said Alan Johnson, managing director of Johnson Associates, a compensation consulting firm.Weighing in on Verizon\u2019s labor dispute, Senator Sanders, an avowed socialist, took a shot at the company\u2019s chief executive, Lowell McAdam, who made $18.3 million last year.\u201cWhen the C.E.O. of a company makes almost $20 million a year but then tries to outsource jobs, reduce wages and cut health benefits \u2014 that\u2019s the kind of corporate greed we need to get rid of in America,\u201d Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign wrote in an email to supporters recently. \u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly what Verizon is doing right now.\u201dStarting her campaign last year, Mrs. Clinton contrasted working Americans with chief executives. \u201cFamilies have fought their way back from tough economic times,\u201d she wrote in a campaign email. \u201cBut it\u2019s not enough \u2014 not when the average C.E.O. makes about 300 times what the average worker makes.\u201dNo less than Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee and a wealthy businessman himself, suggested that executive pay was, in some instances, excessive. \u201cYou see these guys making these enormous amounts of money,\u201d Mr. Trump said on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d last year. \u201cIt\u2019s a total and complete joke.\u201dThe presidential contenders are responding to a sense of outrage among many working-class men and women.\u201cIn the wealthiest country in the history of the world, it should be a no-brainer that someone who works full time should be able to support their family and send their children to school,\u201d Ms. Slavkin Corzo said. \u201cThis type of wealth inequality has dangerous ramifications for our economy over all. It\u2019s immoral.\u201dThat sentiment resonates beyond the picket lines. Even Mr. Johnson, who is paid to advise companies on pay, said things had gotten out of hand. \u201cI wish all C.E.O.s were paid less money,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they\u2019re paid too much from a moral standpoint, but it is a competitive market.\u201dHere are 200 of the highest-paid chief executives in American business.Several factors account for big paydays at the highest reaches of corporate America, among them the ease with which companies can give away stock, and chummy board members who reward their friends.But another driver of high pay is the practice of benchmarking a chief executive\u2019s compensation against that of others in a so-called peer group.\u201cCompanies are accustomed to benchmarking against other companies in their industries,\u201d said Andrew Goldstein, leader of the North American executive compensation practice at Willis Towers Watson, a consultancy. \u201cYou tend to get these clusters of compensation in these industry groups.\u201d And companies are prone to benchmark themselves against larger companies and set pay at the high end of any range.At First Data, a payments processor with a market value of about $11 billion that went public last year, the chief executive, Frank J. Bisignano, was awarded $51.6 million in 2015, some of it tied to long-term performance. The board benchmarked his pay against 21 other companies it determined made up First Data\u2019s peer group.But those companies tended to be much larger than First Data, with average market values of about $37 billion. The peer group included Visa ($188 billion market cap), MasterCard ($104 billion market cap) and Accenture ($77 billion market cap).Yet despite First Data\u2019s relatively small size, Mr. Bisignano, who joined the company in 2013 after working at JPMorgan Chase, was awarded more than any chief of the companies in his peer group. The closest was Kenneth Chenault of American Express, who made $21.7 million, less than half of Mr. Bisignano\u2019s package. First Data declined to comment.\u201cNobody wants to be in the bottom half,\u201d Mr. Daly said. \u201cSo over time, the average compensation in any group goes up.\u201dFirst Data may be an outlier in the payments industry. In other sectors of the economy, however, specifically media and technology, enormous pay packages have become the norm.In 2014, the four chief executives reporting to the media mogul John Malone were awarded a combined $358 million. Last year, those four men \u2014 David M. Zaslav, Michael T. Fries, Gregory B. Maffei and Thomas M. Rutledge \u2014 were still awarded $103.4 million.Other media and technology chiefs picked up the slack. Sumner M. Redstone has routinely bestowed great riches upon his lieutenants, Mr. Dauman of Viacom, and Leslie Moonves, chief executive of CBS. Last year was no exception.Mr. Moonves was the second-highest-paid executive on the Equilar list, with a package worth $56.4 million. Mr. Dauman was right behind him, with a $54.1 million package that included a contract extension. They received this compensation although CBS shares fell 16 percent last year, and Viacom\u2019s share performance was dismal.It\u2019s not clear how much longer Mr. Redstone\u2019s largess will endure. He is ailing, has publicly split with Mr. Dauman, and the futures of CBS and Viacom are the subject of enormous speculation.\u201cEvery year they get paid more than they should due to that unusual governance situation,\u201d said Steven N. Kaplan, a professor of finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, referring to Mr. Moonves and Mr. Dauman. \u201cThose guys may be going down once Sumner is gone.\u201dShould the pay of Mr. Dauman and Mr. Moonves fall in the coming years, plenty of other media chiefs will still reap big rewards. Robert A. Iger of Walt Disney was awarded $43.5 million last year, Jeffrey L. Bewkes of Time Warner received $31.5 million, James E. Meyer of Sirius XM made $29.2 million, and Brian L. Roberts of Comcast took in $27.5 million.Technology company chiefs also did well. Marissa A. Mayer of Yahoo was awarded $36 million. Marc Benioff, founder and chief executive of Salesforce, received a $33.4 million package. And Mr. Khosrowshahi of Expedia, the lucky high earner of 2015 according to Equilar, had compensation of $94.6 million. (Mr. Khosrowshahi is a director of The New York Times Company.) His package, reflecting a new five-and-a-half-year contract, was almost exclusively stock that vests over time, so much of its value is closely linked to Expedia\u2019s share price.Defenders of executive pay cite factors like those as evidence that seemingly astronomical rewards really don\u2019t add up to that much money. In a statement, Sarah Gavin, an Expedia spokeswoman, said Mr. Khosrowshahi \u201chas been a transformational C.E.O. for Expedia,\u201d adding that much of his compensation was structured to give him \u201can additional incentive to create long-term shareholder value.\u201dAll told, tech and media C.E.O.s made up 17 of the highest-paid 30 spots on Equilar\u2019s list last year.According to Bureau of Labor Statistics data compiled by the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the average worker in the United States who doesn\u2019t have management responsibility earns $36,875 a year. By that measure, the average chief executive on the Equilar list makes roughly 523 times the average worker salary.It\u2019s not a perfect comparison. Executive pay includes stock grants, often with multiyear payouts and performance targets, while low-paid workers rarely receive stock, let alone long-term incentive packages. Nonetheless, the discrepancy is stark. A bank teller at Wells Fargo making that average wage would have to work more than half a millennium, until 2539, to earn what that company\u2019s chief executive, Mr. Stumpf, who made the average among chiefs on the Equilar list, earned last year.Incomplete as such ratios may be, chief executives will have to get used to them. Starting in 2018, companies will be required to disclose the ratio of their C.E.O.s\u2019 pay to the median compensation of their employees. The Securities and Exchange Commission will allow companies significant leeway when interpreting their own data, which could keep ratios down.In the interim, data from other sources offers a hint of what to expect. PayScale, a company that makes enterprise software, has surveyed more than 80,000 workers about their pay. Using that data, it is possible to roughly approximate ratios of the sort that the S.E.C. will soon require.The biggest gap between C.E.O. and worker pay was at Expedia, where Mr. Khosrowshahi made 993 times the median pay of his employees, as reported to PayScale. That is not so surprising given Mr. Khosrowshahi\u2019s enormous multiyear contract. But it held true even with Expedia\u2019s high median salary of $95,300.Perhaps more glaring was the discrepancy between the Walmart chief executive, C. Douglas McMillon, who made $19.4 million, nearly the average among the Equilar 200, and his workers, who reported a median salary of just $24,600. Mr. McMillon thus made 789 times the income of his median employee, using PayScale and Equilar data.Walmart said it had raised wages for more than 1.2 million employees in February. Mr. McMillon himself started as an hourly worker at Walmart and the company said that most of his compensation was based on company performance.\u201cIt\u2019s an eye-popping number,\u201d said Ms. Slavkin Corzo. \u201cThat means the typical worker would have to work for hundreds of years to make what a C.E.O. makes in one year.\u201dEye-popping as such numbers may be, compensation specialists don\u2019t expect the S.E.C.\u2019s ratio rule to change these disparities very much. But Mr. Johnson said it might embarrass retailers like Walmart. \u201cIt will throw another log on the fire, but I don\u2019t think it will have a huge impact,\u201d he said.Being the chief executive of a big publicly traded company isn\u2019t the only way to get paid these days.Masimo, a small medical device company with a market value of just $2.4 billion and annual sales of about $630 million, saw fit to award its chief executive, Joe Kiani, $119.2 million in cash and stock. Palo Alto Networks, an enterprise technology company with just under $1 billion in sales, awarded its chief executive, Mark D. McLaughlin, $66.6 million. And Paul J. Taubman, an investment banker who recently took his firm, PJT Partners, public, received a package composed almost entirely of stock worth $75.5 million. Because their companies didn\u2019t have $1 billion in sales, they were not included in the Equilar 200.A business leader does not even have to be a C.E.O. to make a fortune. Lowly chief financial officers, chief operating officers and division heads are also hauling in staggering pay packages.When Google reorganized last yearto become Alphabet, it placed Sundar Pichai in charge of its search business. For taking control of the subsidiary, called Google, he was awarded stock and cash worth $100.6 million.Alphabet\u2019s chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, who was recruited from Morgan Stanley, was awarded $31.1 million. And Patrick Pichette, the company\u2019s departing chief financial officer, received a golden parachute worth $56.6 million.Among companies that gave lavish packages to chief executives, other senior executives were also richly rewarded. At Viacom, Thomas E. Dooley, the chief operating officer, was awarded $29.4 million. At Comcast, Michael J. Cavanagh, the chief financial officer, received $40.6 million.And at First Data, where Mr. Bisignano received the sixth-highest total compensation among chief executives last year, his deputies fared well, too.Daniel Charron, executive vice president of global business solutions, was awarded $24.8 million, while the total for Guy Chiarello, the company\u2019s president, was $20.6 million.\u201cThese are very high numbers. Some people think it\u2019s too much,\u201d Mr. Kaplan said. \u201cBut if you look at what people are making in the market \u2014 technology and globalization have played into this \u2014 these are market rates.\u201dThree other hedge fund managers \u2014 Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates, David Tepper of Appaloosa Management and Israel Englander of Millennium Management \u2014 each made more than $1 billion. Another three men made $500 million or more.The figures for hedge fund managers, compiled by Institutional Investor\u2019s Alpha magazine, take into account the money they have invested in their funds as well as the fees they charge.Together, the top 25 best-paid hedge fund managers took in a combined $13 billion last year.On a case-by-case basis, large executive pay packages are easy to understand. Big companies employ thousands of people and generate billions in sales. Competition for top executive talent is intense, especially in today\u2019s global marketplace. From that perspective, Mr. Kaplan said: \u201cIn this day and age, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re particularly overpaid.\u201dAnd chief executive pay declined in 2015, according to the Equilar 200, which included companies with $1 billion in revenue, not $1 billion in market capitalization, as was the case last year. Cash compensation fell to $6 million on average, compared with $6.9 million in 2014, while stock and option awards slumped to $13.3 million, down from $15.7 million in 2014. Some executives with large stock holdings felt a twinge when their company\u2019s share price fell.But it is too soon to call this decline a trend. In 2012, after years of steady increases, average pay dipped 10 percent. What followed were two years of strong gains, until last year. And for all the talk about measures designed to incentivize long-term performance, many chief executives took home enormous cash bonuses, which do little to promote foresight. Mr. Moonves got $23.7 million in cash, while Mr. Dauman received $18.3 million.What is more, when executive compensation is compared with worker salaries, today\u2019s pay packages seem gargantuan.Seen in this light, the compensation committees that set C.E.O. pay are orchestrating a large-scale transfer of wealth to a few hundred individuals \u2014 most of them men, most of them white.Previous efforts to rein in executive pay haven\u2019t yielded many results. So-called \u201csay on pay measures,\u201d which let investors voice their opinions on executive pay, have had little effect. The S.E.C.\u2019s pay ratio rule may make some companies look bad, yet many analysts predict executive pay will continue the trajectory it has followed for decades, climbing ever higher.\u201cThe amount of power that we\u2019ve allowed to be concentrated in the hands of C.E.O.s is worrisome,\u201d Ms. Slavkin Corzo said. \u201cThere is nobody out there that has the power to put their thumb on the scale on the other direction. There are lots of ways you can tweak around the edges, but at the end of the day if you want change, it\u2019s about changing the power structures in corporate America.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Women in Tech Band Together to Track Diversity, After Hours", "Date": "2016-05-03", "News": "Supported byThe group\u2019s push is one of the more visible diversity efforts to come from women in Silicon Valley as tech companies grapple with criticism over the makeup of their work forces, which skew white and male. Over the last few years, tech entrepreneurs like Kimberly Bryant of Black Girls Code and Laura Weidman Powers of Code 2040 have promoted the inclusion of young women and minorities in early computer science education programs with their start-ups.All of them are working on Project Include outside of their respective workplaces, on their own time.As part of Project Include, the group plans to extract commitments from tech companies to track the diversity of their work forces over time and eventually share that data with other start-ups. The effort will focus on start-ups that employ 25 to 1,000 workers, in the hope of spurring the companies to think about equality sooner rather than later. The project will also ask for participation from venture capital firms that advise and mentor the start-ups.Project Include aims to have 18 companies as part of its first cohort; a few have already signed up. The group will meet regularly for seven months to define and track specific metrics. At the end of that period, the group will publish an anonymized set of results to show the progress \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 that the start-ups have made around diversity.\u201cIf companies start early with diversity and inclusion, they don\u2019t have to bolt it on later, which is much harder,\u201d said Ms. Baker, the former Google engineer, who now works at Slack, a workplace collaboration software start-up.\u201cIt is this incredibly self-serving mythology that we are the best and the brightest, and that the best ideas rise to the top and will get funded,\u201d said Ms. Kapor Klein, noting there is plenty of data to show that minority access to tech programs and networks is worse than that of white males. \u201cDespite an avalanche of rigorous data to the contrary, the belief in pure meritocracy persists.\u201dMany of the women involved in Project Include were already leading diversity efforts before they decided to collaborate. Last year, for example, Ms. Pao became something of a magnet for women who were disenfranchised with inequality issues in tech after her case against Kleiner Perkins.So when Ms. Pao had the seeds of the idea for what would become Project Include, it was easy to find others to join forces. She reached out over Twitter\u2019s private message system to Ms. Baker, who is known in Silicon Valley for raising awareness around diversity issues. Ms. Baker in turn introduced Ms. Pao to Ms. Hutchinson; Ms. Pao already knew Ms. Blount through their time working together at Reddit. Eventually, over a dinner, they settled on a group of eight, with a number of outside supporters.Kate Mitchell, managing director at the venture capital firm Scale Venture Partners and a co-chairwoman of a National Venture Capital Association task force on diversity, said her group was working with Project Include because of its tech-centric, start-up approach to sharing data and information with other participants.\u201cIt\u2019s taking a page out of open-source software,\u201d Ms. Mitchell said. \u201cYou measure, you try things, you iterate and then you build on top of each other\u2019s ideas and make your companies even better.\u201dThe hope, over time, is for members of Project Include to form a community open to discussing inclusion issues among one another. \u201cA lot of these conversations are very uncomfortable for people,\u201d Ms. Pao said. \u201cThese are exactly the types of uncomfortable conversations that we need to have.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018The Mirror Thief,\u2019 by Martin Seay", "Date": "2016-05-27", "News": "Supported byFictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Recently I was browsing in an esoteric bookshop in a small medieval town in England when I found, among witches\u2019 almanacs, books on dog reincarnation and boxes of runes, a paperback called \u201cThe Secret History of the World.\u201d This was the kind of book that had apparently inspired \u201cThe Da Vinci Code.\u201d Secret societies, strange connections, gargoyles. I love all that stuff. Who doesn\u2019t? So I almost bought it.But I didn\u2019t, because I had no need for it. At home I already had a 600-page book, two-thirds read, that had so far promised me insights into numerology, card counting, the chaos of war, the secrets of the city, alchemy, fake books, art history, the rule of three, the manufacture of mirrors and the workings of 16th-century magi. This was the only book I needed; the book I was raving about to my friends before I\u2019d even finished it. The novel whose bookmark was simply a pencil, because of the volume of notes I was making in its \u00admargins.\u201cThe Mirror Thief\u201d is Martin Seay\u2019s debut novel, and it arrived covered in prepublication blurbs from indie booksellers proclaiming its brilliance, its similarity to David Mitchell\u2019s \u201cCloud Atlas,\u201d its compulsive readability and so on, and everything in its opening pages seemed to sparkle and shine. One of my novelist friends picked up the book while I was mid-rave and read out the first sentence. A single word: \u201cListen.\u201d He snorted. \u201c\u200a\u2018Listen\u2019? Why do all American novels begin like that? \u2018Listen\u2019? What\u2019s next? The sound of the ocean or something?\u201dNo. The next line is, \u201cThis is what you see.\u201dI\u2019m such a sucker for books like this \u2014 mystical literary fiction with a hard edge \u2014 that I had been planning my glowing review since around Page 150. How could I express that while this novel seems on the surface to be a bit like \u201cCloud Atlas\u201d (multiple perspectives, Russian doll structure), it\u2019s more heartfelt, deeper, less of a pastiche? I thought I might describe it as \u201cStone Junction\u201d rewritten by David Foster Wallace or Thomas Pynchon with a big twist of William Gibson, Susanna Clarke and Italo Calvino. But I wasn\u2019t sure that would cover it. Maybe I would begin by praising the genius of setting the novel in three different versions of Venice: the Venetian casino in Las Vegas (\u201ca machine for forgetting\u201d) in 2003; Venice Beach, Calif. (a lagoon \u201cindependent of geography\u201d), in 1958; and Venice, Italy (a \u201cturkeyleg island\u201d), in 1592. Oh how I was loving this clever, well-written book that even seemed to promise to reveal how magic worked. Like, actual magic! This was going to be a huge best seller. This was \u201cThe Da Vinci Code\u201d for intellectuals. \u201cFoucault\u2019s Pendulum\u201d all over again. Then, eventually, after a month of scribbling in the margins, I finished it.\u201cThe Mirror Thief\u201d is, it turns out, essentially a book about hermeneutics and disappointment. It\u2019s a book about reading, specifically depth reading, to a point of inexplicable transcendence. What does one find in the depths? Nothing? Everything? A bit of both? The book \u2014 in the end long, frustrating and slow \u2014 becomes a mirror, perhaps inscribed, as are several mirrors in this text, with the words \u201cthis is the face of god you see.\u201d But what that actually means is anyone\u2019s guess. Its main lesson, that \u201cthe reader, not the poet, is the alchemist,\u201d is a hard one to apply. Ten, nine, eight pages from the end, one still hopes, but this book does not contain any of the answers offered by \u201cThe Secret History of the World.\u201d It doesn\u2019t even supply the answers to most of its own questions. This is not \u201cThe Da Vinci Code\u201d for intellectuals. It\u2019s more like \u201cHowl\u201d translated into Latin and then back again. Over 600 pages. It\u2019s amazing.All reviews of this novel are going to ruin the thrill of its structure, just as reviews of \u201cCloud Atlas\u201d did. So here goes. We begin in Las Vegas with Curtis Stone, a former military policeman who has been hired by his old acquaintance Damon Blackburn to find Stanley Glass, a card counter who has recently hit Blackburn\u2019s Atlantic City casino the Spectacular (a.k.a. the Point). Curtis finds not Stanley but a battered copy of the book that has inspired his life, a collection of dense and complex poems called \u201cThe Mirror Thief.\u201d This book serves as a portal through which we enter the streets of Venice Beach in 1958 as Stanley, then a 16-year-old runaway, searches for Adrian Welles, the book\u2019s author. Stanley has sensed magic in \u201cThe Mirror Thief\u201d and wants to know how it works. But all Welles can do is open another portal, this time into the life of the book\u2019s protagonist, the displaced Cypriot and possible double agent Vettor Crivano, as he moves around Venice in 1592 trying to bring to fruition a complex plot involving mirror-makers and alchemists.The book then spirals through those three narrations to its conclusion, which has been sort of foreshadowed 500 pages earlier when Stanley \u201clong ago stopped paying the story any mind. He\u2019s come to regard it as a fillip at best, at worst as a device meant to conceal the book\u2019s true purpose.\u201d Do we find out how magic works? No. Or maybe yes. Did I mention that the mirror is \u201ca machine for unseeing\u201d? This book is a machine for unreading.It is impossible to get through the novel without a dictionary (not a concise one; I recommend the Chambers app or the O.E.D.), an atlas and a permanent connection to Google. This is not a book to take on vacation without a good data-roaming package. Unless, that is, you already know a great deal about the Battle of Lepanto, the Beat poets, kabbalah, the works of Machiavelli (referred to only as \u201ca certain clerk of Florence\u201d), who a haseki sultan might be, what a janissary might do, what it means for an \u201cictus\u201d to suddenly come upon someone. Reading this novel sometimes feels like being 8 years old again, learning new words in every sentence. \u201cIn the milling street Crivano feels invisible again, a tessera blended into a mosaic.\u201d Or \u201cThe smell of boiling pitch from the Arsenal has scoured away the tideland miasma, and Crivano tucks his sudarium back into his doublet.\u201d Or \u201cThe question carries an undertone of anxiety, audible though unvoiced, like the drone-strings of a robab.\u201dThe 20th-century sections can be just as thrillingly obscure. A casino building looks like \u201can Anasazi cliffpalace reworked by Frank Lloyd Wright\u201d; someone\u2019s irises are \u201cthe color of Windex.\u201d But there are plenty of more conventionally vivid descriptions as well. A house \u201csits on its wide sandy lot like a lunatic on a parkbench, tricked out in his best suit, with nowhere to go and nothing to do but fix passers-by with a silent crooked smile.\u201d Or \u201cThe shoreline seems limp, collapsed, like an old helium balloon.\u201d Elsewhere, pigeons coo under the eaves alongside the \u201cdowny puffs\u201d their pale guano has glued to the sill. There is a lot of excrement in this book. Descriptions of voiding and the contents of chamber pots are presented alongside extravagant descriptions of meals, paintings, the layout of cities. It is as if nothing is left out. There is no change of pace. Everything is described in minute detail. Except the most important bits, which duck and feint into the margins.How this book got published is a complete mystery to me. Not because it is not good enough, but rather because it is too good. I can\u2019t imagine any mainstream publisher not asking the author to cut at least 200 pages, include more human relationships, use more cause-and-effect plotting, not require the reader to look everything up all the time (including the major locations, which are not named), deliver on at least 50 percent of its promises and not bury significant plot details in a language and register that you need a postgraduate education and research skills to understand. But then it would just be like every other book. And \u201cThe Mirror Thief,\u201d audaciously well written, demanding, frustrating and oddly enlightening, is absolutely not that.Scarlett Thomas\u2019s latest novel, \u201cThe Seed Collectors,\u201d was published this month.Advertisement"}

That means he also has to spend hours each week coordinating that travel.Help has arrived with the Pana app, which employs artificial intelligence to aid customers.Many of the virtual assistant services use artificial intelligence, a branch of computer science that simulates intelligent human behavior. Some respond to questions posed by travelers, either in live speech or digitally, while some, like Pana, rely on additional input by humans to provide answers.Although many services are now in their infancy, they are expected to change the way travel is planned in the not-too-distant future.The Pana app lets users chat, in conversational language, about booking travel and helps if they encounter a delay or cancellation. Responses are provided by a team of travel agents who are on duty round the clock and have access to artificial intelligence to gather information customized for the traveler.Mr. Baer, who has been a Pana devotee since last year and recently signed a contract for his staff of 11 to use it, relies on it primarily for tips on places he visits and to rebook when his schedule changes or he encounters an unexpected delay.Like many in the travel industry, Miriam Moscovici, director of emerging technologies for BCD Travel, a travel management company, predicts that within a year \u201clower-priority tasks will be handled by self-service artificial intelligence, which will free up human travel agents to do more of the intense work required.\u201dWayBlazer and Watson\u2019s cognitive technology are the brains behind Connie, a robot being tested at the Hilton in McLean, Va., outside Washington. Connie answers guests\u2019 questions about amenities and services, and also suggests local attractions.Norm Rose, an analyst for Phocuswright, a travel research company, predicted that artificial intelligence would help simplify and automate travel planning by providing quicker responses and more relevant content.But noting that artificial intelligence is not yet capable of completely replacing human interactions, he warned it could also alienate travelers if a travel company used it but was unable to answer their questions.He said artificial intelligence systems need to understand the vocabulary used in travel to be successful, but still may have difficulty helping travelers if their requests are complex. He also said some emerging systems are arranging complex itineraries that contain multiple flights or involve flights and hotels, and predicted many will eventually be able to handle both.Expedia is among a few dozen companies and organizations that Facebook recently said would use a new chatbot on the social network\u2019s Messenger platform. This lets users pose questions in digital chats and employs artificial intelligence-powered systems to provide answers. Expedia is testing responding to hotel booking requests via Messenger.Passengers of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, an earlier partner on Messenger, can now use the platform to confirm bookings and get flight status updates. The airline also plans to offer bookings through Messenger. And since 2011, the airline has been testing a 6-foot-3 robot, Spencer, at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, its home base. In its most recent trial, which ended in March, Spencer escorted travelers to their gates.Robots are also being used at select Starwood, InterContinental and Marriott hotels in the United States and are being tested in Europe by SNCF, the French railway, and on cruise ships operated by Costa and Aida.Skyscanner, a travel search engine, this year developed a voice-enabled app for Alexa, the cloud-based voice service for the Echo from Amazon, to search for flights. Alexa also recently began working with Kayak to help users search for flights, hotels, rental cars and destinations, though no booking is done through it.HelloGBye will begin testing an app this summer that lets users type or speak into their phone and create an itinerary with flights and hotel accommodations. The app can book travel for as many as nine people at once.In November, Hipmunk, which has helped travelers research and book travel online since 2010, began testing a free, personalized virtual travel-planning assistant, Hello Hipmunk, powered by artificial intelligence. It provides help via email. Users can also give Hello Hipmunk permission to access their Google calendar, which it then periodically scans for events requiring travel and proactively provides booking options.The Pana app answers many users\u2019 questions in less than a minute, said Devon Tivona, the company\u2019s chief executive, and agents notify customers if more time is required. Pana is geared toward people who frequently travel for business. Its monthly fees range from $19 for one person to $449 for companies with fewer than 200 employees. Introduced in a beta test last summer, it formally began operating in April and works with thousands of individual travelers and fewer than 100 businesses.Mr. Baer, the digital marketing consultant, said Pana is \u201cso reasonably priced and so fast, if you travel any more than once a month, it\u2019s literally a no-brainer to buy this.\u201d His company pays $250 a month for its services.Henry Harteveldt, a travel analyst for Atmosphere Research, predicted that artificial intelligence would make shopping for travel \u201cmore efficient, less time-consuming and more useful.\u201dMr. Harteveldt said this would occur, in part, because travel-planning tools that employ artificial intelligence would make use of travelers\u2019 relevant data, such as their home city and age, and would not require them to use technical terms, like airport codes, as many sellers now do. The result, he added, would be tools that come up with suggestions \u201cat lightning speed that are contextually relevant.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google to Get Fiat Chrysler Minivans for Self-Driving Tests", "Date": "2016-05-03", "News": "Supported byDETROIT \u2014 The development of self-driving cars in recent years has been primarily a competition between technology companies and automakers working independently of each other.But that dynamic changed markedly on Tuesday, when Google said it would expand its testing of autonomous vehicles by installing its technology in a fleet of minivans made by Fiat Chrysler.The deal is the most prominent example yet of a Silicon Valley company collaborating with a traditional automaker on self-driving vehicles.It could also prove to be a breakthrough in the generally wary relationship between technology and auto companies, and prompt more collaborative efforts.The deal is a major departure for Google, which previously had chosen to work mostly on its own in creating and testing self-driving vehicles.For Fiat Chrysler, the arrangement allows the company to gain access to Google\u2019s expertise in driverless cars rather than develop its own technology.Analysts said Fiat Chrysler needed a partner to catch up to other car companies that are investing heavily in self-driving vehicles.\u201cIt couldn\u2019t have picked a better one than Google, which is far down the road with self-driving cars,\u201d said Michelle Krebs, an analyst with the firm Autotrader.No financial terms were disclosed for the deal, which calls for Fiat Chrysler to provide Google with 100 Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans built specifically to accommodate self-driving features.The companies said that Fiat Chrysler would design and engineer the minivans, and that Google would then integrate sensors and computer systems into the vehicles.The arrangement is the first time Google has worked directly with an automaker to adapt mass-market vehicles for self-driving purposes. Until now, Google had used an automotive supplier to build its own autonomous-vehicle prototypes.John Krafcik, the chief executive of the Google Self-Driving Car Project, said the deal was a critical step in efforts to create autonomous vehicles for everyday driving. He said the collaboration \u201cwill accelerate our efforts to develop a fully self-driving car that will make our roads safer and bring everyday destinations within reach for those who cannot drive.\u201dSergio Marchionne, Fiat Chrysler\u2019s chief executive, has been outspoken in recent months about his company\u2019s desire to form technology partnerships, partly to defray the cost of developing high-tech systems on its own.\u201cThe experiences both companies gain will be fundamental to delivering automotive technology solutions that ultimately have far-reaching commercial benefits,\u201d he said.Other automakers, such as General Motors and Ford Motor, are also moving rapidly to develop self-driving cars. G.M., for example, has agreed to buy the technology company Cruise Automation to begin outfitting its cars with self-driving systems.At the same time, federal regulators are working on setting new guidelines for self-driving vehicles. Google is part of a coalition \u2014 which includes Ford and Volvo \u2014 that supports swift passage of rules to allow for driverless cars on the nation\u2019s roadways.Google is testing its own self-driving prototypes in California and elsewhere. The company has also modified sport utility vehicles produced by Toyota to accommodate self-driving systems.But the Pacifica hybrid minivan is a larger vehicle that can accommodate more passengers. With features like electronically controlled sliding doors, the van could be well suited to ferrying larger groups of people without the need for an actual driver.There was no indication that Fiat Chrysler had an inside track to mass produce self-driving vehicles for Google one day. For now, the collaboration is said to be strictly for testing purposes.The companies said their engineering teams would work together at an unnamed location in Michigan.\u201cIt is a deal that should benefit both parties,\u201d said Jack Nerad, an analyst with the auto-research firm Kelley Blue Book.Mr. Nerad said adapting a gasoline-electric hybrid vehicle like the Pacifica was a logical extension of Google\u2019s testing efforts. For Fiat Chrysler, the deal highlights the attributes of the new version of its bellwether minivan, which is going on sale this year.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to look at this as anything but a win-win,\u201d he said.The nation\u2019s top auto-safety regulator, Mark Rosekind, said last week that self-driving technology had the potential to reduce traffic fatalities \u2014 currently 33,000 a year \u2014 on American roads.The technology has also been supported by those who advocate self-driving vehicles for disabled people who cannot operate a car, as well as by groups like Mothers Against Drunk Driving that aim to reduce accidents involving alcohol consumption.Opponents of fully autonomous vehicles have said the safety of driverless cars has yet to be proved, and they cite wrecks involving Google prototypes on public streets.Currently, there are no federal rules that expressly prohibit autonomous vehicles. But California has proposed that self-driving cars require an actual driver behind the wheel to take control if autonomous systems fail to operate safely.Bill Vlasic reported from Detroit and Neal E. Boudette from Ann Arbor, Mich.Advertisement"}

And its home solar division will sell the future customer agreements it originates to two partners, Sunrun and Spruce, once the systems are up and running.That approach will allow the residential solar business to break even by next year, Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG\u2019s chief executive, said in a conference call with analysts.\u201cWe don\u2019t have any grand aspirations in terms of the total sales and installations that we want to have for the year,\u201d Mr. Gutierrez said, declining to disclose financial goals.

{"Headline": "Why Dark Money Is Bad Business", "Date": "2016-05-10", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsBoston \u2014 IT\u2019S only May, but this presidential election is on track to be one of the most expensive ever. So far two-thirds of political advertising dollars have largely come from anonymous corporate donations, funneled through what have been referred to as \u201cdark money\u201d nonprofit groups that freely engage in electoral and legislative politics, but don\u2019t have to disclose their donors, expenditures or even their members.One of the most promising strategies to stem the tide of corporate dark money is a proposed rule at the Securities and Exchange Commission that would require public companies to report the amounts and recipients of their political spending. The rule has received a groundswell of support from a bipartisan group of former S.E.C. commissioners, state treasurers and law professors, and has generated more than one million public comments.Defenders of the status quo argue the companies are simply exercising their right to free speech; critics contend that such speech, when anonymous, does immense harm to the democratic process.But as lawyers who specialize in investor rights, we see another critical, nonpartisan reason to support the rule: When it comes to political spending, companies are often not as informed as one might think \u2014 especially when it comes to dark money.By mandating disclosure, the rule would allow investors to serve as a potential check on risky political donations, and help investors determine whether a company\u2019s political spending habits make its shares a good investment in the first place.In theory, a company gives money to influence politics in its favor. But there are countless examples where dark-money spending has undermined their business interests. In fact, giving to dark-money groups may be the riskiest kind of political spending, because companies often have no idea who else is giving, and whether their interests are in competition.For example, in 2010 Target, a company that supports gay rights and has openly gay employees, donated $150,000 to a Minnesota organization called MN Forward, which advocates pro-business tax and economic development policies. But MN Forward ran TV ads supporting a candidate for governor who sought a state constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. When news about the donation came to light, the company faced an employee backlash and a boycott from consumers that ultimately resulted in a personal apology from Gregg Steinhafel, Target\u2019s chief executive, and the formation of a committee to review the company\u2019s political spending.That same year, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a trade association whose members include major manufacturers of contraceptive products such as Merck and Johnson & Johnson, gave a total of $4.8 million to two nonprofits, the American Action Network and the American Future Fund, because they promoted limited government. Both organizations, however, used the money to help elect lawmakers who voted to eliminate funding for access to contraceptives through programs like Title X and Planned Parenthood.A number of corporations had also placed their business interests at risk as members of the American Legislative Exchange Council, until they resigned in 2014. For instance, while Google was devoting significant resources toward developing green energy technologies, its ALEC membership dues were helping campaigns seeking to gut renewable energy standards.Why aren\u2019t companies more careful? One major reason is that the very nature of dark-money giving means that investors have virtually no information about it, and therefore cannot hold companies accountable for their mistakes.Political spending is considered an ordinary business expense under corporate law, which means that companies have no obligation to disclose it to shareholders (and rarely do so voluntarily). It is therefore impossible for investors to track dark-money spending, at best learning about it long after the fact from watchdog groups and investigative journalists.The rule wouldn\u2019t restrict the companies\u2019 right to give money, and there may be instances where political spending is a smart move. For example, a company may reasonably believe that giving to an organization that opposes some of its products is worthwhile because the organization successfully lobbies for lower corporate tax rates.Beyond the risk to business interests, investors should have a right to know whether their money is going toward politicians, legislation or causes that they support or oppose, as union members already have. More and more investors are choosing to make decisions on that basis: Between 2012 and 2014, socially responsible investing in the United States increased by 76 percent, from $3.74 trillion to $6.75 trillion.The S.E.C. has yet to officially endorse a political-spending rule. However, this week, the commission will be required to finally state its position on the rule in response to a lawsuit in the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. We believe that, in addition to the integrity of our democracy, transparent political spending is essential to good corporate governance and sound investment.An Op-Ed article on May 10 about the regulation of \u201cdark money\u201d in political campaigns misstated the nature of two-thirds of anonymous, third-party spending during this election cycle. It is political advertising spending, not overall spending.Kathleen M. Donovan-Maher and Steven L. Groopman are attorneys with the law firm Berman DeValerio.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alexei Ratmansky Has Russian Poetry and an American Pulse", "Date": "2016-05-11", "News": "Supported byNew York comes with a beat that certain people, like the choreographer Alexei Ratmansky, can instantly follow. \u201cIt welcomes you,\u201d he said in a recent interview at American Ballet Theater\u2019s studios on lower Broadway. \u201cYou don\u2019t feel like an outsider.\u201dGeorge Balanchine, another St. Petersburg transplant, introduced a jazz sensibility to the classical form in dances like \u201cThe Four Temperaments\u201d and \u201cAgon.\u201d What Mr. Ratmansky brings to ballet is a singular voice, unpredictable yet recognizable; he uses classical technique, but allows it to breathe in the joints \u2014 it\u2019s loose, rangy, forthright.This season at Ballet Theater, where he has been the artist in residence since 2009, that mingling of the Russian and American spirit will be on display in heavy rotation with programming that includes his masterly \u201cShostakovich Trilogy\u201d; \u201cFirebird,\u201d the Stravinsky vehicle that put Misty Copeland on the map; and \u201cSeven Sonatas,\u201d a subtle, luminous ballet set to Scarlatti.In June, he will present his take on Pushkin\u2019s \u201cThe Golden Cockerel,\u201d inspired by Michel Fokine\u2019s 1914 Ballets Russes production. And the season closes with his staging of \u201cThe Sleeping Beauty,\u201d which brings the spirit of Marius Petipa\u2019s 1890 choreography to life.But first comes a new ballet to be unveiled at Ballet Theater\u2019s gala on Monday, May 16: an exploration of love set to and named after Leonard Bernstein\u2019s \u201cSerenade After Plato\u2019s Symposium.\u201d For Mr. Ratmansky, creating a ballet to Bernstein \u2014 it\u2019s not his first; he has choreographed two versions of \u201cThe Dybbuk\u201d \u2014 is a chance to pair his choreography not only with an American composer but also one who is synonymous with New York City.\u201cI was looking for American music,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I discovered it, I fell in love.\u201dThe 1954 score, according to Bernstein\u2019s notes, is not a literal rendering of Plato\u2019s text but rather \u201ca series of related statements in praise of love.\u201d As Mr. Ratmansky said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe that philosophy can be translated into dance; but it\u2019s about love, which is very much part of our field for ballet.\u201dIn \u201cSymposium,\u201d seven men, or speakers, ruminate on aspects of love; a woman, Diotima, about whom Socrates speaks, appears near the end of the ballet. Each of the men, the dancer Calvin Royal III said, has an individual voice. His, he explained, is \u201cmore pensive and lyrical \u2014 very introspective. It\u2019s not in any way showy, but it\u2019s expressive and definitely has something deeper and important to say.\u201d He added: \u201cI think it\u2019s unlocked many things in me.\u201dAnd, as usual, it is physically taxing. \u201cIt\u2019s a little too ambitious to only have eight dancers for a half an hour of big symphonic music,\u201d Mr. Ratmansky said. \u201cSo I think they\u2019re all going to die at once.\u201dHe laughed and added: \u201cWhich they always do in my ballets, I\u2019m afraid.\u201dAt the time of this conversation, Mr. Ratmansky was half- finished with the dance. It\u2019s not his favorite place to be as a choreographer. \u201cI call it mid-process crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t say more about it, because it hasn\u2019t taken shape yet.\u201dDeveloping his choreographic vision was a process itself. Born in St. Petersburg and raised in Ukraine, he trained at the school of the Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow. He performed with the National Ballet of Ukraine before moving to Canada to dance with the Royal Winnipeg Ballet. It was there, under its artistic director, John Meehan, that he transformed as a dancer, performing works by George Balanchine, Frederick Ashton, Jerome Robbins and Twyla Tharp. He acquired speed and, he said, more turnout in the hips. He also learned how to push more from the floor for jumps.\u201cI did change quite fast I think,\u201d he said. \u201cIt took a year, and then I was completely opposed to the Russian school, which was not right of course, but it was my reaction. And then I learned how to see balance: good things and less good things on both sides.\u201dMr. Royal, who has worked extensively with Mr. Ratmansky over the years, described his style as composed of many elements. \u201cExpressive, dramatic, demanding,\u201d he said. \u201cQuick feet, a very lush port de bras. He\u2019s always asking us to make his movements look more organic. To look more natural, but not necessarily at ease. It\u2019s organic in making it seamlessly fit with the music and the people you\u2019re dancing with onstage.\u201dDancers in a Ratmansky piece form a society. There is an insistence that they must work together \u2014 performing with and for each other to immerse themselves into the perfume of each particular world. And it\u2019s not only the dancers of Ballet Theater who get to live inside such realms this spring. New York City Ballet continues performances of his \u201cConcerto DSCH\u201d this month. And Miami City Ballet brought his \u201cSymphonic Dances,\u201d set to Rachmaninoff, to Lincoln Center in April.As he considers the season and the prospect of all of his ballets coming at once, Mr. Ratmansky is uneasy. \u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll survive.\u201dThat fear comes, in part, because of the hours required to prepare his ballets for the stage. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of work, and it needs to be done precisely with a lot of details,\u201d he said. \u201cThe commitment is there, but details, the polish.\u201d And also, he said: \u201cI worry about the sales \u2014 maybe the audience will say it\u2019s too much of this guy.\u201dBut the lineup demonstrates the versatility of what Mr. Ratmansky, who received his citizenship this year, has created while living in the United States. He said that he doesn\u2019t see himself as any more American now: \u201cI don\u2019t feel I\u2019ve changed much. Of course, my understanding of ballet is completely different from when I was at school.\u201d The loosening of the Iron Curtain, as he put it, changed much for Mr. Ratmansky. \u201cWe started to get information, and that really made a big impact on me,\u201d he said. Even now, he added, \u201cI love Google Books.\u201dMastering the Stepanov notation \u2014 a system of recording dance that dates to the turn of the 20th century \u2014 took time, but, he said, \u201cIt opened the treasury room for me.\u201dHe has inserted vintage steps into recent ballets; there will be some in his Bernstein premiere. \u201cWhen I run out of steps, that gives me steps,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cBut I know that Petipa did a lot of that, and I know Balanchine did a lot of that. I believe that all choreographers do that. Petipa presented the works of his predecessors like Balanchine did with Petipa\u2019s ballets. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m stealing something. There is a good side to it: You have the hand of someone behind you that supports you. It\u2019s a good feeling.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Posts are usually written in bursts around politically sensitive events, like protests or key national political events, and are often intended to distract the public from bad news.The study could shed light on an active but shadowy part of China\u2019s complex system of tools used to guide online public opinion at home. Its best-known tool is the Great Firewall, the sophisticated system of Internet filters and blocks that prevents people in China from accessing Facebook, Twitter and Google, as well as foreign media sources such as The New York Times.But it has others that depend on China\u2019s manpower and spending to manage. Prodding people to write comments online represents the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s longstanding effort to channel public opinion, said David Bandurski, editor of the China Media Project at the University of Hong Kong. \u201cThe whole premise being that the party needs to be more savvy and clever in directing the agenda,\u201d he said.China\u2019s top Internet monitor, the Cyberspace Administration of China, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Domestically, the report found that Beijing primarily sought to guide public opinion by having commenters write posts designed to \u201cregularly distract the public and change the subject\u201d rather than rebut arguments against the government line.\u201cDistraction is a clever strategy in information control in that an argument in almost any human discussion is rarely an effective way to put an end to an opposing argument,\u201d it said.The effects of this strategy are amplified by highly coordinated campaigns in which bursts of messages are posted around news or events as they go viral, according to the report.Based on a trove of leaked emails from a local Internet propaganda office in the eastern Chinese province of Jiangxi in 2013 and 2014, the report examined 43,000 confirmed government-sponsored posts and cited a number of examples of government-backed comment campaigns.The study also tracked the sources of almost all of the 43,000 posts back to groups and individuals from 200 different government agencies. While 20 percent came from the district Internet propaganda office, other comments came from local township governments and even further afield, from people in the district sports bureau and the district human resources bureau. The fact that most commenters are employed by the government likely allows for quick and efficient coordination, according to the report.To determine the total number of posts in China, the researchers used their knowledge of the number of government-fabricated posts in a single county in 2013 and extrapolated how many government-sponsored posts there were per Internet user there.Tracking government activity has become trickier, as Chinese users shift away from social-media services that are broadly accessible to anybody. They increasingly use mobile-chat apps, like China\u2019s WeChat, where only friends connected over the app can see one another\u2019s posts.An article on Monday about online commenters in China who are paid to post messages favorable to the government misstated the university affiliations of two of the three authors of a study showing that most commenters are government employees. The study was not by \u201cresearchers at Harvard\u201d; while Gary King is a professor there, Jennifer Pan is an assistant professor at Stanford, and Margaret E. Roberts is an assistant professor at the University of California, San Diego.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Microsoft Cutting 1,850 Jobs in Smartphone Unit", "Date": "2016-05-25", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Microsoft is making further cuts to what is left of its ailing smartphone business, as sales of the devices continue to fade.In an email to all Microsoft employees sent early Wednesday, Terry Myerson, executive vice president of the company\u2019s Windows and devices group, described the cuts as \u201cincredibly difficult\u201d but said that Microsoft needed \u201cto be more focused in our phone hardware efforts.\u201dAs downbeat a note as the layoffs were for Microsoft\u2019s smartphone business, there isn\u2019t much left of the army of people it once had working on the devices.The acquisition of Nokia\u2019s mobile business will go down as one of the costlier missteps in Microsoft\u2019s history. The company\u2019s previous chief executive, Steven A. Ballmer, made the deal with the goal of transforming Microsoft, a company that was struggling to keep pace with the likes of Apple and Google in the mobile business.But the fortunes of Nokia, a once-mighty player in mobile, had already soured as sales of traditional cellphones lost ground to software-rich smartphones. The combination of its hardware expertise and Microsoft\u2019s software skills never produced the results Microsoft had hoped for.While some of its phones were well reviewed, independent app developers treated Microsoft\u2019s smartphones as an afterthought, making it less attractive to customers.Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s current chief executive, has taken a different approach to the mobile business than his predecessor, pushing the company\u2019s development teams to release mobile apps, including its Office franchise, for the iPhone and the Android operating system from Google.Microsoft has also created a common Windows operating system that runs on all of its devices, including phones, tablets like Surface and the Xbox One game console. The long-term goal of unifying the software for all the devices is to get developers more interested in Windows by giving them a much bigger audience to reach with their apps.Microsoft said it would introduce new smartphones in the future, suggesting that they would be aimed at business customers, who have shown more interest in the company\u2019s devices.\u201cWhen I look back on our journey in mobility, we\u2019ve done hard work and had great ideas but have not always had the alignment needed across the company to make an impact,\u201d Mr. Myerson wrote in his e-mail to Microsoft employees.Mark Scott contributed reporting from Rome.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Regeneron Pharmaceuticals to Sponsor Science Talent Search", "Date": "2016-05-26", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A long-running scholastic science and math competition has a new champion, more money and a splashy kickoff with a famous scientist.On Thursday, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, a biotechnology company based in Tarrytown, N.Y., will announce that it is taking over sponsorship of the Science Talent Search with a 10-year, $100 million commitment to the high school competition.The new sponsors will be announced in New York at the American Museum of Natural History by Neil deGrasse Tyson, the celebrity astrophysicist who is director of the museum\u2019s Hayden Planetarium.Sponsorship of the prize increasingly reflects the state of American business as it relates to education in so-called STEM subjects, or science, technology, engineering and mathematics.The contest, started during World War II, counts among its finalists several Nobel Prize winners, as well as university professors, popular science authors and business executives.Westinghouse Electric \u2014 a pioneer in areas including electrification, nuclear power, commercial radio and home appliances \u2014 initially sponsored the competition. Westinghouse came to ruin over bad loans from its credit division, and Intel, riding high on the personal computer and Internet booms, took over sponsorship in 1998.Like many older companies in computer tech, Intel is now struggling with the transition from traditional software and PCs to a future of cloud computing and mobile devices. In April, Intel announced that it was laying off 12,000 people, and would concentrate more on making chips for big cloud-computing companies like Amazon and Google.Even with its troubles, the decision by Intel\u2019s chief executive, Brian M. Krzanich, to drop a $6 million prize when Intel still had net income of $2 billion in the last quarter dismayed many inside the company. Craig R. Barrett, a former Intel chief executive, sits on the board of trustees for the Society for Science & the Public, which administers the prize.\u201cI don\u2019t overinterpret facts, but I\u2019m happy to observe them,\u201d Dr. Tyson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign of the times and a statement about the future that a computer company doesn\u2019t see this as important, and a biotech company, in an industry on the eve of big breakthroughs, does.\u201dHe added, \u201cIt\u2019s still a surprise why a company would do this to its branding.\u201dStock in Regeneron, which makes drugs that treat ailments like cardiovascular disease and degeneration of the eye, has risen sixfold in the last five years. Intel has gained 35 percent, about half as much as the tech-heavy Nasdaq.In addition to increasing the top prize money to $250,000 from $150,000 and doubling awards to the top 300 contestants and their schools to $2,000 each, Regeneron will spend $30 million in outreach to potential contestants in underserved areas, paying for things like mentoring and help with writing applications and participating in contests.\u201cThis should be the best reality show in the world \u2014 we need these kinds of kids to save the planet,\u201d said George D. Yancopoulos, Regeneron\u2019s founding scientist and president of its laboratory division. \u201cThe world has challenges like cancer, the Zika virus and global warming. We need to change who our heroes are.\u201dDr. Tyson attended the prestigious Bronx High School of Science with Dr. Yancopoulos, who in 1976 placed fourth in the contest for his experiment on cellular regeneration in a type of protozoa.\u201cI didn\u2019t compete, but I remember just being in the company of people who were creating an atmosphere of learning and achievement,\u201d Dr. Tyson said. Leonard S. Schleifer, Regeneron\u2019s founder and chief executive, participated in the 1970 contest.The Science Talent Search begins with about 1,800 applicants, a number that has held steady for a decade. Their projects are narrowed down to 300. Eventually 40 finalists go to Washington for several days, where they meet leaders in government and science and have their projects judged.Rosalind L. Hudnell, an Intel vice president and president of the company\u2019s charity, Intel Foundation, congratulated the Society for Science & the Public in a statement.Regeneron stood out, she said, for \u201ca tremendous contribution to get more students to care and compete.\u201d In addition to raising the money and paying for mentors, Regeneron will also support the creation and publication of science news to 4,000 high schools.Dr. Yancopoulos, a child of immigrants, said having the Westinghouse contest around was an important reason he became a university professor, and then a business scientist.\u201cMuch in life, where you go and what you do, is about dreams and role models,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I got to Bronx Science, I wanted to play football for Notre Dame, but then in the hallways as a freshman I\u2019d see people pointing out somebody and whispering, \u2018He\u2019s a Westinghouse winner.\u2019 My world changed.\u201dSince that time, he said, elite schools like Bronx Science have done well enough in STEM, but in general local schools have found it increasingly hard to find the funds and the mentorship to make those kinds of inspirational moments possible.Even before taking over the prize, Dr. Yancopoulos said, Regeneron has sponsored about 200 high schools in local science competitions, a precursor to the national Science Talent Search.\u201cI don\u2019t want the best minds in this country to be hedge fund managers,\u201d he said. \u201cI want them to be scientists and engineers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Paula Broadwell, David Petraeus and the Afterlife of a Scandal", "Date": "2016-05-28", "News": "Supported byWEST POINT, N.Y. \u2014 It was 6:30 a.m. at the United States Military Academy, the sun was rising over the Hudson River, and Paula Broadwell was in athletic gear. With a half-dozen women, she rotated between sprints and burpees. Sweating onto the pavement, the group was perched atop an overlook called Trophy Point, in the shadow of a 46-foot battle monument memorializing those killed in the Civil War. There is a female statue in bronze at the top, arms outstretched regally, who is said to represent \u201cfame.\u201dMs. Broadwell was here in April for a 40th anniversary celebration for the academy\u2019s first class of women, who enrolled two decades before she would graduate near the top of her class, with multiple varsity letters. It was also the first time she had been back to campus since 2012, when she achieved her own kind of unwanted fame.She was the younger, equally ambitious overachiever: Olympic-distance triathlete; two master\u2019s degrees; deputy director of the center on counterterrorism at Tufts University; a research associate at Harvard, where she had first met the general six years before. \u201cShe was a standout,\u201d said Sue Fulton, a former military captain and member of the first class of women at West Point, who later became a friend.There was hubris: the man tasked with guarding the nation\u2019s secrets revealing them; a woman who had achieved incredible journalistic access committing the ultimate journalistic sin. Another friend of the general\u2019s, Jill Kelley, also became tangled up in the coverage after she reported to the F.B.I. that she was getting harassing emails. Investigators later learned they were sent by Ms. Broadwell under a pseudonym. (Ms. Broadwell, now 43, declined to comment on the emails, other than to say that she regretted sending them; Ms. Kelley said the two have never spoken directly.)\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be the least bit surprised to see him in some senior role in the next administration, Democratic or Republican,\u201d said Vernon Loeb, the managing editor at The Houston Chronicle, with whom Ms. Broadwell wrote her biography of Mr. Petraeus.Ms. Broadwell has struggled to find her footing. For weeks, reporters camped outside her home in Charlotte, N.C., where she was trying to restore her marriage. Friends sent over groceries and hot meals for her family \u2014 her husband, Scott, and sons, 8 and 10 \u2014 and staged interference so Ms. Broadwell could cut across her neighbors\u2019 lawns, climbing over fences, to escape for a morning run.She lost her military security clearance; her promotion from major to lieutenant colonel was revoked when the news broke. The F.B.I. still has her computers \u2014 including her dissertation research \u2014 and she withdrew from her Ph.D. program. She said she was told in more than one job interview that, while she was qualified, hiring her would be a public-relations nightmare.\u201cI\u2019m the first to admit I screwed up,\u201d Ms. Broadwell said. \u201cReally badly, I know that. But how long does a person pay for their mistake?\u201d\u201cThat may be, in part, an unfair standard between men and women caught in an affair,\u201d said David Bradley, the chairman of Atlantic Media, who knew Mr. Petraeus and Ms. Broadwell and once sat down with Ms. Broadwell to offer professional advice. In the aftermath, he reached out to both by email to offer sympathy and support. \u201cBut, I think it\u2019s equally the danger \u2014 the white-hot danger \u2014 for the private citizen caught in an affair with a public figure.\u201dTo journalists, she was the woman who \u2014 without any journalistic experience \u2014 had persuaded the highest commander in the land to give her unusual access and then abused it. (When the book came out, and she appeared on \u201cThe Daily Show With Jon Stewart,\u201d Mr. Stewart joked that \u201cthe real controversy here is, is he awesome or incredibly awesome?\u201d)To military colleagues, she was guilty of \u201cHollywooding\u201d: commanding the attention to herself in a culture that is all about the team. And then there was the infidelity, a crime for active duty officers for a reason. \u201cService members are required to deploy for months and months at a time \u2014 so you have to be able to trust your spouse,\u201d Ms. Fulton said. It happens, of course, so often that there\u2019s a name for it (\u201ca zipper malfunction\u201d). And yet \u201cto violate that trust is viewed as particularly egregious.\u201d\u201cI think the worst feeling is when you don\u2019t have control over your life,\u201d Ms. Broadwell said. She was sitting on the couch in her living room in Charlotte while her children were at school. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what this felt like.\u201dMr. Petraeus had many defenders \u2014 and a four-decade career of service to stand on. Ms. Broadwell did not. She said she never heard from her best friend \u2014 a crime agent with the F.B.I. She asked another friend, a woman she had mentored, if she\u2019d be willing to speak up on her behalf, but this woman was applying for a job with the C.I.A. \u201cIt was too controversial to even touch; certainly if you were active duty you would pay a price,\u201d Ms. Fulton said.There was the emotional toll of the abrupt severing of an intensely personal relationship. But there was also the professional one: her career tangled up with this man with whom she was once in love, her advocates, his allies. Mr. Petraeus had been helping her with her Ph.D., at King\u2019s College London, on military and organizational innovation. (His unit was one of the case studies.) They were working on another book together, this one focused on his leadership style, called \u201cRelentless.\u201dBefore the fallout, the Republican senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Richard Burr of North Carolina had sat her down in Mr. Burr\u2019s office to discuss a future congressional run, she said. Suddenly, overnight, she became \u2014 in her word \u2014 \u201cradioactive.\u201d (A spokeswoman for Senator Burr\u2019s office confirmed that the meeting took place, but said that he could not recall the precise nature of it.)\u201cShe has such confidence, such presence in the way she carries herself, and she commands this attention,\u201d said Rose Keravuori, a longtime friend and former West Point classmate. \u201cI think people expected her to go into politics, or do something different. And then this happened, and just, nobody helped her up. It was hard to reconcile so many people being sort of gleeful in it.\u201dA few days later, she was still nervously checking the Google alerts on her phone.\u201cYou know, Petraeus, when we were working together, he would never read anything about himself,\u201d she said, seated in the lobby of a Charlotte hotel. \u201cSometimes I wonder, am I doing myself mental harm by reading all of it.\u201dThese days, her coping mechanism is to stay busy. She is on the board of multiple local leadership organizations, and she\u2019s a member of an opera club. She volunteers for a group that provides safe houses for human trafficking victims, another that helps veterans rehabilitate. She drops off her sons at the bus stop each day, then goes for a morning run. She continues to push for women in combat, and is active in a group called West Point Women, which planned the event at her alma mater.She is emotional when she speaks about the Charlotte community that embraced her family. But she\u2019s torn: Should she try to reclaim her past \u2014 her dream of becoming a national security adviser \u2014 or should she pursue something entirely different? Should she fight to restore her military status, or simply move on?\u201cThe truth is, the military is not a place where you can rehabilitate,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a \u2018Zero Defects\u2019 policy \u2014 that\u2019s military code. So the whole redemption thing? It\u2019s not common.\u201cMy husband says I just need to walk away,\u201d she continued. \u201cSue Fulton says I needs to fight back. My lawyers \u2014 I literally ask them, \u2018What would you tell me to do if I were your daughter?\u2019 Some days I think, if I could just move on and it was never again in the news, I probably would. But I can\u2019t. My fabric is to fight back.\u201dShe has also, quietly, reached out to female journalists she thought would be sympathetic, asking them to stop using the word \u201cmistress\u201d: Christiane Amanpour at CNN; Norah O\u2019Donnell at CBS; Susan Glasser at Politico, who advised her staff to refrain from using the word.\u201cYou know that character on \u2018Game of Thrones,\u2019 Tyrion?\u201d she asked. \u201cHe says at one point, something to the effect of, \u2018You\u2019ve got to own your weakness, and then nobody can use it against you.\u2019 Well, I\u2019m trying to figure out how to do that.\u201dHer hometown newspaper, The Charlotte Observer, said it would work to retire the term, opting instead to call Ms. Broadwell and Mr. Petraeus \u201clovers.\u201d \u201cIt takes two to have an affair,\u201d said the newspaper\u2019s editor, Rick Thames.The campaign can feel a little like putting out brush fires, Ms. Broadwell said, but for now, it\u2019s given her some sense of purpose.\u201cOn the one hand, I don\u2019t want to define myself by this,\u201d she said. \u201cBut on the other hand, I\u2019ve been defined by this. So if I can change things for the better because of it, then why not?\u201dOf course, she added, \u201cMaybe some day I just need to take off the Google alerts and live in oblivion.\u201dAn article last Sunday about Paula Broadwell described imprecisely her academic record at the United States Military Academy at West Point. While Ms. Broadwell graduated in the top 5 percent of her class in fitness and military and in the top 10 percent in academics, she did not graduate \u201cat the top of her class.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gloria Steinem Brings Feminism to Viceland", "Date": "2016-05-04", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Gloria Steinem and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. were engrossed in conversation steps from his ceremonial office, where he was getting his makeup done. Ms. Steinem, already prepped, was here to interview him for \u201cWoman,\u201d her new Vice TV show.After the vice president strode away, young White House staffers stepped in to angle for their own selfies. Seen-it-all aides went rapt as Ms. Steinem recounted her experience as a 17-year-old in Washington (\u201cWe made it a project to swim in all the fountains\u201d), the first president she remembers (Franklin D. Roosevelt) and the times she picketed outside the Capitol (numerous).\u201cWhat I hope is, seeing it will be the closest thing to being on the ground yourself,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is being a witness. And people in hard times need a witness, and somebody who can help.\u201d\u201cI think she\u2019s a hero,\u201d said Shane Smith, a founder of Vice who greenlit the show.The two met at a Google conference in 2014, where she talked about the global upsurge in violence against women \u201cand the fact that it was now extreme enough so that there are fewer females on earth than males,\u201d she recalled.Mr. Smith was listening. \u201cShe gave a speech and then I bawled my eyes out,\u201d he said. \u201cI was blown away\u201d by her storytelling and the wealth of her experience. Given her connections and insight, he added, \u201cI realized she was a natural producer.\u201dBut their collaboration was hardly an obvious match: Vice made its name on bro-centric content, heavy on the danger-zone posturing, gross-out humor and dopey stoner antics. (Even its nerdiest cable show is called \u201cBalls Deep.\u201d) And as the brand\u2019s poster boy, Mr. Smith, a major onscreen presence in Vice\u2019s separate HBO show, has reveled in a cussing, anti-authoritarian persona even as he became a vaunted, and wealthy, chief executive.It helped that the team for \u201cWoman\u201d was almost entirely female, led by a group of female producers, among them Ariel Wengroff, a 26-year-old with a background in politics. Before she landed at Vice two years ago, Ms. Wengroff had never worked on, let alone created, a TV show.Ms. Steinem has other TV credits and talk show offers were dangled over the years, but they required too much time, she said, and she wasn\u2019t keen on network oversight. \u201cVice feels much more able to move quickly,\u201d she said.Ms. Steinem did not travel with them, but her expertise paved the way. \u201cGloria brought a whole different level of credibility and access to women on the ground that we wouldn\u2019t have had otherwise,\u201d Ms. Wengroff said, suggesting \u201cwhere we could and couldn\u2019t go, who she felt was credible and who she\u2019s worked with, and who also is new that we could empower.\u201dAfter the screening, the audience swapped resources. Ms. Steinem wanted more footage online of women sharing their survival stories. \u201cWe have to figure out how strong they are, and how to leave hope,\u201d she said. \u201cThe challenge is to know, and not despair, and figure out how to make it better a little bit at a time.\u201dFor Ms. Steinem, hatching ideas about grass-roots networking \u2014 how to introduce one rebel group to another, say \u2014 is as elemental as breathing. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing better than empathy,\u201d she said a few days later, at Vice\u2019s offices. It was her first visit to its new headquarters, a sprawling refurbished warehouse, with a coffee bar on the ground floor and solar power on the terrace, and she turned a few heads. But wearing a snug leather jacket, skinny black pants and a keffiyeh-style scarf, she hardly looked out of place \u2014 though she was, almost certainly, the oldest person there.In an email, her friend Lena Dunham wrote: \u201cSomething amazing about Gloria is that she is totally not content to rest on her laurels or stick to mediums she\u2019s comfortable with. It\u2019s the reason she remains so deeply relevant \u2014 that refusal to settle in.\u201dMs. Steinem was at Vice to watch footage of her interview with Mr. Biden and to give notes on an episode about female fighters in the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, a rebel group.She was warned that the chairs in the screening room reclined. \u201cBut do they vibrate?\u201d she said.Then she got down to business. She turned away when her face appeared on screen \u2014 even after a lifetime, she doesn\u2019t like watching herself. She still gets anxious about public speaking, too. \u201cI had chosen to be two things in my life, a dancer and a writer,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause I didn\u2019t want to talk. But I\u2019m grateful. The fact that no editor would print what I wanted to write, forced me into talking.\u201dFor the Vice team, Ms. Steinem\u2019s presence has been a series of pinch-me moments. \u201cI\u2019m lucky to be working with her,\u201d Mr. Smith, the Vice executive, said. Though he\u2019s reported from North Korea and covered jihadis, some of the hardships that \u201cWoman\u201d details were new to him. \u201cI found lots of it difficult to watch,\u201d he said, and grew pensive. \u201cThis is going to get very hippie-dippie,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe the universe gave me daughters\u201d \u2014 his are 4 and 5 \u2014 \u201cto help me understand the world better.\u201dMs. Steinem was impressed by her all-female Vice crew, too, whom she saw as emblematic of a generation striving not against what is, but toward what can be. \u201cThey are smart, caring and fast,\u201d she wrote in an email. She even proudly sported some company bling \u2014 a gold ring that spells out Vice, given to its top brass \u2014 although she did ask, \u201cIs this gender-free jewelry?\u201dAssured that it was worn by all sexes, she kept it on.An article last Sunday about a new Viceland TV show hosted and produced by Gloria Steinem misstated the number of weekly episodes that will air.

I think we will have it in five years.\u201dIn his first public comments on Fiat Chrysler\u2019s agreement with the tech giant, Mr. Marchionne acknowledged it was unclear how far their collaboration will go, or how they will share the results of their work.\u201cWe are approaching this in a completely open-ended fashion,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to get to a stage where the car is viable so we can discuss the spoils of that work. We are not there yet.\u201dOthers in the industry are also rushing to put autonomous vehicles on the road in real-world situations.General Motors and Lyft, the ride-hailing start-up valued at $4.5 billion, intend to test a fleet of self-driving taxis in an American city as soon as within a year, according to a person who has been briefed on the two companies\u2019 plans. That would most likely begin using the technology inside the battery-powered Chevrolet Bolt, said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk about unannounced initiatives.He then tried, without success, to persuade General Motors or other automakers to enter merger talks.Some analysts were skeptical of the agreement with Google.\u201cThey are providing Google with 100 minivans, which is great, but there\u2019s not necessarily a lot of ongoing collaboration,\u201d said Karl Brauer, an analyst at the research firm Kelley Blue Book. \u201cSo it remains to be seen how much work they actually do together.\u201dOther carmakers like Ford Motor and Audi have made no secret of spending millions of dollars to create driverless cars, usually with the idea of heading off any competitive threat that could come from driverless cars being developed by Google and its Silicon Valley rival, Apple. Some have tried to recast themselves as \u201cmobility companies\u201d that will provide the means of moving people around, whether by cars they own, rent or hail via an app.On Friday, Mr. Marchionne said the mobility concept was a \u201clofty ideal.\u201dHe also said he was not imagining a merger with Google, although he was counting on the tech giant to help Fiat Chrysler catch up in driverless car technology. \u201cWe will be walking in a collaborative fashion with them at their speed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are exploring with them to allow us into their world.\u201dHe also said that rival automakers working on their own autonomous cars, in competition with Google, were taking a risk that their investments may not pan out.\u201cIt\u2019s too early in this process to make the call who is going to end up with the winning solution,\u201d Mr. Marchionne said. \u201cPrecluding development with others is a very dangerous bet.\u201dNeal Boudette reported from Windsor, Ontario, and Mike Isaac from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Do You Love Music? Silicon Valley Doesn\u2019t", "Date": "2016-05-20", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorLos Angeles \u2014 ON Sunday night, the entire music industry will pause during the Billboard Music Awards to commemorate the visionary musician Prince. And while the focus will be on his artistic legacy, Prince also fought throughout his career against digital piracy and for the rights of artists to control their own work.That\u2019s a fight artists are losing. It\u2019s been 17 years since Napster, the online file-sharing software, began flooding the Internet with free, illegally uploaded music, devastating musicians and the industry. While Napster is long gone, the looting continues, only now it is technology giants like Google and SiriusXM, along with streaming services like Pandora, that are responsible.New services and platforms are great for consumers, but our weak laws have allowed them to siphon revenue away from the underlying music, leaving songwriters, performers and the whole industry choking on their dust.YouTube, which is owned by Google, is now the world\u2019s dominant audio streaming platform, dwarfing Spotify and virtually every other service. Yet it pays artists and record companies less than a dollar a year for every user of recorded music, thanks to rampant piracy on its site (by contrast, Spotify licenses its music and pays $20 per user each year).The song \u201cDrag Me Down\u201d by One Direction appeared on YouTube 2,700 times after the service was asked to take down unlicensed copies. These 2,700 pirated uploads allowed Google to continue profiting from advertising while the artists got nothing.Google has also leveraged its dominance in Internet search into a cash cow built on advertising. But Google doesn\u2019t care if your search for the movie \u201cMean Streets\u201d or the music from \u201cThe Last Waltz\u201d (both of which I produced) brings up licensed versions or pirated copies: The company sells ads and cashes in either way. Creators, however, get nothing from those stolen copies \u2014 except the anguish of watching others grab the value of their life\u2019s work.Google has basic \u201cdigital fingerprinting\u201d technology that could scrub both YouTube and its search results of illegal versions. But instead of safeguarding the work of artists, Google wields this tool as a bludgeon. Creators can either enter into a licensing agreement with YouTube at very low royalty rates, or get left at the mercy of pirates. What looks like protection for copyright holders is more of a protection racket benefiting Google.Unfortunately, there is a sad history of undervaluing musicians in the United States. Terrestrial radio, a $17 billion industry, pays publishing rights (payments to songwriters) but has never paid artists or record companies for music. In addition, the satellite radio company, SiriusXM, pays below-market royalties, thanks to a giveaway it first wrested from Congress 20 years ago. Conglomerates like iHeartMedia (formerly Clear Channel Communications) and other online services like Pandora, which are required to pay artists for digital streams, have exploited federal copyright law to deny payments for work recorded before 1972 (songwriters are paid; performers are not). This means artists like Aretha Franklin, Ella Fitzgerald, Chuck Berry and John Coltrane never received a dime from AM/FM radio and or from many digital services for some of their greatest music.That system may have made sense when it took minutes to download an illegal song. But today no individual can effectively police the millions of pirated files that mushroom online and reappear the instant after they are taken down. Google alone received almost 560 million takedown notices in 2015.There are two concrete steps Congress can take that would allow musicians to be treated fairly. First, Congress should update the safe harbor rules of the copyright act to achieve the balance that was intended: protecting creators with effective tools in exchange for not burdening Internet companies with liability. That means strong, well-defined consequences for repeat offenders, easing the process for filing notices and ensuring that services are using the best technology to take pirated material off their sites and keep it off.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Turning a Coffee Shop Come-On Into a Platonic Career Contact", "Date": "2016-05-13", "News": "Supported byThe WorkologistWhile in a coffee shop, I was hit on by a man who was about 20 years older than me. He gave me a compliment and handed me a note with his name and email address. I wasn\u2019t excited about it, but I didn\u2019t feel creeped out or threatened.As one does, I searched for him on Google. It turns out he\u2019s an accomplished figure in the industry in which I work, and in which I am trying to cement myself more firmly. He\u2019s been doing his job for a long time, and I would guess he has a lot of wisdom to impart, not to mention connections.I\u2019m definitely not interested in him romantically or sexually (I\u2019m in love with someone else). I am, however, interested in a professional connection.But is that a bad idea because it\u2019s not why he approached me? Or because he\u2019s expressed a presumably romantic or sexual interest and it will therefore be forever uncomfortable to have any other kind of relationship? Or even because the kind of guy who would do that in the first place is someone you want to stay away from? Our field is small, so I don\u2019t want to burn any bridges. ANONYMOUSMy suspicion is that converting this into a useful career contact is a long shot. I suppose neither one of us really knows what this man is like, so it\u2019s possible that I\u2019m being unfair. But I think you should proceed with caution.You\u2019ve already covered most of the arguments for not following up. The only one I\u2019d add is that he might conclude that an anecdote about him hitting on a significantly younger woman in a coffee shop is now circulating through his tightknit work community.But the best argument for any sort of follow-up may be that you\u2019ll end up running into him professionally at some point anyway, and that could be awkward for you both. Even with that as a rationale, I\u2019d make any communication clear and concise. Be direct about being in a relationship \u2014 or however you want to put it \u2014 in a manner that removes all ambiguity about the romantic angle. Then matter-of-factly note that you later realized you\u2019re in the same line of work. (Take care in explaining that: Googling him might be interpreted as evidence that you\u2019re more interested than you claim. Is it plausible that his name rang a bell and that\u2019s why you searched it?)Finally, rather than pivoting to a networking or mentoring request, maybe say something more neutral: Small world \u2014 maybe your paths will cross professionally at some point.He should get the message that you\u2019re not looking for a date but that you respect his role in your mutual line of work (and you\u2019re not out there gossiping about him). Leave it up to him to decide whether to offer some sort of shoptalk opportunity.This may not lead anywhere. But it should at least clear the air, and keep expectations modest \u2014 on both sides. Maybe he\u2019ll turn out to be a thoughtful and generous guy who has no problem separating the personal and the professional when he\u2019s not busy handing out his email to attractive strangers. But you\u2019re probably better off if you\u2019re not counting on that outcome.A while ago, I had a job interview scheduled via Skype. Ten minutes before it was supposed to happen, the interviewer canceled. We arranged another appointment. This time my interviewer simply never showed up. I emailed him afterward, but he did not respond.I contacted his immediate superior (with whom I\u2019d had brief email contact previously), politely suggesting an alternative interview situation. This person told me to try to set up a new time with the same interviewer. I threw up my hands. It\u2019s difficult to envision things going well after you\u2019ve brought an interviewer\u2019s shortcomings up to his boss.How would one handle this with delicate but determined self-advocacy?ANNE, AUSTIN, TEX.One the most surprising things about the Workologist inbox is the number of anecdotes involving disappearing employers: recruiters who vanish, interviewers who fail to materialize at the scheduled time, etc.The most practical response is to get over it and move on. That\u2019s probably not very satisfying, but consider the most likely explanations for such behavior. One is that the position will be filled internally, but there\u2019s some kind of pro forma process that involves talking to theoretical outside candidates. The other is that this company simply does not have its organizational act together.You\u2019ve already tried the best and most difficult response: finding a workaround that indicates your continued interest and that some deeper problem is gumming up the works. Maybe pushing back with that superior could yield something productive. If you accept that you have nothing to lose here, you could state diplomatically yet firmly that you\u2019re open to an interviewer contacting you if there is serious interest \u2014 but your time is too valuable to keep chasing someone who doesn\u2019t show up for appointments. You may never hear back, but at least you sent the right message.Employers, stories like this show that if your basic hiring procedures are sloppy, it affects your reputation \u2014 maybe more than you realize. Keep appointments, and follow up even with rejected candidates. It\u2019s not that hard.Advertisement"}

The subtext reads something like this: \u201cI made it big, and if you follow my advice, sold here for a fraction of what it cost me, you can, too.\u201d But pure altruism rarely explains much, and the ulterior motives behind these works are often as interesting as their catechisms.The veneer of beneficence is somehow easier to see through in audiobook form, as evidenced by the works reviewed here. Of the three, \u201cZero to One: Notes on Startups; Or, How to Build the Future,\u201d by the Silicon Valley investor and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, spends the least amount of time justifying itself. This gives the book the feel of an advertisement for a man who believes he has no need to advertise. Which is a very savvy approach to self-promotion.\u201cZero to One\u201d distills lectures from a class about start-ups that Thiel taught at Stanford in 2012, based on the scribblings of his former student Blake Masters, who is credited with a writing assist and who capably narrates the book. The lessons of Thiel\u2019s course are too important to be limited to a few lucky undergraduates, we are told in the preface: \u201cThere\u2019s no reason why the future should happen only at Stanford, or in college, or in Silicon Valley.\u201dSo what future-shaping advice does Thiel have for the next generation of entrepreneurs? First, competition is expensive, risky, and it invariably reduces profits. So your goal is not to dream up a company in a field that already exists and then fight for market share. No, the smart move is to found a business in a still unimagined realm \u2014 an act of creation that Thiel, a serial catchphrase coiner, calls \u201cgoing from zero to one.\u201dOnce you\u2019ve pioneered a new industry, you and your colleagues should set your sights on a very specific goal: building a monopoly. \u201cWhereas a competitive firm must sell at the market price,\u201d Thiel tells us, \u201ca monopoly owns its market, so it can set its own prices.\u201d Thiel\u2019s favorite example is Google, which all but invented the online \u00adadvertising market and has dominated it for years.As advice goes, \u201cCreate the next Google\u201d is both unassailable and perfectly useless. Thiel glancingly acknowledges that the type of start-up he is describing is rare, but the fortune he made at PayPal, and later as an investor in Facebook, has apparently convinced him that the exceptional would be far more common if people were just bolder and more imaginative. He makes this and other points in brief chapters packed with references to Pythagoras, the Unabomber, Tolkien, Karl Marx, Jim Morrison, \u00adNietzsche, John Rawls and Shakespeare. In interviews and speeches, Thiel has displayed a sense of humor that would have been helpful here. Listening to this five-hour production is like getting stuck at a dinner party beside a guy whose money and surfeit of ideas has convinced him that he should do all the talking.It takes a while to figure out the real point of \u201cGood \u00adProfit: How Creating Value for Others Built One of the World\u2019s Most Successful Companies,\u201d by Charles Koch, the chief executive of Koch Industries. The preface, narrated by Koch himself \u2014 Paul Michael, whose voice you might recall from \u201cThe Da Vinci Code\u201d audiobook, handles the rest \u2014 is a folksy origins story, traced to the family patriarch, Fred Koch, a \u201cJohn Wayne-type\u201d chemical engineer. The younger Koch, now 80 years old, quickly segues into the tale of the astounding growth of the company, which currently employs some 100,000 people in fields as varied as oil, ranching and commodities trading. One thousand dollars invested in this privately held behemoth in 1960, Koch states, would be worth $5 million today.The secret? Market-Based Management, Koch says, which turns out to be a perfectly sensible, five-part framework for making decisions about hiring, firing and managing a company. But that framework was the subject of Koch\u2019s 2007 book, \u201cThe Science of Success.\u201d So what we have here is a rehash and, at a running time that exceeds nine hours, quite a slog, despite Michael\u2019s comfortingly authoritative voice. The bulk of \u201cGood \u00adProfit\u201d is self-\u00adevident truths that have been repackaged as wisdom. Typical is this mouthful from a chapter called \u201cIncentives\u201d: \u201cEvery company should strive to leverage incentives to motivate all employees to fully develop and apply their capabilities to maximize long-term value for the company in a principled way.\u201dO.K. Did someone suggest otherwise?The liveliest part of \u201cGood Profit,\u201d and arguably its reason for being, is a series of homilies in favor of free markets and against corporate welfare and special pleading of any kind. Profit that is \u201cgood\u201d is earned honestly, without favors from the government. Giving a counterexample, Koch denounces a 2014 French law intended to aid independent bookstores by banning online booksellers from offering free shipping. \u201cArtificially propping up businesses is bad for consumers,\u201d he writes, \u201cand ultimately bad for the employees of those businesses, since change is inevitable.\u201dThere is hardly a hint here that Koch and his younger brother David are among the most politically active executives in American history. Together, they have spent hundreds of millions of dollars backing candidates who stand against regulations and taxes. By the midterm elections of 2010, according to Jane Mayer\u2019s book \u201cDark Money,\u201d these efforts yielded astounding results. Democrats lost control of the House of Representatives and Republicans gained 675 seats in state legislatures across the country.Given that Koch Industries is among the country\u2019s leading producers of toxic waste and has spent millions settling cases in federal court, these guys are not exactly disinterested parties. No, they don\u2019t lobby politicians. They just have them replaced. Whether you think this strategy leads to \u201cgood profit\u201d depends on where you stand politically. But Koch\u2019s very hands-on role in American politics is a bizarre omission in a book about the intersection of business and government.\u201cTeam of Teams,\u201d by retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal and three co-authors, appears to have several goals. It works as a calling card for his consulting firm, McChrystal Group, which brings \u201clessons from the battlefield to the boardroom,\u201d as the company\u2019s website says. The book is also a history of one of his great victories: the pursuit and eventual killing of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the elusive and sociopathic leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq.Unfortunately, McChrystal the consultant keeps interrupting McChrystal the general. After every twist and complication in the al-Zarqawi story, we pause so that some theoretical concept \u2014 usually related to how groups are organized, and how McChrystal tinkered with command structure in Iraq \u2014 can be illustrated with a historical anecdote. Thus we get a potted biography of Frederick Taylor, the father of industrial efficiency; an account of NASA in its moonshot era; the story of Horatio Nelson\u2019s victory at Trafalgar; and mini-lectures on subjects as diverse as game theory and the Navy SEALs.McChrystal turns up to narrate five-minute summaries at the end of each chapter (Paul Michael, once again, handles everything else). No doubt these are meant as refreshers, but they make you wonder if this hybrid of management course and combat memoir really needs to be 12 hours long. That\u2019s especially true when McChrystal describes his great \u201caha\u201d moment in the battle against Al Qaeda in Iraq: \u201cWe realized that our goal was not the creation of one massive team. We needed to create a team of teams.\u201d He means an organization in which groups from different fiefs, like the C.I.A. and the Army Special Forces, work together, rather than in competitive silos.That\u2019s the big reveal. Which is heartbreaking, because right after September 11 it was obvious that the intelligence agencies hadn\u2019t been communicating. McChrystal addresses this failure in a section called \u201cSharing.\u201d But he doesn\u2019t explain how lessons of that calamity could have been forgotten a few years later, let alone stand as the \u00adtitle-worthy insight of this overstuffed audiobook.ZERO TO ONENotes on Startups; Or, How to Build the FutureBy Peter Thiel with Blake MastersRead by Blake Masters5 hours.

{"Headline": "Alphabet Chairman Testifies in Oracle Suit Against Google", "Date": "2016-05-10", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Eric E. Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, may have unique insight into the multibillion-dollar lawsuit filed against his company by another Silicon Valley heavyweight, Oracle Corporation.Mr. Schmidt, in an earlier job, was in charge of the programming language that Oracle claims Google misused years later when it created software called Android, which is now the most popular operating system in the world.On Tuesday, Mr. Schmidt was the first witness in the latest round of a lawsuit Oracle first filed against Google nearly six years ago.The outcome of the trial, expected in early June after testimony by some of the most famous people in technology, could have industrywide implications for software development.Oracle initially sought $8.8 billion, but is expected to raise that to $9.4 billion, based on recent estimates of how much profit Google has made from Android, which a lawyer for Oracle put at $21 billion since a working version of Android made its debut in 2008.About three billion Android smartphones have been activated in that time.At issue in the Federal District Court for Northern California is how freely someone might use Java, a popular software language that Oracle acquired when it bought Sun Microsystems for $7.4 billion in 2009. Much of Java is open source, meaning anyone may use it, but some aspects require obtaining a license.Some 11,000 lines of Java code inside Android were taken without paying a copyright fee, Oracle argues.\u201cThis involves fundamental principles of fairness and business conduct,\u201d Peter Bicks, a lawyer with Orrick, Herrington, & Sutcliffe, said in his opening statement for Oracle. \u201cThey knew they needed a license.\u201dGoogle counters that the software, just 0.08 percent of all the software in Android but critical for its operation, was legitimately obtained and used in ways that free it from paying fees.\u201cOur view was that Android was a completely different approach\u201d to building a smartphone, Mr. Schmidt said.Google originally tried to work with Sun on Android, he said, but those talks broke down because Google would not be able to control the final product. Mr. Schmidt, who formerly was in charge of Java at Sun, said his expertise informed how Google could use Java.The trial, including a possible penalty phase, is expected to end by June 10. The payoff could be Oracle\u2019s biggest victory from buying Sun. Some parts of Sun, like its computer hardware, have lost Oracle money.Mr. Bicks noted that a version of Android is used in Amazon\u2019s Kindle reader, raising the prospect that Oracle will pursue payments from more companies that use Android. Deborah Hellinger, a spokeswoman for Oracle, declined to comment on what Oracle might do.Even if it wins, Oracle is unlikely to see any money for a long time. The expected appeals from whichever side loses would also slow any changes in corporate policies on open source, copyrights and licensing.Oracle first sued Google in 2010. That case, over patents and copyrights, featured contentious testimony by Lawrence J. Ellison, Oracle\u2019s founder and then chief executive, and Larry Page, the founder and chief executive of Google.It was decided largely in favor of Google in 2012, but then in 2014 an appeals court found that certain parts of Java were protected by copyright. Last year the Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of that decision, which sent the case back for this new trial.While the clock in Judge William Alsup\u2019s court is stuck at 6:08, the latest phase of the long trial process showed signs of how much the world has changed since the first trial began. This one is expected to end by June 10.Mr. Ellison, now Oracle\u2019s executive chairman, may appear in this trial on video. Safra Catz, Oracle\u2019s co-chief executive, is expected to appear. Mr. Page may also testify, along with Andy Rubin, who developed Android for Google and now works in robotics and artificial intelligence.The parts of Java that Oracle wants to be paid for are the Application Programmer Interfaces, or A.P.I.s, which are the instruction sets that enable one computer to share the data and behavior of another. They have become critically important as computing moves to smartphones, apps and the cloud, because these uses frequently involve using elements from several computers.Google argued that A.P.I.s are tools used by programmers, and that its use of them constitutes \u201cfair use,\u201d a legal standard that permits use of copyrighted material. It also said its use of Java transformed it from something used in computers to something used in smartphones, which could also justify fair use.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nyquist, Staying Undefeated, Wins the Kentucky Derby", "Date": "2016-05-07", "News": "Supported byLOUISVILLE, Ky. \u2014 They were not worried, and they said so all week. Everyone had stopped by the barn of the trainer Doug O\u2019Neill and told him that his colt Nyquist did not have the stamina to last a mile and a quarter \u2014 that he had cranked up his baby too much in capturing a $1 million bonus last month in the Florida Derby.There could not be anything left in the tank after that, right? There was no way that a favorite was going to win the Kentucky Derby for the fourth consecutive year, was there?O\u2019Neill \u2014 along with his brother and consigliere, Dennis, and Nyquist\u2019s rider, Mario Gutierrez, and especially the colt\u2019s owner, J. Paul Reddam \u2014 just smiled and went about his business. The barn was humming along \u2014 think the Google campus, but substitute matted bed head for skinny jeans and piles of dung for beanbag chairs.What, me worry? That was the response from an outfit that had been here and done it before, four years ago with a long shot named I\u2019ll Have Another. That late-running colt sneaked into Churchill Downs and hid in the shadow of the track\u2019s iconic twin spires without anyone much noticing.For the 142nd running of the Kentucky Derby on Saturday, there was no hiding. Nyquist was the 2-year-old champion, after all, and the colt was undefeated in seven starts and had beaten at one time or another nearly a quarter of the field assembled here.11 PhotosNyquist had a better r\u00e9sum\u00e9 than last year\u2019s Triple Crown champion, American Pharoah, and had enough black type, as stakes wins and places are called, to rival that of the 1977 Triple Crown champion, Seattle Slew. He was the Big Horse by anyone\u2019s definition.Nyquist showed why as soon as he slipped out of the gate, a thief in the night, prowling with purpose around the first turn as if he were tethered to the front-runner, Danzing Candy, and were atop the two fattest skis while riding in the wake of a big old boat.There are not many Kentucky Derbys that can be proclaimed over moments after they have started, but losing betting tickets were being crumpled in knotted fists as soon as Nyquist floated out of the first turn and then skipped down the backstretch as if he had just gotten out of school.It did not matter that he was chasing a swift front-runner throwing down fast fractions. Gutierrez had Nyquist breezing along unbothered. Horse and rider totally ignored Florent Geroux, who had a colt named Gun Runner ahead and inside them and looked every bit like a horse sniffing the wire first.Instead, Gutierrez let Nyquist have his head as they came around the far turn and asked for another gear into the stretch. A familiar rival by the name of Exaggerator launched a late run from far back, but his rider, Kent Desormeaux, knew that it was a futile chase.\u201cMy horse slammed on the brakes and ducked back to the inside and then took off,\u201d Desormeaux said after Exaggerator finished second, a length and a quarter behind Nyquist.Gutierrez did not see Exaggerator or anyone else that he was worried about when he peeked beneath his arm. The rider knows his colt.\u201cHe will not allow any other horse past him,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s the kind of horse that always has something left for whatever comes to him late.\u201dBettors were hardly surprised by the outcome: Nyquist was a solid favorite paying $6.60 for a $2 bet. It was a lucrative day for Reddam as well. His colt\u2019s win was worth $1.24 million and lifted Nyquist\u2019s career earnings to more than $3 million.Now that the Kentucky Derby was over, a bigger race was on. Can it be? Is it possible that a year after American Pharoah took down thoroughbred racing\u2019s holy grail and became just the 12th Triple Crown winner in history \u2014 the first in 37 years \u2014 that racing could have another?Again, Reddam and O\u2019Neill took the hypothetical head-on and acted as if it were not only a possibility but their plan.\u201cHe\u2019s such a special horse,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. \u201cWe see it in his eyes on a daily basis. He\u2019s the type of athlete that puts his time in the gym every day and goes to bed early. When we go to the track each day, he just swishes his tail and asks, \u2018What do you want from me now?\u2019 \u201dO\u2019Neill also knows that he will need a whole lot of luck and a little bit of magic to navigate those historic shoals.The affable O\u2019Neill took a beating throughout I\u2019ll Have Another\u2019s run toward a Triple Crown when it came to light that over 14 years and in four states he had received more than a dozen violations for giving his horses improper drugs and that his horses had a tendency to break down or show signs of injury at a rate more than twice the national average.When asked if history could repeat itself, O\u2019Neill asked his mother, who was here with him, to light a candle at church on his and his horse\u2019s behalf.\u201cWe need some higher power to keep this guy injury free,\u201d he said.While Reddam enjoyed his second Derby victory, he could not resist barking back at doubters.\u201cI feel really good for the horse,\u201d Reddam said, \u201cbecause along the way the last year, he has taken a lot of shots for whatever reason. And I think he proved all his critics wrong today.\u201dReddam could not help offering a pun and keeping hope for another piece of history. In 2012, I\u2019ll Have Another won two-thirds of the Triple Crown before withdrawing from the Belmont Stakes on the eve of the race with a tendon injury.\u201cWe\u2019ll have another,\u201d he said when accepting the Derby trophy.We will see if another Triple Crown is in the cards.slide showAdvertisement"}

Some pranksters have recently found themselves facing criminal prosecution and jail. But the legal trouble has not deterred them, and their videos continue to attract fans and imitators.For members of a popular YouTube prank account called Trollstation, wearing pantyhose on their faces and running through London\u2019s National Portrait Gallery screaming \u201cGet the paintings!\u201d probably seemed like a good idea at the time.Amina Maz, a production manager for Trollstation, said in an email on Wednesday that the sentencing was too harsh.\u201cA suspended sentence or community service would have acted as a deterrent,\u201d she wrote.The brothers, who range in age from 16 to 20, were released on bail under the agreement that they not post more videos.

{"Headline": "Start-Ups Embrace Arbitration to Settle Workplace Disputes", "Date": "2016-05-14", "News": "Supported by\u201cIt was like walking onto a set of a movie,\u201d Ms. Zoumer said.But shortly after she became an associate community manager in WeWork\u2019s office in Berkeley, Calif., reality set in. Ms. Zoumer said she was feeling pinched because her annual salary was only $42,000, a sum that, on some weeks, left her without money to ride the subway.She said she thought many of her duties \u2014 leading tours for prospective tenants, tidying up, answering phones and changing the kegs \u2014 were more suited to an hourly wage with a possibility for overtime.Ms. Zoumer tried to enlist colleagues to file what she hoped would be a class-action lawsuit to fight for overtime pay. But the company had instituted a policy that could force employees to ultimately resolve disputes through arbitration instead of the courts, which essentially shut down Ms. Zoumer\u2019s lawsuit, since arbitration bars individuals from joining in a class action.When Ms. Zoumer refused to sign the new policy, she was fired.Uber and Lyft, the ride-hailing services, make their drivers sign an arbitration clause. Square, the mobile payment processor, also requires that employees agree to bring disputes to arbitration. In advice to start-ups, Brotman Law, a tax firm in San Diego, promotes the benefits of arbitration for \u201ccompanies doing business over the Internet,\u201d emphasizing that it \u201ccan save significant costs.\u201dAmazon and Google also use arbitration to resolve disputes with customers.Far from burying its arbitration clause in its employment contracts, WeWork is proud of its policy. The company\u2019s top executives said they thought that by adopting an arbitration clause as part of a broader dispute resolution program, they were staying true to their principles, which prize all levels of employees as members of a single community. WeWork says its employees are eligible for bonuses and equity in the company in addition to their salaries.\u201cWe want to show the world that this works,\u201d Jennifer Berrent, WeWork\u2019s general counsel and chief culture officer, a recently created position, said of the dispute resolution program.For start-ups \u2014 many of which began in Silicon Valley \u2014 the clauses can seem to conflict with professed goals of upending business as usual and being open with employees. Arbitration, by its very nature, is a secretive process that is often lopsided in favor of the employer. That secrecy, federal labor officials said, can allow widespread problems to persist because the process bars employees from sharing their experiences with others who might be in similar positions.\u201cThey give their young workers Ping-Pong tables and take away their constitutional rights,\u201d said Cliff Palefsky, an employment and civil rights lawyer in San Francisco.As Silicon Valley companies grow from small start-ups into major employers, their labor practices are coming into focus. Despite the popular image that the industry is predominantly made up of nerdy millionaires, many of these growing companies depend increasingly on lower-paid employees.And with some technology companies now working harder to raise money, there are growing pressures on these companies from investors to cut costs \u2014 pressures that can fall disproportionately on the workers at the lower rungs.At WeWork, Ms. Berrent said, arbitration is part of a multistep process to resolve disputes. The company adopted the policy after months of discussion about how to deal most fairly with complaints.At the outset of the process, WeWork requires employees to raise any complaints with their managers. If that does not work, the employee and WeWork must try mediation. Only if that fails does the issue go before an arbitrator, whose decision is binding.Ms. Berrent said this process was in keeping with the company\u2019s values, settling problems \u201cthrough open collaboration\u201d rather than the courts. She confirmed that Ms. Zoumer was fired for not signing the arbitration clause.She said the employees who hold the job that Ms. Zoumer used to have were the \u201csoul\u201d of the company and its \u201cbrand ambassadors.\u201d She said they performed tasks that were far from menial and were not suited to an hourly wage.Ms. Berrent also notes that while lawsuits are both costly for the employee and confrontational, the company pays for arbitration no matter who wins.At large corporations, many employees have come to expect the clauses as standard. But those working at smaller firms that claimed to treat their employees like family tend to be surprised when they collide with one.Mr. Ziober had already been at the company for several months when he was asked to sign the arbitration policy in January 2011. He did so without a second thought.It was a decision he would regret. In the fall of 2012, he informed BLB Resources that he was being deployed to Afghanistan. On his last day, the company threw him a farewell party, complete with a cake shaped like an American flag.\u201cI was on Cloud 9,\u201d Mr. Ziober said, recalling how he phoned his family to tell them about the party.That afternoon, as Mr. Ziober said he was packing up his cubicle, he was called into the human resources office and was \u201csummarily\u201d fired, according to his legal appeal.The reason for his termination, the company said, was that he was not being included in a federal contract that the company was applying for.In a statement, BLB said the decision not to include Mr. Ziober in the contract occurred months before he informed the company that he was being deployed. The statement added that BLB had offered to allow Mr. Ziober to work on the remainder of his existing contract if he returned in time from his deployment.Mr. Ziober\u2019s lawyer, Peter Romer-Friedman, has appealed the case, arguing that Userra preserves the rights of service members to go to court.BLB said in a statement that \u201cthe company is extremely disappointed about Mr. Ziober\u2019s allegations and denies them wholeheartedly.\u201dWith their appeal, Mr. Ziober has waded into an intense battle playing out across the country. In Washington, a group of bipartisan lawmakers introduced a bill in 2014 that would exempt service members from having to take claims of wrongful auto repossession or improper debt collection to arbitration. An almost identical bill was quashed after intense lobbying by big banks and credit card companies, never making it out of committee. A bill in California that would have prevented companies from requiring employees to sign arbitration clauses suffered a similar fate when Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed it last year.The legislative skirmishes point to just how valuable arbitration has become to companies and just how far they will go to defend it.Despite WeWork\u2019s arbitration requirement, Ms. Zoumer decided to sue the company on her own, hoping she would prevail in overturning the clause. Ms. Zoumer\u2019s lawyer, Ramsey Hanafi, filed her case in December over wrongful termination and unfair labor practices, and Boies, Schiller & Flexner, a top corporate defense firm, is representing WeWork.Ms. Zoumer, 31, said she knew she was taking a risk when she challenged WeWork over arbitration. She told the company she needed at least a week to review the policy before deciding whether to sign it. In an email to colleagues, she encouraged them to do the same, citing The Times\u2019s investigation into arbitration.Ms. Berrent said Ms. Zoumer was the only employee who refused to sign other than two employees who had planned to leave the company anyway. Ultimately, no other employees joined Ms. Zoumer\u2019s lawsuit.\u201cYounger people don\u2019t want to pick fights, but we are losing our rights,\u201d Ms. Zoumer said.Advertisement"}

Let\u2019s do a superquick rundown of the week in tech.But this week we wanted to try something new, right? Instead of a deep dive into one tech topic, we\u2019re going to do a short list, mostly because millennials love lists.I never really saw them around on the street until I moved to San Francisco. Now I mostly see them on cyclist dudes, at least two of whom were smoking pot and blazing through stop signs, I kid you not. I\u2019m walking down the sidewalk and all of a sudden I\u2019m getting low-quality audio blared at me. It\u2019s like being accosted by a drive-by Sublime album.Anyway, you know what I hate? The iPhone charging cable. It\u2019s called Lightning, though a better name would be Fraying. I\u2019m lucky if I get six months out of these cables before they start acting up \u2014 usually the connector begins separating from the cable or you get a kink in the line that begins to crack, and soon your phone stops charging. I hate it. Will someone please make a superstrong charging cable, please?Here\u2019s something else that I wanted to like, but actually hate: streaming, stationary digital cameras like those offered by Nest for the home.I really liked the whole safety and security pitch at first. When I lived in New York, the editors unfortunately wanted me to leave my house and go into the office to work \u2014 something I\u2019m pretty sure you have never done in the San Francisco bureau. So setting up a Nest cam to watch my dog while I\u2019m gone seemed like a nice idea.Instead, I felt like a creepy voyeur. My dog sat and slept by the door, and watching her made me feel sad. Then when my dog walker \u2014 whom I trust and like \u2014 came in, I saw him pet my dog and be supersweet with her and do what I always assumed he did normally, which was walk my dog. But not telling him that I was watching him felt like a strange breach of trust, as if I suspected him of something that wasn\u2019t ever really warranted.It made me realize how prevalent these cameras are now, and how violated I would feel were I being recorded in, say, my friends\u2019 homes. My \u201chatred,\u201d I guess, is that it\u2019s so mainstream and there\u2019s little I can do to stop it.But at my house, at least, I let my dog have her privacy when I\u2019m gone. It\u2019s better that way.Let\u2019s see, what else do I hate? I hate most hashtags. I can see their value as part of a political campaign or meme \u2014 like, #oscarsowhite or #blacklivesmatter \u2014 but I hate when people add useless hashtags to their most banal posts. On Instagram, people will post photos of their trendy brunch and then clog it up with a barrage of idiotic hashtags: #brunch #sundayfun #sleepinglate #ihavenolife #pleasehelp. That kind of thing.Look, you\u2019re not a marketing campaign. Your brunch is not searchworthy. Don\u2019t hashtag your life.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Just Don\u2019t Call Me Mom (Updated With Podcast)", "Date": "2016-05-06", "News": "Supported byModern LoveTo celebrate our daughter coming into our lives, my husband and I decided to host a party during which Sadie would be blessed by a Catholic priest and be given a Hebrew name by a rabbi. We had the priest from my side of the family. Now we needed a rabbi.Russell was barely even culturally Jewish and had just started his own consulting business, meaning he had no extra time for anything. So finding a rabbi fell to me.Many I contacted refused to officiate with a Catholic priest. Others asked about the mother: \u201cIs she Jewish?\u201d They wanted to make it clear that Sadie would not be considered Jewish unless the mother was, even if we gave her a Hebrew name.Sadie has two fathers. Most people get it when I say, \u201cShe has two daddies.\u201d Others persist, asking, \u201cNo, but who is her mom?\u201dWith the rabbis, I finally just said, \u201cI\u2019m her mom.\u201dThis response has silenced women in elevators, nannies on playgrounds and bureaucratic clerks in charge of postponing jury duty.I didn\u2019t realize that saying those three words would, in some people\u2019s eyes, transform me from a married man into June Cleaver. I just thought: If hanging out with a beautiful baby while someone else earns the money is momlike, then sign me up.Unfortunately, I failed to read the small print explaining that my handsome husband may start seeing me as June Cleaver, too.As a former Catholic, I come from a long line of passive-aggressive mothers. My own Catholic mother, who lives one floor below us, reminds me of it daily.\u201cIf you really want to get me something nice for my birthday,\u201d she\u2019ll say, \u201cI could use a few tubs of Benecol.\u201d When she saw me in a Broadway show where I appeared briefly in spandex, she said, \u201cIt might be fun for us to go on a diet together.\u201dMother\u2019s Day is the worst. She invariably turns down my siblings\u2019 invitation for brunch in the suburbs, preferring to complain to neighbors in our building\u2019s elevator that none of her children invited her anywhere.Russell was on a consulting trip for my first Mother\u2019s Day as a \u201cmom,\u201d where he was enduring the hardships of luxury hotels in Istanbul and London and emphasizing how grueling it was to eat with clients at world-class restaurants (as I dined on Sadie\u2019s leftover pur\u00e9ed spinach and pears). A 9-month-old is expensive, and since I wasn\u2019t earning any money, I was determined to spend as little as possible. I planned on showering my mother with the extravagance of a card I would make myself.Early that fateful Sunday morning, after a whopping three hours of sleep, I was making my mother\u2019s card when our doorman buzzed.Loud noises made Sadie cry, so our buzzer \u2014 similar to the sound of someone being electrocuted \u2014 caused her to scream and me to use language that wasn\u2019t child-friendly. Over the screaming, I heard that I had a package downstairs. I assumed it was our shipment of formula from Diapers.com.\u201cThanks, Junior,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll be down in a bit.\u201d I feared my outfit of boxer shorts and spit-up-encrusted T-shirt was too casual for a full-service lobby.I\u2019d returned to my card making when my phone rang: my mother.\u201cHappy Mother\u2019s Day,\u201d I said.\u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have a package downstairs.\u201d\u201cI know. I\u2019ll get it later.\u201dShe had clearly been making the rounds in the building, moaning about her ungrateful children, so the pressure was on to make her card so special that it would equal a fancy brunch and bouquet of flowers.As Sadie and I trekked down to 11B to deliver it, our neighbor said, \u201cYou have a package downstairs.\u201d\u201cThanks,\u201d I said, nostalgic for brownstone living and anonymous deliveries.My mother opened the door and I handed her the card, which she pretended to appreciate. \u201cOh, David, this is lovely,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go down and get your package?\u201dAs I headed to the elevator, leaving Sadie with my mother, yet another neighbor said, \u201cYou have a package downstairs.\u201d I started to wonder where the line is between a \u201cfull service\u201d building and a \u201cfull annoyance\u201d one.When exiting our elevator into the lobby, you make a hairpin turn past the shiny brass mailboxes before seeing the doorman at his perch. If I were directing a movie, this sequence would involve a slow pan of me turning the corner, with a jump cut to a close-up of my face as I saw what awaited me.It was not a package. It was not a shipment from Diapers.com. On the doorman\u2019s stand was a flower arrangement topped by a clump of Mylar balloons. Stapled to the cellophane, a big card yelled, \u201cHappy Mother\u2019s Day David!!!\u201dTime stood still. I felt as if I were in a vacuum with no sound, movement or feelings.Somehow I managed to grab the thing and rush it into the elevator. I think I heard Junior call out, \u201cHappy Mother\u2019s Day, David\u201d in a nonmocking way, but, as in a Bugs Bunny cartoon, there was a factory whistle blaring and steam coming out of my ears, so I couldn\u2019t really hear him.In the elevator, I assessed what I was holding. This was no gaudy embarrassment of pink carnations and baby\u2019s breath. If it\u2019s possible for a m\u00e9lange of balloons and flowers to be tasteful, this was it. And if my almost three decades with Russell has taught me anything, it\u2019s that the difference between tacky and tasteful is usually the difference between a little money and a lot.Even so, the more my eyes focused on this expensive riot of mini green hydrangea and garden roses, the more I wanted, instead, a bottle of single-malt Scotch, a therapeutic massage and someone to look after Sadie for five hours. As the elevator ascended, the full weight of the package became almost unbearable.I felt, more than ever before, the crushing burden of motherhood. We moms may feel closer to the source of all power that exists in the universe, but we are forced to endure the condescension of a society that acknowledges our role with pink balloons.I envisioned my allegedly hard-working hubby lounging in his London hotel room, suddenly remembering that it was almost Mother\u2019s Day and making a panicked trans-Atlantic call to the pricey florist he has on speed dial. While trying to figure out which arrangement would most impress his mother, he probably thought: \u201cWait! I have two mothers to think about now. Make it a double.\u201dThe possibility that Russell had merged me in his mind with his own mother hit me so hard that I almost dropped the heavy bouquet on the floor.I briefly thought about getting off on 11 and presenting it to my mother. I also considered going directly into the trash room and stomping on it until it was unrecognizable, until I realized that the shattering of glass and explosion of balloons would only call more attention to my wretchedness.That\u2019s when I decided to do what so many moms do every day: suffer in silence. I stowed the humiliating package in my apartment and went back to my mother\u2019s to get Sadie. As I entered, I could tell that even my mother sensed it would be a bad idea to mention Russell\u2019s gift. She again thanked me for my card and asked if we were going out for brunch.\u201cMom, Mother\u2019s Day brunch in New York City is like a combination of jury duty, the D.M.V. and the No. 6 train platform at rush hour.\u201d\u201cSo, no?\u201d\u201cNo, Mom. Another time.\u201dOne of the best things about being a new parent is having the license to sleep when your baby does. So even though I\u2019d been up for only an hour, I stretched out with Sadie, and her sleeping breath against my chest gave me a moment to strategize. Why was I so upset? Didn\u2019t I have a great life? Wasn\u2019t I the first to call myself Mom? Why should I be so offended if others follow suit?My father once gave me two pieces of advice: marry a nice Catholic girl, and always be sure to look, and overlook.\u201cLook, and overlook\u201d is one of those pithy phrases that makes sense one moment and baffles the next. As I stared at the balloons, however, those words gave me much-needed clarity. I needed to overlook how much I felt like a stay-at-home loser and look a little more closely at the actual message on the card attached to the floral elephant in the room.So I ripped open the envelope. It read:\u201cDear Daddy David,Just as we\u2019ve decided that our daughter should celebrate both Hanukkah and Christmas, there\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t co-opt every holiday celebrating parenthood. Thanks for being the best parent in the world and making Sadie and me feel so lucky. Love you tons, Daddy Russell.P.S. Because I know you\u2019re wondering, I sent a different (and much smaller) arrangement to my mom.\u201dBest Mother\u2019s Day ever.David Beach, who lives in Manhattan, is a Broadway actor.To contact Modern Love, email modernlove@nytimes.com.Advertisement"}

Also, the bedroom, dining room and \u2014 it\u2019s a safe bet \u2014 the bathroom as well.Google, which knows more things about more people than any other company, organization or government in history, announced on Wednesday a new household device that will use that information to help people run their lives.\u201cWe want users to have an ongoing two-way dialogue with Google,\u201d Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, told about 7,000 attendees in an outdoor music amphitheater here in the Internet company\u2019s hometown. \u201cWe have started becoming truly conversational.\u201dGoogle Home got top billing during the two-hour keynote by Mr. Pichai and other executives at the company\u2019s annual developer conference, but many details \u2014 how much it will cost, when it will be available \u2014 were not disclosed. The device existed on the stage, but its features still seemed to be works in progress.Why introduce it now and make such a big thing of it? The reason seemed to lie in Mr. Pichai\u2019s unusual shout-out to a competitor. \u201cCredit to the team at Amazon for creating a lot of excitement in this space,\u201d he said.Those are millions of consumers who are lost, at least to some extent, to Google. The search company had to begin competing with Amazon before that number swelled to tens of millions. Mr. Pichai pointedly noted that Google was \u201cat a pivotal moment.\u201dThis was Google\u2019s 10th annual developers conference, but the first held in the amphitheater adjacent to its headquarters. The event is designed to be mostly instructive and inspirational for the freelance software engineers who use Google\u2019s tools to build things. But it is also promotional, an opportunity taken to broadcast around the world \u2014 there were a million people listening in China, Mr. Pichai said \u2014 what tomorrow will hold.Mario Queiroz, the Google executive in charge of Home, said it would \u201cbe a beautiful addition to any room in your house.\u201d In a short film, a family was shown waking up with Home. The father used it to play music in one child\u2019s room and to turn on the lights in another to get them out of bed. The girl, finishing her homework, asked Home what the Spanish word was for \u201capple.\u201d The parents rearranged their schedules.\u201cIt will let anyone in the family, kids or adults, have a conversation with Google,\u201d Mr. Queiroz said. Indeed, in the film, everyone is so busy communicating with Home they hardly talk to each other.Google already does search solely through voice, but its efforts have been confusingly branded. On Wednesday, Google promoted Google assistant \u2014 the company\u2019s name for the ability to have a two-way conversation to get information. It will be available this summer in a messaging app called Allo and later in Google Home.There have been efforts before to develop control centers for the home, but none have made serious inroads. Even the Echo was not an immediate hit with reviewers, some of whom wondered whether it might be little more than a gimmick.\u201cBefore I got an Echo I thought it was a joke and a bad idea,\u201d said Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray. \u201cBut I saw the utility and ended up buying five of them for my family.\u201dFor Google Home to stand out, he said, it would have to outdo the Echo, particularly in search. \u201cYou have to be able to ask it a complex question, and then it would go to the Internet and read it back to you,\u201d Mr. Munster said. \u201cEcho doesn\u2019t do a good job of that today.\u201dThe big tech companies are the new middlemen of commerce and communication. People used to go to stores to buy brands on impulse or by design.

{"Headline": "Dogs Test Drug Aimed at Humans\u2019 Biggest Killer: Age", "Date": "2016-05-16", "News": "Supported byChasing ImmortalitySEATTLE \u2014 Ever since last summer, when Lynn Gemmell\u2019s dog, Bela, was inducted into the trial of a drug that has been shown to significantly lengthen the lives of laboratory mice, she has been the object of intense scrutiny among dog park regulars.To those who insist that Bela, 8, has turned back into a puppy \u2014 \u201cLook how fast she\u2019s getting that ball!\u201d \u2014 Ms. Gemmell has tried to turn a deaf ear. Bela, a Border collie-Australian shepherd mix, may have been given a placebo, for one thing.Technically that is true. But the trial also represents a new frontier in testing a proposition for improving human health: Rather than only seeking treatments for the individual maladies that come with age, we might do better to target the biology that underlies aging itself.But scientists who champion the study of aging\u2019s basic biology \u2014 they call it \u201cgeroscience\u201d \u2014 say their field has received short shrift from the biomedical establishment. And it was not lost on the University of Washington researchers that exposing dog lovers to the idea that aging could be delayed might generate popular support in addition to new data.\u201cMany of us in the biology of aging field feel like it is underfunded relative to the potential impact on human health this could have,\u201d said Dr. Kaeberlein, who helped pay for the study with funds he received from the university for turning down a competing job offer. \u201cIf the average pet owner sees there\u2019s a way to significantly delay aging in their pet, maybe it will begin to impact policy decisions.\u201d\u201cI would resist the idea that we should shift funds away from cancer and diabetes and Alzheimer\u2019s, where there are clear drug targets, and say, \u2018We\u2019re going to work on this hypothesis,\u2019 \u201d Dr. Collins said. \u201cIf you had a lot of money for geroscience right now, it\u2019s not clear what you would do with it that would be scientifically credible.\u201dResearchers in the field, in turn, say they might have more to show for themselves if they could better explain to Congress and the public why basic research on aging could be useful.\u201cPeople understand \u2018my relative died of a heart attack, so I\u2019m going to give money to that,\u2019 \u201d said Dr. James L. Kirkland, a Mayo Clinic researcher. \u201cIt\u2019s harder to grasp \u2018my relative was older, that predisposes them to have a heart attack, so I should give money to research on aging.\u2019 \u201d\u201cWhen I go out and try to raise money for this, the first thing people will say to me is, \u2018Eh, we\u2019re all getting older,\u2019 \u201d said Steven Austad, a researcher at the University of Alabama.That aspiration gained traction in the 1990s and 2000s, when scientists, armed with new tools of molecular biology, homed in on the complex cellular pathways that regulate life span in many species. By removing genes that produced certain proteins, or adding genes that produced others, researchers found they could significantly extend the lives of simple laboratory organisms like budding yeast, roundworms and flies.\u201cIt\u2019s not just wearing out, it\u2019s a program,\u201d Dr. Ruvkun said. \u201cThe genetics told us that. If you can modulate it with a few simple perturbations, that\u2019s the definition of a program.\u201d\u201cIf you go to a dinner party and you tell people you\u2019re working on longevity, they say, \u2018Oh that\u2019s terrible,\u2019 \u201d Dr. Murphy said. \u201cI think if they just understood it\u2019s a way to slow the whole process, instead of fighting it one disease at a time, they\u2019d understand why we\u2019re interested in this.\u201dDogs age faster than humans, and bigger dogs age faster than smaller dogs. The 40 dogs that participated in the rapamycin trial, which just concluded its pilot run in Seattle, had to be at least 6 years old and weigh at least 40 pounds.Like Lynn Gemmell\u2019s Bela, whose cholesterol was high, many of them were showing signs of aging: loose skin, graying muzzles, a stiffness in the joints. So were some of their owners.\u201cHow are you going to be sure people are going to be giving this to their dog rather than taking it themselves?\u201d Ms. Gemmell, 58, joked with Dr. Kaeberlein on her first visit to the veterinary clinic, where Bela was given a checkup and an echocardiogram to measure heart function, a marker that could conceivably register an improvement over the 10 weeks that she would be given the drug.A research coordinator for human clinical trials at a hospital, Ms. Gemmell adopted Bela as a 12-week-old rescue without realizing how much outdoor time she would need with her. Now divorced with two grown daughters, Ms. Gemmell dons a headlamp when she returns home in the dark, and takes Bela out with a glow-in-the-dark ball and a collar light. \u201cI wish she could live forever,\u201d she said.Over 1,500 dog owners applied to participate in the trial of rapamycin, which has its roots in a series of studies in mice, the first of which was published in 2009. Made by a type of soil bacterium, rapamycin has extended the life spans of yeast, flies and worms by about 25 percent.\u201cIf you do the extrapolation for people, we\u2019re probably talking a couple of decades, with the expectation that those years are going to be spent in relatively good health,\u201d Dr. Kaeberlein said.Still, drugs that work in mice often fail in humans. It is also hard to ask rodents about their quality of life. The side effects, depending on the dose and duration, include mouth sores, cataracts, insulin resistance and, for males, problems with testicular function. No one knows if people, who already live a lot longer than mice, would see a proportional increase in life span. And some researchers say there would be serious concerns in testing rapamycin, or any drug, in healthy people just to slow aging. What if a drug lengthened life for some and shortened it for others? Could anyone ethically put a healthy person into a test that might actually shorten life span?Last month, he reported at a scientific meeting that no significant side effects had been observed in the dogs, even at the highest of three doses. And compared with the hearts of dogs in the control group, the hearts of those taking the drug pumped blood more efficiently at the end. The researchers would like to enroll 450 dogs for a more comprehensive five-year study, but do not yet have the money.Even if the study provided positive results on all fronts, a human trial would carry risks.Dr. Kaeberlein, for one, said they would be worth it.\u201cI would argue we should be willing to tolerate some level of risk if the payoff is 20 to 30 percent increase in healthy longevity,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do anything, we know what the outcome is going to be. You\u2019re going to get sick, and you\u2019re going to die.\u201dFor her part, Ms. Gemmell is not counting on anything. The other night, when she got home from work, she was ready to read her mail and have a glass of wine. But Bela greeted her as usual, ball in her mouth, ready to play.For now, she said, this is how they both plan to stay young.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Gawker Founder Suspects a Common Financer Behind Lawsuits", "Date": "2016-05-23", "News": "Supported byDealBookAt first, Nick Denton, the founder of Gawker Media, thought it an unlikely conspiracy theory.Now, he\u2019s starting to believe it himself.Mr. Denton has begun to question whether Mr. Harder has a benefactor, perhaps one of the many subjects of Gawker\u2019s skewering coverage.\u201cMy own personal hunch is that it\u2019s linked to Silicon Valley, but that\u2019s nothing really more than a hunch,\u201d Mr. Denton told me. \u201cIf you\u2019re a billionaire and you don\u2019t like the coverage of you, and you don\u2019t particularly want to embroil yourself any further in a public scandal, it\u2019s a pretty smart, rational thing to fund other legal cases.\u201dMr. Denton\u2019s view is based on the huge expenses of legal cases and settlements, the fact that Mr. Hogan\u2019s financial health has been erratic \u2014 and on the rich history of lawsuits in which lawyers make money only if they win the case. There is an entire industry that exists to provide lines of credit to lawyers working on contingency. There is also a small netherworld of investors who back certain lawsuits.\u201cThe answer may be entirely innocent,\u201d Mr. Denton said, musing on the question of whether Mr. Harder was paid by someone other than Mr. Hogan, \u201cbut I think in order for people to understand what\u2019s going on here, what the stakes are, I think it\u2019s important that it be out in public, or at least that he\u2019d be asked the question in public.\u201dBased on my conversation with Mr. Denton as well some independent lawyers who first raised questions about the financing of Mr. Hogan\u2019s suit, I approached Mr. Harder and asked him the question directly. In an email, he said, \u201cI do not discuss the finances of my clients, including any financial arrangements they have with my firm. This applies to all clients.\u201dStepping aside from this case, it\u2019s clear that some lawsuits have been funded for reasons beyond strict economics. Kenneth G. Langone, the co-founder of Home Depot and former director of the New York Stock Exchange, helped fund Maurice R. Greenberg\u2019s lawsuit against the United States government over the bankruptcy of the American International Group, which was viewed as being as much as about money as about principle.And Max Mosley, the former head of Formula One who successfully brought a series of suits against News of the World for publishing pictures of him involved in an orgy, later funded a number of lawsuits against the same tabloid by people who said its journalists had hacked their phones.As for the lawsuits against Gawker Media, \u201cthe evidence has built up over time that there are questions that are unanswered here,\u201d Mr. Denton said. \u201cThe data point that really got us thinking was the move that they made on insurance, which seemed designed to prevent insurance paying for our defense.\u201dMr. Denton is referring to a decision by Mr. Hogan\u2019s legal team to abruptly drop one of the claims \u2014 for \u201cnegligent infliction of emotional distress\u201d \u2014 from its case. That claim had a particularly special meaning: It was the one claim that required Gawker\u2019s insurance company to pay for its defense as well as potential payouts in the case of a settlement. (That provision of Gawker\u2019s insurance policy became public after the insurance company, Nautilus, sued Gawker to try to limit payment for defense.)Several legal experts said that it was particularly unusual for a plaintiff using a lawyer being paid on a contingency basis not only to turn down settlement offers (several sizable settlements were proffered by Gawker) but also to pursue a strategy that prevented an insurance company from being able to contribute to a settlement.\u201cIt\u2019s a very unusual thing to do, because the insurance company would have deeper pockets than Gawker,\u201d said Larry Geneen, a risk management consultant who has long dealt with lawsuits involving insurance companies. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a situation where the plaintiff intentionally took out the claim involving the insurance company.\u201dAnd given that Mr. Hogan has had financial ups and downs, the cost of the hundreds of motions his lawyers made is significant, and the chances the award is significantly reduced based on previous cases he lost making the same claims in federal court, it\u2019s hard to completely understand the motivations at play.Additionally, Mr. Harder has brought two new cases against Gawker that seem puzzling. One is a defamation case on behalf of Shiva Ayyadurai, who claimed to have invented email. Gawker had written an article challenging his argument, similar to an article from The Washington Post and others on the same topic.\u201cIn L.A. and New York power centers, people are pretty used to an independent and critical press,\u201d Mr. Denton said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we write that much about Hollywood\u2019s celebrities that isn\u2019t written in TMZ or in other celebrity news sites.\u201dBut some subcultures aren\u2019t used to the glare, Mr. Denton added. \u201cSilicon Valley coverage with coverage on Valleywag, and the coverage on Gawker and Gizmodo \u2014 I think that has been a change for them.\u201dGawker has made a virtual industry of skewering the industry. The company got into a public battle with Steve Jobs over the publication of pictures of a prototype iPhone that was found at a bar. It has also poked at the private lives of virtually every member of Silicon Valley\u2019s royalty and outed many. (I\u2019ll spare them being name-checked here because it will invariably send readers scurrying to Google to search the names.)Admittedly, it is a bit hard to defend Gawker Media. I often disagree with Gawker\u2019s news judgment, and it has routinely published items over the years that crossed the line of good taste. I\u2019ve been on the other side of Gawker\u2019s critical pen, and it is not fun. Even so, I believe in a free press, and that means freedom of speech for Gawker\u2019s brand of journalism.Mr. Denton does too, but he also would like to see more transparency on the financial side. As for the Hulk Hogan lawsuit, \u201cit\u2019s a big case that involves the balance of power between public figures and the press,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s in the public\u2019s interest and the media interest for the motives of people on both sides to be out there.\u201dIt would be great to know the answer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Want to Buy a Self-Driving Car? Big-Rig Trucks May Come First", "Date": "2016-05-17", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Imagine you are driving on a highway late at night when a big-rig truck closes in behind you. You relax because it is keeping a safe distance and seems to be obeying the speed limit. Now imagine that truck is driving itself.Despite Silicon Valley\u2019s enthusiasm for self-driving cars, it could be years before there are many of them on the road. But autonomous 18-wheelers? One start-up is betting that is a different matter.That start-up is Otto, led by 15 former Google employees, including eight engineers. Among its staff members are major figures from Google\u2019s self-driving car and maps projects, and it is aiming at the long-haul freeway driving that is the bread and butter of the commercial trucking industry.The engineers think that automating trucks rather than passenger vehicles could be more palatable financially and to regulators. Nationally, trucks drive 5.6 percent of all vehicle miles and are responsible for 9.5 percent of highway fatalities, according to Department of Transportation data.Adding self-driving technology \u2014 at least as it stands now \u2014 into regular passenger cars could make them absurdly expensive for anyone without the cash of a Silicon Valley mogul. Until recently, the laser sensor used on the Google car project cost $75,000.Those costs are coming down, but it will be some time before they have a realistic price for consumers. But a new, big tractor-trailer truck can easily cost more than $150,000, so the added cost of robotic features could make more sense.In addition, it could make trucking more efficient, allowing, for example, a human driver to rest in the sleeper cabin while the truck takes the wheel.Still, automating commercial driving is controversial and \u2014 potentially \u2014 a job killer.There are more than three million truck drivers in the United States, according to the American Trucking Associations, and about one in every 15 workers in the country is employed in the trucking business.There is concern that if commercial trucking is completely automated, it would be economically devastating for small towns in America that thrive from supporting the long-haul trucking industry.Autonomous vehicles have in recent years become one of the tech industry\u2019s favorite projects. Uber sees them as a way to stop dealing with its pesky drivers. Tesla, along with other car manufacturers, sees autonomous technology as an important safety feature to help human drivers.Even Apple is thought to be working on some sort of self-driving car tech.Since the Google car and map veterans, Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron, founded Otto in January, the company has expanded to 41 employees and has been test-driving three Volvo trucks, logging in more than 10,000 miles.Over the weekend, Otto tested a self-driving truck in Nevada.Mr. Levandowski achieved some celebrity in 2004 while he was an industrial engineering graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley. He designed a self-driving motorcycle, stabilized by a gyroscope, that was entered in the Pentagon\u2019s first autonomous vehicle contest. Later, his start-up, 510 Systems, was acquired by Google when it began its self-driving car project.He said that he had decided to leave Google because he was eager to commercialize a self-driving vehicle as quickly as possible.\u201cGoogle is very focused on doing what they\u2019re doing and I felt that it was time to see something come to market and I really liked the idea of bringing trucks to market,\u201d he said.Mr. Ron, Otto\u2019s co-founder, is also a veteran Google software engineer. With a background in Israeli Army intelligence, he was originally the lead engineer for Google Maps.He also worked in the company\u2019s Motorola mobile phone business for three years and then in its secretive robotics research effort.But start-up life isn\u2019t like working for Google on its bucolic Silicon Valley campus.Otto has set up shop in a rickety auto garage, close to a freeway entrance in San Francisco\u2019s South of Market neighborhood. But the new office has enough space to house the firm\u2019s three new Volvo trucks, which have been equipped with cameras, radars, and spinning laser sensors known as Lidar.It is basically the same sensor array used on prototype vehicles being developed by Google, Nissan, Baidu and others. But Mr. Levandowski said that costly commercial trucks gave his designers more freedom to add high-quality sensors.Otto will offer its technology as an upgrade that a long-haul truck owner could purchase, or perhaps as a service a trucking operator could subscribe to.\u201cInitially there will be certain roads that we know we can drive more safely,\u201d Mr. Levandowski said. \u201cOn those roads we\u2019ll tell the driver, \u2018You\u2019re welcome to go take your nap or your break right now.\u2019 If that\u2019s 500 miles, that\u2019s 10 hours, so he gets his full rest.\u201dThe co-founders declined to reveal how much has been invested in the new company so far. They also would say only that they intend to \u201cdemonstrate commercial viability soon.\u201dEven as their technology progresses, Otto still faces a regulatory maze and plenty of competition.California motor vehicle regulations prohibit Otto\u2019s vision of a truck traveling on the freeway with only a sleeping driver in the cab, for example. But many states would permit that technical advance.\u201cRight now, if you want to drive across Texas with nobody at the wheel, you\u2019re 100 percent legal,\u201d said Mr. Levandowski, who as a Google engineer, helped write draft legislation that permitted self-driving vehicles, which later became law in Nevada.The company is initially aiming for the owner-operators market \u2014 truck drivers who own their own rigs and would be able to increase their productivity by sleeping during long-haul trips and dispensing with the need for a second driver.\u201cIt will take a very long time to transition three million people,\u201d Mr. Levandowski said, referring to the number of truck drivers in the United States. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s also the nature of progress. There used to be elevator operators in New York City and there are not anymore.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about a start-up that is developing self-driving tractor-trailer trucks described incorrectly 15 employees of the start-up, called Otto, who came from Google. Eight of them are engineers, not all 15.Advertisement"}

Their articles must now vie for attention in the Facebook algorithms that help determine which items will be prominent in which users\u2019 feeds and which will be highlighted in the Facebook Trending section that is prominent on users\u2019 home pages.So Facebook, born of the open Internet that knocked down the traditional barriers to information, becomes a gatekeeper itself.

Erlich\u2019s incubator may be a patchouli-caked stinkhole, but at least it\u2019s not Hooli, where the hip, open-office layout is merely a candy-colored facade for 21st century corporate venality.\u201cTwo in the Box,\u201d Sunday night\u2019s episode, brings Richard and his team into the belly of the beast \u2014 and it turns out, they kind of like it. With Action Jack handling the budgeting and V.C. funding, Richard can focus on pursuing his coding dreams without concern about dollars and cents. His doctor, played uproariously by Andy Daly, declares him healthy and even notes a glow about him: \u201cIf it were medically possible, I might even think you were pregnant.\u201d As engineers, Dinesh and Gilfoyle are disgruntled by nature, but now they have the hookup on \u201cMinority Report\u201d monitors and a micro-kitchen chef who makes watermelon Jell-O and gluten-free waffles. Only poor Erlich, who has no significant day-to-day role in the company anymore, seems left out, but even he absconds with a few boxes of expensive, unpasteurized coconut water.But, there\u2019s a big catch: Richard no longer has control of his company. His ambition to create a compression platform that will enrich the lives of people everywhere runs against Jack\u2019s mission to sell Pied Piper to businesses and make the stock price go up, up, up. Jack is not an egotist like Gavin Belson, who\u2019s busy trying to scrub the Hooli algorithm to accommodate his morning vanity searches. He\u2019s a successful businessman who will take his \u201cConjoined Triangles of Success\u201d and turn Pied Piper into a smooth-running operation that will offer a massive return on investment. Stephen Tobolowsky plays him with a serene self-confidence that\u2019s unnerving, but essentially innocent: Jack will see through his business initiative with the same lack of affect with which he watches his mare get $150,000 worth of thoroughbred seed.In short order, the existential threat of failure in Seasons 1 and 2 of \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d has morphed into the nightmare of success. Richard wants to bequeath the world a free, efficient, self-learning compression platform and collect his billions with premium services on the back end. Jack wants him to create a product his top-flight team \u2014 like \u201cJan the man\u201d and the guy who shadows another guy \u2014 can sell before the tech bubble bursts again. And since Jack is C.E.O., he wins the argument, despite his empty assurances that Richard\u2019s product will never be compromised. At the end of \u201cTwo in the Box,\u201d Richard witnesses his vision for the next Google or Facebook shrink into a compact metal box to house business data files. No doubt that next bowl of Froot Loops is going to taste like ash in his mouth.Bytes\u2022 Exchange between Dinesh and Gilfoyle over the game of rock-paper-scissors that costs Gilfoyle the bigger of the two monitors. Gilfoyle makes a comment about rock-throwing protests in Pakistan matching Dinesh\u2019s gameplay, to which Dinesh replies: \u201cYou should type up all your racist jokes on your tiny monitor.\u201d\u2022 Jared\u2019s housing issues lead to sleeplessness and legal issues. He\u2019s too ineffectual to kick the Airbnb deadbeat out of his condo, but in typical Jared fashion, he puts a weirdly positive spin on homelessness: \u201cI imagine that my skeleton is me and my body is my house. That way, I\u2019m always home.\u201d\u2022 The tenant-friendly California laws that keep Jared out of his own place are tied neatly to Erlich\u2019s frustrated efforts to boot Jian-Yang, his uncomprehending Chinese \u201cincubee,\u201d out of the house. Erlich\u2019s attempt to bridge the cultural divide by offering a Japanese kimono as a parting gift gets precisely the response it deserves.\u2022 Last week, I talked about conflict as the comic spark to \u201cSilicon Valley,\u201d and with the soon-to-be-ex-Nucleus team cracking Richard\u2019s middle-out code, the gang will have that to worry about, too. The good news for us is that Richard will lose his pregnancy glow and we\u2019ll be seeing a lot more of Andy Daly.Advertisement"}

Oettinger, the European commissioner in charge of the digital economy, said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cWith these new rules, we will uphold media pluralism.\u201dSuch rules already exist for traditional broadcasters, like the BBC in Britain and the TF1 Group in France. On average, they pay the equivalent of millions of dollars each year, or roughly 20 percent of their annual revenue in the countries where they operate, to support local content.European policy makers said that online streaming rivals currently invested only around 1 percent of their annual revenue in local content. Netflix has been able to sidestep existing funding rules, most notably in France, because the company\u2019s European headquarters are in the Netherlands.Streaming services will also be required to ensure that at least 20 percent of their online content is from Europe, and that those movies and television programs are given prominence in their digital catalogs. A report funded by the European Commission recently found that both Netflix and Apple already met this requirement.The commission\u2019s digital plans are subject to the approval of the European Parliament and individual member states, a lengthy process that could lead to significant changes.Europe\u2019s proposals on digital services are only the beginning.The European Commission said on Wednesday that it would also propose new copyright rules in the fall that could force companies like Google to pay online publishers when using their content, including in its news aggregation service Google News.Officials also said that they were still reviewing potential new rules to control how so-called online platforms like Facebook and Amazon operate in the 28-member bloc.European officials said they were looking into making it easier for people to move their digital information between online platforms by the end of the year, giving them greater control over data that companies collected on their daily digital lives.\u201cI want online platforms and the audiovisual and creative sectors to be powerhouses in the digital economy,\u201d said Andrus Ansip, the European Commission vice president in charge of the region\u2019s digital single market proposals. \u201cThey need the certainty of a modern and fair legal environment: That is what we are providing today.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Free Speech: Ten Principles for a Connected World,\u2019 by Timothy Garton Ash", "Date": "2016-05-22", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Among our most treasured public values, free speech is indispensable and perplexing. It involves us at once in high principle and shaming triviality, as two otherwise unconnected headline cases nicely attest. In Germany, a comedian who mocked the Turkish president on air may soon stand trial under an antique law against offending foreign dignitaries. In Florida, a jury in March rejected Gawker Media\u2019s free-speech defense and ordered it to pay $140 million in damages for posting a tawdry video on its gossip site showing a retired wrestler in bed with another celebrity\u2019s wife.Free speech\u2019s many-sided appeal is not hard to identify. It prods society to criticize itself and learn from mistakes. It fosters the independence of mind we need to be responsible grown-ups. Take away free speech, and liberal democracy \u00adceases to be truly liberal or democratic. Free speech hunts out truth and spreads knowledge. When stifled, it responds with soaring words of defiance. Think of Milton or Voltaire, Nelson Mandela or Vaclav Havel, Salman Rushdie or Kamel Daoud.Defending free speech, alas, takes more than standing up for science, sound argument and brave eloquence. It takes standing up as well for the right to say things that are false, hateful, mindless, base, vulgar, stupid or reckless. It is easy to defend what we admire and believe in. To defend free speech, you have to allow for bad speech. Free speech gave us Martin Luther King\u2019s \u201cI have a dream.\u201d It also gave us Donald Trump.It would be nice to have one without the other. But that is not what free speech promises. Free speech is complicated and comes at a high price. We pay for it in terms of other things we also need to care about: public order and security, children\u2019s needs, private reputations, civic courtesy, cultural worth, the social \u00addignity of vulnerable minorities. As Timothy Garton Ash makes admirably clear in his wise, up-to-the-minute and wide-ranging new survey, \u201cFree Speech: Ten Principles for a Connected World,\u201d most of the difficult arguments about free speech bear on its price in terms of other things that also ought to matter to us.The controversies are fierce and familiar. Ought leakers be punished, and how can whistle-blowers be protected? Should pornography be restricted? Do libel laws gag the press? May religion be shielded from mockery? Ought hate speech be criminalized? Garton Ash pursues each in depth. He follows the common practice of taking \u201cfree speech\u201d to mean a cluster of freedoms to express yourself and your thoughts as you please: not just voicing words but printing what you want, \u00adproclaiming your faith as you wish, campaigning for your chosen causes and making art without interference.Speech in that broad sense was once suspect unless expressly permitted; monitored speech was the norm. But in liberal modernity, unmonitored speech is the norm and limits to speech are suspect unless specifically justified. The main arguments now separate laxists from restrictionists. Laxists favor few limits, restrictionists many. The kinds of limits matter. Coercive laws, whether prior censorship or after-the-fact sanctions, provide one kind of limit. Garton Ash is generally against them. High standards of public argument and common decency are another kind of limit. Garton Ash is broadly for them. You could say he is laxist about law and restrictionist about standards. His approach has the great merit of keeping distinct what is legally permissible and what is or ought to be socially acceptable. Garton Ash treasures the jewel but recognizes and regrets the mud. His guiding maxim, never wholly lost amid near encyclopedic detail, is \u201cMore free speech but also better speech.\u201dAs a scholar-journalist, Garton Ash knows what he is talking about from a career of reading, writing, listening and, more lately, web-clicking. When reporting on the breakup of the Communist world in the 1980s, he befriended East European dissidents, saw how truthful speech could sap the will of wrongful power and collected a private lexicon of sardonic political jokes that here lighten the going. Now a fellow at St. Antony\u2019s College, Oxford, he supervises a 13-language online debating platform \u2014 freespeechdebate.com \u2014 for promoting free speech and arguing with all sides about its proper limits. His travels and interviews for \u201cFree Speech\u201d spanned the world, or what he calls the \u201ccosmopolis,\u201d a global space that is virtual as well as geographic. That range alone will squelch the fantasy that free speech is a purely Western concern.Garton Ash invokes recent work by lawyers and philosophers but sees that fine distinctions and tight reasoning get you only so far in public argument. Talk of freedom is empty, he recognizes, when it neglects unequal power. In illustration, he offers a nice cartoon metaphor. Speech, he writes, is fought over by dogs (big state powers like the United States, the European Union and China), cats (big Internet and media concerns) and mice (that is, us). Government and corporations, he thinks, should interfere with speech very little. We should accordingly not look to them to improve speech. Making speech better is up to us, the mice.Law to Garton Ash is a poor tool for \u00adcivic education. He questions hate-speech laws and Holocaust-denial laws, fearing a \u00ad\u201ctaboo ratchet.\u201d Corporations in their turn are after profit, not civic uplift. He distrusts the idea that Google, Amazon and Facebook, for example, serve \u00adequally the values of free speech and good speech. His preferred answer to the more flagrant vices of liberty \u2014 hate speech, manipulative journalism, coarsened debate and a vast sewer of abuse on social media \u2014 is to encourage \u201cshared norms and practices that enable us to make best use of this essential freedom.\u201dIn lesser hands, that recommendation might sound overabstract or simply pious. Garton Ash, \u00adhowever, applies and tests it in 10 chapters offering \u201ccomplex, contextual judgments\u201d that pretty well cover the field of present controversy. He writes with panache and understands the world he works in, especially the virtual world of the Net. Practical answers interest him more than doctrinal purity. His website has adopted a \u201cone-click-away\u201d rule. It screens provocative material \u2014 Muhammad cartoons, for example \u2014 with a warning that some may take offense, leaving them to see it or not as they choose.He knows that \u201cwe,\u201d the citizenry of mice, are not all secular-minded liberals like him but deeply divided in outlook. Heading each chapter is a free-speech maxim that he hopes modernity and tradition may agree on: for example, \u201cNeither make threats of violence nor accept violent intimidation\u201d or \u201cRespect the believer but not necessarily the content of the belief.\u201d His watchword for dialogue amid \u00adcultural diversity is \u201crobust civility,\u201d an ideal somewhere between internal warfare and inauthentic making nice. He derides trigger warnings and on-campus censorship, explaining tersely that \u201cchildren should be educated to become sovereign adults, but not treated as if they already are.\u201dMost of us are somewhat stunned at present by the scale and \u00adcomplexity of the forces in play, be they government surveillance; the \u201cGreat Firewall of \u00adChina\u201d that can censor the national web; the mounting strength of the Internet giants; or the frightening violence of militant Islam. Bewilderment is the easy option. \u201cFree Speech\u201d encourages us to take a breath, look hard at the facts and see how well-tried liberal principles can be applied and defended in daunting new circumstances.Edmund Fawcett, the author of \u201cLiberalism: The Life of an Idea,\u201d is writing a study of conservatism in Europe and the United States from the 19th century to the present.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oracle\u2019s Suit Against Google Digs Up Old Bones", "Date": "2016-05-11", "News": "Supported byBitsIn Silicon Valley, it is often said that new tech companies are built on the bones of the old ones.Sun Microsystems, one of the most influential tech companies of the 1990s, has been back in the news this week, and its old bones could end up costing Google more than $9 billion. In 1995, Sun released the first version of its Java programming language \u2014 or development platform, as many preferred to call it at the time.Java was a programming breakthrough, just as browsing the World Wide Web was becoming mainstream. The Java motto at the time \u2014 \u201cWrite once, run anywhere\u201d \u2014 while always a bit of an exaggeration, pointed to the importance that software created by anyone working on anything could have. Without that notion, the Web would not work.Sun, founded years earlier and best known for its powerful workstation computers, became one of the most influential companies of the first dot-com boom. It moved on to making servers, which ran many of the most popular websites of the time. It is not a stretch to say that big thinkers at the company were mulling things like cloud computing \u2014 giant computer networks that connect over the Internet \u2014 years before they became a reality.But Sun did not last as long as its ideas. Its costly servers, which usually ran on Sun-made computer chips and software, were undercut by cheaper servers that ran on common processors designed by Intel and Linux, a low-cost, open-source software alternative.By the time the company tried to respond, it was too late. Oracle acquired Sun \u2014 and Java \u2014 for $7.4 billion in 2009. And as Oracle\u2019s lawyers did an inventory of the intellectual property of their new purchase, they came to the conclusion that Google had violated Java copyrights in its Android operating system for smartphones.Interestingly, years ago, Mr. Schmidt was in charge of Java at Sun. He says that helped him know what was and was not a copyright violation. Oracle\u2019s lawyers are sure to argue that history means he should have known better.Sun is long gone, but its intellectual legacy lives on. So do its old headquarters. These days, they are part of Facebook\u2019s campus.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Another Company With a Cause: Is Google Just Being a Good Citizen?", "Date": "2016-05-12", "News": "Supported byPayday LoansGoogle is an adventurous company, but few would ever think of it as a financial regulator.It\u2019s not censorship, because Google is a private company, not the government. But with so much digital advertising running through Google\u2019s extensive network, Google does have huge power to quickly effect change. But is that power akin to the government\u2019s?An interesting pattern is forming, but it\u2019s not a rampant power grab by corporate America. It\u2019s more nuanced than that.Google could argue that its move is merely tipping the balance back toward the borrower. PayPal could argue that its move was about civil rights. Corporate power is checked to some degree by many kinds of laws and regulations, including those against unfair competition, discrimination and unsafe working conditions. PayPal, for instance, would be in big legal trouble if it fired employees for supporting the North Carolina bathroom law.More important, though, when there is no clear-cut wrong being done, a crackdown on a corporation could do more harm than good.But even if Facebook suppressed every single right-wing article \u2013 something that would reduce its credibility, destroy its reputation and undermine its business \u2014 this would not be illegal. It is guaranteed the freedom of speech like any news organization. Indeed, trying to make a company\u2019s bias illegal would have negative consequences for society that would far exceed any harm done by Facebook\u2019s trending list.Facebook could tweak its own system to guard against bias. But this is tricky, too. How can \u201cbias\u201d ever be conclusively defined on a social media site with 222 million users in the United States with widely divergent opinions? Scouring all those streams for bias would be close to impossible. Still, Facebook could take smaller, more sensible steps like encouraging external monitors to review serious accusations of bias and bring them to the company\u2019s attention.But in reality Google\u2019s move was not radical. Media companies often decide not to run certain types of ads \u2014 like those for escort services. And Google is hardly out of step with the wider financial industry. Mainstream lenders have long stayed away from payday loans, leaving the business to a few firms.The ad ban by Google, in contrast, came fast, a reminder of how effective corporate power can be. You can understand why the payday industry found it unsettling. But the lenders are just one side of this debate.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Joshua Ferris Reviews Don DeLillo\u2019s \u2018Zero K\u2019", "Date": "2016-05-02", "News": "Supported byFictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Something feels not quite right about subjecting Don DeLillo to the ordinary critical apparatus. I don\u2019t read a DeLillo novel for its plot, character, setting; for who betrayed whom and how hard life with Mother was; for Phoenix days and Bombay nights; or for how to tune a fiddle. I read a DeLillo novel for its sentences. And sentence by sentence, DeLillo magically slips the knot of criticism and gives his readers what Nabokov maintained was all that mattered in life and art: individual genius. Sentence by sentence, DeLillo seduces. And I don\u2019t just mean on the question of thumbs up or down; I mean that his sentences juke and weave around the best defenses, so that not only is the playing field of the past 50 years strewn with conservative critics of all stripes, but text, subtext, ultimate meanings remain elusive and the game, at least in part, now seems original to him.For instance. Charles Maitland, a British security consultant in DeLillo\u2019s 1982 novel \u201cThe Names,\u201d compares Western expatriates \u2014 diplomats, businessmen, risk analysts \u2014 to members of the British Empire whose insouciant lives were full of \u201copportunity, adventure, sunsets, dusty death.\u201d Even with so dour a conclusion, it all sounds winsome and romantic in Maitland\u2019s formulation, which fails to take into account at whose expense opportunity and adventure are made. Later, Maitland complains: \u201cThey keep changing the names .\u2008.\u2008. Persia for one. We grew up with Persia. What a vast picture that name evoked. A vast carpet of sand. .\u2008.\u2008. I find I take these changes quite personally. .\u2008.\u2008. Every time another people\u2019s republic emerges from the dust, I have the feeling someone has tampered with my childhood.\u201d Clueless but effervescent, this is wit and world-weariness as two sides of the Western coin, the sort of thing one might smile at when spoken at a cocktail party. But it masks a deeper intent. DeLillo artfully reveals Maitland\u2019s Western view of things while guiding the reader to ask: Who\u2019s changing the names, and why? Smile, and the history of colonialism and the civil wars it ignited will be scrubbed out with a quip.Local pleasures make palatable \u00adDeLillo\u2019s deep and disquieting engagement with the world on many levels: \u00adsocial, political, philosophical, linguistic, interpersonal. In book after book, his characters fall through constructed surfaces and constructed selves into deeper, more terrifying but also more numinous realities. They quest for truer or purer or more permanent identities, for the hidden key that will resolve them of their limitations, weaknesses and mortal bearings. More often than not, that quest leads to disillusionment and death. Thus does David Bell, in \u201cAmericana,\u201d hope to discover in the small towns and bit players of this uncontainable country something that will make him one with the pure incandescent image. Thus does Owen Brademas, searching in \u201cThe Names\u201d for the resolution of a fallen world in a language of divine order, find that search travestied by a murderous cult seeking similar ends. And thus does Lee Harvey Oswald, in \u201cLibra,\u201d hope to be absorbed into History with a single act of violence in order to be absolved of his otherwise small and insignificant self.In \u201cZero K,\u201d DeLillo\u2019s 16th and latest novel, Jeffrey Lockhart arrives in the middle of the desert at a remote compound called the Convergence. Variously described as an \u201cendeavor,\u201d a \u201cfaith-based technology\u201d and \u201cthe first split second of the first cosmic year,\u201d the Convergence is a cross between a think tank and a state-of-the-art hospice: the Santa Fe Institute meets Sloan Kettering, with a dollop of Heaven\u2019s Gate, all of it given over to Christo for interior decorating. Whatever it is, the Convergence coolly ignites the imagination. Jeff hopes to get his bearings, at least geographically, when he asks his father, the billionaire Ross Lockhart, where they are. \u201cThe nearest city of any size is across the border, called Bishkek,\u201d Ross answers from deep within blastproof walls. He continues: \u201cOnce you know the local names and how to spell them, you\u2019ll feel less detached.\u201dWe are, in other words, far from the neocolonial world described so tendentiously by Charles Maitland. We are in a vision of the future, a postracial, post-postcolonial world where Westerners like Ross and Jeff are but one contingent of a technocratic cult with a single aim: to rid the world of that absolute, all-\u00addefining force, that ultimate despotic colonizer, death. For the Convergence, as it turns out, is a cryonic suspension facility where the dead are frozen in anticipation of that day when resuscitation is medically feasible. Jeff has arrived there to say a temporary goodbye to his stepmother, the archaeologist \u00adArtis Martineau, who is dying of several disabling diseases.Ross Lockhart, who made his billions assessing the financial risk of natural disasters, is a true believer in the promise of the Convergence. He pours money and \u00adresources into the endeavor, not to mention old-fashioned dogma. The first half of the book is devoted to abolishing any skepticism Jeff (and the reader) might have for the cryogenically inclined. \u201cRespect the idea,\u201d Ross tells Jeff of the Convergence, after Jeff, intending only a little disrespect, says, \u201cPeople \u00adenroll their pets.\u201d Yet, despite the proselytizing, Jeff, who spends his downtime wandering past door after door in a series of unending hallways, can\u2019t bring himself to understand what\u2019s all around him as anything more than it seems: a lark, a punch line, a cruel delusion. Artis \u201cwould die,\u201d he thinks, \u201cchemically prompted, in a subzero vault, in a highly precise medical procedure guided by mass delusion, by superstition and arrogance and self-deception.\u201d His skepticism extends to the very rooms and doorways of the Convergence, as he becomes convinced they\u2019re decoys, elaborate fictions to some inscrutable end. He knocks on one, and to his surprise, a man answers in turban and tie. Not a lark, after all. \u201cI must have the wrong door,\u201d Jeff says by way of apology. \u201cThey\u2019re all the wrong door,\u201d the man replies. A lark, after all.This is fiction in touch with the starker parables, with Kafka and Beckett, with the austerity of bare rooms and declarative, uninflected sentences. I was uncertain as I read these early pages. Had DeLillo created a world of pure abstraction where the reader would be left to float in the \u00adzero-gravity chamber of the death fable, everything to think about and nothing to latch on to? But this is only one of several canny feints in the book, which continually shape-shifts and reimagines itself. In the end, it all adds up to one of the most mysterious, emotionally moving and formally rewarding books of DeLillo\u2019s long career.Slowly, Jeff comes to understand what\u2019s intended out there on the outskirts of Bishkek: technological utopia. Cells will be refashioned. Nanobots will restore the body and augment the brain. The old factions born of religion and geopolitics will be permanently mooted in a post-death world. Jeff\u2019s incredulity at such things \u00adallows DeLillo to render the Convergence at once otherworldly and entirely believable, one more high-flying human scheme revved on false hope and doomed to fail. What put me in mind, in the early going, of brushed-steel surfaces and lonely centrifuges becomes something warmer and more elegiac as Artis\u2019s death nears and the enormity of Ross\u2019s loss comes into view. Death, even at the Convergence, remains just that, at least for the foreseeable future. And the man does love his wife.At about the same time, the philosophical implications of cryogenic success deepen. The primary architects of the Convergence, a pair of siblings Jeff calls the Stenmark twins, hold a kind of slapstick seminar on their project; it plays like the Marx Brothers doing a TED talk with the mind-body philosophers Paul and Patricia Churchland. I found myself asking: What would happen if the souls of the cryogenically preserved went to heaven? Would they resurrect as zombies when science restored their bodies? The book inspires a lot of intellectual play as it drifts away from stark Kafka landscape into Borges-\u00adinspired mindspace, even flirting with the trippier themes of Philip K. Dick, and elegy starts to compete not with science fiction, exactly, but with fiction about science.Meanwhile, the real world \u2014 I mean yours and mine (and Jeff\u2019s), the world of headlines and global warming \u2014 enters from the wings in the form of disaster footage projected onto white screens in those hallways Jeff roams. \u201cThere were temples flooded, homes pitching down hillsides,\u201d he tells us. \u201cI watched as water kept rising in city streets, cars and drivers going under.\u201d If literature is Pound\u2019s \u201cnews that stays news,\u201d this is news about news that stays news, for in a place like the Convergence where death has been antiquated, newspaper headlines turn into art installations. Soon the book is pulling a good number of levers, both emotional and intellectual, and really humming, so much so that when Ross, perfectly healthy, announces his intention to follow his wife on the first leg of what they hope to be a round-trip journey \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m going with her,\u201d he tells his son, in a cold declaration of his suicide \u2014 I was wide-eyed, and reading as much for plot as for prose style.DeLillo, the most perceptive (almost occult) chronicler of contemporary life, has not invented the Convergence out of whole cloth: Its DNA comes from an old evangelism dressed in a new rhetoric and streaming out of Silicon Valley. \u201cDeath makes me very angry,\u201d Larry Ellison, the founder of Oracle, told his biographer, perhaps to explain why he has given nearly half a billion dollars to medical research to halt human aging. Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay, together with his wife, has given millions of dollars to the research of biological resiliency. Then there is the Breakthrough Prize, founded by Sergey Brin, Mark Zuckerberg and other tech luminaries, with an annual pot of $3 million going to researchers who make discoveries that extend human life. And there is Larry Page\u2019s founding of Calico (or California Life Company), an \u00adanti-aging research center in San Francisco, with a multimillion-dollar \u00adinvestment from Google. The list goes on. We have entered an age of messianism through philanthropy and are only a billionaire\u2019s whim away from the Convergence and its dreams of \u201ca promise more assured than the ineffable hereafters of the world\u2019s organized religions.\u201dThe full scope of DeLillo\u2019s vision for \u201cZero K\u201d comes into view with the book\u2019s second half, when the real world, in the form of New York City and the crisis in Ukraine, floods the page. Two years have passed since Artis\u2019s death, and Jeff now finds himself involved with a woman named Emma and her politically precocious son, whom she adopted from Ukraine. The strife there, hopeless and cyclical, is soon to rear its terrible head, with consequences for all of them. But before any of this can transpire, we get familiar DeLillo street life, witty repartee in the backs of cabs, rooftop views of the city at dusk. We have our attention focused on those easily overlooked moments of everyday life, like standing shoeless in the airport, and those quotidian \u00addetails \u2014 \u201cfresh towels on the racks, nice new bar of soap, clean sheets on the bed\u201d \u2014 that give texture and pleasure to the day. We visit Emma at the school where she works with developmentally disabled children, admiring her, as Jeff does, for her tenderness with troubled souls. This teeming life, these unexpectedly touching scenes, come to the reader as both refreshing breeze and melancholy plaint, for what is observed here, what is gloried, is also what is inevitably lost with dying. The careful structure of the book won\u2019t let us forget that: The Convergence, the dying part, came first. This is \u00adelegy as formal design. We carry the Convergence with us through the vibrant city like a memento mori, for toward a convergence we all must go, and with it, every attachment, every lustful look, the whole worldly kit and caboodle.The Convergence, with its promises of everlasting life, is a seductive dream, just as Charles Maitland\u2019s assessment of Western entanglement in far-flung lands is seductive. \u201cIt will be very gentle,\u201d Ross says about Artis\u2019s death. \u201cIt will be quick, safe and painless.\u201d Death, painless! \u201cThis is real,\u201d one of the Stenmark twins says. \u201cTake the existential leap. Rewrite the sad grim grieving playscript of death in the usual manner.\u201d When death is indistinguishable from a long night\u2019s sleep among excellent accommodations and in the company of loved ones, after which one awakes rejuvenated and augmented by nanobots with spoken Greek and all of Proust, who wouldn\u2019t love the turndown service at the Convergence?But the seduction is every bit as illusory as Charles Maitland\u2019s. After all, we are as far from a postracial, post-postcolonial world as we are near to arriving at whatever technique or technology is necessary for eternal life. For those inclined to believe that the rationalist mind-set, in league with science and technology, is better poised to bring about results than the old emissaries of heaven, \u201cZero K\u201d reminds them that human nature is one of permanent conflict. Eternal life would only become one more instrument of power and source of human sorrow.The good news, modest as it must be, is \u201cZero K.\u201d DeLillo\u2019s novels generally \u00adoffer consolation simply by enacting so well the mystery and awe of the real world, by probing deeply and mystically into so much, and by offering the pleasures of his unique style. Just as his characters plunge through constructed realities in quest of truer selves, so do we, as DeLillo\u2019s readers, find in his pages something akin to insight of a gnostic order. DeLillo\u2019s characters long to penetrate the enigmas and intrigues of his conjured worlds; DeLillo\u2019s readers devour his sentences, images and narratives for what amounts to something similar: for all that DeLillo \u2014 the seeker, the prophet, the mystic, the guide \u2014 sees.That consolation is every bit as present in \u201cZero K\u201d as it is in the best of DeLillo\u2019s previous novels, down to the pleasures of the final page. The scene takes place in New York, with Jeff on a crosstown bus. It ends the book powerfully. I finished it stunned and grateful. DeLillo has written a handful of the past half-century\u2019s finest novels. Now, as he approaches 80, he gives us one more, written distinctly for the 21st.Joshua Ferris\u2019s novels include \u201cThen We Came to the End,\u201d\u2009 \u201cThe Unnamed\u201d and \u201cTo Rise Again at a Decent Hour.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Unless you meet the person you\u2019re going to marry.That\u2019s what happened to Josh Mankiewicz and Anh Tu Dang in 2009 at Los Angeles International Airport, thanks to Transportation Security Administration procedures.\u201cStanding ahead of me was this stunning woman,\u201d Mr. Mankiewicz said. \u201cI was staring at her. She didn\u2019t notice. Finally we started talking. Actually, I started talking and she responded.\u201dMs. Dang figured there was nothing else to do. She recalled thinking: \u201cHe seemed kind of nice. I may as well talk to him.\u201dTheir conversation was brief and friendly. Luckily, Mr. Mankiewicz, a correspondent since 1995 for the NBC News magazine program \u201cDateline,\u201d could read the upside-down tag hanging from Ms. Dang\u2019s bag.Unluckily, when he returned to Los Angeles from his business trip and searched for her name on Google, he found several Anh Tu Dang\u2019s, just not the one who had caught his attention.But Mr. Mankiewicz, who had never married, had impulsively given his business card to Ms. Dang, who was divorced and the owner and chief executive of the home health care business CareWorks Health Service in Laguna Hills, Calif. \u201cI was 100 percent sure I would never hear from her and that what I had done was something silly and overconfident,\u201d he said.Once Ms. Dang returned to Los Angeles from her trip and looked up Mr. Mankiewicz, she was worried that he may have a big head and big ego. \u201cHe might have girlfriends in Chicago and New York, and I didn\u2019t want to be another person on that list of women,\u201d she said.After about four weeks, she decided to call. \u201cHe was handsome and apparently smart,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought, let me give it a shot and see what happens.\u201dWhen Ms. Dang, now 42, identified herself as the woman from the airport, Mr. Mankiewicz, now 60, didn\u2019t immediately recognize who was calling. \u201cI wondered if maybe I\u2019d lost something,\u201d he said. But when he realized it was Ms. Dang, whose nickname is Tee, he quickly invited her to dinner.\u201cI remember walking into the restaurant and being struck by how beautiful she was,\u201d Mr. Mankiewicz said.The couple dated for over a month, but not exclusively, and then Mr. Mankiewicz decided to pursue another relationship. \u201cI wasn\u2019t the right fit for him,\u201d Ms. Dang said. \u201cYou know how you can tell when a guy\u2019s heart isn\u2019t into it.\u201d\u201cShe let me off the hook pretty easily,\u201d he said.Then one day, four years later, in summer 2013, Mr. Mankiewicz, who had months before broken off his previous relationship, found himself on the street where Ms. Dang lived. He called her and they met for lunch.\u201cNot to say we were boyfriend and girlfriend from that day forward, but I was definitely smitten,\u201d he said. \u201cI always wanted someone who could stand up on her own and stand up to me, someone who didn\u2019t need me but wanted to be with me, and that was Tee.\u201dMark Thompson, a Los Angeles newscaster who has known Mr. Mankiewicz since childhood, said his friend has been with some women in the past who were \u201cinto drama.\u201d \u201cShe is the opposite,\u201d Mr. Thompson said. \u201cShe is not looking to litigate every cup of espresso.\u201dDespite their age difference (\u201cShe\u2019ll say, \u2018I remember when this song came out, I was in the seventh grade,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll say, \u2018I was covering the Mondale campaign.\u2019\u201d), they found compatibility in their professions.On \u201cDateline,\u201d Mr. Mankiewicz speaks to people whose family members have been murdered. In her home health care business, Ms. Dang speaks to people who have often undergone devastating physical or mental losses.\u201cWe\u2019re both in roles where we are talking to people who are dealing with sadness and trauma, and they need compassion and understanding,\u201d she said. \u201cReaching people at an emotionally fragile time gives us something in common and helps us be sensitive to one another.\u201dFive weeks after they had begun dating again, real drama emerged in their relationship. Ms. Dang received a diagnosis of breast cancer and she subsequently had a double mastectomy.Mr. Mankiewicz insisted she recuperate in his two-bedroom Beverly Hills condominium (ultimately she would have eight operations) in spite of her protestations that she could stay at her own place and simply lie on her couch, have the pharmacy deliver medicine and order takeout food.\u201cShe comes off as 10 feet tall and bulletproof,\u201d Mr. Mankiewicz said. \u201cBut she needed my help, and I wanted to help her. This told me things about myself and my relationship to her, namely that I was in love with her in a way I hadn\u2019t realized.\u201dThe operations forced Ms. Dang to acknowledge her vulnerabilities. \u201cI was crying \u2014 this is hard,\u201d she said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting this to happen to me at 39.\u201dAnd the recovery experience left her exposed to Mr. Mankiewicz in a way she hadn\u2019t planned. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be Superwoman hear me roar,\u201d she said. \u201cI hadn\u2019t showered in days. My hair was a mess and I had tubes coming out of my body.\u201dAfter she recovered, she moved back to her Santa Monica apartment, but this time he was not letting go, and she felt safe. \u201cI could tell him anything, and he wouldn\u2019t judge me,\u201d she said. \u201cHe can see through me like a pane of glass and read me better than anybody else.\u201dBy contrast, when bombs were falling on Saigon in 1975 and Ms. Dang was 1\u00bd years old, her mother, then eight months pregnant with Ms. Dang\u2019s brother, escaped to Guam by boat. The family, later joined by Ms. Dang\u2019s father, Khoi Van Dang, who was disabled when Ms. Dang was 13, settled in Orange County, Calif., where they became naturalized citizens.\u201cMy family did not allow me to watch TV during the week unless it was something on PBS and probably about an elephant,\u201d Ms. Dang said. She was a shy, motivated student. By sixth grade she was reading at a 12th-grade level. \u201cIt was easy for me to go into my room, spend the day there reading and come out at 6 at night,\u201d she said.Mr. Mankiewicz takes their cultural differences in stride. \u201cMy dad is from a successful Jewish family, and my mom, who had been raised a Mormon, was the first member of her family to attend college,\u201d he said. \u201cThe lesson my parents gave me was: You don\u2019t have to have a lot in common with someone to love them.\u201dFrom her perspective, Ms. Dang believes the Vietnamese culture can be tough on daughters. \u201cSubconsciously it is ingrained that you need to take care of your guy,\u201d she said. \u201cJosh likes it that, for lack of a better word, I am not subservient.\u201dJoey Dang, Ms. Dang\u2019s brother, saw another, possibly more lighthearted connection: They both love clothes and fashion. \u201cTee used to take pictures of her shoes and put them on the outside of the boxes,\u201d Mr. Dang said. \u201cAs soon as I saw his closet, I thought, This is a man who gets my sister.\u201d (Mr. Mankiewicz\u2019s closet is color coordinated, with his jackets evenly spaced.)After one year of steady dating, Mr. Mankiewicz was not making a move toward the altar. His father, who met Ms. Dang on his 90th birthday in 2014, told his son he should marry her. But his son balked: He wasn\u2019t interested in having children. He was afraid if he was a part of someone else, he wouldn\u2019t be himself anymore. And, he joked, \u201cDateline\u201d was not the biggest commercial for matrimony.The next year, Mr. Mankiewicz changed his mind about staying single, perhaps, as his brother Ben Mankiewicz, a host of Turner Classic Movies, suggested, because four events converged: Ben had a child; their father died; their aging mother had moved to Los Angeles; and his big brother had met the right woman. \u201cIt\u2019s a testament to his emotional maturity that it was O.K. to change his life at 60,\u201d Ben Mankiewicz said. \u201cIt took courage. It\u2019s hokey to say, but I\u2019m proud of him.\u201dTheir mother, Holly Howell, said: \u201cAll I could say to myself was, it\u2019s about time. He was seeing her a lot and I thought, if he doesn\u2019t hurry up, she\u2019d say to hell with it.\u201dIn November 2015, at the restaurant where they\u2019d had their first date, Mr. Mankiewicz proposed to Ms. Dang. \u201cShe gasped like someone in the movies I grew up watching,\u201d he said. \u201cWe made a champagne toast and took a picture and then we sat there silently texting.\u201dThe wedding was set for what would have been the 92nd birthday of Mr. Mankiewicz\u2019s father. Eight weeks before, after the last of her operations, Ms. Dang moved in to Mr. Mankiewicz\u2019s condominium. He lamented having to give away 220 of his shirts to make room for her clothes in his closet.On May 16, they were married before a small gathering of family and friends on the deck of the home of Mr. Thompson, the newscaster who became a Universal Life minister to officiate.\u201cSometimes the path to love is slow, sometimes \u2014 courtesy of T.S.A. \u2014 it is excruciatingly slow,\u201d Mr. Mankiewicz said. \u201cBut I suppose we should thank them. It gave us time to have that first talk.\u201dHis mother delighted in the two families\u2019 newfound connection.\u201cHe finally came to his senses,\u201d Ms. Howell said. \u201cI mean it. You have to work really hard not to like her. There\u2019s not an ounce of snobbishness in her. She doesn\u2019t think she\u2019s a big shot. She has views of her own.\u201dMs. Dang\u2019s mother, Ahn Thi Le, was sold on her new son-in-law at hello. \u201cI\u2019m a Buddhist; my house is a Buddhist temple,\u201d she said. \u201cThe first time he came to visit me, he said, \u2018Thank you for creating your daughter.\u2019 He touched my heart right away. For her, I thought, you don\u2019t have to find another person. You found him. Eureka!\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putting Love to the Stress Test", "Date": "2016-05-27", "News": "Supported byModern LoveSeveral years ago, on a beautiful Valentine\u2019s Day evening in San Francisco, a friend of mine and I decided to visit the California Academy of Sciences. The museum was love-themed for the occasion, with lectures about dating and exhibits of ancient dildos, contraptions that resembled medieval torture devices.After perusing the historic sex toys with growing horror, we wandered into a lecture where a woman was sharing the pros and cons of various online dating sites. Her talk led my friend to suggest I create a profile on OkCupid.I had just moved to the Bay Area and wanted to meet people, but I wasn\u2019t ready to date. So in the \u201cYou should message me if \u2014 \u201d section, I wrote a paragraph about why someone should not message me. At the top of my list: \u201cDon\u2019t message me if you\u2019re interested in dating.\u201dA couple of days later, I received a message from someone who claimed that we had a lot in common, but he insisted I answer more than just 25 questions so he could \u201cmore reliably assess\u201d our compatibility. Curiosity drove me to his profile, where I noticed that he had answered nearly 500 questions.Turns out he, too, had created an elaborate \u201cdo not message me if\u201d list that included everything I would have written if I had spent more time on my profile.We agreed to meet that weekend at a coffee shop. He was thin, with blue eyes and brown hair, and he had the quintessential San Francisco geek look. To complete the stereotype, he was a founder of a tech start-up, the San Francisco equivalent of meeting a writer in Hollywood. The only thing that stood out about him, other than his Slovene accent, was his glasses. Rather than resting on his ears as normal glasses do, they clung to the sides of his head like a huge spider. (It didn\u2019t look quite as odd as it sounds.)We grabbed lattes, settled in on the patio and dived straight into deep conversation about politics and our pasts. There was no chitchat about the weather or hobbies. Coffee turned into dinner, and we spent the entire evening discussing everything from religion to robotics, unearthing one surprising commonality after another.We\u2019re both tech geeks, but our overlap went way beyond that, with us sharing identical first jobs, worldviews, everything. Even our mothers seemed like the same person. We stumbled upon the odd fact that each had urged us (inappropriately) to frame and display our I.T. exam certificates from Microsoft because Bill Gates had signed them. Neither knew much of anything about our work, but both had heard of Mr. Gates.By 10 p.m., we decided to call it a night. He had taken the local rail to meet me, so I offered him a ride home. Our experiences and personalities were so strikingly similar I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if this encounter was an elaborate practical joke orchestrated by my friends. As he told me how to drive to his place, my suspicion only grew, because he was directing me to my own apartment. It turned out he lived right across the street from my building, a fact neither of us had known when we met a few hours earlier.To uncover our differences, I spent the week answering every question he had answered on OkCupid, but I only found more similarities. I had to supply my answers before I could see his, but one after another, our answers were identical. We met the next weekend for dinner, where I spent five hours looking for reasons to vehemently disagree with him on something, anything.After three months, the only disagreement we had was over apples; I liked them, and he didn\u2019t. But here\u2019s the thing: Our ridiculous lack of differences worried me. My idea of a successful relationship had been that of a Venn diagram with a healthy intersection, not two mostly overlapping circles, and that the best match was one in which you complemented, not replicated, each other. Perhaps I was missing something.\u201cDinners and weekend activities are great,\u201d I blurted out one day. \u201cBut we need to find a more efficient way to uncover our real differences.\u201d\u201cI think we both have the same goal,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat do you propose?\u201dIn software development, you sometimes intentionally push the boundaries to see if a system breaks. It\u2019s called stress testing, similar in concept to the treadmill test a doctor performs to measure a patient\u2019s heart condition.\u201cWhy don\u2019t we stress-test our relationship?\u201d I asked.He was game, so we spent the next 30 minutes discussing details. In essence, we wanted to try to create the environment of a decades-long marriage to see how well our relationship might hold up. He would move in with me for four weeks, during which time we would go about our lives without any facade: avoiding romance and doing nothing to try to impress the other person, while being vocal about disagreements and upfront about our inadequacies.In addition, we created exit criteria. If during or after the stress test either of us felt the relationship wouldn\u2019t work, we would part amicably without drama or guilt.With our terms agreed upon, he moved in the next day (it was quite convenient that he was already my neighbor), and our test began.I don\u2019t usually wear makeup, and he had never seen me use anything other than lip balm, so there wasn\u2019t much to test there. But what about hairy legs? That I could do. If I lived with someone for five years (or even five months), there would be plenty of times when he would have to deal with my not-so-smooth legs.Within a couple of weeks, I had achieved what my ex used to call, \u201cWookie legs.\u201d To amplify the effect, I wore shorts. Then I wandered around the living room where he was crouched at the desk working on his laptop.\u201cHow is it going?\u201d I asked casually.\u201cI\u2019m almost done,\u201d he said without looking up.\u201cOh no, my T-shirt is stained!\u201d I said, pointing to an oil stain from a previous cooking experiment.\u201cThat\u2019s barely noticeable,\u201d he said.That stain wasn\u2019t the only thing he was barely noticing. \u201cDoes this bother you?\u201d I asked, pointing to my legs.\u201cDoes what bother me?\u201d\u201cHair on my legs.\u201d\u201cWhy should that bother anyone?\u201d He went back to fixing his code. Just like that, he made the obligatory nuisance of shaving in winter a thing of the past.To test his propensity for jealousy and insecurity, I left him alone most evenings to go out for dinner and movies with my friends. But he was fine with the solitude, and all it did was make me exhausted from so much socializing. Once I hit my 30s, my appetite for \u201changing out\u201d had declined significantly. All I wanted was to watch a documentary in my pajamas and go to bed early.For his part, he slept late every day, left coffee mugs on the night stand and set the thermostat to a balmy 75 degrees, all things his ex would have thrown a fit about. Yet I couldn\u2019t even pretend to get upset since they were things I normally do, too.He also let his goofy personality re-emerge, dropping the guard he had put up after mangling our first intimate encounter before our stress test began.The first time he came to my apartment, I was busy researching something on my desktop. He stood there looking restless.\u201cIs everything O.K.?\u201d I asked.\u201cWould you mind if I did something?\u201d he asked, looking me straight in the eye.I was nervous, thinking he wanted to kiss me. \u201cMaybe,\u201d I said.The tension was mounting. Then he walked up and continued past me to my desk. The next thing I knew, he was changing the power settings on my desktop and laptop so they would use less energy when idle.I burst out laughing, though I didn\u2019t immediately explain why. When he eventually learned that I had expected him to kiss me, he was so embarrassed it made him even more cautious about what he said and did around me.During our stress test, however, I knew he was back to his old self when instead of saying, \u201cI missed you!\u201d in some generic way, he would hug me and say things like, \u201cIt\u2019s too bad I can\u2019t hold you closer than what is physically possible, which is ironic because atoms are mostly empty space.\u201dThe geek in me truly appreciated this.After all of our test cases passed and the fourth week ended, we were left with one question: \u201cWhat now?\u201dHe said he wanted to move in with me permanently. Unable to counter him with any logical reason not to, I agreed. A few weeks later, he proposed, and we married 12 months later.In the two years since, our Venn diagram of mostly overlapping circles has remained intact.Jasmine Jaksic, who lives in Sunnyvale, Calif., is a program manager at Google.To contact Modern Love, email modernlove@nytimes.com.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Warren Buffett and Dan Gilbert Unite in Bid to Acquire Yahoo", "Date": "2016-05-15", "News": "Supported byYahoo appears to be making progress in efforts to sell itself, despite some initial skepticism.The latest piece of evidence: Among those vying for the company is the unusual combination of the investor Warren E. Buffett and Dan Gilbert, the founder of Quicken Loans and owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers.That consortium is one of several suitors that have moved into the second round of bidding for Yahoo, according to people briefed on the matter.Mr. Gilbert is leading the bid, said the people, who were not authorized to speak publicly. Mr. Buffett\u2019s conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway, is offering to provide financing, as he has done with the investment firm 3G Capital in its takeovers of H. J. Heinz and Kraft, and is leaving the negotiations to Mr. Gilbert, according to the people.The two are joined in the second round by a range of other bidders, including Verizon Communications and private equity firms such as TPG Capital and a group that comprises Bain Capital and Vista Equity Partners, people briefed on the process have previously said. Several other strategic bidders are also in the second round.Yahoo declined to comment. Representatives for Quicken Loans and Berkshire did not return requests for comment.The companies in the second round of bidding are seeking to buy one of the best-known names in Silicon Valley \u2014 though one that ceded a longtime hold on the Internet to younger rivals like Google and Facebook. Repeated efforts to reinvent itself, led by a string of chief executives, including the company\u2019s current leader, Marissa Mayer, have failed to take hold.As Yahoo and its bankers canvassed for preliminary bids, the company received criticism, including from some prospective bidders and from the activist hedge fund Starboard Value, over the state of the sales process.Yet Yahoo can point to progress. It settled a looming board fight with Starboard, offering the investment firm four director seats. One of those is held by Starboard\u2019s chief executive, Jeffrey Smith, who now sits on the special board committee overseeing the potential sale.Yahoo executives, including Ms. Mayer, and advisers have been sitting down with bidders in the second round, furnishing those suitors with additional details.Among them is Mr. Gilbert, who built his multibillion-dollar fortune with the financial empire. But he is also an active investor in his own right, having taken stakes in a number of online start-ups.Yahoo would be orders of magnitude larger than those other technology investments and significantly more troubled. But Mr. Gilbert\u2019s consortium, like other bidders, has been interested in the still-significant digital footprint that the company possesses, including its popular finance and sports sites.Backing him is his friend Mr. Buffett \u2014 who has long spoken of his aversion to technology companies, outside of an investment in IBM. But the role of Berkshire in the Gilbert bid would be financial, and Mr. Buffett\u2019s conglomerate would collect interest from its financing with the opportunity to convert those holdings into an equity stake in the company.And one of Berkshire\u2019s directors is Susan L. Decker, a former president of Yahoo.Providing advice to the Gilbert consortium are the former senior Yahoo executives Dan Rosensweig, who is now chief executive of the education company Chegg, and Tim Cadogan, now the head of the online advertising platform OpenX. Neither has expressed interest in rejoining Yahoo, one of the people briefed on the matter said.Mr. Buffett and Mr. Gilbert have another \u2014 albeit more troubled \u2014 tie to the Internet company. In 2014, Berkshire, Quicken Loans and Yahoo briefly united to offer a \u201cBillion Dollar Bracket Challenge\u201d tied to the NCAA basketball tournament that year, though the contest was called off and devolved into a morass of lawsuits.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2016-05-27", "News": "Symantec researchers said the evidence linked an attack at a bank in the Philippines last October with attacks on Tien Phong Bank in Vietnam in December and another in February that resulted in the theft of $81 million from the central bank of Bangladesh. The attacks raised alarm bells because the thieves gained access to Swift, which is considered the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most secure payment messaging system. It is used by 11,000 banks and companies to move money between countries, making it a tempting target. Swift itself had warned of a coordinated assault on banks, although it stressed that it was the banks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 connections to its networks, rather than the network itself, that were breached. Oracle contended that Google used copyrighted material in the software code for the Android mobile phone operating system. Oracle asked for $9 billion from Google. Google said it had made fair use of that code and owed nothing.  Software developers, who operate in the same way Google did when it comes to open-source software, cheered the victory. Open-source products are released, often with some restrictions, for anyone to use and modify. Dorian Daley, Oracle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s general counsel, said the company planned to appeal. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe strongly believe that Google developed Android by illegally copying core Java technology to rush into the mobile device market,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said in a statement. In its opinion, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago said that Epic Systems, a health care software provider in Verona, Wis., violated federal labor law when it required its workers to bring disputes individually to arbitration. The decision directly conflicts with an earlier decision by an appeals court in Louisiana and the split could prompt the Supreme Court to wade back into the fray. In a pair of decisions in 2011 and 2013, the Supreme Court blessed the use of arbitration in a case pushed by a group of credit card companies. The credit card companies turned to a 1925 federal law that formalized arbitration as a means for companies to hash out their disputes with one another.Courts across the country have largely upheld arbitration clauses, deferring to the Supreme Court, which ruled that the Federal Arbitration Act beat even federal laws.Mr. Denton assured Mr. Thiel that Gawker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s journalists would be reporting on his involvement in lawsuits against the company.  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Crowdfunding Rules Let the Small Fry Swim With Sharks", "Date": "2016-05-14", "News": "Supported byStarting Monday, new rules will permit anyone, not just the moneyed, to risk $2,000 a year or more investing in small companies in exchange for a stake in the business. Companies can raise up to $1 million a year this way.It is also an opportunity for start-ups and other small businesses, which can raise money with fairly few regulatory burdens. For instance, small companies seeking less than $500,000 and most first-time issuers will not need to provide audited financial statements, just unaudited ones.That was four years ago. It took a long time to iron out the details, in part because the Securities and Exchange Commission was concerned that ordinary people could lose their life savings because of fraud or na\u00efvet\u00e9.\u201cWhen high-growth companies are looking to raise money, it\u2019s not just for the money,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re also looking for validation, and they want it from venture funds or well-known angels. They won\u2019t get that from a crowdfunding offer.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re building a tribe of women around the world who are passionate about African textiles and want to support these emerging designers,\u201d Ms. Anyadiegwu said.Ms. Anyadiegwu wants to increase her part-time workers\u2019 hours, move her base of operations from Sayreville, N.J., to Atlanta, where she has built a clientele, and do more marketing. To finance that, she\u2019s willing to part with some of her equity in the business.\u201cOur customer base is so engaged,\u201d she said. \u201cThis could be a perfect opportunity for them to participate and be a part of the company in another way.\u201d\u201cWe can build a community around our company. That\u2019s an intangible that you don\u2019t get from private fund-raising,\u201d said Kyle Henson, 23, the company\u2019s chief business officer. He is preparing Rorus to comply with the new securities rules, he said, if it chooses to do a crowdfunding offering.But are the 230 million adult Americans who aren\u2019t millionaires really that interested in becoming do-it-yourself venture capitalists? While supporters cheer the new rules as a democratization of high finance, potentially opening up to the masses deals once reserved for the rich, skeptics worry that regular investors might get only the leftovers.They may dream of discovering the next Facebook. But the most promising companies \u2014 the high-growth ventures delivering the monster returns that keep the entire venture-capital industry afloat \u2014 may also be the ones least likely to bother raising money in small dribs from the crowd, they fear.But what got people excited was the crowdfunding provision allowing companies to raise up to $1 million with few regulatory obstacles.The company caught Mr. Hensch\u2019s eye nearly two years ago, after it raised $1.1 million on Kickstarter. He scoured tech blogs for tidbits, signed up for the company\u2019s newsletter and followed along as executives posted updates from China about their production process.So when Virtuix announced in March that it would crowdfund its next investment round, Mr. Hensch and Ms. Roumagoux jumped in. \u201cI\u2019ve seen where Robert\u2019s recommendations have gone in the market. Typically, when he identifies something early on, it becomes a blockbuster item,\u201d said Ms. Roumagoux, recalling her husband\u2019s early enthusiasm for Tesla, Netflix and a \u201creally neat\u201d search engine called Google.Ms. Roumagoux works as a lawyer, and Mr. Hensch is a real estate business manager. As financiers, \u201cwe\u2019re definitely novices,\u201d she said with a laugh, but both like the idea of diversifying their retirement fund and other investments by gambling on a small portfolio of fledgling technology ventures.Jan Goetgeluk, Virtuix\u2019s founder and chief executive, likes the idea of having hundreds or thousands of stakeholders along for the ride. \u201cThis allows us to turn those fans into true brand advocates. It\u2019s incredibly powerful.\u201dMr. Goetgeluk, a 32-year-old mechanical engineer, had dreamed of becoming an entrepreneur since moving to the United States from Belgium nine years ago. The money he raised from 3,000 backers on Kickstarter funded Virtuix\u2019s early production, and the publicity the campaign created got him a spot pitching his company to a panel of rich investors on \u201cShark Tank\u201d \u2014 where he failed to land a deal.\u201cIf my husband brought this into my house, I would divorce him immediately,\u201d Barbara Corcoran, a real estate entrepreneur, announced on the show.The rules that take effect on Monday make crowdfunding far cheaper and easier for companies to use. But the cost of that concession is a $1 million cap on the amount they can raise in a 12-month period.\u201cWe had no idea that it would take the S.E.C. four years to write all these rules,\u201d Mr. Tommarello said. \u201cWe had to figure out how to stay alive and not go bankrupt.\u201dStill, this isn\u2019t like investing in the stock market. Want to sell Facebook? Just call your broker. Want to sell your shares in Ms. Anyadiegwu\u2019s company, Zuvaa? Well, under the new crowdfunding rules, people must generally hold their shares for at least a year. And even then, there are few marketplaces for finding another buyer.But Ms. Roumagoux, who said she had skimmed the circular, isn\u2019t worried. She and her husband may not be millionaires, but she says they\u2019re financially sophisticated enough to judge the risk that they\u2019re taking.\u201cI know all these rules are there to protect us, but honestly, I don\u2019t think we need the protection,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re relatively young, and this is a long-term investment.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Trump were waiting across North Washington Street, some holding signs. \u00e2\u0080\u009cVote Trump!\u00e2\u0080\u009d one shouted.\u00e2\u0080\u009cSay something really funny!\u00e2\u0080\u009d a Cruz supporter replied.\u00e2\u0080\u009cTed Cruz is going to win!\u00e2\u0080\u009d a Trump fan in dark sunglasses shot back.Then Mr. Cruz did something unusual: He crossed the street.With a phalanx of aides and reporters trailing him, Mr. Cruz approached his critics with a question.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you like about Donald Trump?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.\u00e2\u0080\u009cEverything,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the man in the sunglasses, who later refused to give his name.When the protester mentioned the Second Amendment, Mr. Cruz said he had defended gun rights in front of the Supreme Court.

{"Headline": "Short-Track Racing, Motorsports\u2019 Riskiest Corner", "Date": "2016-05-21", "News": "Supported byOCALA, Fla. \u2014 Niokoa Johnson was 15, too young for a driver\u2019s license but somehow old enough to race, when she landed a spot in her first auto racing competition.For days, Niokoa practiced on the back roads of Central Florida. On the afternoon of the race, she arrived early to circle the pits of Bubba Raceway Park, a dirt track built among horse fields.On her second practice lap, Niokoa lost control and slammed into a concrete wall, breaking her neck. She was not wearing a head-and-neck restraint, a device required in Nascar but not on most short tracks like this, a lower rung of the racing world.After a day on life support, she died.\u201cIt was the worst day of my life,\u201d said her father, Richard Johnson, who rushed from the stands to pull her from the car. \u201cIf she had the head-and-neck device or something similar, it likely wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201dIn the vast and unregulated world of short-track racing, Niokoa\u2019s death was not an isolated event. Since 2002, when Nascar made head-and-neck restraints mandatory, at least 141 people have died on short tracks, and dozens of others have sustained major injuries, making this the most dangerous corner of American motorsports. Those figures \u2014 based on police reports and news media accounts \u2014 surpass previous estimates and highlight the consequences of lax rules and scant safety protections.Short-track racing, born in rural America in the 1930s, is a catchall phrase that refers to myriad competitions on dirt or asphalt ovals, from mile-long speedways fit for Nascar to smaller tracks that could fit in a yard. The vehicles vary, too, from a windowless school bus to $100,000 cars that can reach 160 miles per hour.The sport now comprises about 900 tracks throughout the country, populated with drivers of varying ages and ambitions. Some hope to ascend to the sport\u2019s higher circuits, while others are hobbyists simply taking their souped-up cars or trucks for an adrenaline-fueled spin.Many short tracks struggle to attract fans and drivers every week, and track owners say they do not have the financial means to enact rigorous safety protocols.\u201cOwners are not pushing safety because people won\u2019t show up,\u201d Richard Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to change unless more tragedy or state mandate happens.\u201dBubba Raceway Park, where Niokoa Johnson died, has no ambulance on site and one paramedic, who is not certified in lifesaving techniques. Other track owners, many of whom face little or no legal liability for a crash, have stopped providing professional safety personnel altogether.At the highest echelon of racing in the United States, Dale Earnhardt\u2019s death in 2001 set off a cascade of safety improvements in Nascar, which has not recorded a death since. But few of those measures have trickled down to short-track racing.Whereas Nascar imposes a battery of safety restrictions \u2014 laying out its rules in a 172-page text \u2014 the safety measures for short tracks amount to a patchwork of lenient rules and mere suggestions. Protocols vary state by state, even track by track.There is no national governing body or overarching league, like Nascar or the N.F.L. Only one state regulates short-track racing, and local officials generally focus more on policing noise and pollution than safety.\u201cWe want to leave it in the private sector\u2019s hand and make it a driver\u2019s decision,\u201d said Earl Arnett, the Marion County commissioner, who represents the area encompassing Bubba Raceway Park.The few safety rules that do exist are routinely ignored. Drivers commonly race without fireproof gloves, fire extinguishers are often not present in cars, and fans stand in restricted areas.Many drivers said they wanted to keep it that way. While Earnhardt\u2019s death prompted a sweeping safety overhaul in Nascar \u2014 and drivers embraced the change by wearing head-and-neck restraints \u2014 most short-track racers resist safety changes.Bubba Clem, the owner of the track where Niokoa died, said he had bolstered safety requirements in the wake of her crash. He also paid for her funeral.Clem, a radio personality known as Bubba the Love Sponge, said he now required minors to wear head-and-neck restraints. Still, he acknowledged that safety standards varied.\u201cMost tracks are pretty good, but some tracks could have better lighting and a better warning system,\u201d Clem said. \u201cAn average track owner on a Saturday night does the best he can.\u201dStill, when deaths occur, the owners face little accountability.Insurance payouts are small, usually between $5,000 and $10,000. And successful lawsuits are rare, because of a single piece of paper that shields owners from liability.Anyone who enters a pit area is required to sign a document protecting the track from legal action. Even when tracks are negligent \u2014 like allowing a fence to collapse or failing to extinguish a fire \u2014 these liability waivers allow the owners to escape accountability, according to court records and copies of the waivers.Most deaths on short tracks receive little or no media attention. One notable exception occurred in 2014 when the Nascar driver Tony Stewart struck and killed a 20-year-old driver, Kevin Ward Jr., in upstate New York. Stewart was cleared of criminal wrongdoing but faces a civil suit from Ward\u2019s family.\u201cTwenty-five percent of tracks get it right; 70 percent take the money and hope you leave alive,\u201d said the former Nascar driver Randy LaJoie, who now manufactures safety equipment.In the one-stoplight town of Bronson, Fla., among rotting palm trees and a mud bog, the dangers of short-track racing were on vivid display during a New Year\u2019s Eve race.Scott McAllister, a first-time racer at Bronson Speedway, did not have a head-and-neck device or a fire extinguisher inside his car, though they are required, according to the track\u2019s rule book. The prerace inspector asked for McAllister\u2019s name and sponsor but did not look inside his car.\u201cThey let the rules slide here,\u201d McAllister said.With fans and drivers at a premium, many tracks like Bronson Speedway throughout the country tend to overlook their own rules.Ann Young, a native New Yorker, bought the Bronson track with her husband as a retirement present after searching \u201crace tracks for sale\u201d on Google. Five years later, she said, she has yet to make a profit.\u201cThe racecar business right now is a dying sport,\u201d Young said. \u201cIt has peaked.\u201dAs a sport set primarily in rural communities, short-track racing has felt the aftereffect of the recession in a painful way. Track owners struggle to attract paying fans and drivers who can afford the racecars.\u201cThe owners need cars, and they need drivers, so they turn a blind eye toward safety to have a show,\u201d said Chris Frost, a 40-year-old driver from Alabama.The Bronson track in Florida was the site of a fatal accident in 2014, when Buddy Howell, a track worker, was hit by a pickup truck in the infield while working as a flagman. Howell was killed during a spectator race, in which fans take their own cars onto the track. Bronson\u2019s infield does not have a fence, and Howell had defied track rules by going into the infield.\u201cThat was because of his judgment and not following safety,\u201d Young said of the fatality.During a recent practice at Bronson, cars reached full speed around the track with no ambulance or safety crews present. Just as racing began, an ambulance pulled into the track but left a few minutes later when a track official fell ill. It never returned.McAllister said he was not worried about the absence of an ambulance. He recently bought a car from a friend and was bullish about his chances that evening. His white Camaro had never raced on asphalt before.After a lackluster race, and hitting the wall, McAllister was all smiles while smoking a cigarette in the pits.\u201cI had a third-place car but a seventh-place driver out there,\u201d he said.There is at least one corner of the short-track racing world that adheres to a strict rule book: a circuit called the World of Outlaws, a group of short-track drivers who tour the country.World of Outlaws drivers are required to wear head-and-neck restraints and must use a racing seat with a halo-shaped headrest that prevents the neck from moving sideways during crashes.There has not been a fatality in a World of Outlaws race since 1999.Tyler Clem competes at the highest level of Florida dirt-track racing. He drives a late-model stock car modified to race on dirt. And just last year, he won the championship at the track where Niokoa Johnson had her fatal accident.Tyler is 13 years old.Tyler, whose father is Bubba Clem, is one of the many young drivers who compete every weekend at short tracks across the country. Some stick to races designed for children, like go-karts and mini racecars, while others race in full-bodied cars alongside middle-age veterans.Bubba Clem is able to fund his son\u2019s racing dream \u2014 and protect his safety \u2014 better than many parents. Tyler races with a head-and-neck restraint, containment seat and firesuit.\u201cHe\u2019d feel naked without his head-and-neck system,\u201d Clem said. \u201cIt would be remiss for anybody to put their kid in a car that didn\u2019t have that. I would scrimp on my motor before safety.\u201dTeenage racers are a microcosm of the short-track racing landscape, an unregulated universe where safety stems from money.Some, like Tyler Clem, are flush with cash, sponsors and safety equipment. Others are just scraping by.\u201cIt\u2019s expensive, but not an opportunity to be a rich little brat,\u201d Clem said.The young racers do not need licenses to compete on short tracks. In some cases, tracks require young racers to submit a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of their driving experience. Others allow anyone with a car to join the race.A few recent deaths raise questions about that approach. In addition to Niokoa, Tyler Morr, 12, was killed in 2012 during a race in Winter Haven, Fla., and Amanda Gambacorto, 21, died in 2014 after hitting the wall during a training session for new drivers in Wall Township, N.J.Jordan Fowler, 13, was a first-time racer at Bronson Speedway in Florida. He had experience on dirt tracks near his Jacksonville home, but his father had to call Bronson to get permission for Jordan to race on asphalt for the first time.\u201cI\u2019m intimidated because everyone is bigger than me, but I realized it was all the same once I got out on the track,\u201d Jordan said.Jordan made the trip to Bronson in a dilapidated Honda Civic. Despite the Civic\u2019s mangled body and Jordan\u2019s lack of experience on asphalt, he finished fifth. He did not wear a head-and-neck device or a containment seat.John Westbrook was not the first driver to flip his car at Williams Grove Speedway in Mechanicsburg, Pa. But he was the one to suffer some of the greatest consequences, becoming a quadriplegic after his sprint car tumbled over the guardrail and down a 16-foot embankment in September 2008.Westbrook sued Williams Grove for negligence, arguing that the track lacked a catch fence that would have prevented his car from flipping out of the racetrack.Six years later, a jury found that Williams Grove was not liable because Westbrook had signed a liability waiver, and Westbrook received no damages.\u201cUnfortunately, if someone is hurt in the future, no matter how negligent the track is, if the release is signed, they are good,\u201d Westbrook said. \u201cIf I was a track owner, I\u2019d be feeling pretty good right now.\u201dWhen anyone enters a pit area at a short track, he or she must sign a liability waiver. This contract protects racetracks from lawsuits, but the agreements go beyond absolving the track for accidents out of their control or honest mistakes.According to multiple waivers reviewed by The New York Times, track owners are released from \u201cany loss, liability, damage or cost they may incur arising out of or related to the undersigned\u2019s injury or death whether caused by the negligence of the releases or otherwise.\u201dThat piece of paper, plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers and safety experts said, enables track owners to resist a safety overhaul.\u201cThere\u2019s zero regulation of tracks \u2014 that\u2019s because of the waivers,\u201d said Westbrook\u2019s lawyer, David Inscho.Insurance companies perform spot checks at racetracks to ensure that fans who are not in the pits have a reasonable expectation of safety. This includes inspecting grandstands and fences.\u201cIf they didn\u2019t have a catch fence, we would deny coverage,\u201d said Tony Huth, a senior accident underwriter at K & K Insurance.Insurance underwriters point out hazards facing fans who don\u2019t sign waivers, like dilapidated bleachers and dirty concession stands, to track owners before issuing policies, but they rarely require head-and-neck devices, according to interviews with track owners and insurance adjusters.\u201cThe insurance company manuals are geared toward spectators,\u201d Inscho said, adding that he did not believe insurers were concerned with the drivers.Most crashes involved drivers, but fans and track workers have died, too. A 12-year-old spectator from Brookland, Ark., died last year when an out-of-control racecar struck him down in the area where cars enter the track. A 49-year-old track worker from Sarasota, Fla., died in 2014 after a skidding pickup truck slammed into him.Ross Curtner, 12, was at a race last fall at Crowley\u2019s Ridge Speedway in Paragould, Ark., when a car on the track lost control and hit him, killing him instantly. He had been standing on top of a wall in the staging area where cars enter the track.Eleven days before the accident, the track owner Trent Francis posted on Facebook saying, \u201cI need to install more fencing to make it safer for spectators, that\u2019s supposed to be the staging area.\u201dThe waiver agreements make no mention of the track\u2019s insurance policy, leaving drivers, crew and fans in the dark about how much the track will pay in the event of an injury or death.Families of drivers who die in short-track accidents receive only a few thousand dollars on average, according to track owners. \u201cMost tracks don\u2019t pay out more than $5,000,\u201d said Young, the Bronson Speedway owner.Drivers who sustain injuries are not fully covered by the track\u2019s insurance.Bobby Arnold, a Georgia driver who had to crawl out of his burning racecar last summer after an accident, didn\u2019t have health insurance. The track paid a lump sum, and Arnold was on his own for the rest of his medical expenses, which totaled around $140,000, he said.\u201cThey covered some of it; I wouldn\u2019t say most,\u201d Arnold said.Some short tracks operate without insurance at all.Thunderdome Speedway in Jasper, Ala., will not open for the 2016 season because its owner, Kenny Hogan, is short on cash. The track has not had insurance for years.Lawyers \u201ccould try to sue me, but what are you going to get out of a guy who is $250,000 in debt?\u201d Hogan said. \u201cI would never sue anybody if I got hurt at a racetrack.\u201dHogan said he made it clear to drivers and spectators that his track was not insured, which does not violate state law. He also posts signs to warn everyone on the premises that they assume their own risk.\u201cWhen you show up to a track and have a damn phone book full of rules, I don\u2019t want to race there,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cWhen you get lawyers and insurance companies involved, you\u2019ll kill racing. Don\u2019t kill each other and use common sense.\u201dRichard Johnson chose not to sue Bubba Raceway Park even though track officials failed to check his daughter\u2019s car before the race, he said. But he believes that it wouldn\u2019t have made a difference because his daughter didn\u2019t have a head-and-neck device.According to a Marion County Sheriff\u2019s report, Niokoa Johnson broke her neck and sustained head injuries while traveling just under 40 miles per hour. Richard Johnson and two other men jumped on the hood of the car to pull the steering wheel and create enough room for Niokoa to be removed by medical personnel.\u201cIt was just a tragic accident; that\u2019s all I can really say,\u201d Bubba Clem said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "3 Airfare Hacks for the Committed Penny-Pincher", "Date": "2016-05-25", "News": "Supported byFrugal TravelerThere\u2019s so much advice today on how to find rock-bottom airfares that it can be difficult to filter out the noise. Here are three flight-booking tips, though, that I can almost guarantee you weren\u2019t aware of. They\u2019re outlier tips \u2014 meaning they\u2019ll require a bit of time and energy (and, in one case, flexibility) to employ \u2014 but when used properly, they\u2019ll almost definitely save you a big chunk of money.United Airlines has the most generous and flexible policy on round-trip, international award tickets (flights booked with miles), allowing for a stopover and two open jaws (flying into one airport and out of another). This allows for many possibilities if you\u2019re looking to visit more places than a regular round-trip ticket would entail \u2014 including a way to essentially travel free one-way, anywhere in the United States.Let\u2019s say you\u2019re flying from New York to Berlin this fall: A round-trip ticket on United will cost 60,000 miles plus taxes and fees. But what if you\u2019d like to spend a little time in London, too? You can book a round-trip flight to Berlin with a three-day stopover in London built into the ticket. That will still cost 60,000 miles, even with the stopover.Now let\u2019s say you make that same trip from New York to Berlin, but instead of returning on the same route, you book an open jaw so you can return from Prague to New York. The cost to you is the same: 60,000 miles. In this scenario, you\u2019re responsible for getting from Berlin to Prague on your own.An even better way to take advantage is to use both of the permitted open jaws. Instead of flying from New York to Berlin and open-jawing from Prague back home, you can also open-jaw at your destination. If you\u2019ve been meaning to visit your mother in Chicago (hi, Mom!), you can fly to Berlin, then from Prague to Chicago on the return for the same 60,000 miles. You pay to get back to New York.You can get even more creative by combining the stopover and open jaws. Remember that initial sojourn in London? The above itinerary with two open jaws \u2014 New York to Berlin, and Prague to Chicago \u2014 can have a stopover in London built into it for, that\u2019s right, the exact same number of miles.Here\u2019s where things get fun: You can manipulate these rules to essentially wrangle a free one-way ticket anywhere in the United States. Let\u2019s take our original itinerary, New York to Berlin. You can still use one of your open jaws and return to New York from Prague. (We\u2019ll have to forgo the stop in London \u2014 we\u2019re using our stopover stateside.) Now, use New York as your stopover, and resume your trip anywhere in the country (using the second open jaw) at any point in the coming year. You read that right: Even if you\u2019ve lived in New York City your entire life, you can treat it as your stopover, and resume that trip anytime, anywhere in the United States, for up to a year later.Let\u2019s say you know you want to go to Alaska next spring: Fly New York to Berlin, Prague back to New York, and then New York to Anchorage in, let\u2019s say, April 2017. The cost will be \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 60,000 miles. You can spend a few more miles and go somewhere like Honolulu or Canc\u00fan. That will run you slightly more \u2014 65,000 miles \u2014 but it\u2019s still a great bargain to fly to Hawaii or Mexico for only 5,000 extra miles.You may not speak a foreign language, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t use the local version of an airline\u2019s website to get a discount. Savings can be substantial if you purchase a ticket in local currency, as opposed to U.S. dollars. Looking on the American portal for Norwegian Air Shuttle, the low-cost European carrier (norwegian.com/us), I found a round-trip ticket from Kennedy Airport in New York to Oslo for $688.30 \u2014 a decent price.I then looked on the website for Norway-based passengers (norwegian.no) and searched for the same flight. It takes some work \u2014 there are lots of o\u2019s with slashes through them, and you\u2019ll need to know that \u201chvor vil du dra\u201d means roughly \u201cdestination,\u201d but I found it simple enough to negotiate. (Tip: Keep two browser tabs open, the Norwegian and English versions. Then you can compare if you get stuck. Google translate, for whatever reason, works on the initial landing page then stops working once you\u2019re actually booking.)I found the exact flight for 4,394 Norwegian kroner, about $538. That\u2019s a substantial difference \u2014 $160, or 23 percent. You\u2019ll need to create an account, which I recommend you do on the United States site first. Also, use a credit card that doesn\u2019t have a foreign transaction fee \u2014 you don\u2019t want that eating into your savings.The conventional wisdom is to book tickets well in advance \u2014 preferably at least two weeks, otherwise you\u2019ll pay many times what you ordinarily would. This is no longer the case: Priceline.com now gives steep discounts on next-day \u2014 and even same-day \u2014 flights within the United States. (This is available for some international routes, too, but I\u2019ve found the savings aren\u2019t as consistent.)This, of course, requires flexibility. You\u2019re always rolling the dice with Priceline: You won\u2019t know exactly when you leave, or the airline you\u2019re flying, until you commit to buy. But you do get some information: You\u2019re guaranteed a nonstop or one layover and you typically get a window for arrival and departure times. You\u2019ll also receive a warning (a little moon-and-stars icon) if your flight could be a redeye.As I\u2019m writing this, the lowest published next-day, round-trip ticket from Boston to Los Angeles costs a little over $500. By booking a Priceline deal, you can buy that trip for less than $360. Next-day from Seattle to Dallas is currently $428, round-trip. On Priceline it\u2019s $285, and you\u2019re guaranteed a departure between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., maximum one layover.Booking same-day can yield even greater savings and, ironically, greater control over when you leave. The current lowest published price for a same-day New York to Los Angeles trip is nearly $900. On Priceline it\u2019s $428, saving you over 50 percent. Best of all, depending on what time of day you book, you can more closely deduce your flight times. If you book your same-day ticket in the early afternoon, you will get only flights that depart after you book. Be ready to get going to the airport immediately, however. (Good luck with the T.S.A.!)I\u2019ve booked Los Angeles to New York tickets on two occasions, same-day, and paid around $350, saving hundreds of dollars. In both instances, I\u2019ve gotten nonstop flights on Delta. Booking at the last second isn\u2019t optimal, and this is by no means a recommendation of the practice \u2014 I\u2019m simply pointing out that, if something last-minute comes up, you\u2019re not doomed to pay exorbitant prices. In fact, you may actually end up paying less than if you had booked ahead.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook and the Problem With News Online", "Date": "2016-05-13", "News": "Supported byBitsWould you enjoy reading this more if it were written by a machine? Spoiler alert: It\u2019s not. But whether created by human or computer, what do we want from news?Basically, Facebook said it used a base of computers putting possible stories from various places in front of human editors, who direct how these will be presented and displayed. Facebook said that it had a system of \u201cchecks and balances\u201d that made sure a number of viewpoints were examined, and that it did not allow editors to \u201cdiscriminate against sources of any political origin, period.\u201dIt\u2019s unclear whether the people who think Facebook did wrong will be appeased. All too often, where modern media is concerned, the general public assumes there is bias of one form or another. And Facebook did not seem to have sufficient details about how it made sure a human didn\u2019t carry out a grudge by omitting one story or another.There is a deeper issue at play as well, which has to do with the reasons Facebook is putting up the stories in the first place.Like Google, Facebook makes money by putting up ads concerning things its computers think you are interested in. And like Google, the content (search results or friend\u2019s updates, depending on the company) that goes with the ads is chosen based on previous behavior.There are several reasons for this, including giving you pleasure and not stressing or boring you with dissonance.That is problematic where news is concerned, at least if the reader is seeking an objective viewpoint: Since new information can force us to change our minds, we have to want, on some level, to be stressed if we\u2019re looking to be fully informed. In a slower-moving world, this was known as changing your mind.Is that what people want from news in a click-paced online world, though? The rise and success of specialty news outlets, which largely confirm their readers\u2019 points of view, indicate that many people want to hear about the world, but through filters that affirm how they already feel about things.Arguably, it was ever thus, and the right or the left had their own journals that people read. But the use of computer algorithms that know what you like stand to make it much more so.Facebook may struggle to take news from a lot more points of view, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to put them in front of you.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inglewood, Calif., Pins Hopes for Commercial Revival on N.F.L.\u2019s Rams", "Date": "2016-05-17", "News": "Supported bySquare Feet7 PhotosINGLEWOOD, Calif. \u2014 At Posh Klipz, the barber and owner Sonny Wells points to a framed photograph of Magic Johnson, sitting for a haircut in his shop two decades ago. \u201cThat was my best client,\u201d Mr. Wells says.Eventually, Mr. Johnson, a longtime Los Angeles Laker, stopped frequenting Posh Klipz, going for the shaved look instead. Chairs really emptied at the barbershop, though, in 1999 after the Lakers and the National Hockey League team the Kings left the Forum here, Mr. Wells said, and moved to the Staples Center in Downtown Los Angeles, about a half-hour\u2019s drive northeast.The development will include about 900,000 square feet of retail space, a hotel, 2,500 residential units and 25 acres of public parks, all on the site of the former Hollywood Park Racetrack. Plans include almost 800,000 square feet of office space.\u201cThis development adds a dimension to the city that it has never had before,\u201d said Inglewood\u2019s mayor, James T. Butts Jr.Inglewood, a city of 110,000, is just 10 miles from downtown Los Angeles and a short drive from its upscale western environs like Beverly Hills. \u201cInglewood is strategically located in the L.A. basin,\u201d said Bob Healey, a senior vice president at the commercial real estate firm CBRE who specializes in the South Bay area of Los Angeles. Mr. Healey added that commercial values in the areas surrounding the stadium site had already risen.The city has a predominantly black, lower-income community with pockets of middle-class residents and a growing Hispanic population, said Jamie Brooks, a CBRE executive.\u201cThe stadium reinforces the idea that this is going to be a destination,\u201d Mr. Brooks said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a master developer to figure it out: This place has a lot of potential.\u201dIn 2005, Stockbridge Capital Group, a real estate investment management firm, acquired the 238-acre Hollywood Park site, across the street from the Forum and a premier place for horse racing in its day. The firm aimed to build the entertainment complex, which will include a 6,000-seat performing arts theater.The Kroenke Group, a development firm founded by Mr. Kroenke, in 2013 bought a 60-acre parcel adjacent to Hollywood Park and the Forum, which reopened in 2014 and hosts many concerts. The groups formed a joint venture the next year, the Hollywood Park Land Company, to develop Hollywood Park and the newly acquired site.\u201cOur deal involved no financial contribution from the city,\u201d said Mr. Butts, who supported the project. \u201cEverything public and private is financed by the developer.\u201dOnly in a year when the city derives more than $25 million in direct tax revenue from the project is it responsible for any financial reimbursement of the cost of public infrastructure, Mr. Butts said.Now, just as values have increased in markets affected by Los Angeles International Airport, Inglewood expects to see the same.\u201cSince Jan. 12 when the announcement was made, if a Realtor puts a sign on a property in the morning, by the time they get back to the office in the afternoon, they usually have five to six offers, $10,000 to $20,000 over asking price,\u201d Mr. Butts said.\u201cN.F.L. stadiums are used little more than 10 times a year,\u201d Mr. Tomer said. \u201cAnd as we\u2019ve supersized our sports facilities, much like other components of American life, it has become difficult to integrate them into the fabric of our cities.\u201dBut in the case of the Inglewood stadium, he added, \u201cTypical rules may not apply.\u201dOne reason is that the stadium is not directly supported by taxpayers. And Inglewood is close to Los Angeles International Airport and will be accessible by light rail after a Metro stop is completed in 2019.While a professional football stadium might not be the reason people and businesses choose Inglewood, Mr. Tomer said, it encourages them to consider it.\u201cThis is the kind of pattern we see in highly successful regional economies like L.A., San Francisco, New York,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s like your Brooklyn. Inglewood could be on that list, but it\u2019s going to be because of access to other amenities and jobs in the regional district.\u201dInglewood businesses hope to claim some of the influx from the project. Linda Credit, 61, opened up the Rusty Pot Caf\u00e9 on South Market Street two years ago. The restaurant, one of the few lively storefronts on the street, serves the kind of kale salads and specialty aiolis more often found in nearby Santa Monica.\u201cI was thinking about moving,\u201d Ms. Credit said. But the council members who stopped in for lunch urged her to stay before the N.F.L. announcement. \u201cIt\u2019s changing, and that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d she said.Mayor Butts said, \u201cI really do believe that within five years you won\u2019t be able to recognize the new Inglewood.\u201dAmelia Hernandez, 32, runs Selwyn Jewelers, a family business a few blocks from the Rusty Pot Caf\u00e9 on South Market Street. While she expressed concerned about how to keep a mom-and-pop business competitive as bigger enterprises come in, she predicted the development would help the area. \u201cBuy in Inglewood,\u201d she said. \u201cDo not sell.\u201dLast month, Keion Morgan, 37, was in Posh Klipz barbershop in preparation for a job interview as a college recruiter. He grew up in Inglewood and hopes it will have more options as his two young sons mature, he said.\u201cI\u2019m blessed to \u2014 I guess you say \u2014 make it out of the \u2019hood, or the \u2019wood,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of opportunity.\u201dMr. Wells, the barber, said he wanted to secure a long-term lease because he expected rents to rise. But over all, his outlook was positive.\u201cClients are excited. We\u2019re excited,\u201d said Mr. Wells, who has been in the city 22 years. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to get some of those N.F.L. players in that chair.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on the Square Foot page on Wednesday about a revival of Inglewood, Calif., underpinned by a new stadium and a new National Football League team, referred incorrectly to the founding of the Kroenke Group, a development firm involved in that revival. It was founded in the 1980s \u2014 not in 2013, which was the year that the firm bought a parcel of land next to Hollywood Park and the Forum in Inglewood.Advertisement"}

The case was supercomplicated but many programmers worried that a win for Oracle would cast a shadow over the legality of using open-source code, which is at the center of a lot of the technology that modern computing relies on. A jury sided with Google.Do you understand any of this? I\u2019m guessing no. The upshot for you is, thanks to this win, your phone won\u2019t get superexpensive and will probably still keep getting better. And that\u2019s probably pretty much all you care about.Let\u2019s talk about the big news of the week, or month, in tech and media land: #Thielgate.The story is sort of unbelievable, in and of itself, but also hits a sweet spot within all the crazy things that editors love: tech, billionaires, tech billionaires and, of course, media.The basic argument of those on the tech side was that Gawker was singularly bad. They said that Gawker abused its journalistic platform, it routinely invaded people\u2019s private lives, including outing their sexual orientation, and in other ways made life very difficult for wealthy coastal techies.I\u2019ve certainly not been a fan of everything Gawker has done. But I\u2019m struck by the inability of techies to consider both the proportionality of this punishment and the chilling effects this case could induce on the media generally. First, to me, it doesn\u2019t make sense that a small excerpt from a sex tape should result in a company-ending decision. And I don\u2019t see how techies could support that.All of these examples are potentially far more damaging to the world than a leaked sex tape. But none of these companies were fined anywhere near hundreds of millions of dollars for their recklessness. Do tech venture capitalists really want to support a system in which moving fast and breaking things results in company-ending lawsuits?I\u2019m not sure I quite believe that. But it\u2019s fair to say that Gawker had its day in court \u2014 with a lot of caveats over jurisdiction and judge and jury, Gawker supporters would say \u2014 and that the company lost the case. This should be a deterrent to \u201cbad\u201d journalism.That\u2019s a rosy view, but again, I don\u2019t quite buy it wholesale. Do I agree with every story Gawker chooses to publish? No. Do I think they do good journalism? Absolutely. Do I think people with money will use a tactic such as Thiel\u2019s for only its \u201cproper\u201d and intended purpose of eliminating the wrong in the world? No way, Jos\u00e9.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Jane Doe January\u2019 and \u2018I Will Find You\u2019", "Date": "2016-05-24", "News": "Supported byNonfictionLike a common virus, the experience of rape invades not only the body but the mind of its victims, and it can do so in startlingly similar ways. Dissociation kicks in, mercifully and efficiently, almost like a response of the immune system, as well as a twisted, desperate desire on the part of the victim to please the rapist, in the desperate hope of a quicker conclusion, a better chance for survival. And yet, while these reactions appear to be almost universal, their emotional wake is intensely personal, possessing \u2014 at times obsessing \u2014 each individual in a unique way. Consider, for example, these two memoirs, which explore the 20-year aftermath of being raped by a stranger.\u201cJane Doe January,\u201d by the crime novelist Emily Winslow, chronicles in relentless detail the drama of the justice system\u2019s attempt to indict her rapist after matching DNA evidence is finally secured. Her story reveals a stark, maddening \u00adreality: that rape victims must often become their own legal advocates if they want an \u00adopportunity for retribution. In Winslow\u2019s case, this required more than 20 years of persistent inquiry before the scattered legal and forensic components of her 1992 rape coalesced into something the police and prosecutors were able to pursue.During her junior year at Carnegie Mellon University, Winslow was sexually assaulted by a man who followed her into her apartment building. Less than a year later, a man raped another young woman in the same Pittsburgh neighborhood; thus the two victims became Jane Doe January and Jane Doe November. In the decades that followed, Winslow would encounter a revolving door of detectives, reacquainting them with her case, keeping it alive mostly through her own persistence. By pure luck, a friend of the second victim reached an aggressive detective, who was able to match the DNA sample in the women\u2019s evidence kits to a man named Arthur Fryar.Fryar had also been convicted of rape in the 1970s, but it was a 2002 drug conviction that put his DNA into the system. By the time Winslow learns this, she is living in Cambridge, England, now happily married and the mother of two sons. As she assembles a detailed composite of the rapist\u2019s legal profile, she returns again and again to the same official documents. Yet she is wary of researching Fryar\u2019s personal life, content with surface-skimming Google searches and speculation drawn from the Facebook pages of his sister and his supposed girlfriend.Surprisingly, given Winslow\u2019s career writing crime fiction, there\u2019s nothing novelistic about the way this memoir unfolds. The detectives and prosecutors who emerge as significant supporting characters are given scant descriptions. Settings are all but invisible. Instead, the focus is on the finer points of law enforcement procedure, with every excruciating moment of the process painstakingly recounted. While much of this is bureaucratic, even tedious, Winslow attempts to inject drama with explosive bits of dialogue and many short, declarative stand-alone sentences, a device repeated to diminishing effect.Eventually, the judicial bureaucracy begins to seem almost as destructive as the rapist. Winslow must confront issues like extradition, statutory limits and sentencing guidelines. She must endure lab tests and postponements of the legal proceedings. During all this, she must go through the motions of her daily life in England. She fixates on what she should wear at the trial, how tightly she should try to harness her emotions, how she might be judged as a victim: \u201cBeing angry was appropriate. A jury, though, or a more formal judge, is more likely to reward sadness in a victim and disapprove of anger.\u201dWinslow channels her rage into this meticulously constructed and ultimately terrifying memoir. In the end, writing it proves a necessary release since the proceedings hit a roadblock: A Supreme Court decision overrides the Pennsylvania law on extending the statute of limitations, and the rape charges are withdrawn. Arthur Fryar is a free man.In \u201cI Will Find You,\u201d Joanna Connors, a reporter for The Cleveland Plain Dealer with a college-age daughter, embarks on a quest to understand the man who raped her two decades earlier, a crime she had never discussed with her children. Using her journalistic skills, she sets out to investigate the world that produced a man capable of such an act. The result is a searing narrative that plumbs both emotional and political depths.Like Winslow, Joanna Connors is a white woman raped by a black man, but this fact, largely ignored in Winslow\u2019s memoir, becomes a point of serious moral and political inquiry in Connors\u2019s \u201cI Will Find You.\u201d In July 1984, Connors, then a drama critic for The Plain Dealer, walked into an empty theater on the Case Western Reserve campus, late for a 5 o\u2019clock interview. Claiming to be working the lights, a man in the lobby offered to take her inside. Ignoring her internal alarm, Connors followed him, and there the man (who had been released on parole just a week earlier) raped her at knife point. Asked why she went with him, Connors privately, and with great shame, admits to herself, \u201cI could not allow myself to be the white woman who fears black men.\u201d Despite being \u201cthe perfect victim\u201d (white, educated, middle-class, married, with proof of a struggle and an immediate police report) and her perpetrator, David Francis, the perfect assailant (black, poor, with a criminal record), she is subjected to painful scrutiny and degradation before he is finally convicted.Connors\u2019s forthright exploration of race and poverty enlarges her personal story, turning it into a richer, more complex and ultimately more harrowing account of interwoven traumas. David Francis, she discovers, was one of eight children born into a family that one surviving member describes as \u201ccursed.\u201d That\u2019s as apt an explanation as any other: When Connors interviews some of Francis\u2019 siblings and family friends, she confronts a dizzying intersection of addiction, alcoholism, violence, racism, poverty and crime. (Even small children can\u2019t escape: In this extended family not one but two toddlers are killed, one by violence, the other through gross negligence.) What\u2019s miraculous about this memoir is Connors\u2019s ability to identify, in clean, lucid prose, evidence of hope \u2014 and even beauty \u2014 amid such an abundance of misery.In searching for the reasons the man who raped her became such a monster, Connors hoped to find freedom from the PTSD that haunted her for so long. She discovers instead a complicated web of tragedy connecting her family and his, a discovery that deepens her sense of compassion and allows her finally to heal. Winslow hasn\u2019t been granted the luxury of such closure. Her memoir illuminates the many ways in which legal and criminal institutions succeed in deepening the sense of violation, helplessness and anguish felt by the survivors of rape. Together both books serve as powerful evidence of our society\u2019s failure to address the \u00adcauses and consequences of sexual violence.JANE DOE JANUARYMy Twenty-Year Search for Truth and JusticeBy Emily Winslow279 pp. William Morrow/ HarperCollins Publishers. $26.99.I WILL FIND YOUBy Joanna Connors256 pp. Atlantic Monthly Press. $25.Domenica Ruta is the author of a memoir, \u201cWith or Without You.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can a 700 M.P.H. Train in a Tube Be for Real?", "Date": "2016-05-19", "News": "Supported byLast month, at an M.I.T. conference on the future of suburbia, I met a senior-level executive from Hyperloop Technologies. (Hyperloop is a speculative high-speed transportation system that proposes to use passenger and cargo capsules inside a reduced-pressure tube that aims to reach a top speed of 700 miles per hour.) Why put your energies in something that still feels like science fiction? I asked him. Why not invest time, money and ingenuity in high-speed rail? (I live in California; I want to see high-speed rail happen.)Our conversation veered into a surprising direction, much like the proposed curve of a Hyperloop track. He told me about how he and his wife had made the decision not to be together but to share custody of their children and continue to live under the same roof. I looked at him quizzically.The structure of marriage, he continued, didn\u2019t work for him; it was an outdated institution. High-speed rail, he said, was also an outdated institution, so why should we continue to invest in trains?And so, according to his analogy, one might fairly describe Hyperloop as transportation\u2019s new girlfriend: mysterious, unencumbered, exciting, expensive. A wild card with potential. But does she have long-term potential? That remains to be seen.I went to Las Vegas recently to view the first test of Hyperloop. As someone who experiences aging infrastructure daily and desires something better, I was ready to be convinced of the feasibility and future of this idea, which has become one of the purest expressions of techno-optimism.Several separate entities have since been formed to explore the possibilities. The event I attended was presented by Hyperloop Technologies, a group inspired by but not affiliated with Mr. Musk (though riding on his name recognition and involving several of his former employees). Hyperloop Technologies and its competitors are working to develop a structure to move passengers and cargo between two points safely, efficiently and sustainably. And quickly: Mr. Musk\u2019s initial dream was to propel passengers from San Francisco to Los Angeles in about a half an hour (Amtrak takes 12 hours; flight time is an hour).Hyperloop Technologies, which announced its name change to Hyperloop One with much fanfare in Las Vegas, is a well-funded operation with over 100 employees. It\u2019s gaining new investors (such as Vinod Khosla, a founder of Sun Microsystems; Sherpa Ventures; and SNCF, the French train company) and new partners (including the engineering firms Aecom and ARUP, as well as the starchitect Bjarke Ingels) almost as fast as the model on view at its press event.Approximately 200 investors, polo-shirted employees and reporters piled onto buses to converge on a site that looked eerily like a desert scene from \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201d We\u2019d been brought here to watch a test vehicle accelerate down a rail track at speeds of up to 300 m.p.h. using the company\u2019s propulsion technology. The dream is that capsules will hurl through a tube at 700 miles per hour on a cushion of air. That, however, was not what we witnessed.But I have questions. A lot of them.America (and later most of the world) got excited about freeways and built them everywhere over a 30-year span. Little did we know about the negative effects to neighborhoods, the health (obesity) and pollution risks, the excesses of traffic. What are the possible unintended positive and negative consequences of Hyperloop?Will Hyperloop exist as a series of isolated runs or as a comprehensive network?Hyperloop hopes to connect to city centers: What should cities be doing now to accommodate its arrival?Nevada is a famously lax regulatory environment. How will Hyperloop avoid the regulatory obstacles that every other transportation mode faces in more rigorous states?Hyperloop requires narrower rights of way than rails and highways but also requires curvier ones to offset those G-forces. Where will these go?I was told the right of way issue could be avoided by putting Hyperloop underground or underwater, but what are the environmental and cost impacts of that approach?In case of an emergency, how do you evacuate a Hyperloop that\u2019s under a mountain or under water?Will Hyperloop vehicles and tubes have windows? Will passengers want to see the world go by at 400 m.p.h. at ground level?What will Hyperloop do to ensure that people can get to and from its stations?Who is Hyperloop intended to serve? Will lower- and middle-income people be able to afford it? Would we be better off with a less expensive but somewhat slower system that can benefit more people and have lower ticket prices?Skepticism is O.K., Hyperloop\u2019s chief executive told me during our brief conversation at the event, but not cynicism. So I\u2019ll suspend mine a bit to acknowledge that Hyperloop One has achieved an incredible amount of work in a ridiculously short time. It will pain cities that have labored years to get bike lanes painted or bus stops moved to learn that a mere six months ago, this whole operation was little more than a vision. Now it\u2019s an $80 million venture with global partners.\u201cNo one comes close to our progress in commercializing this revolutionary transportation system,\u201d said Brogan BamBrogan, Hyperloop One\u2019s chief technology officer and a founder, before the test run.(That\u2019s two \u201cbros\u201d in one moniker, by the way, an effect even the scriptwriters of \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d wouldn\u2019t have gone for. Mr. BamBrogan\u2019s real first name is Kevin. This is just one of many aspects to this undertaking that makes me feel that it will all be revealed as a breathtaking piece of performance art.)I\u2019ve written in this space about the dearth of awe in infrastructure and so I\u2019ll applaud Hyperloop (again, modeling itself on Mr. Musk\u2019s media mastery) for conjuring an irresistible narrative of possibility. With Hyperloop One, nothing is deferred or delayed; these guys are in a mad rush. They\u2019re following in the product release footsteps of Apple, not the Department of Transportation. The company says that it will be moving cargo in 2019; passengers by 2021. That\u2019s three years from now.I asked Rob Lloyd, Hyperloop One\u2019s chief executive, what he was most proud of. \u201cThe speed with which the technology is being developed,\u201d he replied. \u201cWhen it works, it does change everything.\u201d\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing right now is what I saw in 1996,\u201d said Mr. Lloyd, a former president of sales and development at Cisco. \u201cWe all had I.P. routers and everything was done a certain way. At Cisco, we said, \u2018You can carry that over the Internet,\u2019 and everyone said, \u2018No.\u2019 But those high-speed networks made the Internet possible.\u201d Hyperloop, he said, \u201cwill do to the physical world what the Internet did to the digital one.\u201d\u201cGeography was our destiny, but soon you\u2019ll see opportunity democratized and communities transformed,\u201d said another founder, Shervin Pishevar, echoing the tech industry\u2019s particular skill at casting virtually any endeavor as world-changing.A compelling notion, to be sure, one that I took to heart after being exhorted after the evening event to \u201cgo grab some drinks and get a chance to interface.\u201dAllison Arieff, who specializes in architecture and design, is a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Overcoming the Shame of a Suicide Attempt", "Date": "2016-05-30", "News": "I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember much about the first time I tried to kill myself, 21 years ago, because any time the memory popped up I deleted it from my mind like an unflattering photo on Facebook. Despite being open and public about my second attempt, in 2006, which I revealed in a memoir about my alcoholism, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never told anyone else about that first one \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not my partner of 25 years, my therapist of 10 years, family, nor friends \u00e2\u0080\u0093 until now.Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what I remember about that first time, in 1995. I felt hopeless, that my 27 years of life were done (27!). I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d come home drunk from a glamorous Manhattan book event, which I had organized as the publicist. The wattage of successful artists in literature, fashion and theater was blinding. I felt like a failure, that I would never be more than the hired help, that my own dreams were just thin air. When I came home and poured another drink and remembered the leftover painkillers in my medicine cabinet \u00e2\u0080\u0093 prescribed for a sprained ankle earned by a drunken fall \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I thought, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy not?\u00e2\u0080\u009dMy attempt was impulsive, not premeditated. Had it been successful, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d classify it as suicidal manslaughter. I climbed into the antique wrought iron bed I shared with my partner and passed out. The next morning, I woke up next to him and he was none the wiser. I got up in a daze and went to work feeling like I was moving under water, so heavy was my triple hangover from booze, pills and shame. I kept moving, kept drinking (I was blind then to the cause and effect of booze and depression) and kept silent.My silence nearly killed me. Eleven years later, I tried again. I had been fantasizing about suicide every day for months. I was more hopeless. I was drunker. That time I did it with sleeping pills I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d been taking to prevent me from drinking as much at night. Booze, pills, suicide attempts: it was all one big happy \u00e2\u0080\u009cValley of the Dolls\u00e2\u0080\u009d family. That time I took the pills in the morning after my partner left for work, and I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wake up on my own. My partner found me in that antique bed when he came home from work. The jig was up, and my winding path to recovery began.As a recovering alcoholic I know that admitting to my behavior and owning my story is the only way it can no longer own me. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not ashamed of being an alcoholic, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m still ashamed of trying to kill myself, even though I know I did it under the temporary insanity of alcohol. According to the A.F.S.P., approximately 30 percent of those who die by suicide have blood alcohol levels in the range of intoxication at the time of their deaths.After my second attempt, I went to rehab and then to sober meetings. The focus quickly shifted from my suicide attempt to my alcoholism, and rightfully so. Once my alcoholism was treated, the depression lifted. It was alcohol that brought on my depression and thoughts of suicide, and ultimately twice gave me the courage to try it. Since I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been sober, I no longer suffer from depression, do not take antidepressants and no longer think about killing myself.I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m fortunate to live in New York City, where there are almost as many sober meetings as there are bars. These are peer-led meetings of alcoholics helping other alcoholics, free of judgment and condescension. These meetings keep me sober, hence nonsuicidal.I admitted my second suicide attempt because I was found out, and had to. But shame kept me quiet about my first attempt. I admit it now, and I throw out a call for other closeted suicide attempt survivors to do the same: Own it, and find \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or create \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a safe group where you can talk about it.Today I own my story, so that my story doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t kill me.Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "PAID FOR AND POSTED BYIN 2010, JODIE FOX'S BUSINESS nearly crashed \u2014 literally. Her company, Shoes of Prey, a Santa Monica-based online operation that creates custom shoes for individuals, had only been in business for a year when it partnered with a YouTube star to help with promotion. The company had about 200,000 hits total to its website during the first five months of the year, but after the YouTuber talked up the business to her half-million-plus subscribers, that hit count soared. After reaching about 500,000 visits in one day, Fox and her two co-founders were certain their home page was going to go down. \u201cI was massively nervous,\u201d says Fox.At the time, Fox and one of her co-founders were in Hong Kong, while another was in Australia. The three of them jumped on a Google Hangout to discuss what might happen if traffic increased even further, and also how to convert these new viewers into customers. Minutes after their conversation, they had created an email sign-up form and added social sharing buttons to the page. Fortunately, everything ended well \u2014 the site didn\u2019t crash and she got a number of new customers thanks to that video. It was also one of the more exhilarating evenings for Fox in the company\u2019s young life. Her response to this experience was just one of the many choices she\u2019s made along that way that helped her company grow and expand.Fox got the idea for Shoes of Prey after being frustrated by not being able to find shoes that she liked. Instead of buying a pair that would make her unhappy, she decided to commission her own design and had a single pair made for herself. She liked the do-it-yourself process so much that she bought 14 more custom pairs. Soon, other people started asking her for custom footwear.She realized that her idea could be the start of something big, so she found a manufacturer that could produce customized shoes \u2014 it could create a pair for one person or for many \u2014 then set up a website allowing people to create and order shoes to their tastes. \u201cPeople can get exactly what they want,\u201d she says.Of course, as every entrepreneur knows, growing a business is not without its challenges. Her first big hurdle? Hiring employees. At first it was just Fox and her co-founders running things, but sales started pouring in soon after she launched the website. In February 2010 \u2014 four months after opening their doors \u2014 they decided to hire a customer service manager who would communicate directly with clients. There was one problem: They had no idea what it took from a tax, legal and payroll point of view to bring someone on board.They told their first employee that if she wanted to join the company, she had to figure out how to hire herself. \u201cWe had no systems in place,\u201d says Fox. She knew we had to choose someone who could figure out how to report tax, research insurance and everything else. By hiring the right person, they were able to build a foundation for the next members of the Shoes of Prey family.For Fox and many others, running a small business is a series of successes and failures \u2014 the latter from which she\u2019s learned a great deal. Managing growth is a common issue that trips up business owners. In Shoes of Prey\u2019s early days, the orders were coming in so fast that it was difficult to keep up. During especially busy periods, customers would often get antsy when their orders didn\u2019t arrive on time.Fox knew she needed to make a change. She amped up her communications with customers, sending emails to let them know when orders were expected to arrive. Staying in touch throughout the process helped customers know there was someone working to get their shoes sent as quickly as possible. There came a point when Fox realized no one could do the job the way she wanted it done, and Shoes of Prey opened its own manufacturing plant allowing them to easily ramp up production when needed.Of course, there\u2019s much more to running a business than growth and hiring, even if these issues get a lot of attention from entrepreneurs. Fox says it is the critical choices in day-to-day operations that can really take a business to the next level. Communicating with employees, for instance, can become challenging as companies grow. She went from one staffer to 15 in 12 months, and after receiving an investment, those employee numbers soared. Keeping employees in touch with one another could have been difficult, but Fox and her team chose Google Apps for Work, a suite of cloud-based programs that helps people share files and talk to one another, among other things, from the get-go.Because it\u2019s cloud-based, these programs allow her to share files with other staffers in other parts of the world, and anyone can open a document and collaborate with colleagues in real-time. She\u2019s used Google Hangouts (part of the Apps suite) since the beginning, to talk face-to-face with employees in her four main offices, as well as an online calendar program so people can see when she\u2019s free for a meeting and vice-versa. If it weren\u2019t for these tools, her company \u201cwould be total madness,\u201d she says. \u201c(We\u2019ve found ways) to make our lives really simple.\u201dFox says it\u2019s a series of smart, thoughtful choices that make running her company exciting: from her first steps creating a customizable shoe business to not overlooking key pieces, like having the right technology in place to work with staff around the globe. Shoes of Prey now has 220 employees, five physical locations in\u00a0the U.S. and Australia, and has begun selling its shoes at\u00a0Nordstrom stores, which is\u00a0also an investor.Through all the ups and downs, Fox says she\u2019s loved every moment of her journey. While there will be tough choices to make, \u201cThere are good days and bad days, but\u00a0you have to stay humble and stay hungry,\u201d\u00a0she says. \u201cIt\u2019s all extremely rewarding.\u201dArtwork by\u00a0Matt BleaseThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}

The family had already spent days in the squalid compound of a school where thousands of Jews destined for deportation were warehoused.

On arrival at the Skirotava station in Riga, the deportees were told that they had to walk miles to the ghetto, and that those unable to make the distance could take buses instead.Ms. Ungar\u2019s mother, her feet frozen, got on board along with about 700 passengers, many of them old, or sick, or children. Yad Vashem researchers said the vehicles were not buses but gas trucks, and their passengers were murdered.The database shows the transport routes on reconstructed maps based on Google imagery. Their details have been cross-referenced with other sources, including Nazi documentation, railroad company documents, material from war crimes trials and the diaries and testimonies of deportees.Some survivors, for example, recalled seeing signs out of train windows, giving researchers clues.\u201cWe are trying to tell the story of the transports as a historical event, not just the technical movement of people from A to B,\u201d Dr. Zisenwine said. For example, earlier transports from Vienna to the Lublin district of Poland took Jews to some kind of Jewish reserve for a short-term plan of \u201cresettlement,\u201d he said, \u201cbut by 1942 the purpose was mass murder.\u201dHalf a dozen researchers are beginning the next phase: mapping the transports in Eastern Europe, where documentation is harder to come by.One day this week Avi Kotsere-Burg, a German speaker, and Marina Spivak, a Polish speaker, were poring over documents relating to the German-annexed Warthegau region of Poland, where the Lodz ghetto was. Ms. Spivak had a scanned testimony from the Yad Vashem archives on her computer screen, handwritten in Polish by an anonymous girl who had survived.Adolfine, who was about 80, died in Terezin, Czechoslovakia, according to a list of Theresienstadt camp inmates cited by Yad Vashem.The train is believed to have gone north to Dresden, Germany, then east to Breslau, Posen and Warsaw before stopping inside the camp. According to the same list of Theresienstadt inmates, Marie, who was 81, and Ms. Winternitz, then 78, were on board.Samuel Rajzman, a Treblinka survivor, said in his testimony before the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal in 1946 that he had witnessed their arrival in the camp.He described one of the sisters \u2014 it was not clear which \u2014 approaching the commander of the camp, showing him an identifying document, saying she was the sister of Sigmund Freud and asking to be given light office work. The commander said there must have been a mistake and told her that in two hours there should be a train to Vienna.\u201cShe could leave all her valuables and documents here, have a bath, and after the bath she would receive her documents and a travel permit to Vienna,\u201d Mr. Rajzman cited the camp commander as saying. \u201cThe lady, of course, went to the bath house, from which she never returned.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Silicon Valley, Gossip, Anger and Revenge", "Date": "2016-05-25", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Silicon Valley likes to keep the media on a tight leash. Tech executives expect obedience, if not reverence, from reporters. They dole out information as grudgingly as possible. Sometimes they simply buy a chunk of a publication, a time-honored method of influencing what is deemed fit to write about.Outing famous people has a long and not particularly respectable history, but Valleywag said it was celebrating Mr. Thiel. The point, as Valleywag\u2019s then-editor Owen Thomas wrote in his post, was that even in Silicon Valley, \u201ca gay investor has no way to fit into the old establishment. That frees him or her to build a different, hopefully better system for identifying and rewarding talented individuals, and unleashing their work on the world.\u201d\u201cSilicon Valley is a closed world and has become more closed at the elite levels,\u201d said Fred Turner, chairman of the department of communication at Stanford. \u201cThe gossip that circulates between people doesn\u2019t always leap into the media the way it might in New York. So Americans know the Valley primarily through its advertising, its self-promotion and its products.\u201dValleywag challenged that, and the Valley \u2014 or at least Mr. Thiel \u2014 pushed back.\u201cWe should not be surprised that they act like entitled industrialists out here, because they are,\u201d Mr. Turner said.Valleywag was born in 2006, an arm of Gawker\u2019s then-expanding empire of blogs, and it died last winter. It had a hiatus or two along the way, with Nick Denton, the Gawker founder, stepping in to write the blog at one point. Its most influential years were in the beginning, especially under Mr. Thomas, who ran the site from 2007 until 2009.\u201cOn one hand the reporting was terribly caustic and brutal and on the other it was really thorough and investigative and accurate in a lot of cases,\u201d said Brandee Barker, former head of global communications at Facebook. \u201cI would read a story and think, \u2018How on earth did they find this information that is correct?\u2019 Other times I\u2019d read Valleywag and think, \u2018This is the most evil and unfair characterization of somebody I\u2019ve ever read in journalism.\u2019\u201dJohn Cook, executive editor of Gawker Media, who helped put Valleywag to rest last year, said the site \u201cdidn\u2019t play the access game.\u201dMr. Thomas, now business editor of The San Francisco Chronicle, said the goal of Valleywag was to improve the tech community.\u201cSilicon Valley said it had ideals,\u201d he said. \u201cAll we asked was that it live up to those ideals. If you\u2019re going to say that you\u2019re a meritocracy, then don\u2019t hire all of your buddies to launch a start-up who all happen to be young white men. Don\u2019t say you\u2019re apolitical when you\u2019re secretly funding anti-immigration measures.\u201dFor Mr. Thiel, taking action against Gawker may be a win. Dan Lyons, an author who was briefly a Valleywag writer, said what Mr. Thiel did \u201csets a scary precedent,\u201d but \u201cmy guess is that most people hate Gawker as much as he does, so he probably ends up looking like a hero among his own crowd.\u201dMr. Adams wrote approvingly of Mr. Thiel, \u201cI assume he is acting out of a combination of revenge and a desire to make the world a better place.\u201dWithout this week\u2019s news, Valleywag\u2019s legacy would be uncertain. Several Silicon Valley figures asked to comment on Wednesday said they had not read it or did not know it was defunct.Others, like the Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff, an occasional Valleywag target, said simply about the site and this week\u2019s events, \u201cI don\u2019t care about any of those people.\u201dThe news about Mr. Thiel funding the suit against Gawker broke just as the previous contretemps about Silicon Valley and the media \u2014 how Facebook shapes the news that its users see, sparked by a story in Gizmodo, another Gawker property \u2014 was dying down. Mr. Thiel, as it happens, is a Facebook board member. Facebook declined to comment on Mr. Thiel.Mr. Thomas, who is himself gay, argues that Valleywag was not really outing Mr. Thiel. \u201cI did discuss his sexuality, but it was known to a wide circle who felt that it was not fit for discussion beyond that circle,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe he was in the closet. He was never hiding it.\u201dHowever much Valleywag said it admired Mr. Thiel for being \u201cthe smartest V.C. in the world,\u201d it took a more disparaging view as well. In one post about Mr. Thiel\u2019s claims of hiring only the best to work at his hedge fund, Clarium Capital, Mr. Thomas wrote, \u201cOh, really? Take a look at their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s on LinkedIn. Like so many of this outspokenly harebrained libertarian\u2019s theses, the claim sounds good on paper but doesn\u2019t stand up to inspection.\u201d\u201cIt scares everybody,\u201d he said in a 2009 interview with Pe Hub, a private equity publication. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible for the Valley, which is supposed to be about people who are willing to think out loud and be different. I think they should be described as terrorists, not as writers or reporters.\u201dQuentin Hardy and Mike Isaac contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alan Rusbridger, Once Guardian\u2019s Celebrated Editor, Severs Ties With It", "Date": "2016-05-13", "News": "Supported byBut Mr. Rusbridger on Friday departed the organization to which he had devoted his career. With mounting financial losses that threatened The Guardian, he was forced to give up the plum role he was set to assume in September, as chairman of the Scott Trust, the nonprofit organization that owns The Guardian.Mr. Rusbridger\u2019s decision to cut ties with The Guardian follows a series of events that made his presence seem increasingly untenable: lingering resentments from a battle over his replacement as editor; a string of articles detailing the paper\u2019s deteriorating finances; and, finally, a clash with his successor, Katharine Viner, who helped spearhead his strategy for international growth but now faces a period of retrenchment.The tensions, playing out on a public stage, deviate from the familiar news media angst in the digital world, where print\u2019s changing fortunes can create upheaval at the top.In his resignation statement, Mr. Rusbridger, 62, seemed to imply at times that he had been undone by the new regime \u2014 which he helped put in place \u2014 as well as a rapidly shifting environment in which even forward-thinking news organizations hemorrhage money while titans like Facebook and Google devour advertising revenue.The Guardian lost an estimated 45 million pounds, or $65 million, last year. It is seeking to cut its annual budget of $380 million by 20 percent over the next three years. It is cutting its British work force by 310 positions \u2014 250 job cuts and 60 vacant positions that will not be filled \u2014 or 18 percent of the total.\u201cMuch has changed in the year since I stepped down,\u201d Mr. Rusbridger wrote in a memo to The Guardian\u2019s staff members on Friday, stating that the leadership of The Guardian \u2014 David Pemsel, the chief executive of the Guardian Media Group, and Ms. Viner, the editor \u2014 no longer wanted him to take over the Scott Trust.\u201cWe all currently do our journalism in the teeth of a force-12 digital hurricane,\u201d Mr. Rusbridger said in the memo. The leaders of The Guardian \u201cclearly believe they would like to plot a route into the future with a new chair,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI understand their reasoning.\u201dA central point of disagreement within The Guardian has been its refusal \u2014 for Mr. Rusbridger, virtually an ideology \u2014 to charge online subscribers, as news organizations like The Financial Times, The Times of London, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times have come around to doing. The Guardian has recently experimented with a membership model that amounts to seeking donations, but Mr. Rusbridger insisted that a digital pay wall would be at odds with the newspaper\u2019s editorial mission.Under Mr. Rusbridger, The Guardian invested hundreds of millions of dollars in expansion, fueled in part by proceeds from the sale of a trade publication, Auto Trader. The Guardian Media Group\u2019s investment fund had been shrinking recently at an alarming rate \u2014 to \u00a3740 million in January, from \u00a3838.3 million in July.The Guardian, which started in Manchester, England, in 1821, built a presence in Australia and the United States beginning in 2011. It seemed to move easily into the digital realm, staffing 10 bureaus in the two countries and hiring more than 50 reporters.The Guardian succeeded in significantly expanding its international readership \u2014 the company says traffic from outside Britain now represents two-thirds of its digital audience. But its resistance to charging readers for content came at a significant cost.In a statement on Friday, Ms. Viner lauded Mr. Rusbridger as \u201ca truly towering figure at The Guardian over the last three decades.\u201d But she added: \u201cIn his email to staff, Alan recognized how much has changed in the year since he stepped down as editor, and that it is right that we all plot a new route to the future. We face a formidable challenge over the coming months in a digital environment that is shifting all the time.\u201dCerebral and academic, with often unruly hair, Mr. Rusbridger had an inner steel that won him admiration and devotion. Early in his career at The Guardian, Mr. Rusbridger led the newspaper\u2019s tenacious investigation of what became known as the cash-for-questions scandal in Parliament, which contributed to the fall of the Conservative government of Prime Minister John Major in 1997. Mr. Rusbridger stared down a libel suit against the newspaper by a powerful former minister involved in the scandal, Jonathan Aitken, who was ultimately jailed for perjury. In the hypercompetitive and partisan world of British journalism, Mr. Rusbridger was sometimes a lonely figure, often more admired in the United States than among his rivals at home.As Mr. Rusbridger\u2019s vision for the newsroom played out, the strategy appeared to have the full support of the top brass. Shortly after Mr. Rusbridger retired in 2015, Mr. Pemsel, the chief executive, said he was \u201chugely excited at the prospect of managing the next phase of growth at The Guardian, building on our international audience, capitalizing on the many commercial and digital opportunities.\u201d Around that time, another top executive said the company\u2019s finances had been good that year.Then the bottom fell out. Print advertising cratered, and expected digital money never materialized.Support for Mr. Rusbridger suddenly shifted, as he was cast as a negligent manager who had saddled the paper with a slew of problems. Janine Gibson, a favorite of Mr. Rusbridger\u2019s who lost out in the race to succeed him, left with other senior Guardian journalists, further shifting the way his legacy was viewed in the newsroom. In January, Mr. Rusbridger\u2019s choice as The Guardian\u2019s opinion editor, Jonathan Freedland, stepped down in what was seen as a leftward shift in the organization\u2019s editorial stance. And Ms. Viner\u2019s plans for the newsroom seemed increasingly at odds with Mr. Rusbridger\u2019s, making the idea that he would soon return, as essentially her boss, increasingly unsavory.It all reached a head on Thursday when the board of the trust met to discuss Mr. Rusbridger\u2019s future. The meeting ended without a decision.Mr. Rusbridger was by all accounts apparently dismayed by the public back-and-forth and the sour tone at the institution he dominated for so many years. While his supporters framed the decision to go as his, others said he had lost the battle with the trust and had no choice but to leave.In his memo, Mr. Rusbridger, who is currently the principal, or head, of Lady Margaret Hall, a college at the University of Oxford, wished his colleagues well. In September, he will also become the chairman of the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, also at Oxford.Graham Bowley contributed reporting from Toronto, Sarah Lyall from New York, and Nicola Clark from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s $1 Billion Investment May Ease Ties With China", "Date": "2016-05-13", "News": "Supported byBut Apple\u2019s surprising interest in the company, called Didi Chuxing, and its out-of-character willingness to publicize the news Thursday evening could go a long way toward showing the Chinese government it is interested in supporting local business.More than any other major American technology company, Apple has had huge success in China. In the last fiscal year, Chinese consumers spent $59 billion on Apple products.With that success has come huge risk. In recent years, Beijing has grown more aggressive in pushing an agenda aimed at expanding local tech companies, forcing multinationals to play by its rules if they want access to China\u2019s markets.\u201cApple must be increasingly sensitive to the need to improve its government relations and to stake out a more entrenched position in the China market,\u201d said Mark Natkin, managing director of the China technology research firm Marbridge Consulting. \u201cSo making a sizable investment in a leading Chinese I.T. company will buy it a lot of good will.\u201dHe added that Apple would probably have to follow up the investment with other partnerships and spending in China if it wanted to stay in Beijing\u2019s good graces.In Apple\u2019s case, the new investment also helps it show Beijing how its operating system and iPhones are closely linked with the rise of app development within China; Didi\u2019s app, for example, is the most downloaded ride-hailing software in China.\u201cDidi exemplifies the innovation taking place in the iOS developer community in China,\u201d Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said in a news release.Many investors hoped that strong growth in China would offset some of the iPhone\u2019s deceleration. Revenue growth in the greater China region, which includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, hovered around 70 percent or more all last year. But last month the company said that quarterly sales in greater China had fallen 26 percent compared with the previous year.For Didi, the deal is a way to beef up its systems. The Chinese company serves close to 300 million users across more than 400 Chinese cities \u2014 more users than Uber \u2014 but lags technologically, analysts say.For more than a year, Apple and Didi \u2014 which share several partners, including Japan\u2019s SoftBank and Coatue \u2014 had been in contact. Apple was one of a handful of technology companies that, over the last year, Didi had talked with to better familiarize itself with the West, according to a person briefed on the deal.In April, Mr. Cook sat down for the first time with the leaders of Didi to discuss working together.In the midst of Didi\u2019s last major round of raising funds, the relationship quickly deepened, the person said. The two companies managed to close the deal with \u201clightning speed,\u201d Didi\u2019s president, Jean Liu, said in a conference call discussing the deal late Thursday.The two will work together on technology, marketing and products, Ms. Liu added.Mr. Cook has repeatedly said that Apple is looking for investment opportunities for its huge cash hoard. Apple has invested small sums in app developers before, and the company views China\u2019s app developer community as a prime source of future growth.\u201cWhat this means to me is that Apple is firmly committed to the Chinese market,\u201d said Brian Blau, an analyst with the Gartner research firm. \u201cThey are going to look at lots of opportunities.\u201dApple\u2019s move also draws it further into a Chinese market crisscrossed with competitive alliances. With the investment, Apple is now aligned with China\u2019s two largest Internet companies, Tencent and Alibaba, as a major shareholder in Didi. And Didi gained Apple as a big-name ally in its battle with Uber in China.Google\u2019s chief legal officer and head of corporate development, David Drummond, is on the board of Uber. And in 2013 Google\u2019s venture capital arm, GV, invested $258 million in Uber.But the partnership between Uber and Google has grown more distant over the past few years as both sides have independently pursued self-driving car projects. Uber has also made moves to wean itself from Google\u2019s map technology, including an acquisition of the mapping start-up deCarta.Investing in ride-hailing services gives Apple a doorway into the world\u2019s largest auto market and smartphone market by cars and phones sold, and an opportunity to better integrate its devices with cars in China. China\u2019s Internet companies are already hard at work developing driverless car technology and entertainment systems for cars, many of which are based on Google\u2019s Android software.\u201cMaybe they could be a technology supplier to Didi,\u201d Mr. Blau said. \u201cMaybe they could learn from Didi.\u201dThe auto market might be one new way that Apple can keep itself relevant to Chinese leaders who often view foreign tech firms in terms of how much utility they have in China as teachers of local companies, Mr. Natkin of Marbridge Consulting said.\u201cAs that utility wanes, the room to maneuver dwindles and the welcome mat starts to get drawn under the door,\u201d he said.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the day Apple\u2019s investment in Didi was announced. The investment was announced Thursday in the United States, not Thursday morning in China.Paul Mozur reported from Hong Kong and Mike Isaac from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "Trump, Truth and the Power of Contradiction", "Date": "2016-05-07", "News": "Supported byThe StoneConsistency, Emerson said, is the hobgoblin of little minds. Perhaps no one in American public life channels this thought more than Donald J. Trump. He not only doesn\u2019t fear contradiction, he embraces it. And he is downright scornful of those little minds that are bothered by his performances.Mr. Trump\u2019s willingness to be inconsistent \u2014 even in a single interview, or the same speech \u2014 has baffled political strategists for months. Even more puzzling is his followers\u2019 happy toleration of it. It is as though the content of what Mr. Trump says doesn\u2019t matter; only the fact that he is saying it does. But how could that be? After all, other candidates are seemingly held to different standards, by their supporters and others. They are held responsible for what they say.A striking early example of this was Mr. Trump\u2019s initial refusal to condemn the Ku Klux Klan and other white nationalists who had been endorsing him. Mr. Trump later denounced such groups. Yet many white supremacists, including David Duke, continue to support Mr. Trump. Why?The explanation, I think, lies in the power of contradictions themselves. That power, and Mr. Trump\u2019s effective use of it, tells us as much about ourselves and our culture\u2019s attitude toward truth as it tells us about him.From the standpoint of classical logic and mathematics, what\u2019s bad about a contradiction is that it leads to absurdity. You can derive any proposition you wish from a contradiction in a few simple steps. Yet that\u2019s precisely what makes them so useful from the point of view of political psychology \u2014 indeed, the more blatant the contradiction the better.Of course, politicians often \u201cwalk back\u201d comments \u2014 either because they misspoke, or because of unwelcome attention generated by the remark. Yet an explicit contradiction isn\u2019t the same thing as \u201cmassaging\u201d a comment. A contradiction doesn\u2019t signal that you misspoke and that you really believe something else.So if we like the Klan, we can read into Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks that he does, too. As so many of his followers put it, Mr. Trump is not afraid to \u201ctell it like it is.\u201d Yet when faced with a contradiction, the \u201cit\u201d can be up to you.Donald J. Trump\u2019s position on a variety of issues has shifted over the years, often rightward. But not always.That contradictions are particularly useful to Mr. Trump also tells us something about what some people find appealing about him. Indeed, it reveals an even deeper contradiction. Mr. Trump\u2019s explicit lack of authenticity is what makes him so authentic. He is like a walking oxymoron (which is perhaps not surprising, given that reality TV is the medium in which he has most flourished). To some, that he is contradicting himself so freely shows that he really doesn\u2019t care what \u201cthey\u201d (read: the news media, liberals, women, minorities) think. The signal this sends is one of strength: Only the strong can afford not to care.There is also a deeper philosophical issue here. The most disturbing power of contradiction is that its repeated use can dull our sensitivity to the value of truth itself. That\u2019s particularly so given that most Americans live in a digital world that both makes it easier and harder to figure out what is true. Googling is like being in a room with a million shouting voices. It is only natural that we\u2019ll hear those voices that are most similar to our own, shouting what we already believe, and as a result Google can find you confirmation for almost anything, no matter how absurd.Of course we are aware that those with different views can do the same. And that very fact, if we aren\u2019t careful, can lead us into thinking that objectivity is a \u201cdead value.\u201d We get so used to contradictory information, rival sources, that we find ourselves no longer valuing truth.In George Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984,\u201d the protagonist is tortured until he agrees that two plus two equals five. The point, his torturer makes clear, is to make him see that there is no objective truth other than what the party says is true. That\u2019s the deep power of contradiction. Repeated enough, political contradictions can lull us into giving up on critical thought altogether. And once that happens, we risk giving up on truth. At which point contradictions \u2014 and everything other than power \u2014 will no longer matter.Advertisement"}

Berrigan wore pajama bottoms that had belonged to an older brother who died last year. In Father Berrigan\u2019s closet was a thin navy blue backpack, \u201clight as a feather,\u201d his niece Frida Berrigan said. He brought it everywhere.\u201cDan owned nothing,\u201d Ms. Berrigan said on Thursday. \u201cHe carried nothing. Whenever I traveled with him, to conferences, speaking engagements, retreats, family occasions, he\u2019d bring that little backpack of nothing. I\u2019d pick him up and ask, \u2018Is that all you have?\u2019 He\u2019d say: \u2018Yes, that\u2019s it. Let\u2019s go.\u2019\u201dDeeds, not things, made Father Berrigan one of the best-known Roman Catholic priests of the 20th century: His physical possessions barely filled the modest room in the Jesuit infirmary at Fordham University in the Bronx where he spent his final years. He departed indifferently penniless from a world that often seems to keep score in gilded ink.\u201cHe had two kinds of clothes: threadbare, translucent from wear, and things that he had never worn,\u201d she said. \u201cHe had a shiny old black raincoat that he wore to every demonstration. Just Google the images of him.\u201dIn their early years of activism, the Berrigans and others of the Catholic left worked at the edges of the institutional church. They were a prophetic force. Since then, the church has become one of the world\u2019s most consistent, prominent voices against wars. Into his late 80s and early 90s, Father Berrigan continued to speak from a distinctly Catholic perspective against war, capital punishment, abortion, bigotry and indifference to the poor. He also managed to keep being arrested.When a network television reporter noted in 1981 that he was not getting as much attention as he once had, Father Berrigan replied, \u201cI don\u2019t think we ever felt our conscience was tied to the other end of a TV cord.\u201dMs. Berrigan and others kept vigil with him in his room last week. As he became frail in recent years, she said, he was tenderly cared for by his brother Jesuits and the staff at the infirmary. By choice, he had no computer. The television was never on. Yet the space was not empty or quiet. \u201cThere were piles and piles of books,\u201d she said. Visitors read to him.After he drew his last breaths on Saturday, Ms. Berrigan said, they sat in his room. She opened mail for his birthday, May 9, and laughed at gimmick cards that chirped out songs. Those would have hit him on the silly bone, she said.On Friday morning, a march of peace will begin at 7:30 from Maryhouse, on Third Street between First and Second Avenues in Manhattan, one of two Catholic Worker homes in New York. It will go to the Church of St. Francis Xavier on West 16th Street, near the Avenue of the Americas, for Father Berrigan\u2019s funeral Mass at 10.During the offertory, which is part of every Catholic Mass, gifts of bread and wine are brought to the altar. When those offerings are blessed, Catholics believe, the bread and wine become the substance of the divine; when they are passed to the congregation, all can then eat and drink of the goodness of God.At the Mass for Father Berrigan, in addition to bread and wine, other gifts will be brought to the altar. A plowshare. A hammer.\u201cAnd that shirt,\u201d Ms. Berrigan said. \u201cThe one he wore to the weddings.\u201dThe About New York column on Friday, 06 about the way in which the Rev. Daniel J.

{"Headline": "Police and Tech Giants Wrangle Over Encryption on Capitol Hill", "Date": "2016-05-08", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the district attorney of Manhattan, visited Washington late last month to argue his case on a pressing issue: encryption.\u201cI wanted to express a sense of urgency around resolution of this issue,\u201d Mr. Vance said in an interview about his Washington visit.Law enforcement officials immediately announced their support of the bill and began to push lawmakers to back it. Trade groups representing tech companies like Apple and Facebook have flooded into congressional offices, sent letters expressing concerns that the bill weakens consumer privacy and security, and delivered scorching speeches about the proposals.\u201cThis is an escalating fight,\u201d said Robert D. Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a research firm based in Washington that is funded by tech companies including Google and Microsoft. \u201cIt\u2019s become the focus now in Washington, with hearings and legislative activity.\u201dLaw enforcement officials blame tech companies for creating the impasse.\u201cThere\u2019s no question our relationship with the tech industry has gotten worse, and now it seems like the tech industry is taking every opportunity they have to put up obstacles in our way, including trying to derail legislative efforts that would give law enforcement what they need to keep people safe,\u201d said Terrence Cunningham, president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police.\u201cToday, terrorists and criminals are increasingly using encryption to foil law enforcement efforts, even in the face of a court order,\u201d Senator Feinstein said in a statement about the draft bill. \u201cWe need strong encryption to protect personal data, but we also need to know when terrorists are plotting to kill Americans.\u201dThe rhetoric in Washington around encryption has grown increasingly sharp. Last month, when the contents of the draft encryption bill were leaked, the president of the Consumer Technology Association, a trade group that counts Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon among its 4,000 members, spoke to an audience filled with government officials at a lunch hosted by the Media Institute.The bill is \u201cdangerously overreaching and technically unsophisticated,\u201d said Gary Shapiro, president of the association. \u201cThis bill would essentially make effective cybersecurity illegal in the United States, pushing companies that take cybersecurity seriously offshore.\u201dOther tech trade groups, including Reform Government Surveillance and the Business Software Alliance, have also waded into the fray, sending critical letters and meeting with senators to warn of the dangers of the bill. And Silicon Valley executives have, in increasing numbers, made the trek to Washington to make their cases directly.Bob Lord, chief information security officer at Yahoo, visited several members of Congress in late April to talk about the technology behind encryption and to warn of the \u201cunintended consequences\u201d of legislation that could weaken security. While he did not specifically mention the Burr-Feinstein bill, he emphasized how consumers and human rights activists worldwide depend on encrypted technology for their safety and privacy.\u201cThe notion that we would weaken encryption or provide back doors, those suggestions will have unintended consequences,\u201d Mr. Lord said.Law enforcement officials, in turn, have frequently met with the same lawmakers in the Senate and House intelligence, judiciary and commerce committees who are being targeted by the tech companies, according to congressional staff members. Chief Cunningham and other members of the police chiefs\u2019 group have talked with Mr. Burr and Ms. Feinstein, given opinions during the drafting of the legislation and hosted panels on encryption for House and Senate lawmakers.Tech companies have turned to certain politicians to champion their cause, such as Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon. On the day the draft encryption bill was introduced, Mr. Wyden, who voted against the 2012 copyright bills known as the Stop Online Piracy Act and the Protect Intellectual Property Act, which were also opposed by the tech industry, said he had been flooded with calls from tech companies wanting to know what he would do.Mr. Wyden said he intended to filibuster the proposal. He has since met with Intelligence Committee members to persuade them to kill the bill.\u201cI have not filibustered many issues, but I think the stakes are enormous,\u201d Mr. Wyden said in an interview. \u201cThe bill as written is a lose-lose, because it will create less security, American families will be less safe, and your liberty and privacy will be damaged.\u201dFor all the lobbying, few lawmakers have expressed their views on the encryption bill.\u201cI\u2019m reserving judgment,\u201d said Senator King, who met with Mr. Vance last month. \u201cThe issues are so complex, it\u2019s like trying to nail Jell-O to the wall.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google to Ban All Payday Loan Ads", "Date": "2016-05-11", "News": "Supported byGoogle announced on Wednesday that it would ban all advertisements for payday loans and related products on its website because they often lead to unaffordable repayment terms and financial harm to consumers.\u201cThis change is designed to protect our users from deceptive or harmful financial products,\u201d Mr. Graff wrote. \u201cAds for financial services are a particular area of vigilance given how core they are to people\u2019s livelihood and well-being.\u201dIt is the first time that the company has banned such a broad range of financial advertisements on its site, but the move was welcome by advocates seeking stricter controls on an industry long accused of targeting low-income and minority communities with loans that carry egregiously high interest rates.Lisa Donner, the executive director of Americans for Financial Reform, said in a statement that Google\u2019s decision would stop abusive lenders from marketing what she described as \u201cdebt-trap products that do serious and lasting harm to consumers.\u201dWade Henderson, president and chief executive of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a coalition representing more than 200 national organizations, said in a statement, \u201cThese companies have long used slick advertising and aggressive marketing to trap consumers into outrageously high interest loans \u2014 often those least able to afford it.\u201d\u201cGoogle is making a blanket assessment about the payday lending industry rather than discerning the good actors from the bad actors.

Ads crop up online when users type in \u201cneed money to pay rent\u201d or other search terms that signal financial distress.Approximately one-third of the payday loan market is online, and two-thirds of the industry operates out of about 16,000 payday loan stores in 36 states across the country, according to a Pew Charitable Trusts report in 2014. The report said interest rates for online payday loans were typically higher than those for storefront loans, and they usually exceed 300 percent annual percentage rates.Consumers will still be able to find payday loan companies through an organic search on Google, but their ads will not be highlighted. Mr. Graff said the company would continue to review the policy, and added that it would not affect companies offering services such as mortgages, car loans, student loans, commercial loans and credit cards.The company declined to say how much it expected to lose in revenue from the ad ban.

{"Headline": "Facebook \u2018Trending\u2019 List Skewed by Individual Judgment, Not Institutional Bias", "Date": "2016-05-20", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Last July, in a seventh-floor conference room at Facebook\u2019s Lower Manhattan offices, a small group met to discuss the future of news media on the social network.Facebook leaders were bullish on a relatively new section of the site that surfaced the most popular news stories, like news of the terrorist attacks on the Charlie Hebdo newspaper in Paris or stories about Chris Hemsworth\u2019s genitalia. They decided the effort, called Trending Topics and until then a pilot operation by a dozen or so staff members, should be doubled to more than 30 people. One goal for the team: use human judgment to make algorithms better at finding news on Facebook.\u201cWe asked, do we consider ourselves Facebook journalists?\u201d said Benjamin Fearnow, a former news curator at Facebook who worked on Trending Topics for close to a year, until April, and who attended the meeting. \u201cWe straddled that very thin line between social media and news. None of us really knew how it was going to play out.\u201dAn examination of Trending Topics, based on interviews with current and former Facebook employees and a demonstration of the curator tools, found that Facebook\u2019s employees were not directed to squelch conservative news on the site, nor would that be easily accomplished by a staff member who wished to do so.Instead, these people said, Trending Topics was a fledgling, ill-managed group \u2014 made up largely of recent college graduates with little work experience \u2014 where individual judgment of news was encouraged. That led to inconsistencies in how the most popular stories were presented, along with departures from the team, eventually landing the group in the controversy that spotlights Facebook\u2019s huge role in the type of information people see every day.\u201cWe\u2019ve reflected a lot,\u201d said Justin Osofsky, Facebook\u2019s vice president for global operations and media partnerships, which includes Trending Topics. He said Facebook had \u201cidentified ways in which we should have improved.\u201dTrending Topics, introduced in a handful of countries in January 2014 with a small staff based in New York, was Facebook\u2019s first major attempt to comb through the avalanche of information being posted on the social network and to make it easier for people to find current events \u2014 such as the pope\u2019s visit to the United States and anything involving the Kardashians \u2014 and to read and talk about them on Facebook.It was a shot at competitors like Google and Twitter, according to two former news curators who spoke on condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Facebook wanted people to search for more content \u2014 like news \u2014 on its own site instead of on Google, the search king, or Twitter, which was widely regarded as better for real-time news, they said.That is where humans came in. Facebook enlisted a set of 20-somethings as curators, copy editors and team leads, charged with sifting through the material the algorithms unearthed. They were crucial, they were told, to improving Facebook\u2019s ability to discern, over time, what constitutes news.Mr. Fearnow, who was terminated from Facebook in April for breaking his nondisclosure agreement, said his job as a curator was to \u201cmassage the algorithm.\u201d Managers were ambivalent about allowing staff members to identify themselves as curators or editors on their LinkedIn profiles, he said, given concerns that outsiders would notice the element of human judgment and ask questions about it.Facebook declined to comment, citing employee confidentiality.During each eight-hour shift, curators were presented with a continuously refreshing list of trending terms they had to sort through and identify as junk or relevant, and draft descriptions for those topics. After labeling them and checking whether they had been independently reported by a number of major news outlets, curators gave topics a value that would make them more or less likely to show up on individual users\u2019 pages. Each user saw a different list of personalized Topics based on their past actions on Facebook.In Facebook\u2019s editorial guidelines, curators were also told to \u201cblacklist,\u201d or push aside, junk topics that appeared in their queue for a period of eight to 24 hours before they could potentially appear again, according to current and former employees. When duplicate or confusing topics arose, curators were told to \u201cinject\u201d a more accurate Topic term. Copy editors and team leads would also oversee and approve the choices being made.The work was monotonous \u2014 and not entirely gratifying. Workers were incentivized to compete against one another to clear the most trends from their queue, former employees said. Top performers were given \u201cpoints\u201d that could be spent on Facebook paraphernalia like T-shirts.Staff turnover was high, they said. Most on the team were contractors, though some were full-time employees. That led to a sense of inequality between the two groups, some said. Starting annual salaries for contractors were in the mid-to-high $50,000s, according to former staff members.Facebook denied the allegations. In a demonstration of its internal tools this week at its headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., Facebook showed multiple layers of scrutiny by staff members that would make it extremely difficult for other workers not to notice an intentional manipulation of the system, nor was it likely to be technically possible.Former employees agree. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see any kind of intentional, outright bias,\u201d Mr. Fearnow said. \u201cThere were an amazing amount of steps taken to avoid that.\u201d He said he regularly wrote headlines and descriptions for far-right conservative sites or personalities that were visible on Trending Topics.Still, current and former Facebook employees said the personal judgment of curators was integral. Unconscious bias, they said, is tough to prevent. Facebook\u2019s 28-page editorial guidelines were also constantly updated and changed, former curators said, and engineers would tweak the product with little or no notice, making it difficult to keep up.Facebook said it was improving employee training to make its guidelines for news curators clearer, including renaming some of the more nefarious-sounding terminology in its guidelines, changing \u201cblacklist\u201d to \u201crevisit,\u201d and \u201cinjection\u201d to \u201ctopic correction.\u201d The company continues to investigate whether any curators intentionally tried to suppress conservative news.Executives said that for an experimental product, they got a lot wrong.\u201cThis is a relatively early product,\u201d Mr. Osofsky said. \u201cThere are aspects of it that clearly we\u2019re continuing to work on.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rise of Donald Trump Tracks Growing Debate Over Global Fascism", "Date": "2016-05-28", "News": "Supported byBut if it was a provocative analogy, it was not a lonely one. Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign has engendered impassioned debate about the nature of his appeal and warnings from critics on the left and the right about the potential rise of fascism in the United States. More strident opponents have likened Mr. Trump to Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini.To supporters, such comparisons are deeply unfair smear tactics used to tar conservatives and scare voters. For a bipartisan establishment whose foundation has been shaken by Mr. Trump\u2019s ascendance, these backers say, it is easier to delegitimize his support than to acknowledge widespread popular anger at the failure of both parties to confront the nation\u2019s challenges.\u201cThe crash of 2008 showed how globalization creates losers as well as winners,\u201d said Mark Leonard, the director of the European Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cIn many countries, middle-class wages are stagnant and politics has become a battle over a shrinking pie. Populists have replaced contests between left and right with a struggle between cosmopolitan elites and angry nativists.\u201dThat dislocation may not lead to a repeat of Europe in the 1930s, but it has fueled a debate about global political trends. There is a tendency at times to try to fit current movements into understandable constructs \u2014 some refer to terrorist groups in the Middle East as Islamofascists \u2014 but scholars say there is a spectrum that includes right-wing nationalism, illiberal democracy and populist autocracy.\u201cOn a world level, the situation that affects many countries is economic stagnation and the arrival of immigrants,\u201d said Robert O. Paxton, a professor emeritus at Columbia University and one of the most prominent scholars of fascism. \u201cThat\u2019s a one-two punch that democratic governments are having enormous trouble in meeting.\u201dMr. Trump dismisses the labels used by those like Mr. Weld, a longtime Republican now mounting a quixotic campaign for vice president as a Libertarian. \u201cI don\u2019t talk about his alcoholism,\u201d Mr. Trump said through a spokeswoman, \u201cso why would he talk about my foolishly perceived fascism? There is nobody less of a fascist than Donald Trump.\u201d (Mr. Weld, who in the 1990s reportedly appeared in public a few times having had too much to drink, declined to respond: \u201cI\u2019ll let that ride.\u201d)Americans are used to the idea that other countries may be vulnerable to such movements, but while figures like Father Charles Coughlin, the demagogic radio broadcaster, enjoyed wide followings in the 1930s, neither major party has ever nominated anyone quite like Mr. Trump.\u201cThis could be one of those moments that\u2019s quite dangerous and we\u2019ll look back and wonder why we treated it as ho-hum at a time when we could have stopped it,\u201d said Robert Kagan, a scholar at the Brookings Institution known for hawkish internationalism.\u201cDo you want to be associated with a fascist?\u201d Mr. Todd asked.\u201cNo,\u201d Mr. Trump answered, \u201cI want to be associated with interesting quotes.\u201d He added: \u201cAnd certainly, hey, it got your attention, didn\u2019t it?\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s allies dismiss the criticism as politically motivated and historically suspect. The former House speaker Newt Gingrich, who has said he would consider being Mr. Trump\u2019s running mate, said in an interview that he was \u201cdeeply offended\u201d by what he called \u201cutterly ignorant\u201d comparisons.\u201cTrump does not have a political structure in the sense that the fascists did,\u201d said Mr. Gingrich, a onetime college professor who earned his doctorate in modern European history. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have the sort of ideology that they did. He has nobody who resembles the brownshirts. This is all just garbage.\u201dBeyond Hitler and Mussolini, fascism can be hard to define. Since World War II, only fringe figures have overtly identified themselves that way. In modern political discourse, the word is used as an epithet. And even Hitler and Mussolini were elastic in their political philosophies as they came to power; Mussolini started out as a leftist.Mr. Paxton, the fascism scholar, said he saw similarities and differences in Mr. Trump. His message about an America in decline and his us-against-them pronouncements about immigrants and outsiders echo Europe in the 1930s, Mr. Paxton said. On the other hand, he said, Mr. Trump has hardly created uniformed, violent youth groups. Moreover, fascists believe in strong state control, not get-government-off-your-back individualism and deregulation.Others caution against comparisons. \u201cI read Kagan\u2019s piece, of course,\u201d said Volker Perthes, the director of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, in Berlin. \u201cAll the phenomena he describes are raising concerns, but I would still not call Trump or his campaign fascist. Maybe with German and European history in mind, we are a bit more cautious than others in using the label \u2018fascism.\u2019\u201dMr. Perthes said real fascism requires two more elements \u2014 an outright rejection of democracy and a harsher definition of order. Jobbik, the ultraright party in Hungary, would fall into this category, he said, but Norbert Hofer, the far-right candidate who narrowly lost the Austrian presidential vote, and Mr. Trump would not.Charles Grant, the director of the Center for European Reform, in London, distinguished between far-right nationalist parties like Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Front in France and actual fascism.\u201cHistorically, it means the demonization of minorities within a society to the extent that they feel insecure,\u201d he said. \u201cIt means encouraging the use of violence against critics. It means a bellicose foreign policy that may lead to war, to excite a nationalist feeling. It takes xenophobia to extremes. And it is contemptuous of a rules-based liberal order.\u201dThe debate about terminology may ignore the seriousness of the conditions that gave rise to Mr. Trump and his European counterparts. The New York real estate developer has tapped into a deep discontent in a country where many feel left behind while Wall Street banks get bailouts, newcomers take jobs, terrorists threaten innocents and China rises economically at America\u2019s expense.\u201cIt seems to me in developed and semideveloped countries there is emerging a new kind of politics for which maybe the best taxonomic category would be right-wing populist nationalism,\u201d said Stanley Payne, a professor emeritus at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \u201cWe are seeing a new kind of phenomenon which is different from what you had\u201d in the 20th century.Roger Eatwell, a professor at the University of Bath, in England, calls it \u201cilliberal democracy,\u201d a form of government that keeps the trappings of democracy without the reality.\u201cElections are seen as important to legitimizing regimes,\u201d he said, but instead of imposing one-party rule, as in the past, today\u2019s authoritarians \u201cuse a variety of devices to control and/or manipulate the media, intimidate opponents\u201d and so on.Either way, it has found pockets of support on both sides of the Atlantic. Lilia Shevtsova, a political analyst in Moscow, said neo-fascism in liberal societies in the West stems from crisis or dysfunction while in illiberal countries like Russia and Turkey it reflects an attempt to fill the void left by the failure of Western notions to catch on.The problem, she added, is that \u201cthe Western political leadership at the moment is too weak to fight the tide.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple, Set to Move to Its Spaceship, Should Try More Moonshots", "Date": "2016-05-04", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtApple is running out of parking spaces. If you drop by its Infinite Loop headquarters, you will find the place stretched beyond capacity. Even the valets, who double and triple-park the Teslas and Porsches that now flock to the world\u2019s most valuable company, have given up finding free spots.That is still true. Several analysts project that over the next year, Apple\u2019s iPhone sales will return to slow growth rather than decline, which should keep its bottom line at its current stratospheric level.But you don\u2019t build spaceship-shaped corporate monuments on the prospect of doing just fine. The deeper question is whether Apple can keep its place as the North Star of the tech firmament. Can the company build the next great platform in computing, as it did the last one? Are its best days ahead of it, as Timothy D. Cook, the chief executive, insists \u2014 or is the new campus the capstone of an era of Apple dominance that we will never see again?I will offer a suggestion. To thrive in the next era of tech, Apple needs to take a series of bigger, bolder risks.But the next moment in tech is likely to be dominated by data-driven online services \u2014 more products like Siri and Apple Pay, fewer stand-alone hardware innovations like the iPhone.In that environment, the slow search for precision and perfection might no longer be in Apple\u2019s best interest. Mr. Cook\u2019s goal, now, should be to alter Apple\u2019s governing ethos to induce a small measure of chaos into his company.It is likely that Apple is already working on some bold plans in secret (a car and a pay TV service are among several that have long been reported). The shift I\u2019m calling for would not be radical, just evolutionary. It should be more nimble and slightly more public with its experiments, and push more of them out sooner. When it releases stuff, it should move faster to fix and improve what is wrong. Above all, it should take more risks; it should say yes more often.These changes will be difficult because they could upset Apple\u2019s customer base and its brand. Experimenting more means failing more, usually in public. Failing means looking bad, and looking bad isn\u2019t something Apple does well.In this environment, the best new products are not likely to be obvious. They will most likely be ridiculed at first and they may actually be kind of useless in early versions. But over time, with brainstorming and updates based on consumer feedback, you might discover something precious.Apple has accumulated many of the pieces to create technologies of the future. It has expertise in voice recognition, data mining, wearables, and of course, hardware and software design. Most importantly, it also has a huge installed base of users who willingly try its newest products.What it doesn\u2019t have quite yet is enough of an appetite for the speed and risks that come with creating and maintaining new services. Some of its sins here have been unforgivable. Siri was one of the earliest voice-recognition technologies released to the public. It wasn\u2019t perfect when it came out and Apple has made slow improvements over time. Today\u2019s Siri is vastly more powerful than yesterday\u2019s.But it still feels like a missed opportunity. There is so much Siri should be able to do that it cannot. Why can\u2019t Siri plug into more parts of my phone? Why can\u2019t it tap into the Uber app to call a car for me, or start up HBO Now when I say, \u201cHey, show me last week\u2019s \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019?\u201dI\u2019m not sure I quite buy Mr. Thompson\u2019s thesis about the cause of some of Apple\u2019s mistakes in its online services. It is not clear that Apple needs a wholesale restructuring rather than simply a greater push from Mr. Cook to be bolder in these products.It is important to note, too, that Apple has very patient customers and that the overall value of its ecosystem often makes up for particular deficits in some of its services. Consider Apple Music, a subscription music service that offered no great improvements over competing services like Spotify. Yet despite being late to market and not as pleasant to use as rivals, Apple Music has snapped up 13 million subscribers paying $120 a year.\u201cIt\u2019s already become a $2 billion business, and it did not exist last year,\u201d said Kulbinder Garcha, an analyst at Credit Suisse who has said that Apple can realize significant growth in its profits by creating and improving online services. If Apple moves quickly to fix some of the problems with Apple Music \u2014 cleaning up its user interface, adding handy features like Spotify\u2019s in-app lyrics browser \u2014 it could easily build on that early growth.\u201cThese things don\u2019t have to be a hit from day one, but what\u2019s important is that they keep learning from their mistakes and keep updating them,\u201d Mr. Garcha said. In other words, Be faster, take more risks, go bold.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pentagon Turns to Silicon Valley for Edge in Artificial Intelligence", "Date": "2016-05-11", "News": "Supported byMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. \u2014 In its quest to maintain a United States military advantage, the Pentagon is aggressively turning to Silicon Valley\u2019s hottest technology \u2014 artificial intelligence.On Wednesday, Secretary of Defense Ashton B. Carter made his fourth trip to the tech industry\u2019s heartland since being named to his post last year. Before that, it had been 20 years since a defense secretary had visited the area, he noted in a speech at a Defense Department research facility near Google\u2019s headquarters.Third Offset is a reference to two earlier eras when Pentagon planners turned to technology to compensate for a smaller military. In the 1950s, President Eisenhower emphasized nuclear weapons as a deterrence to larger Warsaw Pact armies. A second \u201coffset\u201d occurred in the 1970s and \u201980s when military planners turned to improved technology in conventional weapons to again compensate for smaller numbers.This time, Mr. Carter acknowledged, the United States faces significant challenges in translating civilian innovation into a military advantage, since the country will neither control nor determine the path of artificial intelligence.\u201cThat\u2019s different than 30 or 40 or 50 years ago when we expected to control the pace of technology,\u201d he said on Wednesday in a speech at the Pentagon\u2019s nearly year-old Defense Innovation Unit Experimental facility, otherwise known by the techie acronym DIUx. \u201cThat\u2019s not true anymore, but we still can stay the best military with respect to applications of A.I.\u201dIn recent weeks, Deputy Defense Secretary Robert O. Work has repeatedly emphasized the importance of A.I.-related technologies that he believes will help create a new class of \u201cIron Man\u201d-style fighters armed with increasingly smart weapons.The Defense Department will need Silicon Valley\u2019s help with that technology. And Mr. Carter indicated that bridge building with local companies was a key reason the new Pentagon office he visited on Wednesday will now report directly to him.The Defense Department has always had a close relationship with some of tech\u2019s biggest companies. The Hewlett-Packard co-founder David Packard, for example, served as deputy secretary of defense in the Nixon administration.Many companies still count the Pentagon and intelligence agencies among their biggest customers. A venture fund backed by the Central Intelligence Agency has been investing in tech companies since the dot-com boom of the late 1990s.But younger Silicon Valley executives, particularly those in A.I. research, have shown little interest in seeing their new technology used by the military.The depiction of defense weapons that fire without a human operator raised alarms among arms control advocates and some military strategists who worry that the line between offensive and defensive uses of smart weapons will be difficult to maintain.\u201cWe need to figure out where to draw the line and we need to stay on the right side of it,\u201d said Stuart J. Russell, an A.I. specialist at the University of California, Berkeley who is a leader in a movement to ban autonomous weapons.In fact, turning over killing decisions to machines is seen by some technologists and military strategists as inviting a new and possibly destabilizing arms race.\u201cI\u2019m not as confident that we can clearly delineate between offensive and defensive weapons, in general,\u201d said Paul Scharre, a weapons analyst at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington-based policy group. \u201cIf there was an easy way to do that, nations would have agreed long ago to only build \u2018defensive\u2019 weapons.\u201dDespite skepticism among some in the tech community, the Pentagon has played a key role in one of the best-known examples of A.I., the self-driving vehicle concepts now championed by companies like Google and Uber.Beginning in 2004, Darpa, the Pentagon\u2019s advanced research agency, tried to speed progress in autonomous vehicles by hosting a series of three autonomous vehicle \u201cGrand Challenges.\u201d The effort set off a wave of commercial research and development, but it fell short of a goal to remove United States soldiers from hazardous roles on the battlefield.Military contractors say that self-driving technology has now advanced to the point where a human soldier could sit in the driver\u2019s seat in the last vehicle in a truck convoy, safely controlling a series of vehicles. Despite technology demonstrations, however, the American military has not yet committed to converting existing trucks to such a system.Mr. Carter\u2019s background could provide him with cachet among Silicon Valley\u2019s tech elite. He received a doctorate in theoretical physics from Oxford University and has been a lecturer at the Stanford Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies and a visiting fellow at the university\u2019s Hoover Institution, just a few miles from where he gave his speech on Wednesday.In addition to changing the reporting structure of the DIUx group, which occupies a sprawling facility opposite a NASA wind tunnel and adjacent to Silicon Valley\u2019s busy Highway 101, Mr. Carter pointed to a range of initiatives that he was undertaking in an effort to make the Defense Department\u2019s culture more like that of Silicon Valley.\u201cWe\u2019re taking a page straight from the Silicon Valley playbook, we\u2019re iterating rapidly to make DIUx even better,\u201d he said. Borrowing a bit of tech industry lingo, he said the Pentagon planned to create additional organizations in other regions of the country that the Defense Department considered to be \u201cinnovation hubs.\u201d He said the next office would be opened in the Boston area, another hotbed of A.I. research centered on Harvard and M.I.T.\u201cI\u2019ve been pushing the Pentagon to think outside our five-sided box and invest aggressively in change and innovation,\u201d he said, adding that the Defense Department\u2019s proposed research and development budget for the 2017 fiscal year was more than double the combined R.&D. spending of Apple, Google and Intel in the last year.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Apple Pay and Other Mobile Wallets Beat Chip Cards", "Date": "2016-05-04", "News": "Supported byTech FixEvery weekend, when Pierre Houle works the brunch shift at Olea, a neighborhood restaurant in San Francisco, many customers want to split the tab on multiple credit cards, a process that takes much longer than it used to.For waiters like Mr. Houle, diners going Dutch is nothing new. But now he has to take each of the credit cards, insert them into a chip reader and wait about 10 seconds for every transaction to process. In the past, he could swipe a card, wait a few seconds, print out the receipt and get going.\u201cIt isn\u2019t much, but in the restaurant world it can be enormous,\u201d he said. \u201cI have to wait there, and I can\u2019t go check on something else. You need to move all the time when you do a job like that.\u201dThat means if a criminal swipes a counterfeit credit card to buy something, the merchant now has to pay for it. The sweeping change has compelled many retailers to upgrade their equipment to read chips, which have stronger security than the easy-to-forge magnetic stripe. By the end of this year, about 80 percent of all credit cards in the United States should include chips, according to a new report by the fraud prevention company Iovation and the research firm Aite Group.The chip initially may annoy consumers. For most chip transactions, you have to dip the credit card into a slot and wait for the transaction to be approved before you can remove it and scribble your signature.\u201cContrary to what Tim Cook said when Apple rolled out Apple Pay, consumers have been swiping their cards for a long time and it\u2019s not that hard,\u201d said Julie Conroy, a research director for the Aite Group.I tested chip cards and each of the mobile payments services in three different stores: Walgreens, BevMo and Nancy Boy, a small beauty supply store in San Francisco. I inserted a chip card or tapped a phone and timed how long it took each transaction to be approved and start printing a receipt. The results varied slightly, but the mobile wallets were generally much faster than the chip.At Walgreens, after I inserted a chip card, the transaction took eight seconds before a receipt started printing; Apple Pay and Samsung Pay took three seconds; and Android Pay (Google\u2019s service) took seven seconds. At BevMo, the chip payment took 10 seconds; Samsung Pay took four seconds and Android Pay and Apple Pay each took five seconds. At Nancy Boy, the chip took eight seconds, and all the mobile payment services tied at 2.4 seconds.What is happening with the chip to make it so slow? When you dip in the card, the chip generates a one-time code, which is sent to the bank over a network. The bank confirms the code and sends verification back to the terminal. With mobile wallets, the same thing is basically happening in the background. They generate one-time tokens that are sent out and approved by the banks.In the last two years, Apple, Samsung and Google have released mobile wallets, and we decided to test how well these new technologies work. Here\u2019s a rundown of how the mobile wallets compare and where they are accepted.Stephanie Ericksen, a Visa executive who works on security solutions for new payment technologies, says the sluggishness of the chip is largely a perception issue. The actual transaction time behind a mobile payment and a chip card is the same.But with the chip, most merchant terminals require you to leave the card inside the reader until the transaction is complete and wait for a screen to tell you that you can remove the card. With the mobile payments, you can just tap the phone, and there is no extra screen telling you to remove the phone, which partly explains why the transaction appears to move along more quickly.Mobile wallets feel faster, more convenient and less awkward to use than the chip, so you should use them whenever possible. The caveat, of course, is that not every merchant that takes credit cards also accepts mobile payments.To see if the wallet is supported at a store, you will have to look out for Apple Pay or Android Pay logos on cash registers, or a logo of a hand holding a card in front of a wireless signal, which means contactless payments are supported.That brings us to the differences among the mobile wallets. They all work about the same \u2014 take your phone out, enter your passcode or fingerprint and tap the terminal \u2014 and they have their pros and cons.Samsung Pay is accepted by the most merchants because it uses magnetic secure transmission, a technology that emits a magnetic signal to mimic the magnetic stripe, meaning it can be used on most credit-card readers. Samsung Pay also supports payments made wirelessly with near-field communications, for NFC, a technology that enables devices to exchange information wirelessly over short distances.Apple Pay is supported by more banks than the Samsung and Android wallets. (I was surprised, for instance, that I could not add a Chase card to Android Pay). Android Pay\u2019s advantage is it is available on the broadest array of devices. It can run on most Android phones that support NFC, whereas Samsung Pay can only be installed on Samsung phones and Apple Pay can only run on iPhones and the Apple Watch.In a statement, Samsung said Samsung Pay was the most accepted mobile payment service and it \u201cdramatically decreases opportunities for fraud.\u201d Google\u2019s senior director for Android Pay, Pali Bhat, said, \u201cWe want Android Pay to be available everywhere, and everywhere means as many devices as we can support.\u201dJennifer Bailey, vice president of Apple Pay, said, \u201cUsers tell us they love the convenience and speed of paying with their iPhone or Apple Watch.\u201dIn rare cases, there can be a long wait before you take your chip card back. Mr. Houle, the restaurant waiter, also works part time at the beauty supply store Nancy Boy. He recounted an incident in the store when he dipped a chip card for a customer who left before he could hand it back. He tracked her down on Facebook and mailed it to her in New York three days later.\u201cIt was my fault as much as hers,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: The Rise of the \u2018Matchmakers\u2019 of the Digital Economy", "Date": "2016-05-20", "News": "Supported byBook EntryMany of the young giants of the digital economy share a common characteristic. They are platforms that provide valued connections among their participants. The nature of those connections and the value they provide vary widely.Both Google and Facebook \u2013 together approaching $1 trillion in market value \u2014 are in the business of connecting advertisers to consumers, but their platforms and business models are very different.Another trillion-dollar pair, Apple and Microsoft, have followed similarly divergent paths in monetizing their respective platforms: Both own operating systems that connect application developers and users. And \u201cplatform\u201d businesses of various stripes seem to represent a disproportionate share of the market\u2019s hot tech start-ups, like Uber, Airbnb, Pinterest and Snapchat.A surprising number of business books have been published in the last few months that seek to explore the origins and implications of the emergence of the platform paradigm. The great virtue of the best of these, \u201cMatchmakers: The New Economics of Multisided Platforms\u201d (Harvard Business Review) by David S. Evans and Richard Schmalensee, is that it reminds us that there is nothing new about multisided platforms \u2013 which the authors call matchmaker businesses.The \u201cnew economics\u201d mentioned in the subtitle refers to what the authors misleadingly call the \u201cdiscovery\u201d of multisided businesses by fellow economists in 2000. Although the research cited was certainly important in understanding the dynamics of multisided markets, advertising-based media businesses have successfully operated in these environments for literally hundreds of years.An old-world media example quickly makes clear the unusual management challenges of operating multisided-platform businesses. To be successful, newspaper and magazine publishers need to attract both readers and advertisers, who represent the two sides of the platform. In most instances, however, to optimize overall profits, publishers must subsidize one side of the market. Rarely does the price of a subscription cover even the incremental cost of printing and distribution of the publication.This does not reflect a rookie mistake but a nuanced understanding of the tradeoffs between circulation and advertising revenue. If managers ignore the interaction between the different sides of a multisided market in developing pricing strategies, they will inevitably arrive at erroneous conclusions. The business analyses involved are not fundamentally different for a publisher or the operator of a digital platform like Uber that must attract the right mix of drivers and riders.But what has changed in the world to make these models apparently so much more prevalent? \u201cMatchmakers\u201d identifies \u201csix turbocharging technologies\u201d that it claims have \u201cturbocharged the ancient matchmaker model.\u201dSpecifically, the authors argue that the combined impact of improvements in computing power, bandwidth, networking and storage capacity have allowed the establishment of \u201ctwo foundational multisided platforms\u201d that support all the others that have rapidly emerged: Internet service providers (who provide the fixed and mobile connections among platform participants) and operating systems (which provide the common language that allow app developers to achieve mass adoption).History aside, the heart of \u201cMatchmakers\u201d is an entrepreneurial playbook of sorts for \u201cbuilding, igniting and operating matchmakers.\u201d The strongest part of the book is the detailed description of diverse platform business models, both new and old, some of which readers might not have even previously thought of as \u201cmatchmakers.\u201dFor instance, South Florida\u2019s upscale Aventura Mall is really a platform for commerce between retailers and shoppers. To succeed, the developer had to take into account land values, local demographics, nearby alternatives, which retailers and entertainment services to target and what and how to charge them, and the physical design. Similar complexity faced the founders of M-Pesa, a mobile money transfer service in Kenya that in the course of three years counted 42 percent of the adult population as registered users and transformed that economy.The problem with many of the books about the rise of the so-called platform economy is that they are filled with an unbridled optimism about the collective attractiveness of these businesses, particularly in their digital incarnations. Sure, they argue, incumbents will be disrupted, but in their stead will be bigger, stronger competitors in winner-take-all markets.They focus on \u201cnetwork effects,\u201d which can create a virtuous circle \u2013 sometimes called a flywheel effect \u2013 as new users on one side of a platform attract more on another and vice versa. The crucial attribute of network effects businesses is that every new participant increases the value of the network to existing participants.Alex Moazed and Nicholas L. Johnson are the consultants turned authors of \u201cModern Monopolies: What It Takes to Dominate the 21st Century Economy\u201d (St. Martins). Their book promises the same \u201cframeworks and insights we use to help our clients become modern monopolies.\u201d In their telling, the history of \u201cplatform capitalism\u201d appears to have started with eBay, which in part explains the inability of their \u201cframeworks\u201d to deliver on the assurance of market domination.\u201cPlatform Revolution: How Networked Markets Are Transforming the Economy and How to Make Them Work For You\u201d (Norton), another book written by industry consultants \u2014 these mostly with day jobs in academia \u2014 provides an even more expansive vision of the \u201crevolution\u201d wrought by the emergence of network effects as \u201cthe Internet-era source of market power,\u201d which \u201cis likely to strengthen a market\u2019s winner take all tendency.\u201dThe book\u2019s authors \u2014 Geoffrey Parker, Marshall W. Van Alstyne and Sangeet Paul Choudary \u2014 argue that the ascension of platform business models requires a fundamental rethinking of things as diverse as basic business strategy and government regulation. Their wide-ranging vision and predictions are undermined by frequent factual errors. For example, Sony does not own Time Warner movie and television studios, and Netflix does not have strong network effects.Even \u201cMatchmakers,\u201d which offers the most balanced picture of the challenges and opportunities of multisided platforms, plays down the structural fragility faced by all of the \u201cturbocharged\u201d matchmakers described. Mr. Evans and Mr. Schmalensee insist that \u201cnetwork effects power all multisided platforms.\u201d What\u2019s more, according to them, the digital developments recounted \u201chave resulted in a huge increase in the power and reach of these effects.\u201d Neither statement is true.First, plenty of multisided platforms do not have any significant network effects to speak of. A popular TV show attracts both viewers and advertisers, but it is the quality of the programming, not the presence of more advertisers, that keeps the audience coming back. TV and cable broadcasting networks, like most ad-based media businesses, are multisided platforms, but they have negligible network effects. Google, the mightiest exception to the digital fragility rule, is a platform business that does not benefit primarily from network effects but rather from traditional economies of scale.Second, the strength of network effects is often a function of the existence of reinforcing competitive advantages like economies of scale and, notably, customer captivity. The digital economy has undermined both of these barriers to entry by lowering both customer switching costs and the fixed-cost base that drives scale economies.So the Aventura Mall benefits from the long-term leases signed by retailers on the one hand and the fact that local shoppers need to go out of their way to find a comparable experience. Operators of digital malls, by contrast, rarely secure long-term commitments from either advertisers or sellers, and shoppers have multiple alternatives just a click away. And the fixed costs expended to build a traditional mall could easily fund many dozens of digital retail platforms.Even the authors of \u201cModern Monopolies\u201d concede that \u201ca modern monopoly\u2019s dominance\u201d is likely to be short-lived given \u201cthe competitive threat it faces from adjacent competitors and a constant onslaught of new entrants.\u201dAll three books provide useful, and mostly consistent, insights into how to build more resilient and valuable platforms. The diversity of businesses and outcomes described, however, suggest that the differences among platform businesses are far more important than their commonalities. This is at least good news for consumers who will benefit from multiplying innovations that reduce the annoying frictions of everyday life and the consultants who will be kept busy helping managers devise ways to prolong their increasingly tenuous perch as master of a modern monopoly.Jonathan A.

{"Headline": "China Quietly Targets U.S. Tech Companies in Security Reviews", "Date": "2016-05-16", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Chinese authorities are quietly scrutinizing technology products sold in China by Apple and other big foreign companies, focusing on whether they pose potential security threats to the country and its consumers and opening up a new front in an already tense relationship with Washington over digital security.Apple and other companies in recent months have been subjected to reviews that target encryption and the data storage of tech products, said people briefed on the reviews who spoke on the condition of anonymity. In the reviews, Chinese officials require executives or employees of the foreign tech companies to answer questions about the products in person, according to these people.The reviews are run by a committee associated with the Cyberspace Administration of China, the country\u2019s Internet control bureau, they said. The bureau includes experts and engineers with ties to the country\u2019s military and security agencies.While other countries, including the United States and Britain, conduct reviews of some tech products, they usually focus on products that will be used by the military or other parts of the government that are concerned with security, and not on products sold to the general public.The Chinese reviews stand out because they are being applied more broadly, including to American consumer software and gadgets popular in China, the people briefed on the reviews said. And because Chinese officials have not disclosed the nature of the checks, both the United States government and American tech companies fear that the reviews could be used to extract tech knowledge as well as ensure that the United States was not using the products to spy.Ultimately, the reviews could be used to block products without explanation or to extract trade secrets in exchange for market access. Those secrets could be leaked to Chinese competitors or expose vulnerabilities, which, in turn, Chinese hackers could exploit.Further, tech companies are concerned that the reviews could set a precedent and that other countries will follow suit, each demanding different checks that would not only be costly but also put the companies at risk of having to hand over further secrets in exchange for market access.China and the United States have been embroiled in a quarrel about tech and security that has strained their relationship. The reviews could be a fresh sticking point, raising questions about the security of American technology and the degree to which American companies will acquiesce to Beijing\u2019s demands for fear of being punished in a huge market still partly controlled by the state.Chinese officials have not formally disclosed that they are conducting the reviews, and their existence has not been previously confirmed outside of rare, brief mentions in local news media.It is not clear specifically what Chinese authorities are demanding as part of the process. There is no indication that foreign companies have provided access to highly guarded material such as source code \u2014 the digital underpinnings of software \u2014 or other commercial secrets.The lack of disclosure by China\u2019s government has made it hard for the United States government to voice its objections, and has fed concerns that China is quietly carrying out further policies to target American technology companies.China\u2019s Internet regulators suggested the possibility of reviews three years ago, after revelations by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, concerning surveillance escalated tensions between China and the United States over computer security.Since then, China has quietly begun carrying out the reviews. That represents a shift in the way China manages foreign technology. Its previous efforts came through proposed new rules and other public measures that let foreign companies and governments resist.China relies on American technology products, even as it has made clear that it is concerned about the security of those products. A majority of Chinese government offices, state-owned enterprises and other institutions that handle potentially secret information, like universities and research institutes, use Microsoft Windows. Most smartphones in China run software made by either Apple or Google. And the high-end computing that supports China\u2019s banks, energy companies and military uses, in part, American-designed chips and servers.China\u2019s tougher tone is part of a broader challenge that governments around the world are posing to the technology industry over issues like privacy and encryption. In the United States, federal law enforcement officials have pressed Apple to help them gain access to encrypted iPhones even as the Obama administration has resisted Chinese policies that would require similar access.Under President Xi Jinping, China has taken steps to keep tabs on technology from American companies and reduce the nation\u2019s dependence on it.For foreign companies, the other option could be worse.\u201cOne viewpoint holds that we must close ourselves off, make a fresh start, thoroughly shake off our reliance on foreign technology and rely on indigenous innovation to pursue development,\u201d Mr. Xi said, according to a transcript of the speech. \u201cOtherwise, we would always follow in the footsteps of others, and would never be able to catch up.\u201dMr. Xi ultimately said China must find a middle ground and determine \u201cwhich things can be imported but have to be secure and controllable; which things may be imported, digested and absorbed for re-innovation; which things can be developed in collaboration with others; and for which things we must rely on our own strength and indigenous innovation.\u201dWhile details on the tech reviews are scant, commentary from the state-run China Daily in 2014 suggested that companies affected could include Cisco Systems and Microsoft. Other state news media has said the reviews will prevent product suppliers from \u201cillegally controlling, interfering in or interrupting user systems, or illegally collecting, storing, handling or exploiting information about users.\u201dCisco and Microsoft declined to comment on the Chinese media statements. Apple also declined to comment.\u201cAs the world connects to the Internet, various forms of attacks and new defensive technologies are ever multiplying, bringing challenges to China\u2019s development of a new digital industry,\u201d the group said.Paul Mozur reported from Hong Kong and Jane Perlez from Beijing.

{"Headline": "After Conventions, a Debt to Donors", "Date": "2016-05-11", "News": "Supported byEditorialIndustries with business before the federal government have long found opening their checkbooks for the conventions to be one of the most efficient means for influencing an incoming administration and Congress in one quick action.Come July, some of America\u2019s best-known companies will pay to celebrate the nomination of Donald Trump, whose racist rants have in the past caused NBC, Macy\u2019s and Nascar to distance themselves from him. Progressive political groups like ColorOfChange.org and Credo Action are pressuring Coca-Cola, Walmart, Microsoft, Facebook and Google to cut off money for the Republican gathering. But the protest against Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t address the deeper problem of corporate influence over both parties.The ITT scandal prompted legislation that provided public financing for conventions, and limited their budgets to that amount. But the parties soon found multiple ways around that, including using \u201chost committees\u201d that operate in the cities where the conventions are held, soliciting unlimited amounts of convention money from corporations and wealthy individuals. These committees, established to skirt federal laws banning corporations from giving to political parties directly, should be abolished.The law shifted ever-escalating convention costs onto rich donors and corporations like Google, Facebook, Duke Energy, Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Bank of America, General Motors and AT&T, which were all past contributors. Corporations can give unlimited cash, services and swag to Democratic and Republican host committees for conventions that basically are four-day-long parties. Shareholders in these companies pick up the tab since the money comes directly from corporate coffers.This year, the two political parties together will most likely spend upward of $150 million on their conventions, all of it paid by private entities.Lawyers who advise corporations on campaign finance laws say that so far, most previous corporate donors will continue financing both conventions, eager to ensure that they\u2019re covered regardless of which party takes the White House in November. \u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous system that creates widespread opportunities for influence peddling,\u201d says Fred Wertheimer, who leads Democracy 21, a campaign finance watchdog group.Convention spending is part and parcel of the creeping corporate buyout of America\u2019s political system. In a year marked by voter anger at a political class out of touch with struggling Americans, one might expect both Republicans and Democrats to rein it in. But as with all political spending, the tendency is always toward more, not less. That publicly held companies seeking favors from the government will underwrite this excess is offensive, and entirely legal.Advertisement"}

He\u2019s addressed a handful below.I hasten to add, though, that I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s easy, possible or sensible to divide the world into good schools and bad schools, because the education a student gets has every bit as much to do with the control he or she seizes over it, the experiences he or she demands, the thoroughness and cleverness with which he or she surveys the landscape of that school and figures out how to till it to the best of his or her advantage.In fact, I\u2019ve met graduates of supposedly \u201clesser\u201d schools who, because they felt it incumbent on them to maximize that experience, got more out of their higher education than an elite-school student who felt that he or she could just coast through, absorbing the glory of it all by osmosis.More specifically to your question: There can be a short-term risk to going to a foreign school that\u2019s unfamiliar to some American employers, who aren\u2019t accustomed to hiring from there, might not be entirely confident of its instruction and graduates, and might assume, wrongly, that the student was having a grand lark. But I think that\u2019s offset by several advantages, and so I think considering schools outside the United States is a fine idea for students who have the maturity and confidence to travel that far from home.*********I looked at that and then I thought about what I\u2019d seen in more than 25 years of journalism, during which I\u2019d had an array of beats and interviewed and written about hundreds of successful people across scores of disciplines. Those people\u2019s lives did not include the common thread of fancy undergraduate diplomas. Some had such diplomas. Many \u2014 probably more \u2014 didn\u2019t. So there was a disconnect between the myth of Ivy importance and the reality of distinguished careers and contented lives forged in an infinity of ways.

The online platform in and of itself won\u2019t guarantee that broadening: Kids need to have instructors, mentors and counselors in their lives who make them aware of the platform and guide them toward it. Do they? Will they? This project will be only as successful as follow-up efforts to put this new tool in the hands that it\u2019s supposedly designed for.***Mr. Bruni, my friend\u2019s stepfather is a Stanford professor. He says that, as a matter of unwritten policy, Stanford and the other Ivy\u2019s take a view of their student bodies which is much different from mainstream universities. Stanford sees its students not as competitors striving to prove themselves scholastically and earn their success within the school, but as clients \u2014 clients to be serviced with a level of academic credential and institutional support that will enable them to reach greater heights in life than normal people. Consider that A\u2019s and A-minuses are the most common grades at many if not most of the elite institutions, except perhaps in the sciences. Consider the amount of attention and money lavished on student services and student facilities that exist to the side of, and sometimes far from the heart of, the primary academic mission. Consider the impulse on many campuses to keep away speakers and purge conversations that upset prevailing sensibilities. Consider trigger warnings, which aren\u2019t as widespread as the media sometimes suggests but which do exist and are emblematic of something larger.Why shouldn\u2019t every student crave this experience? Because it may not be the right preparation for work and for life, which aren\u2019t as forgiving and coddling. Because high standards and demanding appraisals are often what exhort you to your best achievements and best self. The list goes on.***But that\u2019s not the gist of your question, which seems to be: Is higher education even worth it? I fervently believe so, and most people who pursue higher education don\u2019t rack up the number and diversity of degrees that you did, a cluster that may well be excessive. (It depends on what was required for your job and what motivated you to get those degrees.)There remain many employers who, rightly or wrongly, won\u2019t look at someone without a college diploma. There are many fields that require specific graduate degrees, and those graduate programs can\u2019t be breached without a college diploma.So as a job credential, college still matters very much. But college isn\u2019t just or even principally vocational, and though I understand the reasons, I\u2019m frustrated by how much of the conversation about college centers on its immediate, measurable utility and some blunt, dollars-and-cents cost/benefit analysis. College ideally doesn\u2019t just pave the way toward a career but also paves the way toward more informed citizenship, more enlightened thinking, a better understanding of who you are and a better understanding of the world around you. It\u2019s giving you tools for an engaged, thoughtful life. It\u2019s exercising the muscle (so to speak) of your mind as surely as daily running exercises your heart.There\u2019s surely a point at or after which more education becomes self-indulgent. I don\u2019t think that point arrives at the end of high school.***Such polishing concentrates kids\u2019 efforts on a very narrow spectrum of pursuits that play to their strengths and that are mastered with pure discipline, diligence and plotting. It doesn\u2019t necessarily foster or reward creativity. It doesn\u2019t acknowledge the importance of spontaneity, serendipity, setback, resilience and (to use the coinage du jour) grit in life and in eventual success. I think frequently of something that a former admissions director at Pomona said to me, because it\u2019s something that other elite-school faculty members and administrators have also told me: They recruit and admit young men and women who are fantastic on paper but who are in fact very fragile, because they\u2019ve flourished in a very particular way and in a very particular climate, with the illusion of complete control, and they don\u2019t know how to pivot to new circumstances and turn on a dime.Go with a college that will, as I said in another answer in this discussion, fill in the blanks of your life, expanding you and showing you new things rather than just validating who you already are and replicating your high school. Appraise the diversity at the colleges you\u2019re considering: More diverse is better, because that means you\u2019ll confront a wider range of perspectives, and such a range is key to education. If there\u2019s an option that involves significantly less debt on the far end, give special consideration to that. Pay attention to which schools the adults in your life whom you find most interesting went to (not just the schools that the highest earners went to). Use the Internet enterprisingly and creatively, to get a real-time sense of what students at and recent alumni of a school think about the experience there.***But you touch on a wider point that\u2019s crucial and a big part of my push for people to stop obsessing on only a handful of schools: The skills you learn, the intelligence you build and the demonstration that you can make of your usefulness to an employer are going to be more important, broadly speaking, than the name of the school on your diploma. So focus on those, whether that\u2019s online or on a campus.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Audi\u2019s Virtual Cockpit, Technology Is Your Co-Pilot", "Date": "2016-05-19", "News": "Supported byTHE video game experience has arrived in the automobile.It\u2019s called the virtual cockpit and, starting with Audi, it will become a more common feature in cars in the not too distant future.Gone are the traditional mechanical dials \u2014 the speedometer, the tachometer, the various gauges and pointers \u2014 and in their place is a 12.3-inch LCD screen that houses an animated instrument cluster.The high-resolution screen, which lights up behind the steering wheel, directly in the driver\u2019s line of sight, can be programmed to show several functions \u2014 for navigation, a cellphone, radio and media, Google Earth 3-D graphics, and traffic data. That is in addition to the usual functions of showing speed, engine revolutions, outside temperature and the gas level.By any standard, it\u2019s an abundance of information, all on one screen. But it also has some drivers and experts asking: How much is too much, and will consumers understand it?Paul A. Green, a research professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s Transportation Research Institute, expressed concern over displays.\u201cOne of the principles here is that displays that people use while driving generally should not be dynamic,\u201d said Mr. Green, who said that he had not spent any time auditioning the system. \u201cIt becomes like a movie that you\u2019re watching, and anything that adds even a half a second or so is problematic.\u201dAudi said that a central objective in designing the virtual cockpit was simplicity.\u201cIf you look at the virtual cockpit and notice something different, we\u2019ve failed,\u201d said Justin Goduto, a spokesman for Audi. \u201cHow can we achieve a functional operation in as few steps as possible?\u201dThe on-screen menus are designed to allow access to items with a single click of the steering wheel buttons, Mr. Goduto said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want people having to dive down.\u201dThe heart of the virtual cockpit is a powerful computer processor made by Nvidia.Nvidia said that precision and safety were two important goals of the virtual cockpit.\u201cDriver distraction is a big issue, and if you have graphics that don\u2019t look good, poor-quality maps that lag, that are hard to read, it becomes a distraction,\u201d said Danny Shapiro, senior director for automotive development at Nvidia.The virtual cockpit does have its adherents.Michael Wong test-drove a new Audi Q7 with and without the system, and wound up ordering the vehicle with the virtual cockpit.\u201cIf it was a feature to sell Audis, they\u2019ve accomplished their mission,\u201d he said.\u201cI\u2019d rather have the luxury of having those functions than not,\u201d said Mr. Wong, who lives in Stamford, Conn., and is in the Army Reserve. He allowed that duplicating the information on the virtual cockpit and the center screen might be overkill. He also noted that having dueling information available can be distracting, but added, \u201cPicking up a phone call can be distracting. You got to pick your poison.\u201dBecause the Audi technology is so new and integrated into only a few of the brand\u2019s vehicles \u2014 the 2016 TT and the 2017 A4 sedan, Q7 sport utility vehicle and R8 sports car \u2014 mass-market reaction has been limited.But a study about to be made public raises concerns about how challenging it is to use Audi\u2019s Virtual Cockpit 1.0, said Kristin Kolodge, executive director of driver interaction at J. D. Power, the research firm.The study, which asked about buyers\u2019 attitudes toward the system in the Audi TT two-seater coupe, found that the TT\u2019s virtual cockpit presented a \u201ccomplex system with a number of layers,\u201d she said.\u201cIt\u2019s going to take a significant amount of time for the consumer to learn it,\u201d said Ms. Kolodge, who declined to divulge specific data from the study before it was released.The virtual cockpit is not a standard feature in base models. To add it to the A4 Premium Plus model requires buying a $3,250 technology package option.But to Aadel Khan, it\u2019s worth it. He bought the system for his two-month-old Audi Q7, which cost $73,000.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons I bought the car,\u201d said Mr. Khan, who works in auto performance tuning in Houston.\u201cI love being able to toggle the gauges from larger to smaller,\u201d Mr. Khan said. \u201cHey, do you need your speedometer to be big? You just need a digital readout to tell you how fast you\u2019re going. And having the map right in front of you is nice, because you\u2019re only glancing up and down, and you don\u2019t have to look to the right.\u201dMr. Shapiro of Nvidia said that his company was working with several other manufacturers, including Tesla, Honda, the Volkswagen group (Audi is part of that family) and Mercedes-Benz, which last year showed its own system that incorporates an array of digital displays in and around the dashboard.Not all automakers, including General Motors, agree with the approach, however.\u201cWe recognize the need to push the tech, but we have different philosophies in how we present the information to the driver,\u201d said Nick Richards, a spokesman for General Motors. \u201cWe have a belief that information should be displayed in multiple locations.\u201dHe added, \u201cThere are some functions you want to have redundant on a nice big beautiful display in the center.\u201dG.M. is also taking another view at cockpit display technology: the rear view.Cadillac\u2019s CT6 sedan offers a feature called the \u201cfull display mirror,\u201d which transforms the inside rearview mirror into a high-resolution digital display that is fed images from a backward-facing camera mounted atop the car.The device, developed by Gentex Corporation, is a hybrid as well, with a toggle to revert to a conventional mirror if the electronic display fails.\u201cIt is a mirror first and foremost, because there are cases when the drivers want to look at the people behind them during conversations,\u201d said Neil Boehm, vice president for engineering at Gentex.\u201cOn the other hand, with passengers in the back, or luggage piled up, or you\u2019re bringing the kids home from school, by having the display you still have a great view of what\u2019s behind,\u201d he said.Gentex\u2019s mirror will be offered in the coming Chevrolet Bolt and by other manufacturers in coming months, Mr. Boehm said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Using Tweets and Posts to Speed Up Organ Donation", "Date": "2016-05-10", "News": "Supported byFixesFirst of two articles. In 2004, Rick Segal, a father of four living in Rye, N.Y., found his stamina inexplicably failing him as he did his regular runs. He went to see his doctor, and learned he had a genetic disease that enlarges and weakens the heart. Segal was about to turn 50, but his heart was pumping at one-eighth of a normal heart\u2019s effectiveness. He needed a transplant.He got on a waiting list, and for the next five years, he was in and out of hospitals while his heart deteriorated further. He underwent multiple 12-hour operations. A defibrillator was installed in his chest. Then came mechanical pumps for both ventricles. \u201cI got a belt from a police wholesale site to carry around these huge batteries,\u201d he said. Because the heart pumps had an 18-month life span, an imminent transplant became his only option.On Monday, Feb. 9, 2009, the 29th day of his 1A status, he and his wife were driving on the Hutchinson River Parkway to NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital to seek end-of life-counseling \u2014 \u201cWe had pretty much given up hope,\u201d he said \u2014 when the phone rang. \u201cThey said: Go home, pack your bags. A heart has been found.\u201d A 26-year-old intravenous drug user from Boston had overdosed. The next day his heart was pumping in Segal\u2019s body.\u201cThey tell you in six months, you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re 20 or something,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was true.\u201dWhat could be done to harness people\u2019s generous impulses more effectively to save lives?This approach is shaking up longstanding assumptions.In practice, legal registration may be overemphasized. It may be just as important to simply make your wishes known to your loved ones. When people tell relatives, \u201cIf something happens to me, I want to be an organ donor,\u201d families almost always respect their wishes. This is particularly important for minors, who cannot legally register as donors.If you post or tweet about organ donation, or include a hashtag like #iwanttobeanorgandonor, #organdonor, #donatemyparts, or any of a number of other relevant terms, Organize captures the information and logs it in a registry. In a year, it has gathered the names of nearly 600,000 people who declare support for organ donation. Now the big question is: Will it actually increase organ donation rates?We should begin getting an idea pretty soon. Organize has been working with the Nevada Donor Network to test its registry. And in the coming months, several other states will begin using it.\u201cIt\u2019s a moral imperative to help next of kin make the most educated decision about their deceased loved one,\u201d said Arnold, the Organize co-founder. \u201cThey\u2019re often desperately looking for a sign. Seeing \u2018I want to be an #organdonor\u2019 explicitly, in someone\u2019s own words, could be that sign.\u201dWhat\u2019s needed are more conversations among parents, spouses and children, so everyone can be fully informed and understand one another\u2019s convictions. \u201cThe beautiful thing about social media, especially Facebook, is that it\u2019s cross generational,\u201d says Arnold. \u201cWe target millennials in our marketing because they tend to be the earliest adopters of new technology, but we specifically feed them content to share with their parents.\u201dOf course, concerns arise from using social declarations to inform major decisions. Can identity be confirmed? Is a tweet a compelling indication of intent? In the end, families must decide these questions based on information available. Legally speaking, any \u201cstatement or symbol\u201d that indicates a donor\u2019s wish can serve as consent. \u201cThe law is written broadly enough that you could write it on a cocktail napkin,\u201d Greg Segal says.Since 2015, the Nevada Donor Network has been using Organize\u2019s registry experimentally, said Keith. \u201cIn 2015, we identified 10 additional matches that would have provided another 35 organs,\u201d he said. \u201cThat translates to an 11 percent increase over the 320 organs we transplanted that year. We\u2019re now at a point where if we get a match, we\u2019ll begin using the information in conversations.\u201dThrough Instagram, Arnold added, celebrities could share photos of transplant beneficiaries and reach millions of people in demographics that are largely untapped for organ donation education.\u201cThe game change of what Organize is doing \u2014 and I think it will save lives \u2014 is to build on the increasing acceptance of people making public declarations about their beliefs on a whole variety of things and applying that to their wishes about organ donation,\u201d said Sadler, who helped draft the original organ donation act. \u201cMost of us don\u2019t have these conversations. This could change the dynamic for grieving families \u2014 being able to acknowledge the wishes of their family member and find purpose in a tragedy.\u201dFor Rick Segal, as the recipient of a gift of life, there is a dimension to Organize\u2019s work that has brought an added measure of comfort. \u201cThere\u2019s something called survivor\u2019s guilt,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know that if you were given an organ, three other people didn\u2019t get it. You are walking around every day with the very thing that would have saved their lives \u2014 so you have this tremendous drive to prove that you are worthy. This phantom competition never leaves your mind. I feel that at least, by having what happened to me instill the vision and motivation in Greg and Jenna to take on this challenge, I\u2019m doing good in terms of payback.\u201dI\u2019ll continue to track Organize\u2019s work. And next week, I will report on efforts to increase living organ donation, an area of great potential.An earlier version of this article contained an erroneous spelling of the hashtag #donatemyparts.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Kobe, Budget-Friendly Beef and Beyond", "Date": "2016-05-11", "News": "Supported byFrugal TravelerDuring strolls along its quiet, tree-lined boulevards, there is a decidedly intimate, rustic feel that pervades Kobe, Japan, despite its population of nearly 1.5 million. But there is also a distinctly cosmopolitan air \u2014 one that comes partly from its history as one of the first cities to be forced to open trade following Japan\u2019s centuries-long policy of sakoku, or isolation from the rest of the world, until the mid-19th century.Best of all, I was only a few stops \u2014 less than 10 minutes \u2014 from Kobe-Sannomiya station, in the heart of downtown. I was in the mood for some of the above-mentioned Kobe beef one afternoon, and so I strategically targeted the lunch hour. As any good bargain hunter knows, lunch is when many expensive restaurants offer deals, serving similar (or exactly the same) meals as during dinnertime, but for a fraction of the price. I ducked into a small street and looked at the lunch menu for a restaurant called Ishida. The Kobe beef lunch options there ranged from 3,300 to 8,800 yen (about $31.40 to $83.85) \u2014 a bit more than I was looking to pay. I went around the corner and found one of a small restaurant chain called Nishimuraya, which had a menu more in my price range: 1,980 yen for a serving of Kobe beef, rice, soup, salad and pickles.The restaurant had no English signage outside, and I discovered it purely by accident. I slid open the outside door and headed up a quiet, narrow staircase. Everything was done in wood and there was some music playing I had originally noticed; I could pick out a few notes here and there from the melody of a jazz song. I entered and was greeted by the host and the chef, who was in the back, and was shown to a table booth with a large charcoal burner in the middle. I ordered my lunch, and a man with a pan of glowing hot charcoal fed the burner on my table, then placed a metal grate on the top.The beef came out quickly, as did the accompaniments (the mushroom and tofu soup was outstanding). I took the small slices, reddish-pink and streaked with white fat, and placed them on the grill. The fat sizzled, droplets hitting the coal, and each piece quickly turned a beautiful shade of brown. Per my server\u2019s suggestion, I dressed each piece with only a small amount of a salt-and-pepper mixture that was on the table. The taste of the beef was sensational: each piece was a flavor bomb of protein and fat. The simple salt dressing was a perfect complement, highlighting the sweetness of the fat but not obscuring the taste of the beef.The set ended \u2014 far too soon \u2014 and the group took their bows. It\u2019s often said that music has no language or, rather, that it is its own language. That proved to be true that evening in Kobe, as I was reminded that even halfway across the world, it\u2019s possible to feel entirely at home.Advertisement"}

By Friday afternoon, a spokesman in the office of Senator Link said the amendment was no longer being considered but declined to comment further. The senator had also written the original law.In a comment sent by email, a spokeswoman for Facebook said, \u201cWe appreciate Senator Link\u2019s effort to clarify the scope of the law he authored.\u201d\u201cWe have had a very dysfunctional Congress for quite some time, and as a result the most effective place to work has been the statehouses,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s where hearts and minds are being won and where laws are still being crafted and passed.\u201dBiometric information like face and voice recognition has become a huge and potentially costly area as tech companies plow tons of money and powerful artificial intelligence technologies into photo and video applications that can identify people with an accuracy that would have seemed like science fiction only a few years ago.Laws curbing these programs can be a huge burden for tech companies, because following the laws could mean slowing the arrival of new features or creating a patchwork of features that could be turned off and on in various states.While the state violations are often small \u2014 the Illinois act gives citizens the right to sue for up to $5,000 per violation \u2014 potential liability can run to billions or even trillions of dollars once multiplied across hundreds of millions of individual users. That has made privacy law a lucrative new area for class-action lawyers who can extract multimillion-dollar settlements just by bringing a case.Nevertheless, questions of how much tech companies should be allowed to do without notifying their users will multiply, especially as people adopt more live video and voice technologies that have already made it possible for tech companies to identify people who might not even use their services.\u201cIt\u2019s basically a company creating the ability to capture someone\u2019s identity when they might not want to reveal their identity,\u201d Mr. Rotenberg said.The Biometric Information Privacy Act was passed in Illinois in 2008 and has quickly become the bane of social media companies. Under the current law, companies have to get a user\u2019s consent before turning on features that scan and store faces for identification.The law is at the center of several class-action lawsuits, including one that claims that Facebook has \u201csecretly amassed the world\u2019s largest privately held database of consumer biometrics data.\u201dJay Edelson, founder of Edelson PC, said of Facebook: \u201cThese guys believe that the rules shouldn\u2019t apply to them and have the money to literally rewrite them.\u201dDoris Burke contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

But betting on Greece has proved to be tricky and it has been a rough 17 months for hedge funds. It is unclear why Eaglevale waited until this year to close the Hellenic fund, which had already lost about 40 percent of its value by early last year. Greece edged near economic collapse and the situation remains tenuous with the country still arguing with other eurozone nations and its creditors over how to reduce its debt burden. Sam Gilford, a consumer bureau spokesman, confirmed that staff members and the consumer advisory board had discussed seller financing, specifically an arrangement called a contract for deed or a land contract which is a long-term, high-interest installment financing deal. The buyer only becomes the owner after the last payment is made and the contracts can last for as long as 40 years.These contracts have proliferated as banks have retrenched from lending to low-income families and private investment firms like hedge funds have stepped in to fill the void. The foreclosure crisis created a bountiful supply of cheap, often dilapidated homes for investors to buy and left millions of people with damaged credit histories.  Now many of the homes that have been foreclosed are being sold under contracts for deeds. Homes sold through a contract for deed often require buyers to spend a significant portion of their disposable incomes on repairs and renovations.

{"Headline": "Corporate America Chases the Mythical Millennial", "Date": "2016-05-25", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtYet there\u2019s a glaring problem with these and other efforts to go after the younger among us: Millennials aren\u2019t real.Sure, the demographic group exists as an amorphous bloc. But you are as likely to come upon an archetypal millennial as you are to run into Joe Sixpack or be invited to a barbecue at the median American household. It\u2019s hard to believe this even needs to be said, yet here we are: Macroscale demographic trends rarely govern most individuals\u2019 life and work decisions. For most practical purposes \u2014 hiring and managing, selling to, creating products for \u2014 your company may be better off recognizing more discrete and meaningful characteristics in workers and customers than simply the year of their birth.If your management or marketing theories involve collapsing all millennials into a catchall anthropological category \u2014 as if you\u2019re dealing with space aliens or some newly discovered aboriginal tribe that\u2019s suddenly invaded modernity \u2014 you\u2019re doing it wrong. Or, as I believe my millennial friends say, \u201cyass literal epic fail hashtag, bro.\u201dAnother might be to consider that maybe the problem stems from something about your company, your management style or just the worker\u2019s personality, and that it has nothing to do with the fact that the employee was born in 1983 and really enjoyed \u201cAnimaniacs\u201d as a kid.In other words, break out of the stereotype. According to Laszlo Bock, who runs human resources at Google, pigeonholing workers into categories is nothing new, and it\u2019s rarely helpful in running a workplace.\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is that every single generation enters the work force and feels like they\u2019re a unique generation, and the generation that\u2019s one or two ahead of them looks back and says, \u2018Who are these weird, strange kids coming into the work force with their attitudes of entitlement and not wanting to fit in?\u2019\u201d Mr. Bock said. \u201cIt\u2019s a cycle that\u2019s been repeated every 10 to 15 years for the last 50 years.\u201d\u201cWe measure this sort of thing closely, and if you look at what their underlying needs and aspirations are, there\u2019s no difference at all between this new generation of workers and my generation and my father\u2019s generation,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery single human being wants the same thing in the workplace \u2014 we want to be treated with respect, we want to have a sense of meaning and agency and impact, and we want our boss to just leave us alone so we can get our work done.\u201dThis is not to say that today\u2019s young people are identical to old people. Kim Parker, director of social trends research at the Pew Research Center, said demographers have noted large differences in millennials: Compared to older cohorts, they tend to be more socially liberal when it comes to issues like gay marriage and marijuana use, they marry later in life, and they are less enamored of traditional religious and political institutions. Looking at these shifts over time \u201cis a useful construct when you\u2019re trying to analyze a whole population,\u201d Ms. Parker said.But these broad trends leave lots of room for individual differences that matter in the real world, and that are often papered over when we talk about millennials as a monolithic collective.Considering that millennials are the most diverse generation \u2014 spanning many racial, ethnic and income categories \u2014 intragenerational differences are bound to play an important role when you\u2019re talking about individual people. Though both are \u201cmillennials,\u201d a young immigrant working three sharing-economy gigs is likely to look at the world very differently from a trust-fund baby who\u2019s tending his Tumblr in Brooklyn. Yet only one of these stereotypes tends to make it into media accounts of millennials.That doesn\u2019t have to be the case. What\u2019s most bizarre about efforts to describe young people as a broad collective is that technology has rendered such generalizations mostly unnecessary. Thanks to social media, smartphones and reams of searchable data, companies can now track their customers and workers in far more precise ways than simply noting their age cohort. They have your purchase and employment histories, your social media musings, your educational history, your credit report. Companies can break you down analytically, psychographically, financially and in just about every other way short of physically.As my millennial friends say: Ugh.The State of the Art column on Thursday, about the nonhomogeneity of the so-called millennial generation, misspelled the given name of Google\u2019s head of human resources. He is Laszlo Bock, not Lazslo.Email: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjooAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Cheery Elevator Ride With Larry Page", "Date": "2016-05-20", "News": "Supported byBitsOn Thursday I stepped into an elevator at the federal courthouse in San Francisco, smack into Larry Page and his retinue. Mr. Page is the chief executive of Alphabet, the parent company of Google. We were headed to the same court.Oracle Corporation is suing Google for copyright violations that could cost Alphabet $9 billion. Considering the sum, Mr. Page seemed pretty jolly while on his way into court.The copyright concerns Android, the operating system now used in 84 percent of the world\u2019s smartphones. One of those phones was in Mr. Page\u2019s hands, and he showed his crew a photo of a quote from the writer Jill Lepore: \u201cI Google, therefore I am not.\u201dNot a bad joke. Even Mr. Page\u2019s personal assistant laughed.In part, this is the theater of the law. On the witness stand, Mr. Page was a less voluble man, uncertain and disputative in the face of questioning by an attorney for Oracle. In earlier testimony, Safra Catz, the steely co-chief executive of Oracle, appeared more sad than incensed at Google\u2019s behavior.But then there are the facts obscured or omitted in the trial. Much of both sides\u2019 story, for example, involves the collapse of Sun Microsystems, the inventor of the open-source Java code used in Android, which Oracle acquired in 2010. Neither side, however, talks about how Linux, another open-source project, was the real undoing of Sun. Linux was also one reason Google was able to get big so fast.If there are differing views on open source at the two companies, it has much to do with two different generations of software makers, which were essentially divided by the Linux experience. In life, if not in law, such context matters.There are other such omissions in this history. Like friendship: Sun was co-founded by Scott McNealy, a friend of Lawrence J. Ellison, the co-founder of Oracle. Mr. McNealy long disparaged Linux, before making a late-stage conversion that did not save his company.Though, as Ms. Lepore notes, being human may be changing as we move under the dominion of data.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Before and After: Bringing Urban Style to Suburbia", "Date": "2016-05-12", "News": "Supported byBuying a fixer-upper was not part of the plan when S. Jefferson Thomas and Patricia Balaci decided to move to Westchester County from Brooklyn last year.After all, their combined renovation experience consisted mostly of watching reality TV. But in a search for more space and proximity to nature, the couple found themselves captivated by a dated one-bedroom apartment in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y.Never mind the wall-to-wall carpeting, linoleum-lined balcony and pink bathroom toilet. Facing the Hudson River and the cliffs of the Palisades beyond, the place had a view \u2014 and at 900 square feet, including the balcony, was much larger than their maisonette in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn.So with the proceeds from the sale of the Brooklyn place, they paid about $227,000 for the apartment last July and embarked on an ambitious plan to bring urban design to their slice of suburbia.\u201cI wanted to bring Manhattan to Westchester and I wanted to bring it up to the 21st century,\u201d said Mr. Thomas, 49. A real estate agent with Douglas Elliman, he spends enough time in expensive New York City apartments that the latest design trends are seared into his brain. \u201cWe wanted to emulate these multimillion-dollar apartments, but we wanted to do it cheaply.\u201dBut with no previous renovation experience, the couple didn\u2019t know where to start. A tour of local home-improvement stores in search of ideas proved that the streamlined, contemporary look they wanted was not to be found on the shelves of Home Depot or Lowe\u2019s. Local design stores in Westchester came closer, but asked $30,000 to $40,000 to outfit the kitchen alone, not including labor.The couple were referred to a contractor, Luciano Jacomini of Silver Brook Enterprises, in Bridgeport, Conn., by a structural engineer who was recommended by the co-op board. Then, over the next few months, Mr. Thomas made it his mission to track down vendors that could replicate the custom look they wanted, at a price they could afford. \u201cA lot of it was trying to put the right words into Google,\u201d he said, noting there were hours of typing various combinations of \u201cIkea replacement doors\u201d into the search engine.\u201cWe spent money on the things that are the most obvious,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one sees your kitchen cabinets behind the doors.\u201dThe bathroom, they decided, needn\u2019t be fancy, but the floor tiles there had to be laid in a herringbone pattern.But as soon as demolition began, hurdles arose. The walls that had closed off the kitchen didn\u2019t line up properly with the apartment below. They were \u201coff by two inches, resting on nothing,\u201d Mr. Thomas said. \u201cIt\u2019s scary to think what was actually holding up our kitchen.\u201dThe walls were so misaligned, he said, \u201cwe had to get permission to go downstairs to the apartment below to put in a support column.\u201d Wood and metal columns were added in the garage below the neighbor\u2019s apartment to ensure stability, and a ceiling beam was installed in the kitchen to help bolster the floor above, with the couple picking up the cost for all the work.Permission was granted by the president of the co-op board, who happened to own the downstairs apartment and was renting it out. It didn\u2019t hurt that the tenant happened to be a contractor. \u201cHe knew what these things entail, and he was reasonably O.K. with it,\u201d said Mr. Thomas, noting that the new columns not only improved the stability of both apartments but also allow the downstairs neighbor to open up his kitchen should he ever want to.The additional work meant that new permits had to be obtained and floor and ceiling joists realigned, increasing the budget and delaying the project by several weeks. In all, the renovation lasted 103 days and cost about $60,000 \u2014 not including the $8,000 the couple spent for four months in a rental in the building next door while the renovation dragged on.\u201cIt was a learning curve for both of us,\u201d said Ms. Balaci, an Italian teacher. \u201cI have to hand it to Jeff,\u201d she added. \u201cI picked a smart one, and he could see the big picture.\u201dWhile Mr. Thomas took the lead on managing the renovation, Ms. Balaci kept the budget in check, reining in her husband on expenses she deemed unnecessary, like buying a new hallway light fixture when the existing one looked perfectly fine. \u201cHe wanted everything new,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m the thrifty-daughter-of-immigrants type where you don\u2019t throw anything out and try to salvage it until it\u2019s on its last leg.\u201dTo save money in the kitchen, the couple kept the existing stainless-steel stove and dishwasher. And they lucked into a high-end refrigerator at a cut rate. An elderly client of Mr. Thomas who found the door of the $2,000 Fisher & Paykel in her new apartment hard to open offered to trade it to him for an $800 model from Lowe\u2019s.At the couple\u2019s meticulously renovated apartment, it was clear Ms. Balaci appreciated her husband\u2019s attention to detail, but she didn\u2019t miss an opportunity to tease him about his thoroughness. \u201cHe has a Ph.D. in these lights,\u201d she said, gesturing to the recessed lighting in the kitchen and prompting an impassioned speech by her husband about the differences between \u201cremodel\u201d and \u201cnew construction\u201d housings. He is now well versed in the nomenclature for the various lights\u2019 casings, he said, after he ordered a case of the wrong ones online before consulting his contractor.The experience \u201cwas like a master class in renovations,\u201d said Mr. Thomas, adding that he had enjoyed the renovation challenge but was not in a rush to do it again. \u201cMy contractor said, \u2018Now you can be a general contractor.\u2019 \u201dMs. Balaci agreed that the time and effort was ultimately worth it. \u201cI love it \u2014 it\u2019s the best place I ever lived,\u201d she said, sipping a latte in the couple\u2019s gleaming new kitchen. \u201cThis place, I smile when I come into it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "5 More Bankers Leave Credit Suisse as Exodus Accelerates", "Date": "2016-05-18", "News": "Supported byThe revolving door at Credit Suisse has been turning faster, as a number of senior bankers have left in the last few days.On Tuesday, five technology bankers, most with decades at Credit Suisse, defected to Jefferies, according to six people briefed on the moves, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Another consumer banker quit last week to work at Royal Bank of Canada, three of these people said.Departures have accumulated over the last several weeks. A few more bankers who cover health care resigned this month to join Centerview Partners, while another banker who handles private equity relationships went to Goldman Sachs.He recently unveiled a plan to realign the investment bank, and its traders and deal makers, to serve the needs of private banking and wealth management. In other words, bankers were concerned there would be less focus on efforts like trading, mergers and acquisitions, and initial public offerings, and more emphasis on low-risk activities that cater to wealthy clients.European banks, in general, have had more difficulty retaining vital employees lately. Other firms, such as Deutsche Bank, also have lost several prominent bankers recently. They are more restricted in how much they can divide bonuses in cash versus stock, making it easier for the American competition to poach bankers. Shares at Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank have been cut in half over the last year, shrinking the potential stock value of their compensation.Jefferies, based in New York, is a subsidiary of Leucadia National Corporation. It and smaller advisory firms have been able to capitalize on the turmoil because they are not required by regulators to defer compensation and have the firepower to offer big pay packages and build up investment banking groups. Still, Jefferies lost its four technology bankers to UBS last year.The recent moves were significant because many of the people who left had been at Credit Suisse many years.William Brady, who was at Credit Suisse since he was brought over by Frank Quattrone in the late \u201990s, was among those who left for Jefferies. Cully Davis, who was a leader of the firm\u2019s equity capital markets group in the Americas and helped manage several prominent initial public offerings including Alibaba and Google, also departed. Cameron Lester, who had just returned to Credit Suisse as head of Internet investment banking a year ago after a stint in venture capital, also resigned.Those three will take two other managing directors with them to Jefferies: Steve West, who focused on software, and John Metz, who led enterprise technology.Credit Suisse has already designated bankers to step up to the roles that were vacated and will hire others in the technology group, one of the people said. David Wah, the global co-head of Credit Suisse\u2019s technology, media and telecom group, remains at the bank, as does the head of technology, media, telecom and health care equity capital markets, John Kolz.Additionally, Credit Suisse has continued to hire investment bankers from other firms. Ray Raimondi plans to join in August from Barclays as head of industrials mergers and acquisitions. Haidee Lee left BMO Capital Markets to lead Credit Suisse\u2019s sell-side mergers and acquisitions group, where she will help smaller companies find buyers.Representatives from Credit Suisse and Jefferies declined to comment on the moves.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inner Peace? The Dalai Lama Made a Website for That", "Date": "2016-05-06", "News": "Supported byROCHESTER, Minn. \u2014 The Dalai Lama, who tirelessly preaches inner peace while chiding people for their selfish, materialistic ways, has commissioned scientists for a lofty mission: to help turn secular audiences into more self-aware, compassionate humans.\u201cIt is my duty to publish such work,\u201d the Dalai Lama said.Dr. Ekman\u2019s daughter, Eve, a post-doctoral fellow in integrative medicine research, worked on the project as well, with the goal of producing a guide to human emotions that anyone with an Internet connection could study in a quest for self-understanding, calm and constructive action.\u201cWe have, by nature or biologically, this destructive emotion, also constructive emotion,\u201d the Dalai Lama said. \u201cThis innerness, people should pay more attention to, from kindergarten level up to university level. This is not just for knowledge, but in order to create a happy human being. Happy family, happy community and, finally, happy humanity.\u201dThe Dalai Lama paid Dr. Ekman at least $750,000 to develop the project, which began with a request several years ago.Dr. Ekman recalled the Dalai Lama telling him: \u201cWhen we wanted to get to the New World, we needed a map. So make a map of emotions so we can get to a calm state.\u201dBased on the survey, Dr. Ekman concluded that there were five broad categories of emotions \u2014 anger, fear, disgust, sadness and enjoyment \u2014 and that each had an elaborate subset of emotional states, triggers, actions and moods. He took these findings to a cartography and data visualization firm, Stamen, to depict them in a visual and, he hoped, useful way.\u201cIf it isn\u2019t fun, it\u2019s a failure,\u201d Dr. Ekman said. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be fun for people to use.\u201dStamen\u2019s founder, Eric Rodenbeck, has created data visualizations for Google, Facebook and MTV, as well as maps showing climate change and rising oceans. But he said the Atlas was the most challenging project he had worked on because it was \u201cbuilt around knowledge and wisdom rather than data.\u201dNot surprisingly, getting scientists to reach a unified understanding of human emotions was difficult.Although Dr. Keltner took part in Dr. Ekman\u2019s survey, the two are not in complete agreement on the number of core emotions. Still, Dr. Keltner said he saw the project as a good step.\u201cThe survey questions could have allowed for more gray areas,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s important to take stock of what the scientific consensus is in the field.\u201dDr. Ekman emphasized that the Atlas was not a scientific work intended for peer review.\u201cIt is a visualization for what we think has been learned from scientific studies,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a transformative process, a work of explanation.\u201dThe Dalai Lama wants to keep religion out of it.\u201cIf we see this research work as relying on religious belief or tradition, then it automatically becomes limited,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if you pray to God, pray to Buddha, emotionally, very nice, very good. But every problem, we have created. So I think even God or Buddha cannot do much.\u201dThe Dalai Lama said he hoped the Atlas could be a tool for cultivating good in the world by defeating the bad within us.\u201cUltimately, our emotion is the real troublemaker,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to know the nature of that enemy.\u201dThe Dalai Lama said he had been encouraged by President Obama\u2019s reaction to the project when he told him about it in India.\u201cObama seems, I think, to show more interest about our inner value,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the past, compassion was something of a sign of weakness, or anger a sign of power, sign of strength. Basic human nature is more compassionate. That\u2019s the real basis of our hope.\u201dWhile excited about the Atlas, however, the 80-year-old Dalai Lama will probably not be clicking around the interactive site. He is much more comfortable turning the printed pages of a version that was custom-made for him.\u201cTechnology is for my next body,\u201d he once quipped to the researchers.Advertisement"}

Let the Battle Begin.", "Date": "2016-05-18", "News": "Supported byTech FixWhat do Home and Echo have in common?Home and Echo are both speakers that require a wired power connection. They stream music and perform tasks like web searches, adding calendar appointments and looking up movie showtimes over an Internet connection.What are the differences between Google Home and Amazon Echo?Google has yet to share many important details, including a price tag, about Google Home, which is scheduled for release this fall. However, from the announcement we can glean a few differences:Home, which can easily be held in one hand, is shorter and more compact than Echo.Both speakers have a cylindrical shape, but the top of Home is slanted downward, whereas Echo\u2019s top is flat. Google is allowing consumers to choose from different colors for the bottom part of Home, while Echo comes only in black. (Amazon also sells a smaller voice-controlled speaker called Tap.)Most important, the brains of Home will be Google\u2019s virtual assistant, which draws from Google\u2019s extensive search database, whereas Echo relies on Alexa, Amazon\u2019s assistant. In other words, consumers can expect voice commands that already work with Google\u2019s assistant to work with Google Home.Is Home smarter than Echo?Thanks to Home\u2019s reliance on Google\u2019s search engine, it will probably be a smarter speaker than the Echo when it comes to basic tasks like web searches and looking up traffic data. However, when it comes to actions offered by outside companies \u2014 like the ability to order a pizza from a restaurant or to set your Internet-connected thermostat \u2014 Home\u2019s success will depend largely on whether Google persuades third-party developers to create tasks that work with it.\u201cTo do this well we really need to work with developers and third parties so we can provide these actions to our users,\u201d said Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, during his announcement of Home.By contrast, Amazon has already made great progress with third-party developers for Echo. Alexa is capable of summoning an Uber car, ordering a pizza from Domino\u2019s, controlling smart light bulbs and much more. Time will tell which company\u2019s speaker gets more third-party support, but Echo, which was released last June, has a major head start.What is Google\u2019s assistant?Here\u2019s where things get confusing. Google is referring to the virtual-assistant portion of its search product as \u201cassistant.\u201d Previously it was called Google Now, and later it was renamed to just Google.The problem was that many consumers had trouble distinguishing Google search from its virtual assistant because the assistant lacked a friendly name like Siri or Alexa. The difference now, Google says, is that its assistant is more capable of being naturally conversational than other assistants. Adding to the confusion: Google\u2019s assistant is what comes with Google Home and Allo, the new messaging app. But you won\u2019t summon it by saying \u201cGoogle assistant.\u201d You\u2019ll just say \u201cGoogle.\u201dWhat is Allo?Allo is Google\u2019s forthcoming messaging app, which has Google\u2019s assistant built into it. Inside the app, you will be able to type \u201c@google\u201d and say conversational things like \u201cLet\u2019s go out for some Italian food.\u201d Google will then respond with some suggestions for tables to reserve at Italian restaurants using, for example, the OpenTable app.What\u2019s more, you will be able to have conversations with friends and type \u201c@google\u201d with questions or requests inside those conversations; all people in the conversation will see how Google\u2019s assistant responds.

The systems are based on the notion of a \u201cqubit,\u201d or quantum bit \u2014 a basic value capable of encompassing more information than the 1\u2019s and 0\u2019s that are the basis of classical digital computing.\u201cIt\u2019s meant to be educational, but also to be the beginnings of a larger framework,\u201d said Jerry M. Chow, manager of the Experimental Quantum Computing Group at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, in Yorktown Heights, N.Y.IBM researchers have recently demonstrated a quantum computer that they believe will one day be scaled up to a machine that might have hundreds of qubits and be able to run a wide range of algorithms more quickly than today\u2019s computers.Some quantum computing theorists believe that such a computer one day might be designed as a \u201cuniversal\u201d computer capable of performing any task much faster than machines now in use.IBM has been gradually enhancing the power of its quantum computer, which is assembled from a network of qubits made from metals that become superconducting when they are cooled to temperatures near absolute zero.Researchers at the company announced the construction of a four-bit quantum computer last year and in February reported they added a fifth qubit and were making progress in refining certain error-correcting methods that are important for quantum computing.The IBM quantum computer will offer visually oriented online tutorials that are intended to help people and companies understand how programming such a computer will be different from programming a digital computer. In addition to visual simulations of quantum computing, it will include a gamelike system that will parcel out access to the actual quantum computer for online users.The idea of computers that might exploit the \u201cspooky\u201d laws of quantum behavior that describe nature at an atomic level was first broached by the physicist Richard Feynman in 1981. Since then, scientists have proposed specialized algorithms that might allow quantum computers to break computer codes or even simulate complex biological processes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rap Concert Shooting Renews a Racially Charged Debate on Safety", "Date": "2016-05-30", "News": "Supported byOn Saturday evening outside Webster Hall in Manhattan, a young crowd buzzed expectantly amid a heavy police presence, including as many as 10 squad cars, while bouncers with security wands diligently patted down all those who entered for the sold-out hip-hop dance party known as HennyPalooza.\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d he added, \u201cthat violence often times manifests itself during their performances.\u201dThis focus on hip-hop is outdated and amounts to a form of musical and racial profiling of black fans and artists, Mr. Bratton\u2019s opponents say. Rap is now a huge and dominant professional industry, they say, pointing to megastars like Drake and Kendrick Lamar. And despite the headlines, they add, violent crime at rap concerts is rare.The New York City Police Department said that it did not keep statistics about violence at rap or other concerts, and an official was not available to comment on the department\u2019s policing of these events. But it has made its concerns known by warning music halls about certain acts, while maintaining a ubiquitous, and some would say, overwhelming presence at such events.\u201cQuite frankly, that stereotype is not as relevant today as it was 20 years ago,\u201d at the height of the violent feud between Tupac Shakur and the Notorious B.I.G., said David Yorio, an owner of Citadel Security Agency, which has operated in New York since 1982 and works the concert and festival circuit.But in a sign that hip-hop has not shaken its old reputation as an outlaw genre \u2014 and that safety remains a complex worry \u2014 the police are not the only ones forcing hip-hop promoters to amp up security.Promoters and security companies working mainly in New York say that when booking concerts, many hip-hop acts receive extra scrutiny from music halls and insurers. Some artists and their entourages must undergo security checks that many musicians in other genres would not tolerate. And after warnings from the police, some music venues have canceled hip-hop concerts rather than deal with the headaches that can come with them. The overall effect, many promoters say, only adds to the already fraught relationship among fans, rap artists and law enforcement.This renewed discussion over these policies is occurring just as summer begins and rap shows across the city and the country become more frequent.On Sunday, the influential hip-hop and R&B station Hot 97 (WQHT-FM, 97.1) will host its annual Summer Jam in New Jersey, featuring acts including Future and Young Thug. That same night, Kanye West will headline Governors Ball on Randalls Island, a festival preceded by three affiliated rap shows scheduled this week at Irving Plaza.As with concerts in other genres, most of the security at these events will focus on personal safety.Across electronic music, country and hip-hop alike, \u201cThe majority of the issues we run into are people who are inebriated or borderline overdosing,\u201d Mr. Yorio said. \u201cIt has much more to do with E.M.T.s and paramedics than breaking up fights.\u201d\u201cAt Summer Jam, which is arguably the largest hip-hop festival in the world, every single fan goes through a metal detector, and the artists and crew are also frisked by state police,\u201d said Carl Freed, a veteran concert producer whose company, Trevanna Entertainment, has worked on Summer Jam for more than two decades. \u201cWe take these precautions, but nothing is foolproof. You do as much as you can.\u201dThe shooting contributed to the club\u2019s decision to hold fewer rap concerts. But the decision also \u201cstems from pressure from the police,\u201d said Jonas Leon, a talent buyer for S.O.B.\u2019s. \u201cWe\u2019d rather just not put on a show instead of having the police come and shut it down for the smallest reasons.\u201dMr. Leon said that S.O.B.\u2019s had also instituted a \u201cheavy vetting system\u201d for artists, which includes ranking risk factors on a scale of one to 10 before scheduling shows.Mr. Yorio of Citadel Security Agency said that his company would scour Google and social media to learn about performers before concerts. \u201cIf there\u2019s a history of violence, then we would increase our numbers and would work to have a paid N.Y.P.D. detail on site,\u201d he said.Alex Damashek, an independent concert promoter whose company, Move Forward Music, works with Webster Hall, said that scrutiny, and the liability issues that come with it, can prevent hip-hop concerts from happening at all.\u201cYou have to be very careful about how you describe your event on the insurance application,\u201d he said. \u201cJust say the word \u2018hip-hop\u2019 and the price is going to go up.\u201dIn March, Webster Hall canceled its weekly rap event, House Party; Mr. Damashek cited the continuing \u201cperceptions and tensions\u201d between attendees, security and the police.One House Party show in the summer of 2014 featured the up-and-coming Brooklyn rapper Bobby Shmurda, whose viral Internet fame was just beginning to crest. \u201cWe were shocked the N.Y.P.D. called the venue to give a heads up \u2014 \u2018You might want to be careful with these guys,\u2019\u201d Mr. Damashek said.But Mr. Damashek and others said that \u201cpeople outside of the culture\u201d might have trouble grasping the nuances of hip-hop. There are artists, he said, who might rap about the street but foster a safe, positive environment at shows. Other acts whose concerts may be more volatile might not project that in their music.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to discern the difference, so we\u2019d rather just paint the whole thing with a broad brush,\u201d he said.As with many rap concerts that are closely monitored by law enforcement, concern with Chief Keef\u2019s shows may have centered less on the artist and more on the fans or opening acts.\u201cIt\u2019s always a local issue, someone from the neighborhood with a chip on their shoulder,\u201d Mr. Leon of S.O.B.\u2019s said.Artists are often searched as well, raising questions about whether their pasts or personal issues are relevant in a professional setting.\u201cWe put our strongest guys on the artist entrance,\u201d Mr. Yorio said. \u201cThose are the guys who show up late, they try to rush in and they don\u2019t want to be searched.\u201d That\u2019s what may have happened at Irving Plaza, he added. (The events company Live Nation, which runs Irving Plaza and concert locations around the country, did not respond to requests for comment about its policies.)Last year, the ubiquitous Young Thug was scheduled to make a surprise appearance at an art event in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. But because he had recently been charged with drug and weapons possession after a raid of his Atlanta home, the venue insisted that additional off-duty police officers be hired for the event, said Diane Varnie, a concert promoter and publicist known as Shabazz.The rapper and his management team declined to enter because of the intensity of the proposed search. \u201cI wasn\u2019t surprised he didn\u2019t want to come in,\u201d Ms. Varnie said. \u201cI\u2019ve attended regular parties and alternative music events, and they definitely don\u2019t search you down like that.\u201dSeparating an artist\u2019s personal life, which may be problematic, from his or her professional life as a touring musician can be tricky and hard to parse. And it\u2019s connected to the larger problem \u2014 separating the art of rap, which often depicts grim realities of city life, from the country\u2019s issues with violence.\u201cIt\u2019s an American problem,\u201d said Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, contradicting his police commissioner. \u201cIt\u2019s a much bigger problem than rap.\u201dAll the same, rap continues to carry the weight of scrutiny. \u201cFans are now going to have to catch their favorite act at a strip club or a nightclub,\u201d Ms. Varnie said, because the shooting at Irving Plaza will \u201cmake it way harder for actual rap shows to flourish.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about a debate on safety at rap concerts after a shooting last week before a concert in Manhattan by the rapper T.I. misidentified the city where the rapper Fat Trel, who was featured at a concert in Manhattan in 2013 where four people were shot, is based. It is Washington, not Atlanta.Alex Vadukul, Ben Sisario and Ashley Southall contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

If successful, the value of the transaction will most likely get much bigger.\u201cFor sure, we\u2019re talking of billions of dollars in services over the next several years,\u201d said Marc Benioff, the co-founder and chief executive of Salesforce.Salesforce already uses A.W.S. for some of its businesses, but this is the first time its key applications will be on someone else\u2019s computers.Mr. Benioff said Salesforce had evaluated similar deals with Microsoft and Google, the other two giants in selling cloud-computing to corporations. So far, A.W.S. is still ahead on its range of offerings and low prices, he said. Salesforce will review the contract in one year, he added.Cloud computing uses a massive density of computer servers and sophisticated software to rent data storage, computing and applications to companies. Besides those capabilities, the deal with A.W.S. enables Salesforce to get into new markets faster, since Salesforce doesn\u2019t have to find facilities and recruit talent.Amazon has also established itself in countries like China that have strict requirements about what data can be sent offshore. Meeting those regulations is difficult and time-consuming, and companies like Salesforce put a premium on getting into markets quickly.While the deal could be a sign of larger trends in corporate computing, as businesses evaluate whether to keep their own computers or work with the big public clouds, for now it also has limits.That spending will probably be limited to new countries where Salesforce expands, Mr. Benioff said. That may change, he added, as the three giants bring down prices and increase the services they offer.\u201cWe have our own infrastructure in the U.S., Japan, the U.K., France and Germany,\u201d Mr. Benioff said. \u201cIf you have critical mass, your own infrastructure is still cheaper.\u201dMr. Benioff said that, down the line, A.W.S. may also become competitive purely on price, as their scale and engineering enables them to run big computing systems at a lower cost. \u201cIf Amazon, Microsoft and Google are smart, the price difference will change,\u201d he said.Adam Selipsky, vice president of marketing and sales for A.W.S., said the company was intent on getting its prices down enough to replace existing servers in established markets.\u201cOur prices relative to what they can build themselves \u2013 we\u2019re already at a stage where it\u2019s competitive,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re just at the starting point of enterprise adoption.\u201dAdvertisement"}

We\u2019re pressured to conform.But unseen puppet masters on Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s payroll aren\u2019t to blame. We\u2019re the real culprits. When it comes to elevating one perspective above all others and herding people into culturally and ideologically inflexible tribes, nothing that Facebook does to us comes close to what we do to ourselves.\u201cAnd one of the things we want is to spend more time with people who think like us and less with people who are different,\u201d Haidt added. \u201cThe Facebook effect isn\u2019t trivial. But it\u2019s catalyzing or amplifying a tendency that was already there.\u201dBy \u201cthe Facebook effect\u201d he didn\u2019t mean the possibility, discussed extensively over recent weeks, that Facebook manipulates its menu of \u201ctrending\u201d news to emphasize liberal views and sources. That menu is just one facet of Facebook.More prevalent for many users are the posts we see from friends and from other people and groups we follow on the network, and this information is utterly contingent on choices we ourselves make. If we seek out, \u201clike\u201d and comment on angry missives from Bernie Sanders supporters, we\u2019ll be confronted with more angry missives from more Sanders supporters. If we banish such outbursts, those dispatches disappear.That\u2019s the crucial dynamic, algorithm or whatever you want to call it. That\u2019s the trap and curse of our lives online.The Internet isn\u2019t rigged to give us right or left, conservative or liberal \u2014 at least not until we rig it that way. It\u2019s designed to give us more of the same, whatever that same is: one sustained note from the vast and varied music that it holds, one redundant fragrance from a garden of infinite possibility.A few years back I bought some scented shower gel from Jo Malone. I made the purchase through the company\u2019s website. For months afterward, as I toggled through cyberspace, Jo Malone stalked me, always on my digital heels, forever in a corner of my screen, a Jo Malone candle here, a Jo Malone cologne over there. I\u2019d been profiled and pigeonholed: fan of Jo Malone. Sure, I could choose from woody, citrus, floral and even fruity, but there was no Aramis in my aromatic ecosphere, and I was steered clear of Old Spice.So it goes with the fiction we read, the movies we watch, the music we listen to and, scarily, the ideas we subscribe to. They\u2019re not challenged. They\u2019re validated and reinforced. By bookmarking given blogs and personalizing social-media feeds, we customize the news we consume and the political beliefs we\u2019re exposed to as never before. And this colors our days, or rather bleeds them of color, reducing them to a single hue.We construct precisely contoured echo chambers of affirmation that turn conviction into zeal, passion into fury, disagreements with the other side into the demonization of it. Then we marvel at the Twitter mobs that swarm in defense of Sanders or the surreal success of Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy, whose historical tagline may well be \u201cAll I know is what\u2019s on the Internet.\u201dThose were his exact words, a blithe excuse for his mistaken assertion that a protester at one of his rallies had ties to Islamic extremists. He\u2019d seen a video somewhere. He\u2019d chosen to take it at face value. His intelligence wasn\u2019t and isn\u2019t vetted but viral \u2014 and conveniently suited to his argument and needs. With a creative or credulous enough Google search, a self-serving \u201ctruth\u201d can always be found, along with a passel of supposed experts to vouch for it and a clique of fellow disciples.Carnival barkers, conspiracy theories, willful bias and nasty partisanship aren\u2019t anything new, and they haven\u2019t reached unprecedented heights today. But what\u2019s remarkable and sort of heartbreaking is the way they\u2019re fed by what should be strides in our ability to educate ourselves. The proliferation of cable television networks and growth of the Internet promised to expand our worlds, not shrink them. Instead they\u2019ve enhanced the speed and thoroughness with which we retreat into enclaves of the like-minded.But there\u2019s no argument that in an era that teems with choice, brims with niche marketing and exalts individualism to the extent that ours does, we\u2019re sorting ourselves with a chillingly ruthless efficiency. We\u2019ve surrendered universal points of reference. We\u2019ve lost common ground.We\u2019re less committed to, and trustful of, large institutions than we were at times in the past. We question their wisdom and substitute it with the groupthink of micro-communities, many of which we\u2019ve formed online, and their sensibilities can be more peculiar and unforgiving.Facebook, along with other social media, definitely conspires in this. Haidt noted that it often discourages dissent within a cluster of friends by accelerating shaming. He pointed to the enforced political correctness among students at many colleges.\u201cFacebook allows people to react to each other so quickly that they are really afraid to step out of line,\u201d he said.But that\u2019s not about a lopsided news feed. It\u2019s not about some sorcerer\u2019s algorithm. It\u2019s about a tribalism that has existed for as long as humankind has and is now rooted in the fertile soil of the Internet, which is coaxing it toward a full and insidious flower.An earlier version of this article misstated a word in a quote by Jonathan Haidt. Mr. Haidt said the Facebook effect was \u201ccatalyzing or amplifying\u201d a tendency already there (not \u201cmetabolizing or amplifying\u201d).Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Real Bias Built In at Facebook", "Date": "2016-05-19", "News": "Supported byThe social network\u2019s powerful newsfeed is programmed to be viral, clicky, upbeat or quarrelsome. That\u2019s how its algorithm works, and how it determines what more than a billion people see every day.The root of this bias is in algorithms, a much misunderstood but increasingly powerful method of decision making that is spreading to fields from news to health care to hiring and even to war.Algorithms in human affairs are generally complex computer programs that crunch data and perform computations to optimize outcomes chosen by programmers. Such an algorithm isn\u2019t some pure sifting mechanism, spitting out objective answers in response to scientific calculations. Nor is it a mere reflection of the desires of the programmers.We use these algorithms to explore questions that have no right answer to begin with, so we don\u2019t even have a straightforward way to calibrate or correct them.But \u201csurfaced by an algorithm\u201d is not a defense of neutrality, because algorithms aren\u2019t neutral.Algorithms are often presented as an extension of natural sciences like physics or biology. While these algorithms also use data, math and computation, they are a fountain of bias and slants \u2014 of a new kind.If a bridge sways and falls, we can diagnose that as a failure, fault the engineering, and try to do better next time. If Google shows you these 11 results instead of those 11, or if a hiring algorithm puts this person\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 at the top of a file and not that one, who is to definitively say what is correct, and what is wrong? Without laws of nature to anchor them, algorithms used in such subjective decision making can never be truly neutral, objective or scientific.Programmers do not, and often cannot, predict what their complex programs will do. Google\u2019s Internet services are billions of lines of code. Once these algorithms with an enormous number of moving parts are set loose, they then interact with the world, and learn and react. The consequences aren\u2019t easily predictable.Our computational methods are also getting more enigmatic. Machine learning is a rapidly spreading technique that allows computers to independently learn to learn \u2014 almost as we do as humans \u2014 by churning through the copious disorganized data, including data we generate in digital environments.However, while we now know how to make machines learn, we don\u2019t really know what exact knowledge they have gained. If we did, we wouldn\u2019t need them to learn things themselves: We\u2019d just program the method directly.With algorithms, we don\u2019t have an engineering breakthrough that\u2019s making life more precise, but billions of semi-savant mini-Frankensteins, often with narrow but deep expertise that we no longer understand, spitting out answers here and there to questions we can\u2019t judge just by numbers, all under the cloak of objectivity and science.If these algorithms are not scientifically computing answers to questions with objective right answers, what are they doing? Mostly, they \u201coptimize\u201d output to parameters the company chooses, crucially, under conditions also shaped by the company. On Facebook the goal is to maximize the amount of engagement you have with the site and keep the site ad-friendly. You can easily click on \u201clike,\u201d for example, but there is not yet a \u201cthis was a challenging but important story\u201d button.This setup, rather than the hidden personal beliefs of programmers, is where the thorny biases creep into algorithms, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s perfectly plausible for Facebook\u2019s work force to be liberal, and yet for the site to be a powerful conduit for conservative ideas as well as conspiracy theories and hoaxes \u2014 along with upbeat stories and weighty debates. Indeed, on Facebook, Donald J. Trump fares better than any other candidate, and anti-vaccination theories like those peddled by Mr. Beck easily go viral.The newsfeed algorithm also values comments and sharing. All this suits content designed to generate either a sense of oversize delight or righteous outrage and go viral, hoaxes and conspiracies as well as baby pictures, happy announcements (that can be liked) and important news and discussions. Facebook\u2019s own research shows that the choices its algorithm makes can influence people\u2019s mood and even affect elections by shaping turnout.Software giants would like us to believe their algorithms are objective and neutral, so they can avoid responsibility for their enormous power as gatekeepers while maintaining as large an audience as possible. Of course, traditional media organizations face similar pressures to grow audiences and host ads. At least, though, consumers know that the news media is not produced in some \u201cneutral\u201d way or above criticism, and a whole network \u2014 from media watchdogs to public editors \u2014 tries to hold those institutions accountable.The first step forward is for Facebook, and anyone who uses algorithms in subjective decision making, to drop the pretense that they are neutral. Even Google, whose powerful ranking algorithm can decide the fate of companies, or politicians, by changing search results, defines its search algorithms as \u201ccomputer programs that look for clues to give you back exactly what you want.\u201dBut this is not just about what we want. What we are shown is shaped by these algorithms, which are shaped by what the companies want from us, and there is nothing neutral about that.Advertisement"}

I didn\u2019t inspect all of them but the first 50 were variants of Donald Trump complaining that the Republican primary process was tilted against him.That\u2019s beyond ironic. Mr. Trump and his family have been the beneficiaries of a great rigged system: the tax code, which bestows huge advantages on the real estate business. Throughout his career, Mr. Trump has not only grabbed for every loophole and legal lever he could find, he\u2019s boasted about it.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to learn from them,\u201d he said in the Associated Press interview.I\u2019ll bet there\u2019s plenty to learn. More likely, Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t want us to know how small his tax hit is, something that he bragged about earlier in the campaign, before realizing that it could come back to bite him.Real estate guys can take advantage of the best loopholes left in the tax code, thanks in part to some aggressive nudging of lawmakers. For starters, real estate investors can take deductions for the ostensible depreciation of the value of their buildings, even though the point of owning buildings is that they generally appreciate.For another, they often borrow against those properties, and because they hold these investments in partnerships or limited liability companies, the interest payments are tax-deductible.\u201cIf you get close to paying taxes, you just buy another building,\u201d a real estate friend told me.The tax benefits don\u2019t stop, even at death. If an investor dies holding appreciated properties, the heirs get a step up in basis, which means that they can sell the real estate and pay no taxes on the gain in value.Meanwhile, according to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, from 2010 to 2014, he \u201cdonated\u201d more than $102 million to charity \u2014 without giving away even $1 of his own money. More conservation easements constituted the biggest source of deductions, but the \u201cgifts\u201d included items like free rounds of golf for charity events. Many of these \u201ccharitable contributions,\u201d of course, gave rise to more tax deductions.Taxes are far from the only way that Mr. Trump has gamed the system. He\u2019s added materially to his net worth by pushing the edges of the bankruptcy laws.By arguing that his name had huge commercial value, for example, he managed to retain more ownership in his Atlantic City hotel and casino projects than is customary in an insolvency, thereby minimizing his losses while his creditors lost billions.Finally, by his own admission, Mr. Trump has used our broken campaign finance system to achieve private gain by giving generously to politicians of both parties (including to Hillary Clinton) in order to gain influence. Since 1989, he has donated more than $1.5 million to political causes, 62 percent of it going to Republicans, according to PolitiFact.Among the ways that politicians have been there for him and his brethren has been developing a tax system in which real estate moguls pay little or no taxes. \u201cThe Declaration of Independence tells us that all men are created equal, but the government definitely favors real estate investors!\u201d wrote one such investor, David Lindahl.

{"Headline": "Automakers Befriend Start-Ups Like Uber, Girding Against a Changing Car Culture", "Date": "2016-05-24", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Automakers are looking toward a technology-driven future, one where they increasingly acknowledge that getting around may not require owning a car.The alliances are the latest in a string of pairings between technology companies and traditional automakers that are scrambling to reposition themselves. For decades, automakers had abided by the well-worn formula of making bigger and more powerful cars to fuel their growth.But start-ups like Uber and Lyft and technology companies like Google and Tesla have disrupted that cadence. These companies, mostly located in Silicon Valley, have in the last few years sped the development of self-driving cars, electric vehicles and ride services.Automakers have become increasingly concerned about those technologies and their potential to help people travel easily and cheaply without owning a car \u2014 or even without knowing how to drive.In some American cities, small groups of people are already choosing not to own cars by relying on ride-hailing services like Uber, through which consumers can order a ride through their smartphone, and car-sharing companies like Zipcar, where they essentially pick up a car whenever they need to drive one. Eventually, self-driving cars will be a reality, which would let Uber and others field fleets of driverless vehicles that can operate around the clock and further cut the cost of ride services.Karl Brauer, an analyst at the research firm Kelley Blue Book, said there was no sign that car-sharing or ride-sharing \u2014 sometimes called \u201cmobility services\u201d \u2014 was slowing auto sales today. Auto sales in the United States hit a record high in 2015 and are on the rise this year, and China and other international markets will ensure the global auto market continues to grow.Nevertheless, auto companies are investing in companies like Uber \u201cto be ahead of the curve\u201d if they do shake up car ownership down the road, Mr. Brauer said. \u201cHistory has shown that if you wait for the market to decide, you\u2019re dead,\u201d he said.Last June, Uber said it had approximately 20,000 regular drivers in the Chinese city of Chengdu alone, on par with the approximately 22,000 drivers in San Francisco and 26,000 in New York at the time.Toyota said that in its work with Uber, the companies would also cooperate on trials in countries where ride-hailing is growing.The companies also plan to develop in-car apps that support Uber drivers, and to share their knowledge and research, they said.Next month, Volkswagen is supposed to detail a plan to buy back or repair about 500,000 diesel models that had the cheating software and were sold in the United States.About the same time, Volkswagen is also planning to unveil a \u201cStrategy 2025\u201d in which mobility initiatives will play major roles. In April, Volkswagen said it intended to set up a separate mobility company to oversee investments and initiatives on this front.\u201cWe aim to become a world leading mobility provider by 2025,\u201d Matthias M\u00fcller, chief executive of Volkswagen, said in a statement.Shahar Waiser, Gett\u2019s chief executive, stressed the synchronicity his company had with Volkswagen\u2019s European sales, and how the companies were focused on both consumer and business clients. Mr. Waiser said Gett had $500 million in revenue, 30 percent of which came from the company\u2019s 4,000 corporate and business clients, and that it was profitable in some markets.Gett, which is popular in more than 60 European cities, as well as Moscow and New York, said it planned to use the capital to continue expanding its European operations.\u201cBy now, people realize that the landscape is so big \u2014 and every market is so different \u2014 there will be more than a monopoly or a duopoly,\u201d Mr. Waiser said. \u201cYou will always see two, maybe three major players in this space, wherever you go.\u201dMike Isaac reported from San Francisco, and Neal E.

(Disclosure: I represent companies opposed to Google on other issues in the United States and Europe.)The F.C.C.\u2019s proposal would give Google free access to the raw TV programming data it needs to power its search engine for TV. In effect, Google could use the data to become the modern version of the program guide, connecting users to the TV shows and movies that Google\u2019s search algorithms determine are relevant.It\u2019s a simple concept: Turn on the TV, search for what you want to watch, scan the results, and then click on a link to start watching your favorite show or sporting event. But Google is missing a key ingredient for its search-centric TV. It lacks access to providers\u2019 proprietary programming information \u2014 what shows are available when. Google cannot show a full list of TV programs in its search results without first entering into licensing agreements with cable companies to obtain that data.The F.C.C.\u2019s proposal would give Google access to live TV listings in its search results \u2014 free. Not surprisingly, Google supports the F.C.C.\u2019s proposal. But the company has been accused of troubling practices such as biasing its search results, allowing some sites to pay for prominent display in search results and copying the content of others for its own use.Google is said to have followed the same playbook for years: introducing a free product into a competitive space, subsidizing that product with advertising revenue, and then closing off competition through discriminatory and exclusionary practices.The F.C.C. must ensure that Google doesn\u2019t engage in the same behavior when users search from their TVs. Absent F.C.C. oversight, the record suggests, Google will favor its own video services in search results just as it does today for shopping, news and other categories.Google also has a long history of harming content providers. To attract users and advertisers to its services, Google needs content. But it loses ad dollars from additional searches when users click away from its search engine, so it often copies that content \u2014 sometimes in small pieces \u2014 from third parties.For example, Google\u2019s image search engine displays high-resolution and large-format images from third-party sites, thereby promoting piracy. Google also seems to favor sites that rely on ads rather than subscription fees, a practice that has cut into news outlets\u2019 profit margins. These kinds of practices starve content providers of revenue and chill investment in content creation.Will Google follow the same playbook when it comes to TV? The F.C.C. needs to address this question before moving forward with its proposal.Google also faces scrutiny from regulators and watchdog groups over accusations of user privacy, bundling of its products, abuse of open-source software and other anticompetitive and discriminatory actions.If the F.C.C. provides Google with the data it needs to build its search-based set-top, it should take significant steps to prevent Google from continuing its questionable conduct. At a minimum, the F.C.C. should require Google to commit to search neutrality, transparency, adherence to privacy standards and restrictions on anticompetitive bundling. Without these conditions, a proposal meant to increase innovation may well stifle it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Subtle Empire", "Date": "2016-05-21", "News": "Supported byIN one story people tell about the news media, we have moved from an era of consolidation and authority to an era of fragmentation and diversity. Once there were three major television networks, and everyone believed what Walter Cronkite handed down from Sinai. Then came cable TV and the talk radio boom, and suddenly people could seek out ideologically congenial sources and tune out the old mass-culture authorities. Then finally the Internet smashed the remaining media monopolies, scattered news readers to the online winds, and opened an age of purely individualized news consumption.How compelling is this story? It depends on what you see when you look at Facebook.In one light, Facebook is a powerful force driving fragmentation and niche-ification. It gives its users news from countless outlets, tailored to their individual proclivities. It allows those users to be news purveyors in their own right, playing Cronkite every time they share stories with their \u201cfriends.\u201d And it offers a platform to anyone, from any background or perspective, looking to build an audience from scratch.Who\u2019s right? Well, Beck is right that Facebook is different in kind from any news organization before it, and that traditional critiques of media bias \u2014 from the Chomskyite left as well as from the right \u2014 don\u2019t apply neatly to what it\u2019s doing.Between the algorithmic character of (much of) its news dissemination, the role of decentralized user choice, and the commercial imperatives of personalization, there\u2019s little chance that the Facebook experience will ever bear the kind of ideological stamp that, say, the Time-Life empire bore in Henry Luce\u2019s heyday.But the more plausible (and inevitable) exercise of Facebook\u2019s power would be basically unconscious \u2014 as, I suspect, any suppression of conservative stories may have been.Human nature being what it is, a social network managed and maintained by people who tend to share a particular worldview \u2014 left-libertarian and spiritual-but-not-religious, if I judge the biases of Silicon Valley right \u2014 will tend to gently catechize its users into that perspective.Virtual architecture tells stories no less than the real variety: Like stained-glass windows in a medieval cathedral, even what seem like offhand choices \u2014 like Google\u2019s choice of its Doodle subject, to cite a different new media entity \u2014 point people toward particular icons, particular ideals.So even if you don\u2019t particularly care how Facebook treats conservative news sources, you should still want its power constantly checked, critiqued and watched \u2014 for the sake not just of its users\u2019 politics, but their very selves and souls.Advertisement"}

If a person in the United States went to Google and said there was a link to a site with private bank account details, Google would waste no time in removing the link.And it would certainly not tell the user that it plans to remove the link only in the .us domain or restrict access only to those in the United States. But that is essentially what Google is trying to do when faced with a similar privacy concern in Europe.Moreover, Google\u2019s decision to block access to information based on a regional basis is censorship pure and simple. The French agency has been very clear on this point. There is no desire in Europe to limit access to information in this way.Google has turned a decision that protected privacy and freedom of expression into a justification for restricting access to information.

{"Headline": "Trump and the Lord\u2019s Work", "Date": "2016-05-03", "News": "Supported byI watched that video with Chuck Todd, the host of \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d and he had the exact same reaction I had: \u201cWhere was that brotherly love when America needed it\u201d for a real grand bargain?That scene plucked the deepest emotional chord in the country today: The nonstop fighting between our two political parties has left many Americans feeling like the children of two permanently divorcing parents. The country is starved to see its two major parties do big hard things together again. And getting a glimpse \u2014 even just a pretend one \u2014 of Obama and Boehner teaming up reminds you what\u2019s been lost.I think what\u2019s propelling Donald Trump\u2019s success more than anything is the feeling of many Americans that our politics are totally stuck. There is an overwhelming sense of \u201cstuckness\u201d \u2014 and the fantasy that Trump plays to, and plays up, is that he can pull the sword from the stone and do deals. No one was more responsible for this \u201cstuckness,\u201d though, than today\u2019s Republican Party. When Mitch McConnell, the G.O.P. leader in the Senate, said in October 2010 that \u201cthe single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president,\u201d he described the Republicans\u2019 dominant strategy since 2008. The party stopped thinking seriously about market-based alternatives. Into that emptiness entered Trump, like an invasive species.This was a really bad time for us to be stuck. I\u2019m just finishing writing a new book, which is partly about the inflection point we hit around 2007. In 2007, Apple came out with the iPhone, beginning the smartphone/apps revolution; in late 2006 Facebook opened its doors to anyone, not just college and high school students, and took off like a rocket; Google came out with the Android operating system in 2007; Hadoop launched in 2007, helping create the storage/processing power for the big data revolution; Github, launched in 2007, scaling open-source software; Twitter was spun off as its own separate platform in 2007. Amazon came out with the Kindle in 2007. Airbnb started in 2007.That was the real grand bargain we needed. Instead, we had the 2008 economic meltdown, which set off more polarization, and way too much gridlock, given how much rethinking, reimagining and retooling we needed to do. In this vortex a lot of the public got unmoored and disoriented, opening the way for populists with simple answers. Get rid of immigrants, end trade with China or eliminate big banks and all will be fine. It\u2019s nonsense.But if you\u2019re for these things only as they now exist, you\u2019re also wrong. Each one needs retooling. It\u2019s clear: Free trade with China has hurt more people than originally thought. It\u2019s clear: Low-skilled illegal immigration has hurt more American workers than we\u2019ve fully understood. (And more high-skilled immigration in a knowledge age would enhance our economy more than most people understand.) It\u2019s clear: Social Security, Medicare and Obamacare all need fixes to remain sustainable. It\u2019s clear: Capitalism driven more by machines and robots poses new challenges for both white-collar and blue-collar workers.Every one of these challenges can be met if we put our heads and hands together. For that to happen, though, this version of the Republican Party had to be destroyed, so a thinking center-right party can emerge. If that is what Trump has done, he\u2019s done the Lord\u2019s work. We also need Democrats to be a center-left party, though, and not let Bernie Sanders pull them to the far left. If both happen, maybe something good can actually emerge from this crazy election.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Through the Looking Glass With Ben Rhodes", "Date": "2016-05-13", "News": "Supported byNotebookMy interest in Ben Rhodes began with a photograph I saw from Senator Barack Obama\u2019s insurgent campaign for president in 2008. The photograph showed a group of Obama\u2019s young speechwriters celebrating a victory. In the shallow background was a young writer, sitting at a table, with a dark, wool ski cap pulled down low, nearly over his eyes.The young writer\u2019s name, I learned, was Ben Rhodes. Following the practice I have pursued for the past 25 years, I created a new file on my laptop and labeled it \u201cRhodes.\u201d Every decent journalist I know keeps dozens of files like that on subjects that interest them. We move them around on our screens and tuck them away into other files. Sometimes we deposit them in the trash. Every few months or so, I would scroll through the clips in the file to see if they added up to something larger that I wanted to write about. For several years, the answer was no. So it sat there.My interest heightened during the debates over the Iran nuclear deal, which seemed to highlight the increasingly sophisticated use of digital tools by powerful interests \u2014 including the White House \u2014 to achieve their policy aims, a practice that both amazed and troubled me. The campaign to sell the deal, it seemed to me, had been constructed by someone very smart, someone with a real mastery of an art that I recognized immediately, because I had built my entire career on it and had also taught it for 10 years to graduate students at N.Y.U. and Columbia University: narrative. Through a cascade of tweets, quotes and other social-media posts, a story was being told, with the purpose of motivating people to feel a certain way, in order to achieve a specific foreign-policy aim. The other side was doing the exact same thing, of course, but they weren\u2019t very good at it \u2014 and they weren\u2019t in the White House. When I started asking some of my colleagues for the name of the master storyteller whose narratives I was watching unfold, only one name came back at me: Ben Rhodes.So in my spare time, I began thinking harder about Rhodes and what he actually did, with the aim of writing a long magazine story about him.After the dust-up over the Iran deal was safely over \u2014 I thought \u2014 I pitched my editors at The New York Times Magazine on a profile of Ben Rhodes. They agreed to it. I then asked Rhodes in December of last year if he would be willing to cooperate for the story. He almost immediately said yes. And that is where the story gets complicated \u2014 at least for the people who have written, blogged and tweeted about it over the past week.Rhodes knew who I was. How do I know that? Because the White House is equipped with Google. And because Rhodes told me so himself. He earned a Master of Fine Arts degree at N.Y.U., where I taught, and he appreciates longform narrative journalism, which is what I do. He is a regular reader of the magazines \u2014 like Harper\u2019s, The New Yorker and The Atlantic \u2014 in which I have published dozens of deeply reported stories over the past 20 years. We met a few times, and when I told him what I wanted to write, and why, he understood immediately why it was important and why I wanted to do it. He decided to help me. During the course of my reporting, he opened every door I asked him to open (except for one question I wanted to ask the president). He was always incredibly direct and candid with me. In more than a dozen hours of taped conversation, he went off the record, for very brief periods, only twice.Rhodes wasn\u2019t afraid of the fact that I strongly disagreed with him on specific matters of policy \u2014 like the war in Syria. He welcomed disagreement and encouraged it. He vociferously supported the president\u2019s policies on every single issue we spoke about \u2014 and made some excellent points, some of which changed my mind about things that I thought I felt clearly about. It turned out that Rhodes had been instrumental in reopening diplomatic relations with Cuba and Myanmar. None of the diplomats he worked with seemed to have a single bad word to say about him.When a White House adviser \u2014 not Rhodes \u2014 mentioned a \u201cwar room\u201d for selling the Iran deal, a phrase that disturbed me, I went back to Rhodes and asked what it was and who ran it. He arranged for me to interview anyone I wanted. They were all candid and factual. They explained to me how they had used state-of-the-art tools and a sophisticated understanding of the way information moves in the social-media age to sell a deal that they clearly believed to be in the United States\u2019 national interest.But why were any of them talking to me? I soon surmised that Rhodes\u2019s motivation in allowing me to peek behind the curtain came from a disquiet he felt at the possibility, or the likelihood, that the machinery he managed so brilliantly would soon be in the hands of his successors, who might use it to do things that he thought could be quite dangerous \u2014 like goading the United States into another pointless, bloody foreign war. Rhodes readily admitted to me that the work he does is a potentially dangerous distortion of democracy, but he also felt that it had become a necessary evil, caused by the fracturing of the 20th-century mass audience and the decline of the American press. He expressed a deep personal hopelessness about the possibility of open, rational public debate in a brutally partisan climate. But didn\u2019t the country deserve better? I kept asking him. Over time, our conversations around this point evolved, without either of us directly mentioning it, into a kind of gentleman\u2019s bet: My article would go as hard as I could at the truth as I saw it, The Times would publish it, and one of us would be proved right while the other would be proved wrong.Before I address some of the criticisms of the article, I would like to state two very basic things for the record:1. I stand behind every single word I wrote. This newspaper does, too. The New York Times has looked closely at every complaint leveled against the piece and has found absolutely nothing to correct. If anything is found to merit a correction, it will certainly be corrected.2. I think Ben Rhodes is the bravest person I\u2019ve ever met in Washington. If it sounds weird to say that Rhodes is both a manipulative spin-doctor and a deeply honest, creative person who believes strongly in the policies he spins for, well, that is still the truth.Now, to some of the specific accusations:Let\u2019s consider the Slate article first. It was, like a lot of Slate articles, intentionally provocative. It unfolds as an exercise in rational choice superpower-client state theory. It was designed to be provocative on the way to making a serious point.Near the top of the article I state: \u201cFrom a U.S. point of view, at least, there is little reason to doubt the analysis that a nuclear Iran with a few dozen bombs can be contained at relatively limited cost using the same strategies that successfully constrained an aggressive Soviet Empire armed with nearly 45,000 nuclear warheads at the height of the Cold War.\u201dThe rest of the article proceeds to explain exactly why, \u201cfrom the standpoint of international relations theory, the scariest thing about recent Israeli rhetoric is that an attack on Iran lines up quite well with Israel\u2019s rational interests as a superpower client.\u201dMy analysis of how Israel might see its own rational self-interest was apparently shared by no less distinguished a neocon than President Obama. As Leon Panetta noted in my magazine article, perhaps his main job as secretary of defense was to restrain Israel from bombing Iran \u2014 by convincing them that America would do it for them, if Iran actually threatened to build a bomb.I explained to Smith what I considered to be an important difference between nuclear know-how and infrastructure, one that I thought was being blurred by the rhetoric of both sides in the Iran deal debate. Thanks to Coster-Mullen, I told him, I had the plans for a nuclear bomb in my desk drawer at home \u2014 but I lacked the tens of billions of dollars necessary to proliferate. I thought that Smith\u2019s article was fair to what I wrote, so I agreed to be on his panel.\u201cUnlike many of you, I\u2019m a writer. I\u2019m a journalist. I\u2019m not involved in partisan politics. I\u2019ve generally considered myself to be a liberal Democrat. These principles [of bipartisanship and consensus] historically are noncontroversial ones. They\u2019ve been embraced by every American administration since World War II. To find them being undone in this very rapid way, given the potential consequences of unchecked nuclear proliferation \u2014 not just in the region but also in Asia \u2014 is and should be a terrifying thing for Americans to contemplate, whatever their feelings about this president or Republicans or Democrats. As someone who has reported in and around questions related to nuclear programs and gray market economies, I am startled by the lack of attention and clarity that is obvious in the way these stories are being reported.\u201dFinally, I would like to turn to the protestations of two journalists, Jeffrey Goldberg and Laura Rozen, who felt wounded by a very brief passage in my article, in which they were named as people who \u201chelped retail\u201d the administration\u2019s talking points.The reason I chose to cite Rozen and Goldberg as important conduits for the administration\u2019s foreign policy message is based on two kinds of evidence. One: This very idea was suggested to me in taped interviews with White House staff members who dealt with these journalists; in interviews with other journalists; and in interviews with other people who read their work. Two: My own reading of both Rozen and Goldberg for years had suggested to me that this was a fair thing to say about their work. It seemed at least worth mentioning the names of some journalists in a 9,500-word article about a writer who tells stories to the public, using journalists as one of his instruments. If I didn\u2019t name any of those journalists, readers might fairly conclude that Rhodes was in fact terrible at his job \u2014 or that journalists, especially those who live in Washington, belong to a special category of person who must never be criticized, even gently.And this is why, I think, my story ignited such a firestorm. It was a portrait of an honest, dedicated person with a great deal of power in Washington who happens to be deeply critical of the press \u2014 not out of cynicism or anger, but out of regret over the seemingly vanishing possibilities of free and open discourse. I did not pry this critique out of Rhodes, nor did I introduce him to it. He has far more familiarity with the 21st-century news cycle than I do. It has been fascinating for me to watch my story, which was largely read on its own terms outside of Washington and even by the White House itself, go through the looking glass of social media. The story itself has vanished, replaced by a digital mash-up of slurs and invective, supported by stray phrases that have been mechanically tweezered from different texts. The issues that Rhodes raises in my profile \u2014 about the reshaping of the media, the way American foreign policy has shifted, the way the world works now \u2014 none of these things are being discussed, either. Somehow, for a small group of people with very loud megaphones, the point right now seems to be me \u2014 or rather, a digital pi\u00f1ata they have slapped my name on. It seems fair to say that Rhodes won our bet.Advertisement"}
