{"Headline": "Artificial Intelligence Is Far From Matching Humans, Panel Says", "Date": "2016-05-25", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Never mind Terminator-like killer robots. Artificial intelligence researchers are grappling with more realistic questions like whether their creations will take too many jobs from humans.Eight years after leading artificial intelligence scientists said their field did not need to be regulated, the question of government oversight has re-emerged as the technology has rapidly progressed.On Tuesday, at an event sponsored by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, legal specialists and technologists explored questions about autonomous systems that would increasingly make decisions without human input in areas like warfare, transportation and health.Still, despite improvement in areas like machine vision and speech understanding, A.I. research is still far from matching the flexibility and learning capability of the human mind, researchers at the conference said.\u201cThe A.I. community keeps climbing one mountain after another, and as it gets to the top of each mountain, it sees ahead still more mountains,\u201d said Ed Felten, a computer scientist who is a deputy chief technology officer in the Office of Science and Technology Policy.The half-day program, co-sponsored with the University of Washington School of Law and the university\u2019s Tech Policy Lab, was the first of four events the White House has planned that will focus on law and policy, as well as the social and economic implications of autonomous machine research.\u201cThese issues of A.I. and machines learning were popping up all over the government, and there was an opportunity to get more coordinated in how we address them,\u201d Dr. Felten said.After 25 artificial intelligence researchers met in 2009, the group, sponsored by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, reported that there was no imminent danger from a technology that had prompted fears of Hollywood-style weapons and advanced economies that were devoid of human workers.Leading technologists and scientists have also pondered the possibility that artificial intelligence, like genetic engineering, might soon constitute an existential threat to the human race.In recent years, the debate has spread to the broader social impact of autonomous programs that will perform tasks like driving cars and offering medical and financial advice.One challenge for A.I., according to a number of the researchers who spoke, is that the public perception about the threat of A.I. has largely been shaped by Hollywood.\u201cCertainly, Hollywood has played a tremendous role with vision like Skynet,\u201d the computer network that turns on humans in the \u201cTerminator\u201d movies, said Oren Etzioni, chief executive of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, a nonprofit research group funded by the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much always the case in science fiction that A.I. is this monolithic entity that is scheming to take over.\u201dHe cautioned that attention-getting feats like Google\u2019s AlphaGo program, which defeated a human champion in the board game Go, had plenty of humans behind the machine doing the work.At the same time, despite the consensus about the limits of today\u2019s technology, many of the panelists wrestled with new challenges presented by A.I. systems that were appearing in virtually all walks of life, including services delivered by smartphones and algorithms that guide missiles.Kate Crawford, a principal researcher at Microsoft Research, called on the industry to add ethics to the professional training of engineers. \u201cWe need to start changing the skill set of the people who are going to be the data scientists of the future and the A.I. creators of the future,\u201d she said.A.I. systems are pervasive, Ms. Crawford said, pointing to a doll like Hello Barbie, which speaks and listens.\u201cYou might think that\u2019s a fantastic toy, that\u2019s really wonderful,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat you don\u2019t realize is that it is the front to this huge data ingestion machine that is taking all of those statements by that child and then using them for a whole range of purposes.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Google has made a practice of informing websites when links are removed, which critics contend is an effort to rally support against Europe\u2019s privacy ruling.

{"Headline": "Why Windows 10 Upgrades Go Wrong, and How to Avoid It", "Date": "2016-05-18", "News": "Supported byTech FixM. J. RUMMINGER, a freelance writer in Chicago, recently clicked a button to upgrade her laptop to the latest version of Microsoft\u2019s Windows operating system. The upgrade took all day to download \u2014 and then nothing happened, not even a message about a failure.Ms. Rumminger feared that installing the upgrade again would do more harm than good, like breaking her apps, so she decided not to try. Yet reminders to upgrade from Microsoft frequently pop up on her computer screen.\u201cI get the sense from their messages they\u2019re getting increasingly desperate in trying to get people to upgrade,\u201d she said.One reader, Maureen Moss, emailed that Windows 10 was a \u201cnightmare\u201d after the system broke her computer\u2019s networking capability and compatibility with a printer. Another reader, James Bass, said Windows 10 took apart two Toshiba laptops \u201cpiece by piece.\u201d First the Wi-Fi stopped working, he wrote, and then the keyboard failed.Yet the consensus among information technology professionals is that upgrading to Windows 10 is a wise idea because the system is faster, well built and more secure. And Microsoft\u2019s free-upgrade window for Windows 10 is closing soon: After July 29, the company will start charging $119 for a copy.Microsoft said that the Windows 10 release had been smooth, but that there were bound to be some issues among the millions of devices running the system, given the complex ecosystem of PC hardware and accessories.\u201cWhen you\u2019ve got 300 million devices, there\u2019s going to be edge cases that we don\u2019t pick up,\u201d said David Dennis, a Microsoft spokesman. He said the company was continuing to update the system to address problems.To help overcome upgrade issues, Microsoft and tech experts offered tips on diagnosing and treating Windows 10 problems.Before starting an installation, back up all of your data. Microsoft designed the Windows 10 upgrade to be seamless \u2014 a push of a button and you get going. While the company does not officially recommend that you create a backup, this is a must for any operating system upgrade. You never know if an unforeseen circumstance, like a power or Internet failure, could interfere with your installation. Services like Backblaze and CrashPlan are handy tools for making backups.Brian Denslow, a technician for Tech Collective, an information technology consulting company in San Francisco, said his experience upgrading clients to Windows 10 had been smooth. For example, when upgrading a law firm\u2019s machines to Windows 10, only one out of 50 PCs had issues, he said.So what is the culprit behind Windows 10 upgrades going wrong? Mr. Denslow said the machines that tended to have problems were cheap computers that cost $300 or less, like budget models made by Acer or Asus.Cheaper machines tend to be loaded up with parts manufactured by component makers that have neglected to update their drivers \u2014 the software written for devices or components to work with the operating system \u2014 for the new Windows system, he said.Before users switch to Windows 10, Microsoft runs a \u201ccompatibility checker\u201d to see if any apps or devices will stop working after an upgrade to Windows 10. Yet many readers said that the checker failed to identify issues before installing the upgrade.Mr. Dennis of Microsoft said the compatibility checker was imperfect. Some manufacturers and component makers may not have kept their software drivers up to date, which can lead to problems.So if a specific accessory or part of your computer acts badly, an outdated driver is often the culprit. If, say, your printer stopped working, go to the manufacturer\u2019s support website and search for a new driver for that printer model with Windows 10 compatibility. If there is no updated driver, your best options are to stick with the older version of Windows or buy a new printer.In the Settings window, select the Recovery tab, and there will be an option to go back to an older version of Windows. Click \u201cGet started,\u201d and Microsoft will return you to the previous version of Windows.In other words, when you install Windows 10, you need not purge all the data from the hard drive to install a fresh copy of the operating system. Doing so would wipe out the directory with that older version of Windows, killing an important protection. So create a backup, install the operating system, see how it hums and revert if the system is unstable. The option to return to a previous version of Windows is available for only one month after an upgrade to Windows 10.If you have tried all of the above and Windows 10 is still not playing well, you can stick with your older version and tell Microsoft to leave you alone.Mr. Dennis said the company had heard feedback about it being too aggressive with encouraging people to upgrade. So Microsoft recently clarified the wording of the upgrade reminder to read: \u201cClick here to change upgrade schedule or cancel scheduled upgrade.\u201d Clicking through will let you opt out of the upgrade.If you are eager to get on Windows 10 and your machine is not cooperating, consider upgrading the parts or buying a new computer, Mr. Denslow said. He and other I.T. professionals recommended that owners of PCs with older, spinning hard-disk drives upgrade to solid state, a newer storage technology. Solid-state drives generally have less storage capacity than spinning hard-disk drives, but they load Windows 10 applications faster and are more durable because they lack moving parts.Mr. Denslow also suggested that Windows users who want to hold on to their machines for many years consider spending a bit more on higher-quality computers like the ThinkPad by Lenovo, a company that is diligent about keeping drivers up to date. Even buying a used ThinkPad for $500, he said, will go a long way.Problems with Windows 10 are usually because of user error, but not because a user installed the system wrong. \u201cIt\u2019s the user error based on shopping on price alone,\u201d Mr. Denslow said.J.D. Biersdorfer contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Women in Tech Band Together to Track Diversity, After Hours", "Date": "2016-05-03", "News": "Supported byThe group\u2019s push is one of the more visible diversity efforts to come from women in Silicon Valley as tech companies grapple with criticism over the makeup of their work forces, which skew white and male. Over the last few years, tech entrepreneurs like Kimberly Bryant of Black Girls Code and Laura Weidman Powers of Code 2040 have promoted the inclusion of young women and minorities in early computer science education programs with their start-ups.All of them are working on Project Include outside of their respective workplaces, on their own time.As part of Project Include, the group plans to extract commitments from tech companies to track the diversity of their work forces over time and eventually share that data with other start-ups. The effort will focus on start-ups that employ 25 to 1,000 workers, in the hope of spurring the companies to think about equality sooner rather than later. The project will also ask for participation from venture capital firms that advise and mentor the start-ups.Project Include aims to have 18 companies as part of its first cohort; a few have already signed up. The group will meet regularly for seven months to define and track specific metrics. At the end of that period, the group will publish an anonymized set of results to show the progress \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 that the start-ups have made around diversity.\u201cIf companies start early with diversity and inclusion, they don\u2019t have to bolt it on later, which is much harder,\u201d said Ms. Baker, the former Google engineer, who now works at Slack, a workplace collaboration software start-up.\u201cIt is this incredibly self-serving mythology that we are the best and the brightest, and that the best ideas rise to the top and will get funded,\u201d said Ms. Kapor Klein, noting there is plenty of data to show that minority access to tech programs and networks is worse than that of white males. \u201cDespite an avalanche of rigorous data to the contrary, the belief in pure meritocracy persists.\u201dMany of the women involved in Project Include were already leading diversity efforts before they decided to collaborate. Last year, for example, Ms. Pao became something of a magnet for women who were disenfranchised with inequality issues in tech after her case against Kleiner Perkins.So when Ms. Pao had the seeds of the idea for what would become Project Include, it was easy to find others to join forces. She reached out over Twitter\u2019s private message system to Ms. Baker, who is known in Silicon Valley for raising awareness around diversity issues. Ms. Baker in turn introduced Ms. Pao to Ms. Hutchinson; Ms. Pao already knew Ms. Blount through their time working together at Reddit. Eventually, over a dinner, they settled on a group of eight, with a number of outside supporters.Kate Mitchell, managing director at the venture capital firm Scale Venture Partners and a co-chairwoman of a National Venture Capital Association task force on diversity, said her group was working with Project Include because of its tech-centric, start-up approach to sharing data and information with other participants.\u201cIt\u2019s taking a page out of open-source software,\u201d Ms. Mitchell said. \u201cYou measure, you try things, you iterate and then you build on top of each other\u2019s ideas and make your companies even better.\u201dThe hope, over time, is for members of Project Include to form a community open to discussing inclusion issues among one another. \u201cA lot of these conversations are very uncomfortable for people,\u201d Ms. Pao said. \u201cThese are exactly the types of uncomfortable conversations that we need to have.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The company\u2019s previous chief executive, Steven A. Ballmer, made the deal with the goal of transforming Microsoft, a company that was struggling to keep pace with the likes of Apple and Google in the mobile business.But the fortunes of Nokia, a once-mighty player in mobile, had already soured as sales of traditional cellphones lost ground to software-rich smartphones. The combination of its hardware expertise and Microsoft\u2019s software skills never produced the results Microsoft had hoped for.While some of its phones were well reviewed, independent app developers treated Microsoft\u2019s smartphones as an afterthought, making it less attractive to customers.Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s current chief executive, has taken a different approach to the mobile business than his predecessor, pushing the company\u2019s development teams to release mobile apps, including its Office franchise, for the iPhone and the Android operating system from Google.Microsoft has also created a common Windows operating system that runs on all of its devices, including phones, tablets like Surface and the Xbox One game console. The long-term goal of unifying the software for all the devices is to get developers more interested in Windows by giving them a much bigger audience to reach with their apps.Microsoft said it would introduce new smartphones in the future, suggesting that they would be aimed at business customers, who have shown more interest in the company\u2019s devices.\u201cWhen I look back on our journey in mobility, we\u2019ve done hard work and had great ideas but have not always had the alignment needed across the company to make an impact,\u201d Mr. Myerson wrote in his e-mail to Microsoft employees.Mark Scott contributed reporting from Rome.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Leaks Abound as Yahoo Auction Gets Underway", "Date": "2016-05-18", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorIt\u2019s hard to sell any company, but Yahoo is finding that it may be even harder when the entire world seems to know about your supposedly secret bidding.Secrecy is supposed to be the sine qua non of deal-making. An early leak can destroy a deal by driving the share price of the target company too high or by alerting other potential bidders.As a result, deal makers are known for their secrecy, using code names and holding clandestine meetings. In the 1980s, it was not uncommon for law firms to sweep for bugs and for arbitrageurs to camp outside law firm offices to try to figure out who would be the next hostile raider target.Secrets are not always kept, to be sure; in fact, leaks in deal-making are an art form practiced for a variety of purposes. It may just be about a lawyer or a banker cozying up to a journalist. In Britain, it is standard practice to do a \u201cleak announcement\u201d at the start of a negotiation, as bankers are known for regularly leaking deals. It is not quite like that in the United States, but there is a steady stream of dialogue among lawyers, bankers and journalists. After all, they are all in this game together and are likely to see each other again in the next big deal.The leak cycle can work both ways for companies, though the conventional wisdom is that leaks hurt deals more than help.That\u2019s probably true for Yahoo. Its sale process is unfolding in the public eye in part as a result of its decision to publicly announce that it is exploring \u201cstrategic alternatives\u201d \u2014 Wall Street code for a sale. Given Yahoo\u2019s prominence, a media feeding frenzy was always a given.But here\u2019s where it gets interesting. Yahoo is running an auction process. So its goal is to bring in as many bidders as possible to generate a hot auction and push up the price.In this case, reporting on the process has the effect of amplifying the bidders and the numbers they are putting forward. Take the recent reports that Warren E. Buffett and Dan Gilbert of Quicken Loans are in the Yahoo bidding.This is the type of news that bankers love. There is such a glow around Mr. Buffett that it will help make Yahoo shine. It shows other bidders that there is a real player with money in the bidding, which will hopefully push up interest and prices.Never mind that Mr. Buffett is known for paying cheaply most of the time or that this is essentially a private equity bid \u2013 one that cannot pay top dollar.Private equity firms often lose out to strategic bidders, real companies that can cut costs and find efficiency in the merger of two entities. Many of the bidders for Yahoo are private equity firms, including TPG Capital, Bain Capital and Vista Equity Partners. That is another bad sign for a high price for Yahoo.Some of the attention over the early stages of the sales process seems unwarranted. The news that there were about 40 bidders for Yahoo in its first round missed the point that these were just companies that had signed confidentiality agreements. The number of bidders is settling down \u2013 perhaps to 10 or so. But even those bidders are probably still deciding whether to make final offers.And pay no attention to the presumed range of the latest round of bids \u2014 $4 billion to $8 billion. These are simply back-of-the-envelope indications that will change substantially.A steady stream of players has emerged in the media coverage. Verizon, the parent of AOL, is in the mix and is seen by many as the most likely winner. There\u2019s not a lot of foundation to this assertion other than the concept of putting AOL and Yahoo together has become one of the more pitched merger ideas of the decade.Alphabet does not appear to be bidding. (Antitrust issues would most likely prevent it from acquiring Yahoo anyway.) And Microsoft is supposedly lurking to try to tie up with another bidder.Some players may be deliberately leaking that they are not involved in the bidding to signal to their competitors to stay out as well, since they do not have to worry about an Internet behemoth acquiring the company and becoming even more gigantic.The round-by-round coverage of the bidding may push the winner to pay more for Yahoo, but it can also have the opposite effect. If Verizon thinks it is up against only private equity firms, it can adjust its bid lower to account for this.Reports of potential bidders walking away from Yahoo can cool down the auction, too. If bidders are seen as dropping away too quickly, Yahoo will be severely damaged as it becomes known which companies kicked Yahoo\u2019s tires and passed.In other words, the more information other bidders have about the bidding, the more finely they can tune their bids to the competition, at that will most likely result in lower bids.And the coverage becomes a channel for bidders to complain that Yahoo is not disclosing enough information about the business for them to bid. This has put pressure on Yahoo to do more to push the sales process.So we await the next round of bidding \u2013 second-round bids are supposedly due in June in what is definitely a slow-motion auction. You can be sure there will be more details and players to surface.Whether it helps Yahoo or not is another question.Advertisement"}

The device existed on the stage, but its features still seemed to be works in progress.Why introduce it now and make such a big thing of it? The reason seemed to lie in Mr. Pichai\u2019s unusual shout-out to a competitor. \u201cCredit to the team at Amazon for creating a lot of excitement in this space,\u201d he said.Those are millions of consumers who are lost, at least to some extent, to Google. The search company had to begin competing with Amazon before that number swelled to tens of millions. Mr. Pichai pointedly noted that Google was \u201cat a pivotal moment.\u201dThis was Google\u2019s 10th annual developers conference, but the first held in the amphitheater adjacent to its headquarters. The event is designed to be mostly instructive and inspirational for the freelance software engineers who use Google\u2019s tools to build things. But it is also promotional, an opportunity taken to broadcast around the world \u2014 there were a million people listening in China, Mr. Pichai said \u2014 what tomorrow will hold.Mario Queiroz, the Google executive in charge of Home, said it would \u201cbe a beautiful addition to any room in your house.\u201d In a short film, a family was shown waking up with Home. The father used it to play music in one child\u2019s room and to turn on the lights in another to get them out of bed. The girl, finishing her homework, asked Home what the Spanish word was for \u201capple.\u201d The parents rearranged their schedules.\u201cIt will let anyone in the family, kids or adults, have a conversation with Google,\u201d Mr. Queiroz said. Indeed, in the film, everyone is so busy communicating with Home they hardly talk to each other.Google already does search solely through voice, but its efforts have been confusingly branded. On Wednesday, Google promoted Google assistant \u2014 the company\u2019s name for the ability to have a two-way conversation to get information. It will be available this summer in a messaging app called Allo and later in Google Home.There have been efforts before to develop control centers for the home, but none have made serious inroads. Even the Echo was not an immediate hit with reviewers, some of whom wondered whether it might be little more than a gimmick.\u201cBefore I got an Echo I thought it was a joke and a bad idea,\u201d said Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray. \u201cBut I saw the utility and ended up buying five of them for my family.\u201dFor Google Home to stand out, he said, it would have to outdo the Echo, particularly in search. \u201cYou have to be able to ask it a complex question, and then it would go to the Internet and read it back to you,\u201d Mr. Munster said. \u201cEcho doesn\u2019t do a good job of that today.\u201dThe big tech companies are the new middlemen of commerce and communication. People used to go to stores to buy brands on impulse or by design. Now Google, Amazon and the others mediate the moment.One example of that power was given by Mr. Pichai, when he demonstrated a conversation with Google through his phone about taking his family to the movie \u201cJungle Book.\u201d\u201cIs \u2018Jungle Book\u2019 any good?\u201d he asked. The reply came: \u201cLooks like it\u2019s getting some good reviews.\u201dWho or what is powering the agent\u2019s opinions, and how much the consumer can trust it, are among many things still to be worked out.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Aging in the Key of Humor", "Date": "2016-05-20", "News": "Supported byHis back hurts. His memory is slipping. He can\u2019t cook, but then he never could. Igloo-making is no longer one of his diversions. The wit is sharp, quick as ever, but now he\u2019s prone to \u2026 what\u2019s the word? Oh, and he has Parkinson\u2019s disease.Michael Kinsley is aging so you don\u2019t have to. The editor in him, the one who held the reins at The New Republic, Harper\u2019s and Slate, and grasped for a few hours the chance to helm The New Yorker, would refine that. Here\u2019s how he puts it, in his guidance to the 74 million baby boomers entering the years of living less dangerously:\u201cBut when it comes to the ultimate boomer game, competitive longevity, I\u2019m on the sidelines doing color commentary.\u201d His chronic disease, which gives him many of the symptoms of old age but which he believes is no more likely to bring him to an early death than slipping on a bar of soap, has presented him with \u201can interesting foretaste of our shared future.\u201dKinsley, who coined a new definition of a gaffe \u2014 when a politician tells the truth \u2014 and once described 38-year-old Al Gore as \u201can old person\u2019s idea of a young person,\u201d (today, Paul Ryan), is in public service mode, out with a slim book on aging. \u201cSometimes I feel like a scout from my generation, sent out ahead to experience in my 50s what even the healthiest boomers are going to experience in their 60s, 70s and 80s.\u201dFull disclosure: I like Kinsley. I would call him a friend, even if his trademark misanthropy prevents him from returning the sentiment. But here\u2019s the thing: I loathe books about baby boomers. I hated the yuppie thing. I despised the era when my generation acted as if we were the first people ever to have kids. And I can\u2019t stand the Viagra-taking, booty-shaking, aging rocker phase. I don\u2019t doubt that boomers will \u201creinvent\u201d old age, because that\u2019s what boomers do to every age.But along the road to Bernie Sanders grumpiness, can somebody slap some sense into these people? Enter Kinsley. At age 65, his Parkinson\u2019s has given him a premature taste of the stumbling, the cognitive slips, the limits that will inevitably define life\u2019s actuarial last trimester. He can no longer drive. A woman at a dinner party offered to cut up his meat.When I met Kinsley in 1996, he had just moved to Seattle to start Slate, the online magazine. There were many reasons to hate him: Harvard graduate, Rhodes Scholar, wunderkind editor, talking head on CNN\u2019s \u201cCrossfire,\u201d his visage on the cover of Newsweek, under the headline: \u201cSwimming to Seattle: Everyone Else is Moving There. Should You?\u201dI gave him six months before he left. Surely he would die outside the biosphere of Beltway bloviation. A decade later, he was still here in Seattle. He found true love, his wife Patty Stonesifer \u2014 who has done much good in nonprofits and philanthropy after doing well at Microsoft. I always thought of him as a highly evolved brain inhabiting an uncertain body, an E.T. with wit. But then he learned to backpack in the Cascade Mountains, to snowshoe, to swim in Lake Washington in winter, and yes, to build an igloo \u2014 all with Parkinson\u2019s, which was diagnosed when he was 43.In his book, \u201cOld Age \u2014 A Beginner\u2019s Guide,\u201d he tries on altruism, suggesting that boomers\u2019 ultimate gift to the future would be to pay off the national debt, and do it before the last of that g-g-generation turns 65, in 2029.Nice try. Never going to happen. Kinsley\u2019s contribution to the wave of new books, shows and miracle antidotes to aging is his approach. Where others would groan, wince, cry or whine, Kinsley is looking for the joke. So, after undergoing nine hours of deep brain surgery, he thought of what he could say to assure his friends he had not lost any of his analytical skills.\u201cWell, of course,\u201d he said, post-op. \u201cWhen you cut taxes, government revenues go up. Why couldn\u2019t I see that before?\u201dEasy for him to say. No, actually, it\u2019s not. His Parkinson\u2019s meds allow him to seem relatively symptom-free for hours, but then he starts to stiffen, like the Tin Man in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d in need of oil. And Kinsley admits to some loss of his mental acuity in recent years.He notes that 28 million boomers are expected to develop Alzheimer\u2019s or some other form of dementia \u2014 nothing to laugh at. \u201cDementia seems like an especially humiliating last stop on the road of life,\u201d Kinsley writes. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to do it in style or in dignity.\u201dBut perhaps there\u2019s a way to find some grace notes through humor. I saw Kinsley this week, before a packed house at Seattle\u2019s Town Hall. He was in typical form. Asked at the end of the evening what his audience should \u201ctake away\u201d from the distilled wisdom of his book, he paused, giving that owlish, quizzical look of his and said, \u201cSeveral copies.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Warren Buffett Stake Suggests Apple Is All Grown Up", "Date": "2016-05-19", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseWith this week\u2019s imprimatur from the legendary investor Warren Buffett, it should now be official: Apple, the world\u2019s largest company by market capitalization and a symbol of American technological innovation, is a \u201cvalue\u201d stock.That may prove to be a decidedly mixed blessing.Mr. Buffett is the world\u2019s most prominent and successful proponent of value investing \u2014 an approach that seeks stocks that are undervalued and sell for less than their \u201cintrinsic value,\u201d as Benjamin Graham put it his 1949 classic \u201cThe Intelligent Investor.\u201d Mr. Buffett credits Mr. Graham with shaping his own approach to investing.\u201cWe\u2019ve just looked at it again,\u201d said Bill Smead, who manages the Smead Value Fund, one of the most successful large-cap value mutual funds over the last five years, according to Morningstar. \u201cAnybody that discounts the thinking at Berkshire Hathaway does so at their peril, in my opinion.\u201dValue stocks are typically unpopular among many investors, their shares often battered by disappointing short-term revenue and earnings results. They usually trade at very low price-to-earnings ratios, a common valuation measure. Nonetheless, some academic studies have suggested that over time, they outperform other stocks, in part because expectations are so low.Apple \u201cis going to attract more value investors,\u201d said Toni Sacconaghi, a senior analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein who covers Apple. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for beaten-down stocks with negative sentiment. Apple has traded below a market multiple for years and sentiment has become increasingly pessimistic, especially over the past month.\u201dMr. Sacconaghi has a buy recommendation on the stock, \u201cnot because we believe this will be a high-growth company going forward, but because the current price is discounting a decline in cash flow forever, and we think that\u2019s overly pessimistic.\u201dAccording to the market research firm Thomson Reuters Lipper, just 69 of 357 actively managed value funds in the United States \u2014 fewer than 20 percent \u2014 currently hold positions in Apple.That\u2019s because Apple has long been considered a quintessential growth stock: one of the glamorous high-flying cousins to dowdy value stocks. Growth investors think growth stocks are undervalued, too, because they expect their earnings to grow faster (often much faster) than other investors recognize.As a result, valuation measures for growth stocks can go sky-high. In two prominent growth-stock examples, shares of Facebook trade at a price-earnings ratio of about 73, and Netflix at about 312. (The price-earnings average for stocks in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is currently about 24.)This week Apple\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio was just over 10.If Apple is now a value stock, though, plenty of growth investors haven\u2019t gotten the message. Among actively managed growth funds, 249 of 619, or 40 percent, hold Apple shares, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper. That\u2019s more than the 230 growth funds that owned Apple stock in 2014.Should growth funds suddenly decide that Apple no longer meets their criteria, there could be a mass exodus that would be only partly offset by new purchases from value investors.Some prominent value investors aren\u2019t convinced Apple really is a value stock, despite Mr. Buffett\u2019s blessing, or that its stock price is significantly below its intrinsic value. (Intrinsic value considers all aspects of a business, including both tangible and intangible factors.)That means Apple could fall into the neutral zone of stocks that are neither growth \u2014 because they aren\u2019t growing fast enough \u2014 or value, because they\u2019re still not cheap enough.\u201cApple is extraordinarily cheap, but it\u2019s never been a value stock in the traditional sense,\u201d said Bruce Greenwald, who runs the value investing program at Columbia Business School and is a co-author of \u201cValue Investing: From Graham to Buffett and Beyond\u201d (Wiley, 2001).\u201cValue investing has always focused primarily on asset value,\u201d Professor Greenwald told me. Apple\u2019s book value, or asset value, of $130 billion isn\u2019t even close to its market capitalization of about $515 billion.That means, in theory, that other companies could replicate Apple\u2019s assets at relatively low cost, produce rival products and undermine Apple\u2019s enviably high profit margins.Tech companies typically have low asset values relative to their share prices \u2014 one reason Mr. Buffett and other value investors long shunned the sector \u2014 but their patented technologies and intellectual property nonetheless often create formidable barriers to entry by competitors.For an extraordinarily high-profit-margin technology company like Apple, the question is whether there are such \u201cmoats,\u201d as value investors like to put it, that will continue to protect it from these competitive threats.\u201cThat\u2019s always been the issue with Apple,\u201d Professor Greenwald said. \u201cHow sustainable are these profit levels and how big are the barriers? The fear with Apple is that it will get overwhelmed by new entry and new competitors. The moat doesn\u2019t seem that big. It\u2019s not just giant rivals like Samsung, but smaller companies that can survive with even a small share of the smartphone market.\u201dMr. Smead told me this week he had not added Apple to his value fund\u2019s holdings, even though the stock is so cheap that it meets many of his fund\u2019s investing criteria.\u201cOver the past five or six years, when Apple was doing so well, we joked that we were the best-performing large-cap fund that didn\u2019t own Apple,\u201d Mr. Smead said. \u201cNot that we didn\u2019t wrestle with it many times.\u201d\u201cOur difficulty has been that we don\u2019t understand what kind of moat protects their technology over the next 10 years,\u201d Mr. Smead continued. \u201cThat\u2019s the main problem. The other is that, given Apple\u2019s huge success and its sheer magnitude, it needs a monstrous new product or enhancement of an existing product to move the needle on growth.\u201dFor their part, many growth investors were startled on April 26 when Apple reported its first quarterly revenue drop since 2003. Both revenue and earnings fell short of analyst estimates, and Apple shares plunged 8 percent in one day. They rallied some this week on news of the Berkshire Hathaway investment, but are still down sharply from where they were as recently as mid-April.But Apple still has defenders among growth investors.At the end of the year, Apple was the second-largest holding in the Upright Growth Fund, the top-performing large-cap growth fund so far this year, according to Morningstar.\u201cApple\u2019s best and fastest growing days may be behind us,\u201d David Chiueh, Upright Growth\u2019s president and fund manager, told me. \u201cBut even growth-oriented funds like ours don\u2019t just contain high-growth stocks with 35-50 percent growth rates in our portfolio.\u201dHe said such rapid growth was not sustainable, and added that he was happy with companies that showed \u201csolid 8 percent to 12 percent earnings growth,\u201d a category in which he included Apple. \u201dGive them some time and they will show outstanding performance,\u201d he said.Mr. Chiueh said he was also encouraged that Apple had stepped up its spending on research and development, suggesting that new products with strong growth prospects might still be in the offing.At some fund families, Apple seems to be both a value and a growth stock, even though that seems contradictory. At the fund giant Vanguard, Apple is a major holding in the Vanguard Windsor and Windsor II funds (both value funds) and the Vanguard Morgan Growth Fund and US Growth Fund. A Vanguard spokeswoman declined to comment.All of which suggests that when it comes to Apple, \u201cvalue\u201d and \u201cgrowth\u201d may be in the eye of the beholder.Still, Mr. Buffett\u2019s announcement this week underscores that Apple\u2019s once sizzling growth has slowed, and suggests it may well be on the inexorable path from growth to value stock.That\u2019s not an especially good portent for investors. Among technology companies that have already made the same transition, Professor Greenwald cited IBM, Intel, Cisco, Microsoft and Dell, companies whose share prices, after great rocket rides, have mostly languished in recent years. (Dell was taken private in 2013.)For those who failed to buy the stock early enough, \u201cas investments, they all turned out pretty badly,\u201d he noted.Berkshire Hathaway also disclosed this week that it had increased the stake in IBM it first acquired in 2011. IBM shares have declined over the period, but by Mr. Buffett\u2019s long-term standards, the investment is still too new to judge.\u201cIf you believe the iPhone will be the global standard in 25 years, you\u2019d buy\u201d Apple stock, Professor Greenwald said. But many value investors have already seen where smartphones can go, \u201cwhich is where PCs have already gone.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "If Hillary Clinton Has 70 Percent Chance to Win, Why Is Merrick Garland at 0?", "Date": "2016-05-05", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceThe Democratic nominee for president has a 70 percent chance to win in November.The Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland has a 0 percent chance to receive a Senate hearing before the election this year.That\u2019s according to Mitch McConnell, Charles Grassley and just about every other Republican senator who has spoken on the matter.If life is partly about playing the percentages, Republicans, with their blockade against Mr. Garland \u2014 a 63-year-old widely viewed as a centrist \u2014 seem to be getting the math wrong. If the Democratic nominee (almost certainly Hillary Clinton) wins, Democrats will probably be able to name a more liberal justice and also a younger one who could serve a much longer term. Are Republicans, with Donald Trump set to be their nominee, just feeling lucky?\u201cAs Trump and Cruz knocked down Marco Rubio, the markets went up for the Democratic nominee,\u201d David Rothschild, an economist at Microsoft Research who runs PredictWise, said via email.Recently, the rise of Mr. Trump has actually decreased the PredictWise probabilities for a Democratic victory, to 70 percent today from 76 percent last week. \u201cThe markets view Trump as a much more viable general election candidate than Cruz,\u201d Mr. Rothschild said.Here\u2019s why Republicans may want to hold their ground (apart from whether it\u2019s the right thing to do):To make the moderate move effective, however, Obama would have to credibly threaten to withdraw the nomination unless it was approved by a certain date. Otherwise the Republican Senate could wait until it saw how the electoral winds were blowing, confirming Obama\u2019s nominee if a Democrat appeared poised to win the presidency and rejecting it if the Republican candidate seemed likely to prevail.It\u2019s amazing how often the press takes as a point of fact that elected officials will be \u201cpunished\u201d for one decision or another. In that same Pew poll, 58% of Republican respondents said not to confirm Garland. Those are the voters Republican Senators care about! Democrats won\u2019t vote for them. And independents, if there really are still mythical creatures who change parties during elections, will no doubt be thinking of a lot of other things besides Merrick Garland.This is not even a close call. There is absolutely no reason to drag this out any longer. Garland is not a great choice, but he is not a terrible one, either. And more than anything, he is old (for a modern Supreme Court appointment) and will be up for replacement in probably 10 years instead of 20 or 30.Republicans must know that there is absolutely no chance that we will win the White House in 2016 now. They must also know that we are likely to lose the Senate as well.In fact, if I were the Republicans, my main concern right now would be that Barack Obama would withdraw Garland\u2019s nomination today. The fact that Merrick Garland still exists as an option right now is a gift that should not be squandered.It\u2019s hard to put a percentage on that one, but it would be tough to beat for court drama.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Putting Love to the Stress Test", "Date": "2016-05-27", "News": "Supported byModern LoveSeveral years ago, on a beautiful Valentine\u2019s Day evening in San Francisco, a friend of mine and I decided to visit the California Academy of Sciences. The museum was love-themed for the occasion, with lectures about dating and exhibits of ancient dildos, contraptions that resembled medieval torture devices.After perusing the historic sex toys with growing horror, we wandered into a lecture where a woman was sharing the pros and cons of various online dating sites. Her talk led my friend to suggest I create a profile on OkCupid.I had just moved to the Bay Area and wanted to meet people, but I wasn\u2019t ready to date. So in the \u201cYou should message me if \u2014 \u201d section, I wrote a paragraph about why someone should not message me. At the top of my list: \u201cDon\u2019t message me if you\u2019re interested in dating.\u201dA couple of days later, I received a message from someone who claimed that we had a lot in common, but he insisted I answer more than just 25 questions so he could \u201cmore reliably assess\u201d our compatibility. Curiosity drove me to his profile, where I noticed that he had answered nearly 500 questions.Turns out he, too, had created an elaborate \u201cdo not message me if\u201d list that included everything I would have written if I had spent more time on my profile.We agreed to meet that weekend at a coffee shop. He was thin, with blue eyes and brown hair, and he had the quintessential San Francisco geek look. To complete the stereotype, he was a founder of a tech start-up, the San Francisco equivalent of meeting a writer in Hollywood. The only thing that stood out about him, other than his Slovene accent, was his glasses. Rather than resting on his ears as normal glasses do, they clung to the sides of his head like a huge spider. (It didn\u2019t look quite as odd as it sounds.)We grabbed lattes, settled in on the patio and dived straight into deep conversation about politics and our pasts. There was no chitchat about the weather or hobbies. Coffee turned into dinner, and we spent the entire evening discussing everything from religion to robotics, unearthing one surprising commonality after another.We\u2019re both tech geeks, but our overlap went way beyond that, with us sharing identical first jobs, worldviews, everything. Even our mothers seemed like the same person. We stumbled upon the odd fact that each had urged us (inappropriately) to frame and display our I.T. exam certificates from Microsoft because Bill Gates had signed them. Neither knew much of anything about our work, but both had heard of Mr. Gates.By 10 p.m., we decided to call it a night. He had taken the local rail to meet me, so I offered him a ride home. Our experiences and personalities were so strikingly similar I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if this encounter was an elaborate practical joke orchestrated by my friends. As he told me how to drive to his place, my suspicion only grew, because he was directing me to my own apartment. It turned out he lived right across the street from my building, a fact neither of us had known when we met a few hours earlier.To uncover our differences, I spent the week answering every question he had answered on OkCupid, but I only found more similarities. I had to supply my answers before I could see his, but one after another, our answers were identical. We met the next weekend for dinner, where I spent five hours looking for reasons to vehemently disagree with him on something, anything.After three months, the only disagreement we had was over apples; I liked them, and he didn\u2019t. But here\u2019s the thing: Our ridiculous lack of differences worried me. My idea of a successful relationship had been that of a Venn diagram with a healthy intersection, not two mostly overlapping circles, and that the best match was one in which you complemented, not replicated, each other. Perhaps I was missing something.\u201cDinners and weekend activities are great,\u201d I blurted out one day. \u201cBut we need to find a more efficient way to uncover our real differences.\u201d\u201cI think we both have the same goal,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat do you propose?\u201dIn software development, you sometimes intentionally push the boundaries to see if a system breaks. It\u2019s called stress testing, similar in concept to the treadmill test a doctor performs to measure a patient\u2019s heart condition.\u201cWhy don\u2019t we stress-test our relationship?\u201d I asked.He was game, so we spent the next 30 minutes discussing details. In essence, we wanted to try to create the environment of a decades-long marriage to see how well our relationship might hold up. He would move in with me for four weeks, during which time we would go about our lives without any facade: avoiding romance and doing nothing to try to impress the other person, while being vocal about disagreements and upfront about our inadequacies.In addition, we created exit criteria. If during or after the stress test either of us felt the relationship wouldn\u2019t work, we would part amicably without drama or guilt.With our terms agreed upon, he moved in the next day (it was quite convenient that he was already my neighbor), and our test began.I don\u2019t usually wear makeup, and he had never seen me use anything other than lip balm, so there wasn\u2019t much to test there. But what about hairy legs? That I could do. If I lived with someone for five years (or even five months), there would be plenty of times when he would have to deal with my not-so-smooth legs.Within a couple of weeks, I had achieved what my ex used to call, \u201cWookie legs.\u201d To amplify the effect, I wore shorts. Then I wandered around the living room where he was crouched at the desk working on his laptop.\u201cHow is it going?\u201d I asked casually.\u201cI\u2019m almost done,\u201d he said without looking up.\u201cOh no, my T-shirt is stained!\u201d I said, pointing to an oil stain from a previous cooking experiment.\u201cThat\u2019s barely noticeable,\u201d he said.That stain wasn\u2019t the only thing he was barely noticing. \u201cDoes this bother you?\u201d I asked, pointing to my legs.\u201cDoes what bother me?\u201d\u201cHair on my legs.\u201d\u201cWhy should that bother anyone?\u201d He went back to fixing his code. Just like that, he made the obligatory nuisance of shaving in winter a thing of the past.To test his propensity for jealousy and insecurity, I left him alone most evenings to go out for dinner and movies with my friends. But he was fine with the solitude, and all it did was make me exhausted from so much socializing. Once I hit my 30s, my appetite for \u201changing out\u201d had declined significantly. All I wanted was to watch a documentary in my pajamas and go to bed early.For his part, he slept late every day, left coffee mugs on the night stand and set the thermostat to a balmy 75 degrees, all things his ex would have thrown a fit about. Yet I couldn\u2019t even pretend to get upset since they were things I normally do, too.He also let his goofy personality re-emerge, dropping the guard he had put up after mangling our first intimate encounter before our stress test began.The first time he came to my apartment, I was busy researching something on my desktop. He stood there looking restless.\u201cIs everything O.K.?\u201d I asked.\u201cWould you mind if I did something?\u201d he asked, looking me straight in the eye.I was nervous, thinking he wanted to kiss me. \u201cMaybe,\u201d I said.The tension was mounting. Then he walked up and continued past me to my desk. The next thing I knew, he was changing the power settings on my desktop and laptop so they would use less energy when idle.I burst out laughing, though I didn\u2019t immediately explain why. When he eventually learned that I had expected him to kiss me, he was so embarrassed it made him even more cautious about what he said and did around me.During our stress test, however, I knew he was back to his old self when instead of saying, \u201cI missed you!\u201d in some generic way, he would hug me and say things like, \u201cIt\u2019s too bad I can\u2019t hold you closer than what is physically possible, which is ironic because atoms are mostly empty space.\u201dThe geek in me truly appreciated this.After all of our test cases passed and the fourth week ended, we were left with one question: \u201cWhat now?\u201dHe said he wanted to move in with me permanently. Unable to counter him with any logical reason not to, I agreed. A few weeks later, he proposed, and we married 12 months later.In the two years since, our Venn diagram of mostly overlapping circles has remained intact.Jasmine Jaksic, who lives in Sunnyvale, Calif., is a program manager at Google.To contact Modern Love, email modernlove@nytimes.com.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Fight Over Privacy and Secrecy in Government Investigations", "Date": "2016-05-16", "News": "Supported byWhite Collar WatchThe challenge will be striking the right balance between the government\u2019s need to obtain information for law enforcement \u2014 a significant priority these days \u2014 with the desire to keep at least some personal information private, a growing concern as more sensitive data is stored online.Why the different level of protections based on the age of the communications? Thirty years ago, Congress considered any messages over 180 days old to be abandoned, and therefore subject to reduced protection. This distinction does not make much sense now, but in the early days of emails when they were seen as a cutting-edge innovation, no one thought that a message of more than six months would be of much importance.The S.E.C.\u2019s willingness to follow a procedure similar to obtaining a warrant as a prerequisite to obtaining emails would make it more difficult to obtain evidence because issuing an administrative subpoena involves no judicial review. Given the prevailing tide in favor of enhancing the privacy of electronic communications, this concession is the best way for the agency to maintain access to emails.If the legislation is not changed, then other agencies, such as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Federal Trade Commission, would similarly be unable to obtain emails as part of their investigations. This type of evidence is standard fare because the communications can provide crucial insight into the knowledge and intent of participants \u2014 the key to establishing most regulatory violations.Whether Congress wants to hamstring civil enforcement actions, which occur much more frequently than criminal prosecutions, is something that should be addressed explicitly in deciding how to enhance the privacy afforded electronic communications.The flip side of privacy is secrecy \u2013 how much authority should the government have to keep its investigations from becoming known when it seeks personal information. That is an issue that has come to the forefront as technology companies object to demands that they not notify customers when their information is sought.Corporations have constitutional rights, but it may be difficult for Microsoft to show that it has an unfettered right to inform customers about a government inquiry that involves their information when that could present a danger to public safety or jeopardize an investigation. The lawsuit appears to be intended more to highlight how the growth of secrecy orders presents a threat to customer privacy, especially if they become almost a matter of routine.That issue arose last week when Magistrate Judge James Orenstein of the United States District Court in Brooklyn issued an opinion denying Justice Department requests in 15 cases, two involving Facebook, for orders prohibiting disclosure of subpoenas for customer electronic records.The judge found that prosecutors asserted that disclosure would jeopardize the investigation without any evidence showing why, especially when at least one subpoena was directed to a potential victim and not a target of the case. \u201cThe boilerplate assertions set forth in the government\u2019s applications do not make such a showing,\u201d he wrote, while affording prosecutors a right to renew the requests if there were additional facts supplied to support imposing a secrecy order.An order directing a company not to inform its customer is issued \u201cex parte,\u201d which means that only the prosecutors and judges are involved in the procedure. With no one present to oppose a request, there is the danger that secrecy becomes the rule rather than the exception to efforts to obtain digital information.The interesting question is whether Judge Orenstein\u2019s opinion will prompt other judges to question these requests for secrecy, perhaps imposing a higher threshold than the Justice Department has been accustomed to when requesting such orders. What Microsoft seeks in its lawsuit may actually come about more through judicial scrutiny than an expansive reading of the rights of corporations.The Email Privacy Act would amend the law by allowing a secrecy order for up to 180 days in any case that involves obtaining email, while also recognizing a right for service providers to notify customers of any effort to obtain their information. The momentum is certainly present to expand the privacy protections afforded to electronic information because Congress rarely shows the type of unanimity the House did in passing the bill.It is worth taking a moment to consider how administrative agencies should fit into expanded privacy protections, and how much secrecy should be afforded when the government seeks that information.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s $1 Billion Investment May Ease Ties With China", "Date": "2016-05-13", "News": "Supported byBut Apple\u2019s surprising interest in the company, called Didi Chuxing, and its out-of-character willingness to publicize the news Thursday evening could go a long way toward showing the Chinese government it is interested in supporting local business.More than any other major American technology company, Apple has had huge success in China. In the last fiscal year, Chinese consumers spent $59 billion on Apple products.With that success has come huge risk. In recent years, Beijing has grown more aggressive in pushing an agenda aimed at expanding local tech companies, forcing multinationals to play by its rules if they want access to China\u2019s markets.\u201cApple must be increasingly sensitive to the need to improve its government relations and to stake out a more entrenched position in the China market,\u201d said Mark Natkin, managing director of the China technology research firm Marbridge Consulting. \u201cSo making a sizable investment in a leading Chinese I.T. company will buy it a lot of good will.\u201dHe added that Apple would probably have to follow up the investment with other partnerships and spending in China if it wanted to stay in Beijing\u2019s good graces.In Apple\u2019s case, the new investment also helps it show Beijing how its operating system and iPhones are closely linked with the rise of app development within China; Didi\u2019s app, for example, is the most downloaded ride-hailing software in China.\u201cDidi exemplifies the innovation taking place in the iOS developer community in China,\u201d Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said in a news release.Many investors hoped that strong growth in China would offset some of the iPhone\u2019s deceleration. Revenue growth in the greater China region, which includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, hovered around 70 percent or more all last year. But last month the company said that quarterly sales in greater China had fallen 26 percent compared with the previous year.For Didi, the deal is a way to beef up its systems. The Chinese company serves close to 300 million users across more than 400 Chinese cities \u2014 more users than Uber \u2014 but lags technologically, analysts say.For more than a year, Apple and Didi \u2014 which share several partners, including Japan\u2019s SoftBank and Coatue \u2014 had been in contact. Apple was one of a handful of technology companies that, over the last year, Didi had talked with to better familiarize itself with the West, according to a person briefed on the deal.In April, Mr. Cook sat down for the first time with the leaders of Didi to discuss working together.In the midst of Didi\u2019s last major round of raising funds, the relationship quickly deepened, the person said. The two companies managed to close the deal with \u201clightning speed,\u201d Didi\u2019s president, Jean Liu, said in a conference call discussing the deal late Thursday.The two will work together on technology, marketing and products, Ms. Liu added.Mr. Cook has repeatedly said that Apple is looking for investment opportunities for its huge cash hoard. Apple has invested small sums in app developers before, and the company views China\u2019s app developer community as a prime source of future growth.\u201cWhat this means to me is that Apple is firmly committed to the Chinese market,\u201d said Brian Blau, an analyst with the Gartner research firm. \u201cThey are going to look at lots of opportunities.\u201dApple\u2019s move also draws it further into a Chinese market crisscrossed with competitive alliances. With the investment, Apple is now aligned with China\u2019s two largest Internet companies, Tencent and Alibaba, as a major shareholder in Didi. And Didi gained Apple as a big-name ally in its battle with Uber in China.Google\u2019s chief legal officer and head of corporate development, David Drummond, is on the board of Uber. And in 2013 Google\u2019s venture capital arm, GV, invested $258 million in Uber.But the partnership between Uber and Google has grown more distant over the past few years as both sides have independently pursued self-driving car projects. Uber has also made moves to wean itself from Google\u2019s map technology, including an acquisition of the mapping start-up deCarta.Investing in ride-hailing services gives Apple a doorway into the world\u2019s largest auto market and smartphone market by cars and phones sold, and an opportunity to better integrate its devices with cars in China. China\u2019s Internet companies are already hard at work developing driverless car technology and entertainment systems for cars, many of which are based on Google\u2019s Android software.\u201cMaybe they could be a technology supplier to Didi,\u201d Mr. Blau said. \u201cMaybe they could learn from Didi.\u201dThe auto market might be one new way that Apple can keep itself relevant to Chinese leaders who often view foreign tech firms in terms of how much utility they have in China as teachers of local companies, Mr. Natkin of Marbridge Consulting said.\u201cAs that utility wanes, the room to maneuver dwindles and the welcome mat starts to get drawn under the door,\u201d he said.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the day Apple\u2019s investment in Didi was announced. The investment was announced Thursday in the United States, not Thursday morning in China.Paul Mozur reported from Hong Kong and Mike Isaac from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "Police and Tech Giants Wrangle Over Encryption on Capitol Hill", "Date": "2016-05-08", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the district attorney of Manhattan, visited Washington late last month to argue his case on a pressing issue: encryption.\u201cI wanted to express a sense of urgency around resolution of this issue,\u201d Mr. Vance said in an interview about his Washington visit.Law enforcement officials immediately announced their support of the bill and began to push lawmakers to back it. Trade groups representing tech companies like Apple and Facebook have flooded into congressional offices, sent letters expressing concerns that the bill weakens consumer privacy and security, and delivered scorching speeches about the proposals.\u201cThis is an escalating fight,\u201d said Robert D. Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a research firm based in Washington that is funded by tech companies including Google and Microsoft. \u201cIt\u2019s become the focus now in Washington, with hearings and legislative activity.\u201dLaw enforcement officials blame tech companies for creating the impasse.\u201cThere\u2019s no question our relationship with the tech industry has gotten worse, and now it seems like the tech industry is taking every opportunity they have to put up obstacles in our way, including trying to derail legislative efforts that would give law enforcement what they need to keep people safe,\u201d said Terrence Cunningham, president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police.\u201cToday, terrorists and criminals are increasingly using encryption to foil law enforcement efforts, even in the face of a court order,\u201d Senator Feinstein said in a statement about the draft bill. \u201cWe need strong encryption to protect personal data, but we also need to know when terrorists are plotting to kill Americans.\u201dThe rhetoric in Washington around encryption has grown increasingly sharp. Last month, when the contents of the draft encryption bill were leaked, the president of the Consumer Technology Association, a trade group that counts Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon among its 4,000 members, spoke to an audience filled with government officials at a lunch hosted by the Media Institute.The bill is \u201cdangerously overreaching and technically unsophisticated,\u201d said Gary Shapiro, president of the association. \u201cThis bill would essentially make effective cybersecurity illegal in the United States, pushing companies that take cybersecurity seriously offshore.\u201dOther tech trade groups, including Reform Government Surveillance and the Business Software Alliance, have also waded into the fray, sending critical letters and meeting with senators to warn of the dangers of the bill. And Silicon Valley executives have, in increasing numbers, made the trek to Washington to make their cases directly.Bob Lord, chief information security officer at Yahoo, visited several members of Congress in late April to talk about the technology behind encryption and to warn of the \u201cunintended consequences\u201d of legislation that could weaken security. While he did not specifically mention the Burr-Feinstein bill, he emphasized how consumers and human rights activists worldwide depend on encrypted technology for their safety and privacy.\u201cThe notion that we would weaken encryption or provide back doors, those suggestions will have unintended consequences,\u201d Mr. Lord said.Law enforcement officials, in turn, have frequently met with the same lawmakers in the Senate and House intelligence, judiciary and commerce committees who are being targeted by the tech companies, according to congressional staff members. Chief Cunningham and other members of the police chiefs\u2019 group have talked with Mr. Burr and Ms. Feinstein, given opinions during the drafting of the legislation and hosted panels on encryption for House and Senate lawmakers.Tech companies have turned to certain politicians to champion their cause, such as Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon. On the day the draft encryption bill was introduced, Mr. Wyden, who voted against the 2012 copyright bills known as the Stop Online Piracy Act and the Protect Intellectual Property Act, which were also opposed by the tech industry, said he had been flooded with calls from tech companies wanting to know what he would do.Mr. Wyden said he intended to filibuster the proposal. He has since met with Intelligence Committee members to persuade them to kill the bill.\u201cI have not filibustered many issues, but I think the stakes are enormous,\u201d Mr. Wyden said in an interview. \u201cThe bill as written is a lose-lose, because it will create less security, American families will be less safe, and your liberty and privacy will be damaged.\u201dFor all the lobbying, few lawmakers have expressed their views on the encryption bill.\u201cI\u2019m reserving judgment,\u201d said Senator King, who met with Mr. Vance last month. \u201cThe issues are so complex, it\u2019s like trying to nail Jell-O to the wall.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google to Ban All Payday Loan Ads", "Date": "2016-05-11", "News": "Supported byGoogle announced on Wednesday that it would ban all advertisements for payday loans and related products on its website because they often lead to unaffordable repayment terms and financial harm to consumers.\u201cThis change is designed to protect our users from deceptive or harmful financial products,\u201d Mr. Graff wrote. \u201cAds for financial services are a particular area of vigilance given how core they are to people\u2019s livelihood and well-being.\u201dIt is the first time that the company has banned such a broad range of financial advertisements on its site, but the move was welcome by advocates seeking stricter controls on an industry long accused of targeting low-income and minority communities with loans that carry egregiously high interest rates.Lisa Donner, the executive director of Americans for Financial Reform, said in a statement that Google\u2019s decision would stop abusive lenders from marketing what she described as \u201cdebt-trap products that do serious and lasting harm to consumers.\u201dWade Henderson, president and chief executive of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a coalition representing more than 200 national organizations, said in a statement, \u201cThese companies have long used slick advertising and aggressive marketing to trap consumers into outrageously high interest loans \u2014 often those least able to afford it.\u201d\u201cGoogle is making a blanket assessment about the payday lending industry rather than discerning the good actors from the bad actors. This is unfair towards those that are legal, licensed lenders and uphold best business practices.\u201d\u201cThe Federal Reserve Board noted last year that 47 percent of Americans are not prepared to handle a $400 unexpected expense,\u201d said Lisa McGreevy, the alliance\u2019s president and chief executive. \u201cThis is yet another tactic that further limits the ability of families to have access to credit to fulfill their financial obligations.\u201dPayday loans are typically marketed as a way for people to cover a cash shortage between paychecks. Ads crop up online when users type in \u201cneed money to pay rent\u201d or other search terms that signal financial distress.Approximately one-third of the payday loan market is online, and two-thirds of the industry operates out of about 16,000 payday loan stores in 36 states across the country, according to a Pew Charitable Trusts report in 2014. The report said interest rates for online payday loans were typically higher than those for storefront loans, and they usually exceed 300 percent annual percentage rates.Consumers will still be able to find payday loan companies through an organic search on Google, but their ads will not be highlighted. Mr. Graff said the company would continue to review the policy, and added that it would not affect companies offering services such as mortgages, car loans, student loans, commercial loans and credit cards.The company declined to say how much it expected to lose in revenue from the ad ban.

{"Headline": "How Big Are Those Killer Asteroids? A Critic Says NASA Doesn\u2019t Know.", "Date": "2016-05-23", "News": "Supported byBut hundreds of thousands more have not yet been discovered, and whether any of those are on course to slam into our planet, no one knows. So finding and tracking all the asteroids that could cross Earth\u2019s path would allow officials to issue warnings and potentially provide time to deflect dangerous ones.He has also become a statistics scold of scientists.WISE, launched in 2009, snapped images of three-quarters of a billion stars, galaxies and other celestial objects, including the heat emissions of asteroids.Dr. Myhrvold contends that the Neowise analysis is deeply flawed. \u201cThe bad news is it\u2019s all basically wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately for a lot of it, it\u2019s never going to be as accurate as they had hoped.\u201dDr. Myhrvold isn\u2019t arguing that NASA has overlooked dangers from the known asteroids. But he does question whether scientists know as much as they think they do.Most of the millions of asteroids are found between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, but some dip closer to the sun. There is no doubt that some will hit Earth someday.\u201cFrom the practical perspective of finding asteroids,\u201d Dr. Myhrvold said, \u201cit\u2019s really important that we know the distribution of diameters and the distribution of albedos.\u201dAccording to NASA\u2019s scientists, the estimates of asteroid diameters made by Neowise are often within 10 percent of the actual size. But Dr. Myhrvold says the uncertainties are much greater, more than 100 percent in many cases.Space agency officials disagree. \u201cHe\u2019s a very smart man,\u201d said Lindley Johnson, who oversees NASA\u2019s efforts to protect the planet from space rocks. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t make him an expert in everything.\u201dDr. Johnson said NASA experts had pointed out errors and that Dr. Myhrvold had not fixed them. \u201cIt\u2019s overly simplistic, and he makes some assumptions that are not valid,\u201d Dr. Johnson said.Other scientists say that Dr. Myhrvold\u2019s criticisms have merit.But even if Dr. Myhrvold is correct, Dr. Harris said the Neowise data \u201chas good enough validity to be useful for most purposes.\u201dDr. Myhrvold is not an astronomer. He had never done research on asteroids.\u201cWhat they didn\u2019t know is that I had been interested in killer asteroids for a long time,\u201d Dr. Myhrvold said. After all, an asteroid slamming into Earth is believed to have brought the age of dinosaurs to an end 66 million years ago.Each group offered computer simulations of how many unseen asteroids would be spotted, making different assumptions.Ultimately, Dr. Myhrvold, who became wealthy from his Microsoft days, decided not to donate money to B612.He has also not given any money to the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, which has received some private financing from Bill Gates, his former Microsoft boss.Dr. Myhrvold said that Dr. Mainzer argued that a ground-based telescope could not detect asteroids within Earth\u2019s orbit because they would be too close to the horizon.That seemed strange to Dr. Myhrvold, because even amateurs can easily spot celestial objects far inside Earth\u2019s orbit like Venus, 26 million miles closer to the sun than Earth.Dr. Myhrvold said Dr. Mainzer responded that large telescopes were not designed to point that close to the ground. But the one in Chile is, he noted.\u201cI was happy he pointed out there was a misconception that LSST could not see within the Earth orbit,\u201d said Dr. Ivezic, a professor at the University of Washington.Dr. Chesley of NASA is coordinating a more detailed analysis of the telescope\u2019s asteroid-finding prowess, with preliminary findings expected in late summer.In recent presentations, NASA officials have portrayed Neocam more as a complement than a competitor. \u201cIt\u2019s a team sport,\u201d Dr. Johnson said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any one system that is going to provide us all the data we need.\u201dNASA declined to make Dr. Mainzer available for an interview. Responding to written questions, she said the Neowise team stood behind the findings and that the results had been validated by independent observations and other researchers.A simple demonstration of that, Dr. Myhrvold said, is the shiny chrome cooking surface of a restaurant hibachi grill. A dark grill surface would bathe diners in uncomfortable waves of heat. The Neocam models failed to take into account the effects of reflected sunlight, he said.He then took a closer look at Neowise, too. One aspect Dr. Myhrvold found curious was that in more than 100 instances, the Neowise team reported asteroid diameters that matched exactly what had previously been determined by other methods like radar measurements and spacecraft flybys. \u201cI think it\u2019s a pretty strong smoking gun that something is wrong,\u201d he said.For her part, Dr. Mainzer said the asteroids with exact measurement matches were used for calibration and thus the values were set to those that had been previously observed.The younger Dr. Harris agrees that Dr. Myhrvold has raised a valid point about Kirchhoff\u2019s Law and that a closer look at the Neowise analysis would be fruitful. Earlier satellites looked at longer wavelengths where reflected sunlight was less of a problem.Still, he disapproves of Dr. Myhrvold\u2019s scolding tone. \u201cThere\u2019s very much a schoolteacher attitude about it,\u201d he said.Dr. Myhrvold insists he has no vendetta against the Neowise scientists. But, he added, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s unduly mean of me to point out their data is irreproducible.\u201dKirchhoff\u2019s law could again come into play with Neocam, which would make observations at fairly short infrared wavelengths. Neocam is one of five lower-cost missions under consideration, and NASA is to approve one or two of them in September, aiming for launch in the 2020s.Dr. Mainzer deferred answering some follow-up questions, saying those issues would be best addressed by the referees reviewing Dr. Myhrvold\u2019s paper. \u201cWe believe at this point it\u2019s best to allow the process of peer review \u2014 the foundation of the scientific process \u2014 to move forward,\u201d she wrote.Advertisement"}

And there\u2019s an entire side of the world that knows me, knows my values and knows my face.\u201dMany celebrities go beyond supplying a pretty picture and a quote.The celebrity efforts provide another crucial weapon for conservationists: money.In 2014, donations to animal and environmental causes rose to $10.5 billion, up 43 percent since 2009.At a grass-roots level, a celebrity-fueled social media campaign like #JointheHerd can persuade the masses to reach for the credit card, said Mr. Harmon of WildAid. Since the campaign began in February, WildAid has seen the number of small donors to its elephant initiative rise 94 percent, he said.Celebrities also persuade other celebrities to open their wallets.Elephant Family will make further inroads into the art world this summer, when it takes the Elephant Parade, a showcase of elephant-themed outdoor art by David Yarrow, David LaChapelle, and other artists, to the Hamptons\u201cIf you want to understand the issue, you have to talk former C.I.A. officers who are in touch with Kenyan intelligence who can tell you who is corrupt at the port at Mombasa,\u201d Mr. Neilson said.By contrast, \u201cWhen a well-meaning reality TV star in Los Angeles is tweeting \u2018save the elephants,\u2019 I think it\u2019s safe to say that that has no impact whatsoever,\u201d he said.President Obama has called for a near-total ban on the ivory trade in the United States, and conservation groups expect the new law to be put in effect this summer.She finds the issue gripping in part because elephants seem so human in their behavior, she said: Each herd has its matriarchs, its wise old aunts, its rowdy teenagers. When an elephant dies, the others mourn. \u201cThey touch the body with their feet, smell it with their trunks, and stand around for a day or longer,\u201d Ms. Davis said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like sitting shiva.\u201dAnd unfortunately, there is a lot of that going on in Africa these days, she said. \u201cHow on earth will we be able turn to our children and say, \u2018All those elephants in books, they used to be everywhere, now they\u2019re gone.\u2019\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article last Sunday about celebrities who are trying to save elephants from extinction referred incorrectly to the mother of Maggie Q, an actress who starred in \u201cNikita\u201d and \u201cStalker.\u201d She is not an actress herself and did not appear in either of those shows.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: The Rise of the \u2018Matchmakers\u2019 of the Digital Economy", "Date": "2016-05-20", "News": "Supported byBook EntryMany of the young giants of the digital economy share a common characteristic. They are platforms that provide valued connections among their participants. The nature of those connections and the value they provide vary widely.Both Google and Facebook \u2013 together approaching $1 trillion in market value \u2014 are in the business of connecting advertisers to consumers, but their platforms and business models are very different.Another trillion-dollar pair, Apple and Microsoft, have followed similarly divergent paths in monetizing their respective platforms: Both own operating systems that connect application developers and users. And \u201cplatform\u201d businesses of various stripes seem to represent a disproportionate share of the market\u2019s hot tech start-ups, like Uber, Airbnb, Pinterest and Snapchat.A surprising number of business books have been published in the last few months that seek to explore the origins and implications of the emergence of the platform paradigm. The great virtue of the best of these, \u201cMatchmakers: The New Economics of Multisided Platforms\u201d (Harvard Business Review) by David S. Evans and Richard Schmalensee, is that it reminds us that there is nothing new about multisided platforms \u2013 which the authors call matchmaker businesses.The \u201cnew economics\u201d mentioned in the subtitle refers to what the authors misleadingly call the \u201cdiscovery\u201d of multisided businesses by fellow economists in 2000. Although the research cited was certainly important in understanding the dynamics of multisided markets, advertising-based media businesses have successfully operated in these environments for literally hundreds of years.An old-world media example quickly makes clear the unusual management challenges of operating multisided-platform businesses. To be successful, newspaper and magazine publishers need to attract both readers and advertisers, who represent the two sides of the platform. In most instances, however, to optimize overall profits, publishers must subsidize one side of the market. Rarely does the price of a subscription cover even the incremental cost of printing and distribution of the publication.This does not reflect a rookie mistake but a nuanced understanding of the tradeoffs between circulation and advertising revenue. If managers ignore the interaction between the different sides of a multisided market in developing pricing strategies, they will inevitably arrive at erroneous conclusions. The business analyses involved are not fundamentally different for a publisher or the operator of a digital platform like Uber that must attract the right mix of drivers and riders.But what has changed in the world to make these models apparently so much more prevalent? \u201cMatchmakers\u201d identifies \u201csix turbocharging technologies\u201d that it claims have \u201cturbocharged the ancient matchmaker model.\u201dSpecifically, the authors argue that the combined impact of improvements in computing power, bandwidth, networking and storage capacity have allowed the establishment of \u201ctwo foundational multisided platforms\u201d that support all the others that have rapidly emerged: Internet service providers (who provide the fixed and mobile connections among platform participants) and operating systems (which provide the common language that allow app developers to achieve mass adoption).History aside, the heart of \u201cMatchmakers\u201d is an entrepreneurial playbook of sorts for \u201cbuilding, igniting and operating matchmakers.\u201d The strongest part of the book is the detailed description of diverse platform business models, both new and old, some of which readers might not have even previously thought of as \u201cmatchmakers.\u201dFor instance, South Florida\u2019s upscale Aventura Mall is really a platform for commerce between retailers and shoppers. To succeed, the developer had to take into account land values, local demographics, nearby alternatives, which retailers and entertainment services to target and what and how to charge them, and the physical design. Similar complexity faced the founders of M-Pesa, a mobile money transfer service in Kenya that in the course of three years counted 42 percent of the adult population as registered users and transformed that economy.The problem with many of the books about the rise of the so-called platform economy is that they are filled with an unbridled optimism about the collective attractiveness of these businesses, particularly in their digital incarnations. Sure, they argue, incumbents will be disrupted, but in their stead will be bigger, stronger competitors in winner-take-all markets.They focus on \u201cnetwork effects,\u201d which can create a virtuous circle \u2013 sometimes called a flywheel effect \u2013 as new users on one side of a platform attract more on another and vice versa. The crucial attribute of network effects businesses is that every new participant increases the value of the network to existing participants.Alex Moazed and Nicholas L. Johnson are the consultants turned authors of \u201cModern Monopolies: What It Takes to Dominate the 21st Century Economy\u201d (St. Martins). Their book promises the same \u201cframeworks and insights we use to help our clients become modern monopolies.\u201d In their telling, the history of \u201cplatform capitalism\u201d appears to have started with eBay, which in part explains the inability of their \u201cframeworks\u201d to deliver on the assurance of market domination.\u201cPlatform Revolution: How Networked Markets Are Transforming the Economy and How to Make Them Work For You\u201d (Norton), another book written by industry consultants \u2014 these mostly with day jobs in academia \u2014 provides an even more expansive vision of the \u201crevolution\u201d wrought by the emergence of network effects as \u201cthe Internet-era source of market power,\u201d which \u201cis likely to strengthen a market\u2019s winner take all tendency.\u201dThe book\u2019s authors \u2014 Geoffrey Parker, Marshall W. Van Alstyne and Sangeet Paul Choudary \u2014 argue that the ascension of platform business models requires a fundamental rethinking of things as diverse as basic business strategy and government regulation. Their wide-ranging vision and predictions are undermined by frequent factual errors. For example, Sony does not own Time Warner movie and television studios, and Netflix does not have strong network effects.Even \u201cMatchmakers,\u201d which offers the most balanced picture of the challenges and opportunities of multisided platforms, plays down the structural fragility faced by all of the \u201cturbocharged\u201d matchmakers described. Mr. Evans and Mr. Schmalensee insist that \u201cnetwork effects power all multisided platforms.\u201d What\u2019s more, according to them, the digital developments recounted \u201chave resulted in a huge increase in the power and reach of these effects.\u201d Neither statement is true.First, plenty of multisided platforms do not have any significant network effects to speak of. A popular TV show attracts both viewers and advertisers, but it is the quality of the programming, not the presence of more advertisers, that keeps the audience coming back. TV and cable broadcasting networks, like most ad-based media businesses, are multisided platforms, but they have negligible network effects. Google, the mightiest exception to the digital fragility rule, is a platform business that does not benefit primarily from network effects but rather from traditional economies of scale.Second, the strength of network effects is often a function of the existence of reinforcing competitive advantages like economies of scale and, notably, customer captivity. The digital economy has undermined both of these barriers to entry by lowering both customer switching costs and the fixed-cost base that drives scale economies.So the Aventura Mall benefits from the long-term leases signed by retailers on the one hand and the fact that local shoppers need to go out of their way to find a comparable experience. Operators of digital malls, by contrast, rarely secure long-term commitments from either advertisers or sellers, and shoppers have multiple alternatives just a click away. And the fixed costs expended to build a traditional mall could easily fund many dozens of digital retail platforms.Even the authors of \u201cModern Monopolies\u201d concede that \u201ca modern monopoly\u2019s dominance\u201d is likely to be short-lived given \u201cthe competitive threat it faces from adjacent competitors and a constant onslaught of new entrants.\u201dAll three books provide useful, and mostly consistent, insights into how to build more resilient and valuable platforms. The diversity of businesses and outcomes described, however, suggest that the differences among platform businesses are far more important than their commonalities. This is at least good news for consumers who will benefit from multiplying innovations that reduce the annoying frictions of everyday life and the consultants who will be kept busy helping managers devise ways to prolong their increasingly tenuous perch as master of a modern monopoly.Jonathan A.

{"Headline": "China Quietly Targets U.S. Tech Companies in Security Reviews", "Date": "2016-05-16", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Chinese authorities are quietly scrutinizing technology products sold in China by Apple and other big foreign companies, focusing on whether they pose potential security threats to the country and its consumers and opening up a new front in an already tense relationship with Washington over digital security.Apple and other companies in recent months have been subjected to reviews that target encryption and the data storage of tech products, said people briefed on the reviews who spoke on the condition of anonymity. In the reviews, Chinese officials require executives or employees of the foreign tech companies to answer questions about the products in person, according to these people.The reviews are run by a committee associated with the Cyberspace Administration of China, the country\u2019s Internet control bureau, they said. The bureau includes experts and engineers with ties to the country\u2019s military and security agencies.While other countries, including the United States and Britain, conduct reviews of some tech products, they usually focus on products that will be used by the military or other parts of the government that are concerned with security, and not on products sold to the general public.The Chinese reviews stand out because they are being applied more broadly, including to American consumer software and gadgets popular in China, the people briefed on the reviews said. And because Chinese officials have not disclosed the nature of the checks, both the United States government and American tech companies fear that the reviews could be used to extract tech knowledge as well as ensure that the United States was not using the products to spy.Ultimately, the reviews could be used to block products without explanation or to extract trade secrets in exchange for market access. Those secrets could be leaked to Chinese competitors or expose vulnerabilities, which, in turn, Chinese hackers could exploit.Further, tech companies are concerned that the reviews could set a precedent and that other countries will follow suit, each demanding different checks that would not only be costly but also put the companies at risk of having to hand over further secrets in exchange for market access.China and the United States have been embroiled in a quarrel about tech and security that has strained their relationship. The reviews could be a fresh sticking point, raising questions about the security of American technology and the degree to which American companies will acquiesce to Beijing\u2019s demands for fear of being punished in a huge market still partly controlled by the state.Chinese officials have not formally disclosed that they are conducting the reviews, and their existence has not been previously confirmed outside of rare, brief mentions in local news media.It is not clear specifically what Chinese authorities are demanding as part of the process. There is no indication that foreign companies have provided access to highly guarded material such as source code \u2014 the digital underpinnings of software \u2014 or other commercial secrets.The lack of disclosure by China\u2019s government has made it hard for the United States government to voice its objections, and has fed concerns that China is quietly carrying out further policies to target American technology companies.China\u2019s Internet regulators suggested the possibility of reviews three years ago, after revelations by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, concerning surveillance escalated tensions between China and the United States over computer security.Since then, China has quietly begun carrying out the reviews. That represents a shift in the way China manages foreign technology. Its previous efforts came through proposed new rules and other public measures that let foreign companies and governments resist.China relies on American technology products, even as it has made clear that it is concerned about the security of those products. A majority of Chinese government offices, state-owned enterprises and other institutions that handle potentially secret information, like universities and research institutes, use Microsoft Windows. Most smartphones in China run software made by either Apple or Google. And the high-end computing that supports China\u2019s banks, energy companies and military uses, in part, American-designed chips and servers.China\u2019s tougher tone is part of a broader challenge that governments around the world are posing to the technology industry over issues like privacy and encryption. In the United States, federal law enforcement officials have pressed Apple to help them gain access to encrypted iPhones even as the Obama administration has resisted Chinese policies that would require similar access.Under President Xi Jinping, China has taken steps to keep tabs on technology from American companies and reduce the nation\u2019s dependence on it.For foreign companies, the other option could be worse.\u201cOne viewpoint holds that we must close ourselves off, make a fresh start, thoroughly shake off our reliance on foreign technology and rely on indigenous innovation to pursue development,\u201d Mr. Xi said, according to a transcript of the speech. \u201cOtherwise, we would always follow in the footsteps of others, and would never be able to catch up.\u201dMr. Xi ultimately said China must find a middle ground and determine \u201cwhich things can be imported but have to be secure and controllable; which things may be imported, digested and absorbed for re-innovation; which things can be developed in collaboration with others; and for which things we must rely on our own strength and indigenous innovation.\u201dWhile details on the tech reviews are scant, commentary from the state-run China Daily in 2014 suggested that companies affected could include Cisco Systems and Microsoft. Other state news media has said the reviews will prevent product suppliers from \u201cillegally controlling, interfering in or interrupting user systems, or illegally collecting, storing, handling or exploiting information about users.\u201dCisco and Microsoft declined to comment on the Chinese media statements. Apple also declined to comment.\u201cAs the world connects to the Internet, various forms of attacks and new defensive technologies are ever multiplying, bringing challenges to China\u2019s development of a new digital industry,\u201d the group said.Paul Mozur reported from Hong Kong and Jane Perlez from Beijing.

{"Headline": "After Conventions, a Debt to Donors", "Date": "2016-05-11", "News": "Supported byEditorialIndustries with business before the federal government have long found opening their checkbooks for the conventions to be one of the most efficient means for influencing an incoming administration and Congress in one quick action.Come July, some of America\u2019s best-known companies will pay to celebrate the nomination of Donald Trump, whose racist rants have in the past caused NBC, Macy\u2019s and Nascar to distance themselves from him. Progressive political groups like ColorOfChange.org and Credo Action are pressuring Coca-Cola, Walmart, Microsoft, Facebook and Google to cut off money for the Republican gathering. But the protest against Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t address the deeper problem of corporate influence over both parties.The ITT scandal prompted legislation that provided public financing for conventions, and limited their budgets to that amount. But the parties soon found multiple ways around that, including using \u201chost committees\u201d that operate in the cities where the conventions are held, soliciting unlimited amounts of convention money from corporations and wealthy individuals. These committees, established to skirt federal laws banning corporations from giving to political parties directly, should be abolished.The law shifted ever-escalating convention costs onto rich donors and corporations like Google, Facebook, Duke Energy, Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Bank of America, General Motors and AT&T, which were all past contributors. Corporations can give unlimited cash, services and swag to Democratic and Republican host committees for conventions that basically are four-day-long parties. Shareholders in these companies pick up the tab since the money comes directly from corporate coffers.This year, the two political parties together will most likely spend upward of $150 million on their conventions, all of it paid by private entities.Lawyers who advise corporations on campaign finance laws say that so far, most previous corporate donors will continue financing both conventions, eager to ensure that they\u2019re covered regardless of which party takes the White House in November. \u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous system that creates widespread opportunities for influence peddling,\u201d says Fred Wertheimer, who leads Democracy 21, a campaign finance watchdog group.Convention spending is part and parcel of the creeping corporate buyout of America\u2019s political system. In a year marked by voter anger at a political class out of touch with struggling Americans, one might expect both Republicans and Democrats to rein it in. But as with all political spending, the tendency is always toward more, not less. That publicly held companies seeking favors from the government will underwrite this excess is offensive, and entirely legal.Advertisement"}

After trumpeting Hulu\u2019s new interactive ads, Mr. Naylor made another pitch. \u201cWe offer you the opportunity to become part of the creative process with us,\u201d he said.Meaning what, exactly?This kind of advertising through product placement is certainly not new. But Mr. Naylor\u2019s announcement \u2014 made during last week\u2019s Digital Content NewFronts, an annual sales event where companies like Hulu compete for digital advertising dollars \u2014 underscored a broader question running through the advertising industry: What exactly constitutes an ad these days?For decades, 30-second television commercials were the gold standard, and as online video proliferated, many digital ads were essentially repurposed from TV. But in the last several years, advertisers have become more sophisticated, creating digital ads that were divorced from traditional campaigns and were better suited to the many platforms that have become available, including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Snapchat. Now, online ads interrupt nearly everything.This explosion of online ads, however, has led to the rising use of ad blockers and turned \u201cadvertising\u201d into something of a dirty word. So advertisers and publishers are now looking for ways to make online ads less like ads. Many in the industry are even changing the way they talk about ads.During the NewFronts, Hulu and many other companies, often using a rhetorical sleight of hand, put forth the idea that ads are the products of symbiotic relationships, rather than frustrating invaders.

Wong, president of digital for Time Inc., told advertisers the company was \u201chelping brands develop original content\u201d and added, \u201cWorking with us is easy.\u201d Lisa Valentino, head of ad sales for Cond\u00e9 Nast, urged the audience to \u201ctake a look at the results when Cond\u00e9 Nast tells your story.\u201d Ze Frank, president of BuzzFeed Motion Pictures, said the company worked \u201cwith brands and agencies to develop original content.\u201dMany companies ran flashy videos that showcased examples of these partnerships, much like ad agencies pitching clients. BuzzFeed, for instance, promoted its Tasty channel as a successful example of how it could work with brands like Oster, which makes grills and other appliances.Publishers are \u201cno longer content to be the place where ads go,\u201d said Ben Winkler, chief investment officer for the agency OMD United States. \u201cWhat we\u2019re hearing at this NewFronts more than ever is this can be a two-way exchange.\u201dThe rhetorical gymnastics, however, also signal a deeper trend in the ad business. As companies seek to remove clutter from their sites while also bolstering their ad revenue, many are turning to so-called branded content, a widely used but vague industry term that generally means ads that look more like things people actually want to read or watch.Many publishers, including Vice and The New York Times, have formed what are essentially internal agencies that create ads for brands. And many already boast of success, or at least the promise of it.\u201cWe believe branded content and native solutions is a large-scale opportunity for Time Inc.,\u201d Joseph A. Ripp, chief executive of Time Inc., said on an earnings call last week. \u201cWe are increasingly hearing from C.M.O.s that they want to speak to their customers in the same way that Time Inc. talks to its audiences,\u201d he added in a reference to chief marketing officers.NBC, for example, announced last month that it was planning to cut about 30 percent of the ads from episodes of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d next season and allow advertisers to create original segments. Turner, which is part of Time Warner, and Viacom, which owns MTV and Comedy Central, have also said they plan to reduce the amount of commercials on their cable networks.With online ad spending growing, finding ways to stand out among the onslaught of other online ads has become more important for advertisers. And therein lies a possible conundrum: Advertisers want their ads to look less like ads even as they are fighting harder for attention.As Caty Burgess, senior vice president for media strategies at the CW television network, said, \u201cIs the question, \u2018What is an ad?\u2019 or \u2018What isn\u2019t an ad?\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brooklyn Judge Will Not Force Facebook\u2019s Silence on Subpoenas", "Date": "2016-05-12", "News": "Supported byA federal judge in Brooklyn ruled on Thursday that prosecutors could not force Facebook to remain silent about 15 grand-jury subpoenas involving the company\u2019s customers.The judge, James Orenstein, said that the prosecutors had legitimate concerns that their investigations might be compromised, but he added that the government\u2019s boilerplate requests, made in identical language in each of the 15 applications for a gag order, were insufficiently detailed.\u201cGovernment prosecutors and agents have a difficult job investigating crime, and one that is made more difficult by the fact that some of the investigative techniques they must rely on can backfire by alerting criminals to the fact of the investigation,\u201d Judge Orenstein wrote. But he went on to say that law-enforcement officers cannot \u201cobtain an order that constrains the freedom of service providers to disclose information to their customers without making a particularized showing of need.\u201dA handful of cases have emerged in recent months laying bare the tensions between the government\u2019s desire to conduct criminal inquiries, sometimes secretly, and the rights of companies like Facebook to have autonomy over their businesses.In the case of Facebook, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn sought to cloak the existence of the subpoenas under the Stored Communications Act, which grants courts the power to prohibit tech companies from revealing the receipt of various government orders, like warrants or subpoenas, in order to protect the covert nature of criminal probes.Judge Orenstein wrote that the prosecutors had submitted 15 separate sealed requests to him, each bearing the title: \u201cApplication for order commanding [service provider] not to notify any person of the existence of subpoena.\u201dThe requests, all filed in Brooklyn, asked for permission to bar Facebook from mentioning the subpoenas to anyone except its lawyers out of a fear that the targets of the secret investigations might get wind of them and either flee or tamper with evidence.Judge Orenstein\u2019s ruling did not reveal the information the government wanted from Facebook. It also left open the possibility that he would agree to impose gag orders on Facebook if the prosecutors could convince him with more details.Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the ruling.The policy states that as Facebook receives requests from the police or other agencies, it vets them to establish whether they are within the bounds of the law and how compelling they are. It frequently shares only \u201cbasic subscriber information.\u201dMike Isaac contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Home vs. Amazon Echo. Let the Battle Begin.", "Date": "2016-05-18", "News": "Supported byTech FixWhat do Home and Echo have in common?Home and Echo are both speakers that require a wired power connection. They stream music and perform tasks like web searches, adding calendar appointments and looking up movie showtimes over an Internet connection.What are the differences between Google Home and Amazon Echo?Google has yet to share many important details, including a price tag, about Google Home, which is scheduled for release this fall. However, from the announcement we can glean a few differences:Home, which can easily be held in one hand, is shorter and more compact than Echo.Both speakers have a cylindrical shape, but the top of Home is slanted downward, whereas Echo\u2019s top is flat. Google is allowing consumers to choose from different colors for the bottom part of Home, while Echo comes only in black. (Amazon also sells a smaller voice-controlled speaker called Tap.)Most important, the brains of Home will be Google\u2019s virtual assistant, which draws from Google\u2019s extensive search database, whereas Echo relies on Alexa, Amazon\u2019s assistant. In other words, consumers can expect voice commands that already work with Google\u2019s assistant to work with Google Home.Is Home smarter than Echo?Thanks to Home\u2019s reliance on Google\u2019s search engine, it will probably be a smarter speaker than the Echo when it comes to basic tasks like web searches and looking up traffic data. However, when it comes to actions offered by outside companies \u2014 like the ability to order a pizza from a restaurant or to set your Internet-connected thermostat \u2014 Home\u2019s success will depend largely on whether Google persuades third-party developers to create tasks that work with it.\u201cTo do this well we really need to work with developers and third parties so we can provide these actions to our users,\u201d said Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, during his announcement of Home.By contrast, Amazon has already made great progress with third-party developers for Echo. Alexa is capable of summoning an Uber car, ordering a pizza from Domino\u2019s, controlling smart light bulbs and much more. Time will tell which company\u2019s speaker gets more third-party support, but Echo, which was released last June, has a major head start.What is Google\u2019s assistant?Here\u2019s where things get confusing. Google is referring to the virtual-assistant portion of its search product as \u201cassistant.\u201d Previously it was called Google Now, and later it was renamed to just Google.The problem was that many consumers had trouble distinguishing Google search from its virtual assistant because the assistant lacked a friendly name like Siri or Alexa. The difference now, Google says, is that its assistant is more capable of being naturally conversational than other assistants. Adding to the confusion: Google\u2019s assistant is what comes with Google Home and Allo, the new messaging app. But you won\u2019t summon it by saying \u201cGoogle assistant.\u201d You\u2019ll just say \u201cGoogle.\u201dWhat is Allo?Allo is Google\u2019s forthcoming messaging app, which has Google\u2019s assistant built into it. Inside the app, you will be able to type \u201c@google\u201d and say conversational things like \u201cLet\u2019s go out for some Italian food.\u201d Google will then respond with some suggestions for tables to reserve at Italian restaurants using, for example, the OpenTable app.What\u2019s more, you will be able to have conversations with friends and type \u201c@google\u201d with questions or requests inside those conversations; all people in the conversation will see how Google\u2019s assistant responds. The Allo app will be released this summer for iPhones and Android phones.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Salesforce to Use Amazon\u2019s Cloud to Expand in Canada and Australia", "Date": "2016-05-25", "News": "Supported byAmazon Web Services, the biggest of the cloud-computing providers, has a new line of work: Taking other cloud-computing giants into other countries.On Wednesday, Salesforce.com announced it would use A.W.S. to expand in Canada and Australia, in a deal valued at about $400 million. If successful, the value of the transaction will most likely get much bigger.\u201cFor sure, we\u2019re talking of billions of dollars in services over the next several years,\u201d said Marc Benioff, the co-founder and chief executive of Salesforce.Salesforce already uses A.W.S. for some of its businesses, but this is the first time its key applications will be on someone else\u2019s computers.Mr. Benioff said Salesforce had evaluated similar deals with Microsoft and Google, the other two giants in selling cloud-computing to corporations. So far, A.W.S. is still ahead on its range of offerings and low prices, he said. Salesforce will review the contract in one year, he added.Cloud computing uses a massive density of computer servers and sophisticated software to rent data storage, computing and applications to companies. Besides those capabilities, the deal with A.W.S. enables Salesforce to get into new markets faster, since Salesforce doesn\u2019t have to find facilities and recruit talent.Amazon has also established itself in countries like China that have strict requirements about what data can be sent offshore. Meeting those regulations is difficult and time-consuming, and companies like Salesforce put a premium on getting into markets quickly.While the deal could be a sign of larger trends in corporate computing, as businesses evaluate whether to keep their own computers or work with the big public clouds, for now it also has limits.That spending will probably be limited to new countries where Salesforce expands, Mr. Benioff said. That may change, he added, as the three giants bring down prices and increase the services they offer.\u201cWe have our own infrastructure in the U.S., Japan, the U.K., France and Germany,\u201d Mr. Benioff said. \u201cIf you have critical mass, your own infrastructure is still cheaper.\u201dMr. Benioff said that, down the line, A.W.S. may also become competitive purely on price, as their scale and engineering enables them to run big computing systems at a lower cost. \u201cIf Amazon, Microsoft and Google are smart, the price difference will change,\u201d he said.Adam Selipsky, vice president of marketing and sales for A.W.S., said the company was intent on getting its prices down enough to replace existing servers in established markets.\u201cOur prices relative to what they can build themselves \u2013 we\u2019re already at a stage where it\u2019s competitive,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re just at the starting point of enterprise adoption.\u201dAdvertisement"}
