Elizabeth Olson reports in DealBook.David Wippman, the dean of the University of Minnesota Law School, has already overseen a shrinking first-year class, offsetting the loss in tuition income with more public subsidies. He said the school was trying to determine why applications for the course were dropping and was trying to identify students more precisely, while publicizing more broadly. Mr. Wippman had to decide whether to admit students with lower scores, but a surplus of graduates who do not find jobs can eviscerate a law school\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reputation. Raising tuition was not an option with so many students wary of taking on high debt. The school was also facing competition from others in its hometown.So the school opted for fewer students.

It has also shed staff and left openings unfilled.  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Oracle-Google Dispute Goes to Heart of Open-Source Software", "Date": "2016-05-19", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The Greek philosopher Aristotle described man as a rational animal. If only software were so easy to define.On the witness stand in the federal courthouse here Thursday morning, Larry Page, the chief executive of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, offered metaphysical musings regarding the nature of software as a lawyer for Oracle Corporation questioned him about the creation of the world\u2019s most popular smartphone operating system, Android.Oracle says Google, the search giant, uses copyrighted material in 11,000 of its 13 million lines of software code in Android, and wants $9 billion from Google. Google says it made fair use of that code and owes nothing.Mr. Page, known for his love of big technology ideas, questioned whether lines of software that declare how the rest of its actions will work are really software.\u201cFor me, declaring code is not code,\u201d he said, offering a philosophical view of software that may be common among Google engineers but stands a good chance of confounding nearly everyone else.The copyrights that are crucial to the trial are related to open-source software, which is created and shared for general use. Open-source technology is at the heart of many current innovations, from Google\u2019s Android to the hardware going into giant cloud-computing data centers.\u201cThe open-source community will heave a huge sigh of relief if Google wins, and will be very worried if Oracle wins,\u201d said Pamela Samuelson, professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cIt will have a chilling effect.\u201dShould Oracle prevail, Mr. Page could lose a significant chunk of his company\u2019s $75.3 billion in cash. Since Android became a product in 2007, Oracle estimates Google has made $21 billion in profit from it. A verdict in favor of Oracle could also lead to a new way for older companies that built giant businesses from licensed software to make money.Speaking on the witness stand earlier in the week, Safra A. Catz, the co-chief executive of Oracle, called Java, the open-source product Google is accused of taking, \u201cthe single most important asset Oracle acquired\u201d in its 39-year history, and spoke of billions in lost revenue as a result of Google\u2019s actions. Oracle picked up Java when it purchased Sun Microsystems for $7.4 billion in 2010.The fight between Oracle and Google began that year as a patent and copyright dispute, and in one phase or another it has involved many of the best-known names of Silicon Valley.The initial case was decided largely in favor of Google in 2012, and the patent claims were dismissed. But in 2014 a federal appeals court found certain parts of Java were protected by copyright. When the Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal of that decision last year, the case was sent back to federal court.This trial, which began last week, has followed a tangle of careers as well as code. Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Alphabet, testified on his time working on Java when he was at Sun, and his knowledge of Apple\u2019s iPhone developments when he sat on the Apple board. Andy Rubin, who led the Android efforts at Google and also testified, had worked at Apple early in his career, and used Java at Danger, another phone company he co-founded. Mr. Rubin has since left Google, and is working on robots and artificial intelligence.Lawrence J. Ellison, co-founder and now executive chairman of Oracle, appeared in a taped deposition about acquiring assets of Sun. Though it was not mentioned in the testimony, Sun fell on hard times after the dot-com boom largely because of competition from another open-source software project, Linux.Mr. Ellison was also close friends with Steven P. Jobs, Apple\u2019s co-founder, who was outraged when Google revealed its plans for an iPhone competitor that looked a lot like the iPhone.There were even glimpses of frosty social exchanges. Ms. Catz testified to running into Google\u2019s corporate lawyer at a bat mitzvah. \u201c\u2018Google is a very innovative company,\u2019\u201d she recalled him saying. \u201c\u2018The old rules do not apply to us.\u2019\u201d\u201cI immediately said, \u2018Thou shalt not steal,\u2019\u201d she said on the stand.The jury was allowed to spend the weekend with what appeared to be notebooks full of notes on code, corporate strategy and the economics of software. Whatever the jurors decide, both sides have indicated another appeal is likely.Ultimately, Ms. Samuelson said, the Supreme Court should hear some aspect of the case, if only to clarify what she termed \u201cincredibly important, the first significant software copyright case in 10 years.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Podcasts Surge, but Producers Fear Apple Isn\u2019t Listening", "Date": "2016-05-07", "News": "Supported bySteven P. Jobs put his talent as a master salesman to the test when, in 2005, he introduced new Apple software for downloading digital audio shows. The format was so incipient that he struggled to describe it.\u201cIt\u2019s sort of like TiVo, for radio, for your iPod,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the \u2018Wayne\u2019s World\u2019 of radio, but real radio is jumping onto this.\u201dBut he was clear about the potential. \u201cIt\u2019s getting very, very exciting,\u201d he said.He was talking about podcasting \u2014 radio-style shows made for the Internet that have, in recent years, exploded in popularity. These days, many amateur podcasters are going professional. Major media organizations, searching for answers and bright spots in a fast-changing and confusing digital world, are releasing new shows every week. Advertisers are starting to follow them, and so are millions of dollars of venture capital.It is, in other words, an industry now, one that Apple essentially gave life to and still dominates. Yet at this moment of triumph for podcasting, concerns are growing in the community about how much Apple actually cares.Interviews with over two dozen podcasters and people inside Apple reveal a variety of complaints. The podcasters say that they are relegated to wooing a single Apple employee for the best promotion. That sharing on social media is cumbersome. And that for podcasters to make money, they need more information about their listeners, and Apple is in a unique position to provide it. The problems, they say, could even open up an opportunity for a competitor.\u201cThe lack of podcast data is kind of shocking,\u201d said Gina Delvac, the producer of \u201cCall Your Girlfriend,\u201d a popular show about pop culture and politics.Late last month, Apple brought seven leading podcast professionals to the company\u2019s campus in Cupertino, Calif., to air their case to a room full of employees, according to two people who were there. The people would speak only on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. The company made no promises, the people said, but several pressing issues for podcasters were discussed in frank terms.After the presentations concluded, Eddy Cue, the executive at Apple who oversees software and services, arrived for a closed session with the company\u2019s employees, according to the attendees.\u201cI think everyone who\u2019s seriously involved in this space, they\u2019d at least like to know what the endgame is,\u201d said Chris Morrow, the chief executive of the Loud Speakers Podcast Network. \u201cPeople think there\u2019s another shoe that\u2019s going to drop.\u201dBut podcasting is a product of a different era for digital media \u2014 and for Apple. When Mr. Jobs introduced the updated podcast software in 2005, the company was still in comeback mode, driven by iPods. The iPhone wouldn\u2019t come out for two more years.Now Apple is the biggest public company in the world, but podcasts bring Apple virtually nothing in direct revenue. Perhaps as a result, the iTunes podcasting hub that Mr. Jobs introduced remains strikingly unchanged. Sharing on social media, which basically didn\u2019t exist in 2005, takes multiple clicks.Promotion within iTunes, which is still one of the only reliable ways to build an audience, particularly for a new show, is decided by a small team that fields pitches and does its own outreach. Interviews with people inside and outside the company make it clear that Apple\u2019s small podcast team has been hearing \u2014 and assuaging \u2014 such concerns for years.The question for podcasters \u2014 and for Apple \u2014 is about what comes next. Apple has at least two obvious choices: to rush to accommodate an industry that is quickly outgrowing its origins, or to let podcasting be, at the risk of losing its claim over a medium that owes its very name to the company.Even podcasters are conflicted; a hands-off Apple retains some appeal. \u201cSome would argue that it could have advanced in certain ways,\u201d said Andy Bowers, chief content officer of Slate\u2019s Panoply podcast network. But since 2005, he said, \u201cthey\u2019ve provided a remarkably level playing field.\u201dIn a statement, Mr. Cue of Apple said, \u201cWe have more people than ever focused on podcasting, including engineers, editors and programmers.\u201d He added, \u201cPodcasts hold a special place with us at Apple.\u201dIn terms of revenue, podcasting is still minuscule compared with the technology and entertainment industries. In the early days, hobbyists grew passion projects into businesses and full-time jobs. Now a few established podcast networks and popular podcasters have millions in revenue.Podcasters can sell advertisements at rates ranging from $20 to $100 for every thousand listeners. For podcasts with hundreds of thousands of listeners \u2014 and, in rare cases, millions \u2014 those numbers add up. The spending on advertisements will generate hundreds of millions of dollars for the industry this year, said Matt Lieber, a co-founder of Gimlet Media, a podcasting start-up that has raised $7.5 million from venture capitalists.Expanding the industry much more, though, gets tricky. Apple does not allow shows to charge people to download episodes, for example, and does not support paid subscriptions, as many podcasters would like. Apple has stuck with an advertising model for podcasting that looks almost exactly like what Mr. Jobs predicted onstage in 2005.Measuring how many people listen is also inconsistent and a regular source of frustration. Podcasters know how many times their podcasts are downloaded, for example, but they don\u2019t know how many people actually listened, or how far those listeners might have gotten.With data like listener counts and listening duration \u2014 similar to what Apple provides app developers \u2014 the industry could accelerate quickly, said Ms. Delvac of \u201cCall Your Girlfriend.\u201dBut unlike with downloads of music, movies and apps \u2014 sources of billions of dollars of revenue for Apple, which takes a cut from sales and subscriptions \u2014 the company\u2019s financial incentive in podcasting is limited. The company takes no cut from podcast advertising, and all podcast downloads are free, so there is no cut to take from that, either. As it stands, podcasting is effectively just one more free feature to help the company sell hardware.And it\u2019s a popular one. Apple\u2019s service now contains over 325,000 podcasts. The company expects users to listen to 10 billion episodes in its apps \u2014 on computers, mobile devices and on Apple TV \u2014 by the end of the year.\u201cApple built this village 10 years ago,\u201d Mr. Lieber said. \u201cThere\u2019s really interesting things in the village, and interesting characters. But the village now has the population of a city \u2014 and when a village becomes a city, you need new infrastructure.\u201dApple\u2019s conservative approach may be creating an opportunity for competitors, as has happened before. Apple\u2019s iTunes software helped popularize online music, only to watch streaming services like Spotify and Pandora create compelling alternatives. Apple pressured the television and film industries to sell, and rent, their content online; then Netflix built subscription streaming into a business worth nearly $40 billion.Google abandoned a podcast app in 2012, but this year it added a podcast features to its music app, which is included with smartphones that run the company\u2019s Android operating system. Todd Cochrane, chief executive of RawVoice, a company that tracks podcasts, said Apple\u2019s share of podcast listeners is now about 65 percent, down from 70 percent a year ago. He attributed that change almost entirely to an \u201cupsurge\u201d in listening on Android.In January, Spotify, the streaming music service, began rolling out an ambitious slate of podcasts. Among the company\u2019s promises to podcasters: hosting, streaming and extensive listening data. Audible, the audiobook service owned by the notoriously aggressive Amazon, is investing heavily in original audio content under the guidance of Eric Nuzum, a former vice president at National Public Radio. (The New York Times is among the partners working with Audible.)\u201cWe\u2019re actively distributing our content in many different places right now,\u201d said Laura Walker, president and chief executive of New York Public Radio, whose podcasts include \u201cRadiolab,\u201d \u201cFreakonomics\u201d and \u201c2 Dope Queens.\u201d \u201cEverything is growing.\u201dApple\u2019s stance as the giant of the industry remains undisputed, though, and podcasters are left to navigate a complicated relationship with the company. Most send messages to the company at a general email address. To those who have direct contact, their relationship centers on one person: Steve Wilson.Mr. Wilson, podcasters say, acts as Apple\u2019s de facto podcast gatekeeper. Attention from him can be the difference between a hit and a dud \u2014 and between a podcast that pays and one that doesn\u2019t.The most consistent major source of new listeners \u2014 in some cases, tens of thousands \u2014 is a top spot on iTunes and Apple\u2019s podcast app. That is the real estate that Mr. Wilson helps oversee, and that podcasters covet. (Mr. Wilson directed a request for an interview to a company publicist, who declined to make him available for an interview.)\u201cAs far as I can tell they\u2019re huge podcasts enthusiasts,\u201d said Jody Avirgan, who hosts and produces podcasts for the ESPN data journalism site FiveThirtyEight. \u201cBut you\u2019re trying to cram thousands of new shows into, what, six things that get featured on the home page?\u201dMr. Wilson\u2019s identity and contact information are shared among podcasters like a juicy secret, and his podcast preferences are furtively debated in the industry, as are those of his boss, James Boggs. Mostly, it makes podcasters wonder: At a company the size of Apple, what does it mean that American podcasters are left to lobby a single person?From Apple\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s not that simple. Of the more than 150 iTunes podcast portals around the world, 29 have hand-edited selections and Steve Wilsons of their own. Any change to the way Apple handles podcasting could have wide ramifications.Additionally, the \u201cTop Podcast\u201d list within iTunes is also the subject of constant speculation among podcasters. An apparent change in the system this year resulted in small podcasts from Disney fans \u2014 and a show that hadn\u2019t yet published its first full episode \u2014 being ranked alongside shows with hundreds of thousands of listeners, according to Nicholas Quah, who publishes Hot Pod, a newsletter about the industry.For listeners, quirks like this may only be a little weird. For podcasters, who already struggle to communicate their success to advertisers, it leaves them frustrated.\u201cI think it\u2019s like the question everyone asks of any company,\u201d said Ms. Delvac, the \u201cCall Your Girlfriend\u201d producer. \u201cHow can I keep the good parts of my relationship the same, and get more of what I want?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Brooklyn\u2019s Wearable Revolution", "Date": "2016-04-30", "News": "Supported byA meditation on the assumptions we all make about what constitutes value in clothing, the show features 150 garments made between the 1880s and last February by names like Chanel, Iris van Herpen, Lanvin and Hussein Chalayan, and is meant to draw attention to the increasingly meaningless standoff between hand and machine. Why do we believe a dress that took one seamstress thousands of hours to embroider is worth more than a dress that took thousands of hours to 3D print? Can you even tell the difference?The implication being that, despite the fact that Apple, maker of the Apple Watch (a.k.a. the poster object for wearables), is a sponsor of the show, the answer is not necessarily a gadget you strap on your body.Rather it may have something to do with what is going on a few miles to the south of the museum, across the East River in a cavernous old industrial building in Sunset Park, Brooklyn.Forget Silicon Valley and Silicon Beach. Welcome to the land of the Silicon Schmatte.Incubator hubs in former factories have begun to dot the river\u2019s edge and the uplands like pearls on a string: Aside from Manufacture NY, there is the Greenpoint Design and Manufacturing Center, a complex of old brick buildings originally built for the textile industry, and New Lab in the Brooklyn Navy Yard (which concentrates on prototyping and structures), to name just a few. Then there is the Brooklyn Army Terminal, just a few blocks down from Manufacture NY\u2019s home, and a million-plus-square-foot center for \u201cadvanced manufacturing\u201d (including biotech), in the words of Maria Torres-Springer, president of the New York Economic Development Corporation, which will manage the space.Thanks to an unexpected collision of circumstances \u2014 a borough with a surfeit of unused industrial spaces; city planning (the realization on the part of the development corporation, among other agencies, \u201cthat there is enormous economic opportunity in encouraging this identity,\u201d according to Scott Cohen, one of the founders of New Lab); the rise of the maker movement, with its emphasis on small businesses thinking in a local and custom way; and the city\u2019s legacy as a fashion capital \u2014 New York, especially Brooklyn, has become \u201cthe natural home of the greater wearables movement,\u201d said Francis Bitonti, a designer who runs a namesake studio and whose primary tools are algorithms and 3D printers.\u201cThe West Coast has a lot of software talent, but not really a strong fashion culture,\u201d said Mr. Bitonti, who has collaborated on dresses for Dita Von Teese and Chromat and shoes for United Nude. \u201cThey take a very engineering-led bottom-line approach to their start-ups.\u201dManufacture NY has a somewhat different approach.Manufacture NY was founded in 2012 by Bob Bland, 33, a redhead with stints at Polo Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger on her r\u00e9sum\u00e9, who was inspired to \u201ccreate the 21st-century garment district\u201d after struggling to run her own label, Brooklyn Royalty, and source production locally. Now the group aims to focus on the points where design intersects with technology, and how together they can alter the supply chain.To this end, the 10-person executive team includes a chief technology officer named Amanda Parkes, a 41-year-old computer scientist and mechanical engineer with long blond hair who talks at warp speed, has a thing for biofabrication, and tends to pepper her sentences with words like \u201cdensity mapping,\u201d \u201cvoxel\u201d and \u201chacking interfaces.\u201d Together, she and Ms. Bland are the sharp point of the wearables spear. They function a bit like \u201cCharlie\u2019s Angels,\u201d if the angels had thrown off the patriarchy and gone out on their own.\u201cWe want to create a whole new genre of company that will have the instincts and design skills of fashion and the back end of research and I.P.,\u201d Ms. Parkes said, pointing out that current fashion start-ups exist in one sphere and tech start-ups in another, and, generally, never the twain do meet.But, Ms. Parkes said, \u201cIf you are making a clothing line, you need research facilities for the hydrophobic nanotechnology that\u2019s going to make it special, and you need to know what it takes to create a private label so you can actually bring it to market.\u201d If you are Dan Steingart, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Princeton and an energy specialist who is researching how to make fabric into a battery, \u201cYou need to know who can actually scale the fabric you make, or who can actually make clothes out of it. Who can design them.\u201dYou need to be in the same ecosystem.Or at least on the same floor \u2014 all 160,000 square feet of it, with washed concrete floors, giant mullioned windows and curving pillars nearing completion. (Manufacture NY is in a temporary home on a lower floor.) There will be space for 30 or 40 companies, a denim lab, digital printing, laser cutting, 3D knitting, weaving, chemistry and biology labs, and a working sample room. At the moment, 15 are in the temporary site, with another 50 or so linked into their network. Not all of them are product-centric. But all of them embody, to varying extents, this new kind of thinking and function somewhat as a circuit unto themselves.Dropel, for example, was co-founded by Simardev Gulati, scion of a textile-factory-owning family in India, who studied international trade and finance at Oxford. He and the co-founder Bradley Feinstein, a former consultant, have patented a nanotechnology process that bonds hydrophobic polymers with natural fibers on the molecular level to make them water- and stain-repellent, a process that can be licensed by clothing brands. Translated it means that a linen or cotton or denim shirt looks and feels exactly like linen or cotton or denim, but if you spill cranberry juice (or soy sauce or wine) on it, the liquid beads right off.Recently they were in the \u201coffice\u201d hanging out near Jae Rhim Lee, an artist and TED fellow, who first became known for her \u201cburial shroud,\u201d an art project she created at M.I.T. that combined biological material (mushrooms) with textiles to help achieve perfect physical decomposition after death. \u201cBut I\u2019m not a designer, so it didn\u2019t look that attractive,\u201d she said.Ms. Parkes introduced Ms. Lee to Daniel Silverstein, a Fashion Institute of Technology graduate who had interned at Carolina Herrera before going out on his own, and who has a space in Manufacture NY denoted by a gold velvet vintage chaise, a silver bowl of apples and two rails of clothing. Mr. Silverstein redesigned the funeral shroud into a neatly tailored funeral suit, and now Ms. Lee plans to sell it for $1,500.Mr. Silverstein, meanwhile, spends most of his time creating sweatshirt-like tops, for his label ZWD (Zero Waste Daniel), that are painstakingly and personally collaged from scrap fabric left on the cutting-room floor at local factories, so that within its basic contours no one garment is the same. His goal is to connect with a company using visual algorithms that allow robots to identify and manipulate the scraps, which would allow him to automate the process and produce at scale (and use up ever more textile ends that would otherwise end up as landfill).\u201cIf you put designers and engineers really close to the manufacturing process, what happens is they realize they do things the way they do because they are working with machines that were made a long time ago,\u201d said Mr. Cohen of New Lab. \u201cSuddenly they say, \u2018Why not just make a new machine?\u2019 And it transforms the process.\u201dIndeed, process is the key word in the language of the new wearables, as it reflects the idea of technology used to improve the creation of an object, as opposed to technology that is the object in itself.Such was the genesis of Thesis Couture, a Manufacture NY start-up shoe line founded by Dolly Singh, the former head of talent at Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX, who in 2013 enlisted a rocket scientist, an orthopedic surgeon, a mechanical engineer, a shoe designer and an Italian shoemaker in her goal of re-engineering the stiletto.\u201cIt essentially hasn\u2019t changed since it was invented in 1950,\u201d said Ms. Singh, who has spent the last two years trying to build a better shoe. Now she says they have done it.The result, which is in prototype and they hope will be available to order next month, is a limited edition of 1,500 pairs, each pair selling for $900. On first view the shoe looks like a black leather high-heeled gladiator sandal very much in the Jimmy Choo/Christian Louboutin/Manolo Blahnik vein, except it is made of ballistic-grade thermal plastic polyurethane, the pieces of which snap together.

{"Headline": "Gisele Inc.", "Date": "2016-05-14", "News": "Supported by\u201cMy career was never based on pretty,\u201d one of the world\u2019s most beautiful women was saying recently, straining a listener\u2019s credulity. The woman was Gisele B\u00fcndchen. And if what should have seemed disingenuous or else a bad case of false modesty somehow rang true, that is because the listener had already heard the tale of the nose.People in the business often repeat, as an example of the ways in which fashion is deeply disordered, the story of how two decades ago when Ms. B\u00fcndchen was starting out in a field she has dominated ever since \u2014 becoming not just the most highly paid model in the world but the richest, according to Forbes \u2014 some misguided types routinely advised her to correct what they saw as a glaring feature flaw.\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Angela Missoni, creative director of her family company, said last week from Milan. \u201cGisele did our first campaign with Mario Testino and we used a beautiful shot, but with Gisele\u2019s hair all across her face.\u201dWhat can you do about moments like that, Ms. B\u00fcndchen asked. You keep the nose nature gave you and move on. \u201cEven before I got into the business, I was used to being bullied because I was always tall and skinny and stuck out,\u201d she said. \u201cI got really red all the time from playing volleyball, red like a pepper. So I thought bullying was just the way life is.\u201dShrugging, she scoops up Fluffy, a rescue mutt she found online, and snuggles her into the folds of a designer sweatshirt so deliberately tattered it looks as if the puppy had a role in its fabrication.Along with her husband, Tom Brady, the New England Patriots quarterback, and their three children \u2014 a boy and a girl from their marriage and a son from Mr. Brady\u2019s previous relationship \u2014 Ms. B\u00fcndchen divides her time among this place, a house in Boston and a vacation compound in coastal Costa Rica. Neither Mr. Brady nor the children are anywhere to be seen today and, thus, all is quiet in a room where a scented candle emits the fragrance of sandalwood.Ms. B\u00fcndchen, whose diet once skewed improbably toward Coke and hamburgers, now observes the more stringent dietary practices favored by her athlete husband. Roughly 80 percent of what she consumes is vegetable in origin; her family\u2019s meals are prepared by a private chef. She is a practiced yogini and, Ms. B\u00fcndchen said, a deeply spiritual person, so much so that after reading the legend printed on her chamomile tea bag, she urges a reporter to record what it says. Put that in the article, she said. And so let the record show that love, compassion and kindness are the anchors of life.\u201cIn the beginning, you know, everyone told me, \u2018Your eyes are too small, the nose is too big, you can never be on a magazine cover,\u2019\u201d Ms. B\u00fcndchen said. \u201cBut, you know what? The big nose is coming with a big personality.\u201dNo one anymore would dispute that the enduring success Ms. B\u00fcndchen has had in a cruelly objectifying business (one in which the average shelf life of the talent is optimistically five years) owes much to her beauty. And yet there are \u201cmany, many beautiful girls,\u201d in the world, whose names no one remembers, as Ms. Missoni rightly observed. \u201cWith Gisele, there is something different, her energy,\u201d the designer added. \u201cOf course, she is super beautiful, but she also has this charisma, this presence, this very sexy normality.\u201d20 PhotosHere, for instance, is Ms. B\u00fcndchen as a bronzed and long-limbed sexpot in a shot by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott, clad in vertiginous platform sandals and a studded Versace bustier as she descends a ladder into an empty swimming pool. Here she is a sexy goofball girl-next-door photographed against cheap motel curtains by Terry Richardson, unaccountably lending innocence to the scene though clad in just underpants and bra.Here she is a tawny adventuress with a butterscotch mane leading a brace of donkeys along a Sicilian dirt path in Steven Meisel\u2019s images for some long forgotten Dolce & Gabbana campaign. Here she is Kabuki princess hugging tight the Polish model Malgosia Bela in a Richard Avedon hyper-stylized studio portrait, storm-battered orphans dressed in Dior haute couture.Here she is again and again, captured by the lenses of Helmut Newton, Juergen Teller, Peter Lindbergh, Bruce Weber, David LaChapelle, Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin, Michel Comte, Mario Sorrenti, Nino Mu\u00f1oz and David Sims. And what is striking about these images created by a lustrous roster of prominent photographers and artists is that the most compelling element of any photograph she appears in is not the clothes, the setting or the backdrop but the preternatural vitality of Ms. B\u00fcndchen herself.\u201cI always knew that, even if I was not the most beautiful girl, I\u2019d be the most energetic and hard-working,\u201d the model said. \u201cIf you want to know the truth, that\u2019s the reason for my success.\u201dWhen industry insiders talk about Ms. B\u00fcndchen, the praise most commonly proffered has less to do with her beauty than with her indomitable good spirits, a canny though untutored intelligence and an almost animal energy.\u201cGisele always struck me as being super-professional and likable, but with an understanding of her role that went beyond merely turning up and delivering the goods,\u201d said Joe McKenna, a stylist behind some of the more influential fashion campaigns of recent decades. \u201cShe always understood that \u2018Gisele B\u00fcndchen\u2019 could be a business, too. And, though I loathe the word branding, that\u2019s exactly what she\u2019s always been aware of.\u201dWhen the woman Gisele B\u00fcndchen speaks of the global brand Gisele B\u00fcndchen, she tends to attribute its success to a kind of Horatio Alger ethos, a drive that has been with her since she was young. \u201cI\u2019m a twin, I\u2019m a Cancer, I\u2019m always taking care of other people,\u201d she said, offering to pour bottled water or make tea or fetch anything else a guest might desire. \u201cI\u2019ve always been the fixer in the family, the responsible one,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a hard worker, never late for a job in my life. Really, ask anyone.\u201dAnd, while \u2014 unlike, say, the multimillionaire Russian model Natalia Vodianova, whose rags-to-riches story began with her peddling apples by the road in Nizhny Novgorod \u2014 Ms. B\u00fcndchen comes from a modest, though solidly middle-class background, she is acutely conscious of the psychic and economic distance between the provincial world she was born to and the imposing one she inhabits today. Raised by a real estate agent and a bank cashier in a midsize municipality in Brazil\u2019s southernmost state, Ms. B\u00fcndchen is a fraternal twin born to a family of six girls who grew up wearing their sisters\u2019 hand-me-downs. \u201cWhen I was a kid, I never even thought about fashion,\u201d Ms. B\u00fcndchen said. \u201cI had one pair of jeans.\u201dThe story of Ms. B\u00fcndchen, who was discovered in a mall food court, is one that hews to all the modeling industry clich\u00e9s. It happened that she was there that day on an outing with classmates from a modeling school her mother had urged her to attend in the hope that her posture would improve. \u201cThis guy came up to me and said: \u2018Do you want to be a model? Come with me to the agency right now,\u2019\u201d Ms. B\u00fcndchen said, adding that she resisted the idea for predictable teenage reasons. \u201cWe were supposed to go to Playcenter that day,\u201d she said, referring to a popular Brazilian amusement park. \u201cThe guy said, \u2018Oh, I promise you when you come to the agency in S\u00e3o Paulo, I\u2019ll take you to the Playcenter there,\u2019\u201d Ms. B\u00fcndchen added. \u201cAnd you know what? He never took me there!\u201dWith a $50 grubstake from her father, Ms. B\u00fcndchen set off alone on a 28-hour bus ride to S\u00e3o Paulo and an improbable lifelong journey. \u201cModeling was the farthest thing from what I ever thought I would do with my life,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom the beginning, looks did not define me in any way. I have a different idea of what I am. I wanted to be Jane Goodall. In my mind, I\u2019m still Jane Goodall in bare feet.\u201dThus, if she found herself modeling winter clothes on a shoot in Death Valley in 100-degree heat, she would remain, she said, \u201ctotally, 100 percent committed.\u201d And if stylists dressed her in \u201cimpossible clothes, things I can\u2019t breathe in,\u201d or photographers transported her to \u201cextreme settings,\u201d or if she found those around her \u201csaying the most horrendous things right in front of your face,\u201d she said she was determined to seek \u201cwhat is positive here, how to make something good out of this.\u201dShe jumps up from the sofa then and scoops up Fluffy, a dog she adopted as a reminder of Vida, the Yorkshire terrier she carried along on her ceaseless global travels early in her career. And when she rises from the sofa with an athlete\u2019s easy grace, a reporter is reminded of a remark the designer Anna Sui once made about Ms. B\u00fcndchen: \u201cGisele has that effervescence only certain girls have, an energy you look for that is really rare.\u201dTwo decades ago, when Ms. B\u00fcndchen was barely 16 and relatively unknown, she found herself cast for a Harper\u2019s Bazaar editorial to be shot on the French island of St. Bart\u2019s. The photographer was a man famous himself for having photographed the biggest celebrities and most compelling faces in the world \u2014 including Madonna and Diana, Princess of Wales.\u201cSome people on the sitting were saying, \u2018Oh, she\u2019s not too pretty, she has a big nose,\u2019\u201d that photographer, Patrick Demarchelier, said last week, about the youthful Ms. B\u00fcndchen. \u201cBut I said, \u2018No, no, I like her.\u2019 She was smart and outgoing, always happy, and clearly already knew what she was doing.\u201dThroughout the shoot, the naysayers continued to disparage the young Brazilian. Then the contact sheets came in. \u201cImmediately, right away, you could see that the girl was special,\u201d Mr. Demarchelier said. \u201cShe got 20 pages right away.\u201dAn article last Sunday about the model Gisele B\u00fcndchen misidentified the game after which Ms. B\u00fcndchen, whose husband is the New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, was videotaped reacting emotionally to the team\u2019s loss. It was Super Bowl XLVI, when the Patriots lost to the New York Giants. It was not Super Bowl XLIX, when they beat the Seattle Seahawks.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Prevails as Jury Rebuffs Oracle in Code Copyright Case", "Date": "2016-05-26", "News": "Supported byA jury ruled in favor of Google on Thursday in a long legal dispute with Oracle over software used to power most of the world\u2019s smartphones.Oracle contended that Google used copyrighted material in 11,000 of its 13 million lines of software code in Android, its mobile phone operating system. Oracle asked for $9 billion from Google. Google said it made fair use of that code and owed nothing.The victory for Google cheered other software developers, who operate much the way Google did when it comes to so-called open-source software. Unlike traditional software created by corporations and tightly held, open-source products are released, often with some restrictions, for anyone to use and modify.\u201cGreat news for progress and innovation,\u201d Chris Dixon, a technology investor with Andreessen Horowitz, the venture capital firm, posted on Twitter after the verdict.Android relies in part on Java, an open-source software language that Oracle acquired when it bought Sun Microsystems for $7.4 billion in 2010. Oracle argued that Google executives violated Oracle\u2019s copyright by using aspects of Java without permission.William Fitzgerald, a Google spokesman, said in a statement that the verdict \u201crepresents a win for the Android ecosystem, for the Java programming community and for software developers who rely on open and free programming languages to build innovative consumer products.\u201dThe courtroom fight was something of a watershed for technology and could offer clarity on legal rules surrounding open-source technology, which is used in everything from smartphones and digital recording devices to the software that runs many of the world\u2019s biggest data centers.People who work with open-source technology worried that a victory for Oracle would have led other companies to make similar demands of open-source products.While there is an expectation in open-source projects that the software tweaks of others will be given back to the community working on the software, open source often requires a license as well.But where software licenses typically forbid touching code or sharing code with anyone, open-source licenses usually insist on sharing. They detail what can and cannot be used by other companies in their products. And they often require people to share their work with other developers.The idea is that, collectively, people working at many companies or even out of their homes or college dorms can build better technology than what is created behind the closed doors of one corporation.From the start, this was a trial neither side intended. Oracle first sued Google in 2010, accusing it of patent and copyright violations in Android. The outcome of that case, which was decided in 2012, was largely favorable to Google.But in 2014, a federal appeals court found that certain parts of Java were protected by copyright, providing Oracle with fresh ammunition. When the Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal of that decision last year, the case was sent back to the lower courts to hear the copyright aspect of the case again.In this iteration of the courtroom fight, Eric E. Schmidt, executive chairman of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, testified that Sun knew Google was using Java and approved of that use even though Google did not obtain a license. Jonathan Schwartz, who was chief executive of Sun before Oracle bought it, backed up that view, and a blog post he wrote praising Android was a major piece of evidence in the trial.Oracle provided a series of emails and meeting documents that countered that view, suggesting that Larry Page, a founder of Google and chief executive of Alphabet, had pressed the Android team to develop the product quickly. Mr. Page denied the suggestion on the stand.The particular areas of copyright protection in Java involved the so-called declaring code in Application Programming Interfaces, or A.P.I.s., which have become the common way that networked programs on the Internet share data.Declaring code establishes standards and meanings by which future lines of software, the actual effects the software seeks to create, will operate. This distinction compelled the 10 jurors \u2014 eight women and two men \u2014 to hear extensive testimony by engineers and economists about the nature of code, and the copyrightable implications of this type of creativity.Dorian Daley, Oracle\u2019s general counsel, said the company planned to appeal. \u201cWe strongly believe that Google developed Android by illegally copying core Java technology to rush into the mobile device market,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cOracle brought this lawsuit to put a stop to Google\u2019s illegal behavior.\u201dSome lawyers cautioned against viewing the verdict as a green light for the type of software development Google performed, saying that the earlier federal appeals court decision validated the idea that A.P.I.s can be copyrighted.\u201cI don\u2019t think the industry can sit back and rely on this decision and exhale and say these things won\u2019t be protected,\u201d said Christopher Carani, a lawyer at McAndrews, Held & Malloy. \u201cI think what you\u2019re still going to see is a lot more attention paid to securing approval to use other copyrights before the fact.\u201dFor spectators, the historic trial was also a rare look at Silicon Valley history. Not only did Mr. Schmidt work at both Sun and Google, he sat on the board of Apple Computer when Apple was developing the iPhone, leading him to say he recused himself from knowledge of the iPhone when it was clear Android would be a competing product.Andy Rubin, who led the Android project at Google, worked at Apple early in his career and later developed a type of multifunction phone, which had a Java license. Oracle\u2019s executive chairman, Lawrence J. Ellison, who appeared in video testimony, was friends with Steve Jobs, who led development of the iPhone, and Scott McNealy, a founder and the chief executive of Sun before Mr. Schwartz.While the jury may now rest, the court fight will probably continue. The case could go to the Supreme Court, though it was unclear whether the court would rule definitively on copyright, said Pamela Samuelson, a professor at the School of Law and the School of Information at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cThey don\u2019t usually like to go against what the appeals court established,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

Maxx and Marshalls \u2014 reported sales increases last year.\u201cPeople are definitely hunting for value, and I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing,\u201d said Charlie O\u2019Shea, the lead retail analyst for Moody\u2019s. \u201cEspecially in the apparel sector.\u201dBut doubts persist about whether Walmart is growing fast enough in one increasingly important area: online.\u201cFor a company of its size, Walmart underperforms in e-commerce,\u201d said Neil Saunders, a retail analyst for Conlumino.Percentage growth can be misleading. Walmart\u2019s sales increase translates to more than a billion dollars in revenue, essentially the same as adding the entire businesses of Burger King and Tim Hortons. Walmart does not break out a quarterly figure for online sales, but said its e-commerce business had grown 7 percent in the last quarter.Walmart has been investing heavily to increase that business, which, like every other retailer\u2019s, continues to get clobbered by Amazon. Some analysts said that given Walmart\u2019s vast resources, its web business should be growing faster, and Mr. McMillon acknowledged on Thursday that its growth rate was \u201ctoo slow.\u201d\u201cThe U.S. number is better than the global number, but neither is as high as we\u2019d like,\u201d he said.Amazon does much more business than Walmart.com, Mr. Saunders said, and yet it still reports double-digit growth. Amazon reported that net product sales rose 13 percent, to $79.3 billion in 2015, while Walmart reported that global annual e-commerce revenue had risen 12 percent to $13.7 billion in its latest fiscal year.\u201cOther retailers are tackling the problems and making headway much better,\u201d said Bernie Sosnick, a retail analyst with Madison Global Partners. \u201cWalmart has plowed so much capital in this that it should be doing as well or better than other retailers.\u201dBut Mr. O\u2019Shea of Moody\u2019s argues that comparing Walmart.com and Amazon is like comparing \u201capples to watermelons.\u201d\u201cIf Amazon were to get into brick-and-mortar, would it be fair to compare Amazon\u2019s brick-and-mortar business to Walmart\u2019s brick-and-mortar business?\u201d he said. \u201cProbably not, and we\u2019re doing the reverse to that here.\u201dWalmart\u2019s online reinvention, Mr. O\u2019Shea pointed out, has just begun. The company has been aggressively tackling its online business in the last few months, and has committed to investing heavily in a number of areas, including technology.The company recently announced plans to offer free two-day shipping to customers who paid an annual $49 fee. On Thursday, Mr. McMillon also disclosed Walmart\u2019s plans to expand its grocery pickup business to 40 markets by the end of the month, up from 22 early this year.At the same time, the company has expanded its online assortment. At the end of last year, about eight million items were available through Walmart.com. That number is now up to 10 million. Four years ago, it was fewer than two million, according to a spokesman, Dan Toporek.\u201cThis takes time,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Shea said. \u201cYou don\u2019t just flip a switch and become a great online retailer.\u201dIn other areas, Walmart significantly outperformed its peers.Over all, Walmart reported that profit fell to $3.08 billion, or 98 cents a share, compared with $3.34 billion, or $1.03 a share, a year earlier. That beat expectations of 88 cents a share, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue was $115.9 billion; analysts had expected $113.2 billion.\u201cWalmart, especially with apparel, did better than other retailers for a really stressful period,\u201d Mr. Sosnick said.Advertisement"}

Let\u2019s do a superquick rundown of the week in tech.But this week we wanted to try something new, right? Instead of a deep dive into one tech topic, we\u2019re going to do a short list, mostly because millennials love lists.I never really saw them around on the street until I moved to San Francisco. Now I mostly see them on cyclist dudes, at least two of whom were smoking pot and blazing through stop signs, I kid you not. I\u2019m walking down the sidewalk and all of a sudden I\u2019m getting low-quality audio blared at me. It\u2019s like being accosted by a drive-by Sublime album.Anyway, you know what I hate? The iPhone charging cable. It\u2019s called Lightning, though a better name would be Fraying. I\u2019m lucky if I get six months out of these cables before they start acting up \u2014 usually the connector begins separating from the cable or you get a kink in the line that begins to crack, and soon your phone stops charging. I hate it. Will someone please make a superstrong charging cable, please?Here\u2019s something else that I wanted to like, but actually hate: streaming, stationary digital cameras like those offered by Nest for the home.I really liked the whole safety and security pitch at first. When I lived in New York, the editors unfortunately wanted me to leave my house and go into the office to work \u2014 something I\u2019m pretty sure you have never done in the San Francisco bureau. So setting up a Nest cam to watch my dog while I\u2019m gone seemed like a nice idea.Instead, I felt like a creepy voyeur. My dog sat and slept by the door, and watching her made me feel sad. Then when my dog walker \u2014 whom I trust and like \u2014 came in, I saw him pet my dog and be supersweet with her and do what I always assumed he did normally, which was walk my dog. But not telling him that I was watching him felt like a strange breach of trust, as if I suspected him of something that wasn\u2019t ever really warranted.It made me realize how prevalent these cameras are now, and how violated I would feel were I being recorded in, say, my friends\u2019 homes. My \u201chatred,\u201d I guess, is that it\u2019s so mainstream and there\u2019s little I can do to stop it.But at my house, at least, I let my dog have her privacy when I\u2019m gone. It\u2019s better that way.Let\u2019s see, what else do I hate? I hate most hashtags. I can see their value as part of a political campaign or meme \u2014 like, #oscarsowhite or #blacklivesmatter \u2014 but I hate when people add useless hashtags to their most banal posts. On Instagram, people will post photos of their trendy brunch and then clog it up with a barrage of idiotic hashtags: #brunch #sundayfun #sleepinglate #ihavenolife #pleasehelp. That kind of thing.Look, you\u2019re not a marketing campaign. Your brunch is not searchworthy. Don\u2019t hashtag your life.Advertisement"}

Also, the bedroom, dining room and \u2014 it\u2019s a safe bet \u2014 the bathroom as well.Google, which knows more things about more people than any other company, organization or government in history, announced on Wednesday a new household device that will use that information to help people run their lives.\u201cWe want users to have an ongoing two-way dialogue with Google,\u201d Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, told about 7,000 attendees in an outdoor music amphitheater here in the Internet company\u2019s hometown. \u201cWe have started becoming truly conversational.\u201dGoogle Home got top billing during the two-hour keynote by Mr. Pichai and other executives at the company\u2019s annual developer conference, but many details \u2014 how much it will cost, when it will be available \u2014 were not disclosed. The device existed on the stage, but its features still seemed to be works in progress.Why introduce it now and make such a big thing of it? The reason seemed to lie in Mr. Pichai\u2019s unusual shout-out to a competitor. \u201cCredit to the team at Amazon for creating a lot of excitement in this space,\u201d he said.Those are millions of consumers who are lost, at least to some extent, to Google. The search company had to begin competing with Amazon before that number swelled to tens of millions. Mr. Pichai pointedly noted that Google was \u201cat a pivotal moment.\u201dThis was Google\u2019s 10th annual developers conference, but the first held in the amphitheater adjacent to its headquarters. The event is designed to be mostly instructive and inspirational for the freelance software engineers who use Google\u2019s tools to build things. But it is also promotional, an opportunity taken to broadcast around the world \u2014 there were a million people listening in China, Mr. Pichai said \u2014 what tomorrow will hold.Mario Queiroz, the Google executive in charge of Home, said it would \u201cbe a beautiful addition to any room in your house.\u201d In a short film, a family was shown waking up with Home. The father used it to play music in one child\u2019s room and to turn on the lights in another to get them out of bed. The girl, finishing her homework, asked Home what the Spanish word was for \u201capple.\u201d The parents rearranged their schedules.\u201cIt will let anyone in the family, kids or adults, have a conversation with Google,\u201d Mr. Queiroz said. Indeed, in the film, everyone is so busy communicating with Home they hardly talk to each other.Google already does search solely through voice, but its efforts have been confusingly branded. On Wednesday, Google promoted Google assistant \u2014 the company\u2019s name for the ability to have a two-way conversation to get information. It will be available this summer in a messaging app called Allo and later in Google Home.There have been efforts before to develop control centers for the home, but none have made serious inroads. Even the Echo was not an immediate hit with reviewers, some of whom wondered whether it might be little more than a gimmick.\u201cBefore I got an Echo I thought it was a joke and a bad idea,\u201d said Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray. \u201cBut I saw the utility and ended up buying five of them for my family.\u201dFor Google Home to stand out, he said, it would have to outdo the Echo, particularly in search. \u201cYou have to be able to ask it a complex question, and then it would go to the Internet and read it back to you,\u201d Mr. Munster said. \u201cEcho doesn\u2019t do a good job of that today.\u201dThe big tech companies are the new middlemen of commerce and communication. People used to go to stores to buy brands on impulse or by design. Now Google, Amazon and the others mediate the moment.One example of that power was given by Mr. Pichai, when he demonstrated a conversation with Google through his phone about taking his family to the movie \u201cJungle Book.\u201d\u201cIs \u2018Jungle Book\u2019 any good?\u201d he asked. The reply came: \u201cLooks like it\u2019s getting some good reviews.\u201dWho or what is powering the agent\u2019s opinions, and how much the consumer can trust it, are among many things still to be worked out.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Warren Buffett Stake Suggests Apple Is All Grown Up", "Date": "2016-05-19", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseWith this week\u2019s imprimatur from the legendary investor Warren Buffett, it should now be official: Apple, the world\u2019s largest company by market capitalization and a symbol of American technological innovation, is a \u201cvalue\u201d stock.That may prove to be a decidedly mixed blessing.Mr. Buffett is the world\u2019s most prominent and successful proponent of value investing \u2014 an approach that seeks stocks that are undervalued and sell for less than their \u201cintrinsic value,\u201d as Benjamin Graham put it his 1949 classic \u201cThe Intelligent Investor.\u201d Mr. Buffett credits Mr. Graham with shaping his own approach to investing.\u201cWe\u2019ve just looked at it again,\u201d said Bill Smead, who manages the Smead Value Fund, one of the most successful large-cap value mutual funds over the last five years, according to Morningstar. \u201cAnybody that discounts the thinking at Berkshire Hathaway does so at their peril, in my opinion.\u201dValue stocks are typically unpopular among many investors, their shares often battered by disappointing short-term revenue and earnings results. They usually trade at very low price-to-earnings ratios, a common valuation measure. Nonetheless, some academic studies have suggested that over time, they outperform other stocks, in part because expectations are so low.Apple \u201cis going to attract more value investors,\u201d said Toni Sacconaghi, a senior analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein who covers Apple. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for beaten-down stocks with negative sentiment. Apple has traded below a market multiple for years and sentiment has become increasingly pessimistic, especially over the past month.\u201dMr. Sacconaghi has a buy recommendation on the stock, \u201cnot because we believe this will be a high-growth company going forward, but because the current price is discounting a decline in cash flow forever, and we think that\u2019s overly pessimistic.\u201dAccording to the market research firm Thomson Reuters Lipper, just 69 of 357 actively managed value funds in the United States \u2014 fewer than 20 percent \u2014 currently hold positions in Apple.That\u2019s because Apple has long been considered a quintessential growth stock: one of the glamorous high-flying cousins to dowdy value stocks. Growth investors think growth stocks are undervalued, too, because they expect their earnings to grow faster (often much faster) than other investors recognize.As a result, valuation measures for growth stocks can go sky-high. In two prominent growth-stock examples, shares of Facebook trade at a price-earnings ratio of about 73, and Netflix at about 312. (The price-earnings average for stocks in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is currently about 24.)This week Apple\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio was just over 10.If Apple is now a value stock, though, plenty of growth investors haven\u2019t gotten the message. Among actively managed growth funds, 249 of 619, or 40 percent, hold Apple shares, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper. That\u2019s more than the 230 growth funds that owned Apple stock in 2014.Should growth funds suddenly decide that Apple no longer meets their criteria, there could be a mass exodus that would be only partly offset by new purchases from value investors.Some prominent value investors aren\u2019t convinced Apple really is a value stock, despite Mr. Buffett\u2019s blessing, or that its stock price is significantly below its intrinsic value. (Intrinsic value considers all aspects of a business, including both tangible and intangible factors.)That means Apple could fall into the neutral zone of stocks that are neither growth \u2014 because they aren\u2019t growing fast enough \u2014 or value, because they\u2019re still not cheap enough.\u201cApple is extraordinarily cheap, but it\u2019s never been a value stock in the traditional sense,\u201d said Bruce Greenwald, who runs the value investing program at Columbia Business School and is a co-author of \u201cValue Investing: From Graham to Buffett and Beyond\u201d (Wiley, 2001).\u201cValue investing has always focused primarily on asset value,\u201d Professor Greenwald told me. Apple\u2019s book value, or asset value, of $130 billion isn\u2019t even close to its market capitalization of about $515 billion.That means, in theory, that other companies could replicate Apple\u2019s assets at relatively low cost, produce rival products and undermine Apple\u2019s enviably high profit margins.Tech companies typically have low asset values relative to their share prices \u2014 one reason Mr. Buffett and other value investors long shunned the sector \u2014 but their patented technologies and intellectual property nonetheless often create formidable barriers to entry by competitors.For an extraordinarily high-profit-margin technology company like Apple, the question is whether there are such \u201cmoats,\u201d as value investors like to put it, that will continue to protect it from these competitive threats.\u201cThat\u2019s always been the issue with Apple,\u201d Professor Greenwald said. \u201cHow sustainable are these profit levels and how big are the barriers? The fear with Apple is that it will get overwhelmed by new entry and new competitors. The moat doesn\u2019t seem that big. It\u2019s not just giant rivals like Samsung, but smaller companies that can survive with even a small share of the smartphone market.\u201dMr. Smead told me this week he had not added Apple to his value fund\u2019s holdings, even though the stock is so cheap that it meets many of his fund\u2019s investing criteria.\u201cOver the past five or six years, when Apple was doing so well, we joked that we were the best-performing large-cap fund that didn\u2019t own Apple,\u201d Mr. Smead said. \u201cNot that we didn\u2019t wrestle with it many times.\u201d\u201cOur difficulty has been that we don\u2019t understand what kind of moat protects their technology over the next 10 years,\u201d Mr. Smead continued. \u201cThat\u2019s the main problem. The other is that, given Apple\u2019s huge success and its sheer magnitude, it needs a monstrous new product or enhancement of an existing product to move the needle on growth.\u201dFor their part, many growth investors were startled on April 26 when Apple reported its first quarterly revenue drop since 2003. Both revenue and earnings fell short of analyst estimates, and Apple shares plunged 8 percent in one day. They rallied some this week on news of the Berkshire Hathaway investment, but are still down sharply from where they were as recently as mid-April.But Apple still has defenders among growth investors.At the end of the year, Apple was the second-largest holding in the Upright Growth Fund, the top-performing large-cap growth fund so far this year, according to Morningstar.\u201cApple\u2019s best and fastest growing days may be behind us,\u201d David Chiueh, Upright Growth\u2019s president and fund manager, told me. \u201cBut even growth-oriented funds like ours don\u2019t just contain high-growth stocks with 35-50 percent growth rates in our portfolio.\u201dHe said such rapid growth was not sustainable, and added that he was happy with companies that showed \u201csolid 8 percent to 12 percent earnings growth,\u201d a category in which he included Apple. \u201dGive them some time and they will show outstanding performance,\u201d he said.Mr. Chiueh said he was also encouraged that Apple had stepped up its spending on research and development, suggesting that new products with strong growth prospects might still be in the offing.At some fund families, Apple seems to be both a value and a growth stock, even though that seems contradictory. At the fund giant Vanguard, Apple is a major holding in the Vanguard Windsor and Windsor II funds (both value funds) and the Vanguard Morgan Growth Fund and US Growth Fund. A Vanguard spokeswoman declined to comment.All of which suggests that when it comes to Apple, \u201cvalue\u201d and \u201cgrowth\u201d may be in the eye of the beholder.Still, Mr. Buffett\u2019s announcement this week underscores that Apple\u2019s once sizzling growth has slowed, and suggests it may well be on the inexorable path from growth to value stock.That\u2019s not an especially good portent for investors. Among technology companies that have already made the same transition, Professor Greenwald cited IBM, Intel, Cisco, Microsoft and Dell, companies whose share prices, after great rocket rides, have mostly languished in recent years. (Dell was taken private in 2013.)For those who failed to buy the stock early enough, \u201cas investments, they all turned out pretty badly,\u201d he noted.Berkshire Hathaway also disclosed this week that it had increased the stake in IBM it first acquired in 2011. IBM shares have declined over the period, but by Mr. Buffett\u2019s long-term standards, the investment is still too new to judge.\u201cIf you believe the iPhone will be the global standard in 25 years, you\u2019d buy\u201d Apple stock, Professor Greenwald said. But many value investors have already seen where smartphones can go, \u201cwhich is where PCs have already gone.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Oettinger, the European commissioner in charge of the digital economy, said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cWith these new rules, we will uphold media pluralism.\u201dSuch rules already exist for traditional broadcasters, like the BBC in Britain and the TF1 Group in France. On average, they pay the equivalent of millions of dollars each year, or roughly 20 percent of their annual revenue in the countries where they operate, to support local content.European policy makers said that online streaming rivals currently invested only around 1 percent of their annual revenue in local content. Netflix has been able to sidestep existing funding rules, most notably in France, because the company\u2019s European headquarters are in the Netherlands.Streaming services will also be required to ensure that at least 20 percent of their online content is from Europe, and that those movies and television programs are given prominence in their digital catalogs. A report funded by the European Commission recently found that both Netflix and Apple already met this requirement.The commission\u2019s digital plans are subject to the approval of the European Parliament and individual member states, a lengthy process that could lead to significant changes.Europe\u2019s proposals on digital services are only the beginning.The European Commission said on Wednesday that it would also propose new copyright rules in the fall that could force companies like Google to pay online publishers when using their content, including in its news aggregation service Google News.Officials also said that they were still reviewing potential new rules to control how so-called online platforms like Facebook and Amazon operate in the 28-member bloc.European officials said they were looking into making it easier for people to move their digital information between online platforms by the end of the year, giving them greater control over data that companies collected on their daily digital lives.\u201cI want online platforms and the audiovisual and creative sectors to be powerhouses in the digital economy,\u201d said Andrus Ansip, the European Commission vice president in charge of the region\u2019s digital single market proposals. \u201cThey need the certainty of a modern and fair legal environment: That is what we are providing today.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The attacks raised alarm bells because the thieves gained access to Swift, which is considered the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most secure payment messaging system. It is used by 11,000 banks and companies to move money between countries, making it a tempting target. Swift itself had warned of a coordinated assault on banks, although it stressed that it was the banks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 connections to its networks, rather than the network itself, that were breached. Oracle contended that Google used copyrighted material in the software code for the Android mobile phone operating system. Oracle asked for $9 billion from Google. Google said it had made fair use of that code and owed nothing.  Software developers, who operate in the same way Google did when it comes to open-source software, cheered the victory. Open-source products are released, often with some restrictions, for anyone to use and modify. Dorian Daley, Oracle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s general counsel, said the company planned to appeal. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe strongly believe that Google developed Android by illegally copying core Java technology to rush into the mobile device market,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said in a statement. In its opinion, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago said that Epic Systems, a health care software provider in Verona, Wis., violated federal labor law when it required its workers to bring disputes individually to arbitration. The decision directly conflicts with an earlier decision by an appeals court in Louisiana and the split could prompt the Supreme Court to wade back into the fray. In a pair of decisions in 2011 and 2013, the Supreme Court blessed the use of arbitration in a case pushed by a group of credit card companies. The credit card companies turned to a 1925 federal law that formalized arbitration as a means for companies to hash out their disputes with one another.Courts across the country have largely upheld arbitration clauses, deferring to the Supreme Court, which ruled that the Federal Arbitration Act beat even federal laws.Mr. Denton assured Mr. Thiel that Gawker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s journalists would be reporting on his involvement in lawsuits against the company.  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story Advertisement"}

The case was supercomplicated but many programmers worried that a win for Oracle would cast a shadow over the legality of using open-source code, which is at the center of a lot of the technology that modern computing relies on. A jury sided with Google.Do you understand any of this? I\u2019m guessing no. The upshot for you is, thanks to this win, your phone won\u2019t get superexpensive and will probably still keep getting better. And that\u2019s probably pretty much all you care about.Let\u2019s talk about the big news of the week, or month, in tech and media land: #Thielgate.The story is sort of unbelievable, in and of itself, but also hits a sweet spot within all the crazy things that editors love: tech, billionaires, tech billionaires and, of course, media.The basic argument of those on the tech side was that Gawker was singularly bad. They said that Gawker abused its journalistic platform, it routinely invaded people\u2019s private lives, including outing their sexual orientation, and in other ways made life very difficult for wealthy coastal techies.I\u2019ve certainly not been a fan of everything Gawker has done. But I\u2019m struck by the inability of techies to consider both the proportionality of this punishment and the chilling effects this case could induce on the media generally. First, to me, it doesn\u2019t make sense that a small excerpt from a sex tape should result in a company-ending decision. And I don\u2019t see how techies could support that.All of these examples are potentially far more damaging to the world than a leaked sex tape. But none of these companies were fined anywhere near hundreds of millions of dollars for their recklessness. Do tech venture capitalists really want to support a system in which moving fast and breaking things results in company-ending lawsuits?I\u2019m not sure I quite believe that. But it\u2019s fair to say that Gawker had its day in court \u2014 with a lot of caveats over jurisdiction and judge and jury, Gawker supporters would say \u2014 and that the company lost the case. This should be a deterrent to \u201cbad\u201d journalism.That\u2019s a rosy view, but again, I don\u2019t quite buy it wholesale. Do I agree with every story Gawker chooses to publish? No. Do I think they do good journalism? Absolutely. Do I think people with money will use a tactic such as Thiel\u2019s for only its \u201cproper\u201d and intended purpose of eliminating the wrong in the world? No way, Jos\u00e9.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can a 700 M.P.H. Train in a Tube Be for Real?", "Date": "2016-05-19", "News": "Supported byLast month, at an M.I.T. conference on the future of suburbia, I met a senior-level executive from Hyperloop Technologies. (Hyperloop is a speculative high-speed transportation system that proposes to use passenger and cargo capsules inside a reduced-pressure tube that aims to reach a top speed of 700 miles per hour.) Why put your energies in something that still feels like science fiction? I asked him. Why not invest time, money and ingenuity in high-speed rail? (I live in California; I want to see high-speed rail happen.)Our conversation veered into a surprising direction, much like the proposed curve of a Hyperloop track. He told me about how he and his wife had made the decision not to be together but to share custody of their children and continue to live under the same roof. I looked at him quizzically.The structure of marriage, he continued, didn\u2019t work for him; it was an outdated institution. High-speed rail, he said, was also an outdated institution, so why should we continue to invest in trains?And so, according to his analogy, one might fairly describe Hyperloop as transportation\u2019s new girlfriend: mysterious, unencumbered, exciting, expensive. A wild card with potential. But does she have long-term potential? That remains to be seen.I went to Las Vegas recently to view the first test of Hyperloop. As someone who experiences aging infrastructure daily and desires something better, I was ready to be convinced of the feasibility and future of this idea, which has become one of the purest expressions of techno-optimism.Several separate entities have since been formed to explore the possibilities. The event I attended was presented by Hyperloop Technologies, a group inspired by but not affiliated with Mr. Musk (though riding on his name recognition and involving several of his former employees). Hyperloop Technologies and its competitors are working to develop a structure to move passengers and cargo between two points safely, efficiently and sustainably. And quickly: Mr. Musk\u2019s initial dream was to propel passengers from San Francisco to Los Angeles in about a half an hour (Amtrak takes 12 hours; flight time is an hour).Hyperloop Technologies, which announced its name change to Hyperloop One with much fanfare in Las Vegas, is a well-funded operation with over 100 employees. It\u2019s gaining new investors (such as Vinod Khosla, a founder of Sun Microsystems; Sherpa Ventures; and SNCF, the French train company) and new partners (including the engineering firms Aecom and ARUP, as well as the starchitect Bjarke Ingels) almost as fast as the model on view at its press event.Approximately 200 investors, polo-shirted employees and reporters piled onto buses to converge on a site that looked eerily like a desert scene from \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201d We\u2019d been brought here to watch a test vehicle accelerate down a rail track at speeds of up to 300 m.p.h. using the company\u2019s propulsion technology. The dream is that capsules will hurl through a tube at 700 miles per hour on a cushion of air. That, however, was not what we witnessed.But I have questions. A lot of them.America (and later most of the world) got excited about freeways and built them everywhere over a 30-year span. Little did we know about the negative effects to neighborhoods, the health (obesity) and pollution risks, the excesses of traffic. What are the possible unintended positive and negative consequences of Hyperloop?Will Hyperloop exist as a series of isolated runs or as a comprehensive network?Hyperloop hopes to connect to city centers: What should cities be doing now to accommodate its arrival?Nevada is a famously lax regulatory environment. How will Hyperloop avoid the regulatory obstacles that every other transportation mode faces in more rigorous states?Hyperloop requires narrower rights of way than rails and highways but also requires curvier ones to offset those G-forces. Where will these go?I was told the right of way issue could be avoided by putting Hyperloop underground or underwater, but what are the environmental and cost impacts of that approach?In case of an emergency, how do you evacuate a Hyperloop that\u2019s under a mountain or under water?Will Hyperloop vehicles and tubes have windows? Will passengers want to see the world go by at 400 m.p.h. at ground level?What will Hyperloop do to ensure that people can get to and from its stations?Who is Hyperloop intended to serve? Will lower- and middle-income people be able to afford it? Would we be better off with a less expensive but somewhat slower system that can benefit more people and have lower ticket prices?Skepticism is O.K., Hyperloop\u2019s chief executive told me during our brief conversation at the event, but not cynicism. So I\u2019ll suspend mine a bit to acknowledge that Hyperloop One has achieved an incredible amount of work in a ridiculously short time. It will pain cities that have labored years to get bike lanes painted or bus stops moved to learn that a mere six months ago, this whole operation was little more than a vision. Now it\u2019s an $80 million venture with global partners.\u201cNo one comes close to our progress in commercializing this revolutionary transportation system,\u201d said Brogan BamBrogan, Hyperloop One\u2019s chief technology officer and a founder, before the test run.(That\u2019s two \u201cbros\u201d in one moniker, by the way, an effect even the scriptwriters of \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d wouldn\u2019t have gone for. Mr. BamBrogan\u2019s real first name is Kevin. This is just one of many aspects to this undertaking that makes me feel that it will all be revealed as a breathtaking piece of performance art.)I\u2019ve written in this space about the dearth of awe in infrastructure and so I\u2019ll applaud Hyperloop (again, modeling itself on Mr. Musk\u2019s media mastery) for conjuring an irresistible narrative of possibility. With Hyperloop One, nothing is deferred or delayed; these guys are in a mad rush. They\u2019re following in the product release footsteps of Apple, not the Department of Transportation. The company says that it will be moving cargo in 2019; passengers by 2021. That\u2019s three years from now.I asked Rob Lloyd, Hyperloop One\u2019s chief executive, what he was most proud of. \u201cThe speed with which the technology is being developed,\u201d he replied. \u201cWhen it works, it does change everything.\u201d\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing right now is what I saw in 1996,\u201d said Mr. Lloyd, a former president of sales and development at Cisco. \u201cWe all had I.P. routers and everything was done a certain way. At Cisco, we said, \u2018You can carry that over the Internet,\u2019 and everyone said, \u2018No.\u2019 But those high-speed networks made the Internet possible.\u201d Hyperloop, he said, \u201cwill do to the physical world what the Internet did to the digital one.\u201d\u201cGeography was our destiny, but soon you\u2019ll see opportunity democratized and communities transformed,\u201d said another founder, Shervin Pishevar, echoing the tech industry\u2019s particular skill at casting virtually any endeavor as world-changing.A compelling notion, to be sure, one that I took to heart after being exhorted after the evening event to \u201cgo grab some drinks and get a chance to interface.\u201dAllison Arieff, who specializes in architecture and design, is a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Traveler\u2019s Guide to Taking a Smartphone Abroad", "Date": "2016-05-25", "News": "Supported byTech FixThe summer travel season will soon be upon us, with notions of escape, unplugging and faraway lands.But while the idea of disconnecting from technology when abroad seems relaxing, the stress of visiting a foreign country without a smartphone connection can quickly counteract the benefits of a digital detox. After landing in an unfamiliar place, you may realize that an inability to look up mobile maps or places to eat on a phone can be crippling. Relying on a printed tourist guide may feel primitive and immediately inform muggers that you are holding lots of cash.So what to do? There are two ways to take your cellphone abroad and get data \u2014 the frugal way and the pay-full-price way. The inexpensive method involves some tinkering and planning ahead, while the full-price way is easy but requires paying even more money to your carrier.First, the full-price option. For many years, American wireless customers have been able to pay extra to their carrier for international roaming, or the ability to seamlessly use a foreign network. Among other options, AT&T sells an international package with a modest amount of data (800 megabytes, enough to last about a week) for $120, and Verizon Wireless charges $10 a day for roaming in many countries. And in recent years, T-Mobile USA and Sprint began offering free international roaming, but with a caveat: The data speeds are very slow.Toni Toikka, chief executive of Alekstra, a research firm that analyzes cellphone bills, said he finally caved in to paying AT&T an extra $120 whenever he traveled abroad after growing tired of juggling multiple cellphones and SIM cards when in Europe and New York.\u201cAfter all the frustration, they finally got me,\u201d Mr. Toikka said. Paying AT&T or Verizon some extra money is the most convenient option for taking a smartphone abroad, he said.For frugal travelers, there are some smart alternatives if they are willing to do a bit of homework.To get a good deal, bring an \u201cunlocked\u201d smartphone, which is a phone not restricted to use with one carrier, into a foreign carrier\u2019s store, buy a data package and insert its SIM card into the phone. (In wireless industry jargon, these are called prepaid international SIM cards.) Even better, some overseas carriers let you order a SIM card ahead of time so you can get it before your trip or have it delivered to your hotel.Here is a guide to taking your smartphone abroad on the cheap, including analyses by Alekstra on the costs of mobile services in five popular travel destinations: China, Japan, Britain, France and Spain.First and foremost, to use a foreign carrier\u2019s SIM card, you usually have to unlock your smartphone or buy a cheap unlocked phone. Typically, when you buy a new smartphone, it comes locked so you can use it with only one carrier. After you have fully paid off the phone, you can ask the carrier unlock it.If you get a foreign SIM card, you will be using a different phone number from your regular one. To simplify taking a smartphone abroad, we recommend ignoring traditional phone and texting services and relying on free communication services that rely purely on data connections.Apple iPhones include iMessage and FaceTime, services for sending messages and placing calls over a data connection. If someone wants to contact you, tell them to use one of those services.Once you have freed your smartphone of carrier restrictions and downloaded a messaging app, it\u2019s time to find a service package for wherever you are traveling. Mr. Toikka recommends buying service from well-known carriers in each country because they are more reliable than off-brand carriers.For China, the big carriers are China Mobile and China Unicom. Both carriers sell a package in their stores that includes one gigabyte of data for $20.40 \u2014 enough for a two-week trip.For a longer visit, you might consider the two-gigabyte package offered by both carriers for $24.90.In Japan, Mr. Toikka recommended considering the carrier eConnect. It sells a one-gigabyte package that can be used for 15 days for $25.95. For a longer visit, it offers a three-gigabyte package for $40.64 that is valid for 30 days.In Spain, Vodafone offers three cheap options in its stores. Its one-gigabyte package costs $11.20, the 1.5 gigabyte option costs $16.80, and the two-gigabyte option costs $22.40. Each of the packages works for 30 days. We would recommend the one-gigabyte option for a one-week trip, the 1.5-gigabyte package for a two- to three-week trip and the two-gigabyte option for a four-week visit.In Britain, the carrier EE offers a handful of options in its stores, including a two-gigabyte package for $21.75 and a four-gigabyte package for $36.25. Both plans are valid for 30 days.We recommend foreign SIM cards with a few caveats. If you are traveling to multiple countries \u2014 among Britain, France and Spain, for example \u2014 you will need a separate SIM card for each country, and the costs will add up quickly. In that situation, contacting AT&T and Verizon to set up international roaming or tolerating T-Mobile and Sprint\u2019s slow data speeds may be better than the extra trouble of juggling multiple SIMs.Otherwise, you can save a lot of money and get a lot more high-speed data by planning ahead and buying a foreign SIM card.Because of an editing error, an article on the Personal Tech pages on Thursday about traveling abroad with a smartphone misstated the recommended data option for visitors to Spain. It is one gigabyte for one week and 1.5 gigabytes for a two- to three-week trip, not 1.5 gigabytes for a one-week visit and two gigabytes for a two- to three-week visit.Advertisement"}

Icahn\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Keith Meister is striking the right note.Mr. Meister, founder of the activist hedge fund Corvex Management, is pushing Pandora Media, the $2.2 billion online music service, to sell itself after his firm became its largest shareholder. A costly acquisition, an abrupt leadership change and a lack of song rights suggest that Pandora is floundering. Its rivals, Spotify and Sirius XM, could make sense as partners.Pandora has two big attributes: It is easy to operate and it uses algorithms to suggest songs based on listener preferences \u2013 Grateful Dead, anyone? Pandroa, which is 16 years old, is in stiff competition with Spotify, which has more global subscribers, and deep-pocketed Apple, Amazon.com and Alphabet.Pandora weathered an increase in music-royalty fees last December, but growth in the number of users has stalled, and its stock price has fallen 21 percent since January. For the quarter ended in March, the company had fewer than 80 million active listeners, contrasted with more than 81 million in the previous quarter. It\u2019s now aiming to expand internationally by cutting deals for music rights directly with record labels and artists.Relying mainly on advertising for revenue may no longer be enough. Pandora has tried to diversify, buying the ticket purveyor Ticketfly for $450 million in November. But that business contributed only 7 percent to Pandora\u2019s first-quarter revenue of almost $300 million.The exit in March of Brian McAndrews, Pandora\u2019s chief executive, has ruffled investors even further. Replacing him with the founder Tim Westergren suggested there was serious dissension in the ranks, and the new boss quickly stopped efforts to find a possible buyer for the company.At this point, a sale might be the best outcome. Spotify, which recently raised $1 billion and faces pressure to go public, could be interested in Pandora\u2019s substantial user base and advertising sales operation. Sirius XM, a $20 billion satellite radio service, could benefit from Pandora\u2019s popularity on mobile devices. Even Apple, which is trying to make iTunes easier to use, could see a solution in Pandora\u2019s simple design.Mr. Meister argued in a letter to Pandora directors that there could be plenty of strategic buyers willing to pay a substantial premium. The board should be all ears.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Whole Foods\u2019 Scaled-Down 365 Store Has Robots, but No Tattoo Parlor", "Date": "2016-05-11", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 There\u2019s a lot riding on a robot \u2014 the teaBot, to be exact \u2014 but not for the Canadian start-up behind the machine.Rather, it is 365, the much anticipated new grocery concept from Whole Foods Markets, that is banking on the robotic kiosk and a host of other bells and whistles to reverse the company\u2019s waning fortunes. The first store, here in Silver Lake, a neighborhood in the East Side of Los Angeles, opens in two weeks.On Wednesday, Jeff Turnas, the president of 365, gave a tour of the store, which feels like a sort of foodie playroom. Shelves, racks and refrigerated cases are splashed with bright primary colors and surrounded by exposed insulation and polished concrete floors. All the fixtures are low profile \u2014 the highest shelving rises just 72 inches. Electronic terminals are lined up, ready to accept orders.Instead of a human sommelier, there\u2019s Banquet, a wine app developed especially for 365 stores by Delectable. Want a bottle of special Frankies olive oil for $9.99? The Green Gold olive oil is sold exclusively at 365. The store will also feature \u201cFlash Finds,\u201d the name for goods procured and available only temporarily.\u201cLook, we\u2019re all foodies here, we love food,\u201d Mr. Turnas said. \u201cI think that\u2019s kind of gotten lost in all the buzz about this store, which has mostly been about the business aspects.\u201dOver the last couple of years, mainstream grocers like Costco and Kroger, which have studied the Whole Foods playbook, have started to offer big selections of organic and other natural products \u2014 often at lower prices \u2014 attracting some millennials and devotees of organic and natural merchandise.Its shares are down more than half from their peak in October 2013.\u201cRight now, the legacy Whole Foods stores have difficulty attracting new customers, customers who don\u2019t already shop there,\u201d said William Kirk, an investment analyst at RBC Capital. \u201cConventional grocery stores have increased the amount of products they sell that overlap with Whole Foods and are offering them at cheaper prices.\u201dThe company has plans to open at least two other 365 locations this year. The others will be in Lake Oswego, Ore., outside Portland, and Bellevue, Wash., outside Seattle. (Whole Foods plans to open up to 25 traditional stores this year, as well.)\u201cWe\u2019re testing three different demographics to see how different customers react,\u201d said David Lannon, executive vice president for operations, in a phone call from Bellingham, Wash., where a new Whole Foods just opened. He added that the company was also opening larger Whole Foods stores that would allow it to expand higher-margin businesses, like the restaurants and bars inside its stores.Neither rumor, he says, is true.It does not have a tattoo parlor. Nor is it merely a stripped-down Whole Foods. Instead, it\u2019s more like what Old Navy is to the Gap, or Madewell to J.Crew.How is it different? The 365 stores will stock roughly 7,000 items, compared with 35,000 to 52,000 for a traditional Whole Foods. Meat is sold only in packages, lowering the cost of offering specialty cuts of meat served up by a butcher.The store will still sell a wide variety of organic produce, though its selection of conventional produce is wider. As an example of how it might keep prices lower than Whole Foods, Mr. Turnas pointed to apples.\u201cAt Whole Foods, we love big, round apples,\u201d he said. \u201cAt 365, we love apples too, and get them from the same suppliers, but they may be smaller, less beautiful.\u201dFruit is sold atop bright red fixtures straight out of the boxes and crates in which it is delivered, rather than in the handmade heaps found in a Whole Foods store.For dry goods, 365 will stock the company\u2019s private-label brand, from which it gets its name, and a few branded products, leaving the shoppers at Whole Foods to scope out the latest interesting natural and organic brands.Despite the interest in the new line of stores, Mr. Kirk of RBC Capital points out that residents of Silver Lake protested the arrival of the 365 because they wanted the traditional Whole Foods that was originally planned for the site.\u201cPeople like me think almost universally this is some kind of panicked or desperate or rushed maneuver that will cannibalize Whole Foods,\u201d Mr. Kirk said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think they\u2019re giving the company enough credit for thinking about this and planning it for a very long time.\u201dThe 365-branded locations will have about 100 employees, compared with 250 to 500 in a traditional Whole Foods.Mr. Turnas, 44, who typically has a small ponytail and wears a hooded sweatshirt and canvas Camper shoes, looks like the textbook 365 customer.

{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s $1 Billion Investment May Ease Ties With China", "Date": "2016-05-13", "News": "Supported byBut Apple\u2019s surprising interest in the company, called Didi Chuxing, and its out-of-character willingness to publicize the news Thursday evening could go a long way toward showing the Chinese government it is interested in supporting local business.More than any other major American technology company, Apple has had huge success in China. In the last fiscal year, Chinese consumers spent $59 billion on Apple products.With that success has come huge risk. In recent years, Beijing has grown more aggressive in pushing an agenda aimed at expanding local tech companies, forcing multinationals to play by its rules if they want access to China\u2019s markets.\u201cApple must be increasingly sensitive to the need to improve its government relations and to stake out a more entrenched position in the China market,\u201d said Mark Natkin, managing director of the China technology research firm Marbridge Consulting. \u201cSo making a sizable investment in a leading Chinese I.T. company will buy it a lot of good will.\u201dHe added that Apple would probably have to follow up the investment with other partnerships and spending in China if it wanted to stay in Beijing\u2019s good graces.In Apple\u2019s case, the new investment also helps it show Beijing how its operating system and iPhones are closely linked with the rise of app development within China; Didi\u2019s app, for example, is the most downloaded ride-hailing software in China.\u201cDidi exemplifies the innovation taking place in the iOS developer community in China,\u201d Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said in a news release.Many investors hoped that strong growth in China would offset some of the iPhone\u2019s deceleration. Revenue growth in the greater China region, which includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, hovered around 70 percent or more all last year. But last month the company said that quarterly sales in greater China had fallen 26 percent compared with the previous year.For Didi, the deal is a way to beef up its systems. The Chinese company serves close to 300 million users across more than 400 Chinese cities \u2014 more users than Uber \u2014 but lags technologically, analysts say.For more than a year, Apple and Didi \u2014 which share several partners, including Japan\u2019s SoftBank and Coatue \u2014 had been in contact. Apple was one of a handful of technology companies that, over the last year, Didi had talked with to better familiarize itself with the West, according to a person briefed on the deal.In April, Mr. Cook sat down for the first time with the leaders of Didi to discuss working together.In the midst of Didi\u2019s last major round of raising funds, the relationship quickly deepened, the person said. The two companies managed to close the deal with \u201clightning speed,\u201d Didi\u2019s president, Jean Liu, said in a conference call discussing the deal late Thursday.The two will work together on technology, marketing and products, Ms. Liu added.Mr. Cook has repeatedly said that Apple is looking for investment opportunities for its huge cash hoard. Apple has invested small sums in app developers before, and the company views China\u2019s app developer community as a prime source of future growth.\u201cWhat this means to me is that Apple is firmly committed to the Chinese market,\u201d said Brian Blau, an analyst with the Gartner research firm. \u201cThey are going to look at lots of opportunities.\u201dApple\u2019s move also draws it further into a Chinese market crisscrossed with competitive alliances. With the investment, Apple is now aligned with China\u2019s two largest Internet companies, Tencent and Alibaba, as a major shareholder in Didi. And Didi gained Apple as a big-name ally in its battle with Uber in China.Google\u2019s chief legal officer and head of corporate development, David Drummond, is on the board of Uber. And in 2013 Google\u2019s venture capital arm, GV, invested $258 million in Uber.But the partnership between Uber and Google has grown more distant over the past few years as both sides have independently pursued self-driving car projects. Uber has also made moves to wean itself from Google\u2019s map technology, including an acquisition of the mapping start-up deCarta.Investing in ride-hailing services gives Apple a doorway into the world\u2019s largest auto market and smartphone market by cars and phones sold, and an opportunity to better integrate its devices with cars in China. China\u2019s Internet companies are already hard at work developing driverless car technology and entertainment systems for cars, many of which are based on Google\u2019s Android software.\u201cMaybe they could be a technology supplier to Didi,\u201d Mr. Blau said. \u201cMaybe they could learn from Didi.\u201dThe auto market might be one new way that Apple can keep itself relevant to Chinese leaders who often view foreign tech firms in terms of how much utility they have in China as teachers of local companies, Mr. Natkin of Marbridge Consulting said.\u201cAs that utility wanes, the room to maneuver dwindles and the welcome mat starts to get drawn under the door,\u201d he said.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the day Apple\u2019s investment in Didi was announced. The investment was announced Thursday in the United States, not Thursday morning in China.Paul Mozur reported from Hong Kong and Mike Isaac from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "Police and Tech Giants Wrangle Over Encryption on Capitol Hill", "Date": "2016-05-08", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the district attorney of Manhattan, visited Washington late last month to argue his case on a pressing issue: encryption.\u201cI wanted to express a sense of urgency around resolution of this issue,\u201d Mr. Vance said in an interview about his Washington visit.Law enforcement officials immediately announced their support of the bill and began to push lawmakers to back it. Trade groups representing tech companies like Apple and Facebook have flooded into congressional offices, sent letters expressing concerns that the bill weakens consumer privacy and security, and delivered scorching speeches about the proposals.\u201cThis is an escalating fight,\u201d said Robert D. Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a research firm based in Washington that is funded by tech companies including Google and Microsoft. \u201cIt\u2019s become the focus now in Washington, with hearings and legislative activity.\u201dLaw enforcement officials blame tech companies for creating the impasse.\u201cThere\u2019s no question our relationship with the tech industry has gotten worse, and now it seems like the tech industry is taking every opportunity they have to put up obstacles in our way, including trying to derail legislative efforts that would give law enforcement what they need to keep people safe,\u201d said Terrence Cunningham, president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police.\u201cToday, terrorists and criminals are increasingly using encryption to foil law enforcement efforts, even in the face of a court order,\u201d Senator Feinstein said in a statement about the draft bill. \u201cWe need strong encryption to protect personal data, but we also need to know when terrorists are plotting to kill Americans.\u201dThe rhetoric in Washington around encryption has grown increasingly sharp. Last month, when the contents of the draft encryption bill were leaked, the president of the Consumer Technology Association, a trade group that counts Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon among its 4,000 members, spoke to an audience filled with government officials at a lunch hosted by the Media Institute.The bill is \u201cdangerously overreaching and technically unsophisticated,\u201d said Gary Shapiro, president of the association. \u201cThis bill would essentially make effective cybersecurity illegal in the United States, pushing companies that take cybersecurity seriously offshore.\u201dOther tech trade groups, including Reform Government Surveillance and the Business Software Alliance, have also waded into the fray, sending critical letters and meeting with senators to warn of the dangers of the bill. And Silicon Valley executives have, in increasing numbers, made the trek to Washington to make their cases directly.Bob Lord, chief information security officer at Yahoo, visited several members of Congress in late April to talk about the technology behind encryption and to warn of the \u201cunintended consequences\u201d of legislation that could weaken security. While he did not specifically mention the Burr-Feinstein bill, he emphasized how consumers and human rights activists worldwide depend on encrypted technology for their safety and privacy.\u201cThe notion that we would weaken encryption or provide back doors, those suggestions will have unintended consequences,\u201d Mr. Lord said.Law enforcement officials, in turn, have frequently met with the same lawmakers in the Senate and House intelligence, judiciary and commerce committees who are being targeted by the tech companies, according to congressional staff members. Chief Cunningham and other members of the police chiefs\u2019 group have talked with Mr. Burr and Ms. Feinstein, given opinions during the drafting of the legislation and hosted panels on encryption for House and Senate lawmakers.Tech companies have turned to certain politicians to champion their cause, such as Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon. On the day the draft encryption bill was introduced, Mr. Wyden, who voted against the 2012 copyright bills known as the Stop Online Piracy Act and the Protect Intellectual Property Act, which were also opposed by the tech industry, said he had been flooded with calls from tech companies wanting to know what he would do.Mr. Wyden said he intended to filibuster the proposal. He has since met with Intelligence Committee members to persuade them to kill the bill.\u201cI have not filibustered many issues, but I think the stakes are enormous,\u201d Mr. Wyden said in an interview. \u201cThe bill as written is a lose-lose, because it will create less security, American families will be less safe, and your liberty and privacy will be damaged.\u201dFor all the lobbying, few lawmakers have expressed their views on the encryption bill.\u201cI\u2019m reserving judgment,\u201d said Senator King, who met with Mr. Vance last month. \u201cThe issues are so complex, it\u2019s like trying to nail Jell-O to the wall.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple, Set to Move to Its Spaceship, Should Try More Moonshots", "Date": "2016-05-04", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtApple is running out of parking spaces. If you drop by its Infinite Loop headquarters, you will find the place stretched beyond capacity. Even the valets, who double and triple-park the Teslas and Porsches that now flock to the world\u2019s most valuable company, have given up finding free spots.That is still true. Several analysts project that over the next year, Apple\u2019s iPhone sales will return to slow growth rather than decline, which should keep its bottom line at its current stratospheric level.But you don\u2019t build spaceship-shaped corporate monuments on the prospect of doing just fine. The deeper question is whether Apple can keep its place as the North Star of the tech firmament. Can the company build the next great platform in computing, as it did the last one? Are its best days ahead of it, as Timothy D. Cook, the chief executive, insists \u2014 or is the new campus the capstone of an era of Apple dominance that we will never see again?I will offer a suggestion. To thrive in the next era of tech, Apple needs to take a series of bigger, bolder risks.But the next moment in tech is likely to be dominated by data-driven online services \u2014 more products like Siri and Apple Pay, fewer stand-alone hardware innovations like the iPhone.In that environment, the slow search for precision and perfection might no longer be in Apple\u2019s best interest. Mr. Cook\u2019s goal, now, should be to alter Apple\u2019s governing ethos to induce a small measure of chaos into his company.It is likely that Apple is already working on some bold plans in secret (a car and a pay TV service are among several that have long been reported). The shift I\u2019m calling for would not be radical, just evolutionary. It should be more nimble and slightly more public with its experiments, and push more of them out sooner. When it releases stuff, it should move faster to fix and improve what is wrong. Above all, it should take more risks; it should say yes more often.These changes will be difficult because they could upset Apple\u2019s customer base and its brand. Experimenting more means failing more, usually in public. Failing means looking bad, and looking bad isn\u2019t something Apple does well.In this environment, the best new products are not likely to be obvious. They will most likely be ridiculed at first and they may actually be kind of useless in early versions. But over time, with brainstorming and updates based on consumer feedback, you might discover something precious.Apple has accumulated many of the pieces to create technologies of the future. It has expertise in voice recognition, data mining, wearables, and of course, hardware and software design. Most importantly, it also has a huge installed base of users who willingly try its newest products.What it doesn\u2019t have quite yet is enough of an appetite for the speed and risks that come with creating and maintaining new services. Some of its sins here have been unforgivable. Siri was one of the earliest voice-recognition technologies released to the public. It wasn\u2019t perfect when it came out and Apple has made slow improvements over time. Today\u2019s Siri is vastly more powerful than yesterday\u2019s.But it still feels like a missed opportunity. There is so much Siri should be able to do that it cannot. Why can\u2019t Siri plug into more parts of my phone? Why can\u2019t it tap into the Uber app to call a car for me, or start up HBO Now when I say, \u201cHey, show me last week\u2019s \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019?\u201dI\u2019m not sure I quite buy Mr. Thompson\u2019s thesis about the cause of some of Apple\u2019s mistakes in its online services. It is not clear that Apple needs a wholesale restructuring rather than simply a greater push from Mr. Cook to be bolder in these products.It is important to note, too, that Apple has very patient customers and that the overall value of its ecosystem often makes up for particular deficits in some of its services. Consider Apple Music, a subscription music service that offered no great improvements over competing services like Spotify. Yet despite being late to market and not as pleasant to use as rivals, Apple Music has snapped up 13 million subscribers paying $120 a year.\u201cIt\u2019s already become a $2 billion business, and it did not exist last year,\u201d said Kulbinder Garcha, an analyst at Credit Suisse who has said that Apple can realize significant growth in its profits by creating and improving online services. If Apple moves quickly to fix some of the problems with Apple Music \u2014 cleaning up its user interface, adding handy features like Spotify\u2019s in-app lyrics browser \u2014 it could easily build on that early growth.\u201cThese things don\u2019t have to be a hit from day one, but what\u2019s important is that they keep learning from their mistakes and keep updating them,\u201d Mr. Garcha said. In other words, Be faster, take more risks, go bold.Advertisement"}

More important, can anything stop them?For one, we cannot stress enough just how well Facebook handled the broad consumer shift from using a desktop computer to get to the web to now using smartphones as our gateways to pretty much everything on the Internet. The entire industry was caught off guard by the success of iPhone and Android, and absolutely no one was prepared for how to make money on the phone.That killed \u2014 or at least deeply wounded \u2014 quite a few successful companies.

That\u2019s a shift in just a few years, and it\u2019s insane.Facebook endured, I think, because it understood that its appeal was primal and wasn\u2019t dependent on format: People wanted to see what was going on with their friends and frenemies from whatever device they used.

{"Headline": "China Quietly Targets U.S. Tech Companies in Security Reviews", "Date": "2016-05-16", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Chinese authorities are quietly scrutinizing technology products sold in China by Apple and other big foreign companies, focusing on whether they pose potential security threats to the country and its consumers and opening up a new front in an already tense relationship with Washington over digital security.Apple and other companies in recent months have been subjected to reviews that target encryption and the data storage of tech products, said people briefed on the reviews who spoke on the condition of anonymity. In the reviews, Chinese officials require executives or employees of the foreign tech companies to answer questions about the products in person, according to these people.The reviews are run by a committee associated with the Cyberspace Administration of China, the country\u2019s Internet control bureau, they said. The bureau includes experts and engineers with ties to the country\u2019s military and security agencies.While other countries, including the United States and Britain, conduct reviews of some tech products, they usually focus on products that will be used by the military or other parts of the government that are concerned with security, and not on products sold to the general public.The Chinese reviews stand out because they are being applied more broadly, including to American consumer software and gadgets popular in China, the people briefed on the reviews said. And because Chinese officials have not disclosed the nature of the checks, both the United States government and American tech companies fear that the reviews could be used to extract tech knowledge as well as ensure that the United States was not using the products to spy.Ultimately, the reviews could be used to block products without explanation or to extract trade secrets in exchange for market access. Those secrets could be leaked to Chinese competitors or expose vulnerabilities, which, in turn, Chinese hackers could exploit.Further, tech companies are concerned that the reviews could set a precedent and that other countries will follow suit, each demanding different checks that would not only be costly but also put the companies at risk of having to hand over further secrets in exchange for market access.China and the United States have been embroiled in a quarrel about tech and security that has strained their relationship. The reviews could be a fresh sticking point, raising questions about the security of American technology and the degree to which American companies will acquiesce to Beijing\u2019s demands for fear of being punished in a huge market still partly controlled by the state.Chinese officials have not formally disclosed that they are conducting the reviews, and their existence has not been previously confirmed outside of rare, brief mentions in local news media.It is not clear specifically what Chinese authorities are demanding as part of the process. There is no indication that foreign companies have provided access to highly guarded material such as source code \u2014 the digital underpinnings of software \u2014 or other commercial secrets.The lack of disclosure by China\u2019s government has made it hard for the United States government to voice its objections, and has fed concerns that China is quietly carrying out further policies to target American technology companies.China\u2019s Internet regulators suggested the possibility of reviews three years ago, after revelations by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, concerning surveillance escalated tensions between China and the United States over computer security.Since then, China has quietly begun carrying out the reviews. That represents a shift in the way China manages foreign technology. Its previous efforts came through proposed new rules and other public measures that let foreign companies and governments resist.China relies on American technology products, even as it has made clear that it is concerned about the security of those products. A majority of Chinese government offices, state-owned enterprises and other institutions that handle potentially secret information, like universities and research institutes, use Microsoft Windows. Most smartphones in China run software made by either Apple or Google. And the high-end computing that supports China\u2019s banks, energy companies and military uses, in part, American-designed chips and servers.China\u2019s tougher tone is part of a broader challenge that governments around the world are posing to the technology industry over issues like privacy and encryption. In the United States, federal law enforcement officials have pressed Apple to help them gain access to encrypted iPhones even as the Obama administration has resisted Chinese policies that would require similar access.Under President Xi Jinping, China has taken steps to keep tabs on technology from American companies and reduce the nation\u2019s dependence on it.For foreign companies, the other option could be worse.\u201cOne viewpoint holds that we must close ourselves off, make a fresh start, thoroughly shake off our reliance on foreign technology and rely on indigenous innovation to pursue development,\u201d Mr. Xi said, according to a transcript of the speech. \u201cOtherwise, we would always follow in the footsteps of others, and would never be able to catch up.\u201dMr. Xi ultimately said China must find a middle ground and determine \u201cwhich things can be imported but have to be secure and controllable; which things may be imported, digested and absorbed for re-innovation; which things can be developed in collaboration with others; and for which things we must rely on our own strength and indigenous innovation.\u201dWhile details on the tech reviews are scant, commentary from the state-run China Daily in 2014 suggested that companies affected could include Cisco Systems and Microsoft. Other state news media has said the reviews will prevent product suppliers from \u201cillegally controlling, interfering in or interrupting user systems, or illegally collecting, storing, handling or exploiting information about users.\u201dCisco and Microsoft declined to comment on the Chinese media statements. Apple also declined to comment.\u201cAs the world connects to the Internet, various forms of attacks and new defensive technologies are ever multiplying, bringing challenges to China\u2019s development of a new digital industry,\u201d the group said.Paul Mozur reported from Hong Kong and Jane Perlez from Beijing.

Public company filings show that Xintong Tiandi was set up in 2011.It may matter, because iPhones went on sale in China in 2009 amid frenzied scenes.

Apple has said it will appeal to the Supreme People\u2019s Court.Whatever rights the Russian company had or didn\u2019t have are what Xintong Tiandi bought, Mr. Dresden said. \u201cFor better or worse that\u2019s what they purchased,\u201d he added. \u201cIn the logic of how the Chinese trademark system works, it makes sense that it should be viewed as what was the state of the world at the time that it was filed.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t see this as the Chinese court being biased; I see it as them enforcing the trademark law as it is currently implemented,\u201d Mr. Dresden wrote later in an email.Here\u2019s the wild-goose chase: Calls to the Beijing Higher People\u2019s Court seeking clarification on the ruling went unanswered over the course of a recent afternoon, and no fax number could be located for the court.A person answering the telephone at the media office of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, which oversees the Trademark Review and Adjudication Board that first ruled in favor of Xintong Tiandi in the case in 2013, berated a reporter who said she was from The New York Times: \u201cWhat question do you have? Can you speak?\u201d When the reporter said she had been unable to send a fax to the office, the man said: \u201cI only heard the fax machine beeping; how would I know who that was from and what it was about?\u201dWhen the reporter said she may file a complaint for rudeness, he replied: \u201cYou said you want to file a complaint, go file a complaint!\u201d The man hung up without giving his name.Mr. Xiong, Xintong Tiandi\u2019s lawyer, explained the omission of the Russian ownership detail thus: The court was not obliged to recap the entire history of the case in the ruling.He rejected what he said were unfair remarks by \u201csome foreign media\u201d that the court\u2019s decision showed the Chinese judicial system was not to be trusted. \u201cFairness cannot be judged based on whether one has won or lost, but should be based on whether there are problems in the procedures,\u201d Mr. Xiong said.It\u2019s not the first time that Xintong Tiandi has clashed with Apple over trademarks. Apple had \u201cprevailed in several other cases against Xintong\u201d for similar issues, Carolyn Wu, an Apple spokeswoman, said in a statement.Whether that\u2019s a stumbling block or a solution, readers can decide.Vanessa Piao contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

But he went on to say that law-enforcement officers cannot \u201cobtain an order that constrains the freedom of service providers to disclose information to their customers without making a particularized showing of need.\u201dA handful of cases have emerged in recent months laying bare the tensions between the government\u2019s desire to conduct criminal inquiries, sometimes secretly, and the rights of companies like Facebook to have autonomy over their businesses.In the case of Facebook, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn sought to cloak the existence of the subpoenas under the Stored Communications Act, which grants courts the power to prohibit tech companies from revealing the receipt of various government orders, like warrants or subpoenas, in order to protect the covert nature of criminal probes.Judge Orenstein wrote that the prosecutors had submitted 15 separate sealed requests to him, each bearing the title: \u201cApplication for order commanding [service provider] not to notify any person of the existence of subpoena.\u201dThe requests, all filed in Brooklyn, asked for permission to bar Facebook from mentioning the subpoenas to anyone except its lawyers out of a fear that the targets of the secret investigations might get wind of them and either flee or tamper with evidence.Judge Orenstein\u2019s ruling did not reveal the information the government wanted from Facebook. It also left open the possibility that he would agree to impose gag orders on Facebook if the prosecutors could convince him with more details.Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the ruling.The policy states that as Facebook receives requests from the police or other agencies, it vets them to establish whether they are within the bounds of the law and how compelling they are.

{"Headline": "How I Learned to Love Snapchat", "Date": "2016-05-18", "News": "Supported byOn TechnologyIn the mid-\u201980s, a German engineer named Friedhelm Hillebrand helped devise a way for cellphones to send and receive text messages. Back then, mobile bandwidth was extremely limited, which meant that the messages needed to be as lightweight as possible. The story goes that Hillebrand experimented with a variety of greetings and phrases and concluded, in very German fashion, that most things that needed saying could be done so in an economical 160 characters or fewer. \u201cThis is perfectly sufficient,\u201d he said of his findings. Eventually the infrastructure improved so that there were no limits to how much text we could transmit at once. And by 2007, texting had surpassed voice calls as the preferred, if not default, mode of communication.As most rapid advances in technol\u00adogy tend to do, this transition inspired a low-grade, intergenerational moral panic. Many feared that we would become asocial creatures, misanthropes who would rather hide behind the safety of a screen than face the intimacy of a spoken conversation. And maybe there\u2019s some truth in that, but there\u2019s another way of looking at it. Maybe we didn\u2019t hate talking \u2014 just the way older phone technologies forced us to talk. Texting freed a generation from the strictures and inconvenience (and awkwardness) of phone calls, while allowing people to be more loosely and constantly connected.I thought about this shift recently when trying to make sense of the rise of Snapchat, the latest wellspring of techno\u00adsocial hand-wringing. Like texting, Snapchat flourished amid scarcity, though of an entirely different kind. We no longer live in Hillebrand\u2019s era, when there were hard limits on how much we could say over text; but words alone can be an imperfect technology. So much of what we mean lies not just in what we say, or in the exact words we choose, but also in the light that animates our eyes (or doesn\u2019t) when we de\u00ad\u00adliver them and the sharpness (or softness) of the tone we use. Text barely captures even a fraction of that emotional depth and texture, even when we can type as much as we want. Snapchat is just the latest and most well realized example of the various ways we are regaining the layers of meaning we lost when we began digitizing so many important interactions.Most efforts to approximate normal human behavior in software tend to be creepy or annoying. The oblong gray bubble that pops up when your conversation partner is typing (officially called the \u201ctyping awareness indicator\u201d) is no doubt intended to be helpful, the virtual version of watching someone inhale and then part their lips to speak. But it becomes panic-inducing if it appears and then disappears \u2014 an indication that someone wrote something, then, for any number of reasons, deleted it. Similarly, \u201cread\u201d receipts, designed to let you know that someone opened and read your message, are perhaps best at letting you know when you\u2019re being ignored. In a strange turn of events, texting has evolved to become almost as awkward as the phone calls it made obsolete.This is not to say that text is irredeemable. A significant humanization of our text interactions happened quietly in 2011, when emoji were introduced as part of an Apple iOS software update. They offered a palette of punctuation that clari\u00adfied intent. Tacking on emoji like hearts, skulls, grins and bugged-out eyes to a short message made it infinitely easier to confidently project sarcasm, humor, grief and love across a medium that had been, until then, emotionally arid. If you want proof that we see ourselves in the emoji we use, consider the ever-present disputes over emoji inclusivity: Initially, the characters all had the same skin tone, and even now, the only \u201cprofessional\u201d emoji are male. And though the catalog of emoji has expanded in response to user demand, it still struggles to keep up with the multiplicity of human experiences. As a result, a new bespoke-emoji economy has begun to emerge, in apps like Bitmoji, which let people create personalized avatars to adorn their text messages. If our emoji couldn\u2019t become us, we would become our emoji.But messages that include little actual messaging seem to be the wave of the future, and Snapchat is leading the way. The app, which allows users to send short videos and images that disappear after a short period of time, is intimate by design, something that sets it apart from its social-media peers. Most of the \u201csnaps\u201d I send and receive are tightly framed, with angles that could be considered unflattering. They\u2019re low resolution too, the images speckled with grain. Snapchat does have filters, but the dumb ones are the most fun, especially the ones that add a comically hideous effect \u2014 bloating your face into a red tomato, or distorting it into an animal mask.If we are to believe the theories about how people want to communicate nowadays \u2014 largely through anesthetized, hypermediated and impersonal ex\u00ad\u00adchanges \u2014 Snapchat\u2019s recent surge in popularity makes little sense. During the first few years of Snapchat\u2019s existence, the only people I knew using the service (beyond journalists like me who were trying to understand it) were my youngest relatives, still in high school and college. And of course there was the attendant moral panic: When it first blew up around 2012, the press seemed to assume it would primarily be used by horny teenagers swapping nudes.If that was ever the case, it has since expanded. Each time I check the app, I\u2019m surprised to see who else in my network has started using the service. My circle includes every demographic, age and locale: co-workers who send snaps of their dogs, friends on strange adventures in the desert, people I talk to mostly online sending videos from their travels. The videos are rarely elaborate: just a few seconds of my favorite people\u2019s faces on a large screen, smiling, or singing, or showing off their view, before they fade and disappear.Its entire aesthetic flies in the face of how most people behave on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter \u2014 as if we\u2019re waiting to be plucked from obscurity by a talent agent or model scout. But Snapchat isn\u2019t the place where you go to be pretty. It\u2019s the place where you go to be yourself, and that is made easy thanks to the app\u2019s inbuilt ephemerality. Away from the fave-based economies of mainstream social media, there\u2019s less pressure to be dolled up, or funny. For all the advances in tech that let us try on various guises to play around with who we are, it seems that we just want new ways to be ourselves. As it turns out, the mundanity of our regular lives is the most captivating thing we could share with one another.Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Everything Wrestling?", "Date": "2016-05-27", "News": "Supported byNotebookAs for Trump \u2014 whose campaign theatrics feel like a one-man show, and whose history as a registered Democrat can make his contorted appeals to the far right seem like put-ons \u2014 well, not for nothing is there a conspiratorial segment insisting that his candidacy is a winking performance, which will eventually end with the admission that he may have laid it on a little thick.The process of shaping a story by taking all these layers into account seems dangerously similar to what corporations do when they talk about \u201ctelling the story of our brand\u201d \u2014 only as applied to real people and real events, instead of mascots and promotional stunts. On a spiritual level, it seems distasteful to imagine a living person as a piece being moved around on a narrative chessboard, his every move calculated to advance a maximally entertaining story line. But this is how it all too often works \u2014 whether plotted by the public figures themselves or by some canny handler (an adviser, a producer, a PR rep), everyone is looking to sculpt the narrative, to add just the right finishing touch.So when I think of how politics and pop culture are often compared to wrestling, this is the element that seems most transferable: not the outlandish characters or the jumbo-size threats, but the insistence on telling a great story with no regard for the facts. Donald Trump can claim there were thousands of Muslims in New Jersey cheering when the World Trade Center came down. Bill Clinton can lend weight to the myth of pedantic Bernie Bros overwhelming our national political discourse. Michael Jordan can say he was cut from his varsity basketball team, but was driven enough to overcome the slight. Kim Kardashian can say she married Kris Humphries for love, not ratings. Chance the Rapper can brand himself as an independent, unsigned artist, even though his last two mixtapes were released exclusively through Apple, the 12th-largest corporation in the world. And the WWE can honor the recently deceased wrestling star Chyna as a trailblazer, even though it blacklisted her for an entire decade. Each of these doctored realities is close enough, a problem only for pedants.You can be dismayed with all of this for reasons that go deeper than taste. When everything becomes a story, the value of concrete truth seems diminished. There\u2019s too much going on in the world to dive this deep into something as frivolous as entertainment, you might say. Worse still, you can begin to treat politics \u2014 the hammer and forge of our national reality \u2014 as a similar form of \u201cshow.\u201d Sure, seeking out entertainment is a perfectly human impulse; it feels joyless to sharpen yourself into a hypervigilant instrument, ever ready to poke a hole in these swelling mythologies; we all know those people, who are no fun. But when we feel ourselves becoming too consumed with mastering the language of whatever unreality is currently holding our gaze, it might not hurt to consider the overarching forces subtly directing our attention and prepare ourselves to step back if we\u2019re not comfortable with benefiting less than they do.And ultimately, we can\u2019t expect that post-truth culture will somehow collapse because of its perfidiousness. The WWE, for instance, now tells its story without challenge: It\u2019s outlasted all its major competitors and holds the rights to the very images wrestling\u2019s history is made of. Its version of wrestling is the accepted reality of 2016, even when that version is drastically different, and maybe even worse, than the reality of wrestling\u2019s old-school rough-and-tumble days. If a story is told well, if its history seems consistent, then the machinations putting it into place can be temporarily overlooked or turned into a fun story of their own. And why not? In the end, we\u2019re all marks for a world we want to believe in.Jeremy Gordon is a writer and editor in Brooklyn.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Cheery Elevator Ride With Larry Page", "Date": "2016-05-20", "News": "Supported byBitsOn Thursday I stepped into an elevator at the federal courthouse in San Francisco, smack into Larry Page and his retinue. Mr. Page is the chief executive of Alphabet, the parent company of Google. We were headed to the same court.Oracle Corporation is suing Google for copyright violations that could cost Alphabet $9 billion. Considering the sum, Mr. Page seemed pretty jolly while on his way into court.The copyright concerns Android, the operating system now used in 84 percent of the world\u2019s smartphones. One of those phones was in Mr. Page\u2019s hands, and he showed his crew a photo of a quote from the writer Jill Lepore: \u201cI Google, therefore I am not.\u201dNot a bad joke. Even Mr. Page\u2019s personal assistant laughed.In part, this is the theater of the law. On the witness stand, Mr. Page was a less voluble man, uncertain and disputative in the face of questioning by an attorney for Oracle. In earlier testimony, Safra Catz, the steely co-chief executive of Oracle, appeared more sad than incensed at Google\u2019s behavior.But then there are the facts obscured or omitted in the trial. Much of both sides\u2019 story, for example, involves the collapse of Sun Microsystems, the inventor of the open-source Java code used in Android, which Oracle acquired in 2010. Neither side, however, talks about how Linux, another open-source project, was the real undoing of Sun. Linux was also one reason Google was able to get big so fast.If there are differing views on open source at the two companies, it has much to do with two different generations of software makers, which were essentially divided by the Linux experience. In life, if not in law, such context matters.There are other such omissions in this history. Like friendship: Sun was co-founded by Scott McNealy, a friend of Lawrence J. Ellison, the co-founder of Oracle. Mr. McNealy long disparaged Linux, before making a late-stage conversion that did not save his company.Though, as Ms. Lepore notes, being human may be changing as we move under the dominion of data.Advertisement"}

He figured he would never see it again.But sometimes our devices aren\u2019t ready to say goodbye.While Mr. Bonnie, an investment banker with Allen & Company, continued on his way to the Bahamas for a few days of relaxation, his iPad began a strange odyssey of its own, turning Mr. Bonnie into a digital gumshoe and the narrator of a personal thriller that played out on Facebook, to the delight of his online friends.\u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m definitely going to lose my iPad, but I\u2019m going to have some fun,\u2019\u201d Mr. Bonnie said in a phone interview.When Mr. Bonnie discovered the iPad was missing after he left the Fort Lauderdale airport, he turned on Find My iPhone and saw that his tablet was at Elvis Presley\u2019s Heartbreak Hotel at Graceland \u2014 in Memphis. The app represented the location of the device as a glowing green circle on an aerial map outside the hotel, with its distinctive heart-shaped pool.His best guess was that he had lost the iPad in the airport when he was stuffing a travel pillow back into his carry-on bag and that the device was now in the company of another traveler who had picked it up.That person had apparently decided not to turn in the device to the lost-and-found department at the airport. Through Find My iPhone, Mr. Bonnie sent a message, visible on the lock screen of the iPad, telling whoever had the device to call his cellphone for a reward. No one did.Over the next few days, Mr. Bonnie began providing regular updates on the iPad\u2019s whereabouts to his friends on Facebook, providing screen shots from Find My iPhone that showed the device headed to downtown Memphis and at the Links at Riverside, a golf course. \u201cIPad is on the move,\u201d one of his updates said.Most of his posts got more than 100 likes on Facebook and dozens of comments, as Mr. Bonnie\u2019s online acquaintances became more engaged in the story.\u201cPlease keep your fans informed as to the results of the mystery,\u201d one commenter said.By coincidence, Mr. Bonnie nearly bumped into his iPad on a short layover from the Bahamas. As he waited at Concourse C at the Fort Lauderdale airport for a flight back to his home in San Francisco, he saw on Find My iPhone that his iPad was on an airplane approaching Concourse C.He quickly located the gate for an Allegiant Air flight arriving from Memphis and looked over the passengers disembarking from the plane.He remembered he could use Find My iPhone to trigger a distress signal on his iPad. He activated the feature, but heard no sound. He told his Facebook fans he was within 100 feet of the iPad.\u201cThis is better than \u2018Game of Thrones,\u2019\u201d one commented.He concluded that the iPad must have been inside checked luggage that never entered the terminal. By the time he got to the correct baggage carousel the iPad had left the airport.Mr. Bonnie saw an opportunity for mischief when the iPad finally seemed to stay put in a residential neighborhood in Miami Lakes, a suburb of Miami. On a map, it looked like a nice home with a swimming pool, Mr. Bonnie said.He boarded his plane to San Francisco, ordered in-flight Wi-Fi access and spent $50 to have five Mylar balloons delivered to the house the next morning. On the card, he listed the occasion as \u201cThinking of You.\u201d\u201cFriendly yet slightly creepy enough for them to want that iPad out of their house,\u201d one of his Facebook friends said.A voice mail message left by a reporter for the phone number associated with the Miami Lakes address was not returned.The balloons appeared to have an effect. The next morning the iPad was on the move again \u2014 back to the Fort Lauderdale airport. Mr. Bonnie, in San Francisco, was watching the device traveling on the map when it occurred to him that whoever had it might be taking it to the airport\u2019s lost and found.He went to the airport\u2019s website and began filling out a missing item claim form when his phone rang. It was someone from lost and found.\u201cAs described by lost and found when they called a second ago, a fairly elderly woman came in a few minutes ago and said she had gotten the balloons and thought it would be a good idea to return the iPad to the airport,\u201d Mr. Bonnie wrote in a Facebook post. \u201cShe said to thank me for the balloons, but she didn\u2019t really want to call.\u201d\u201cBetter than \u2018Serial,\u2019\u201d a friend commented on Facebook. \u201cBetter than \u2018This American Life.\u2019 Better than everything.\u201dMr. Bonnie paid to have his iPad shipped home by UPS.

Let the Battle Begin.", "Date": "2016-05-18", "News": "Supported byTech FixWhat do Home and Echo have in common?Home and Echo are both speakers that require a wired power connection. They stream music and perform tasks like web searches, adding calendar appointments and looking up movie showtimes over an Internet connection.What are the differences between Google Home and Amazon Echo?Google has yet to share many important details, including a price tag, about Google Home, which is scheduled for release this fall. However, from the announcement we can glean a few differences:Home, which can easily be held in one hand, is shorter and more compact than Echo.Both speakers have a cylindrical shape, but the top of Home is slanted downward, whereas Echo\u2019s top is flat. Google is allowing consumers to choose from different colors for the bottom part of Home, while Echo comes only in black. (Amazon also sells a smaller voice-controlled speaker called Tap.)Most important, the brains of Home will be Google\u2019s virtual assistant, which draws from Google\u2019s extensive search database, whereas Echo relies on Alexa, Amazon\u2019s assistant. In other words, consumers can expect voice commands that already work with Google\u2019s assistant to work with Google Home.Is Home smarter than Echo?Thanks to Home\u2019s reliance on Google\u2019s search engine, it will probably be a smarter speaker than the Echo when it comes to basic tasks like web searches and looking up traffic data. However, when it comes to actions offered by outside companies \u2014 like the ability to order a pizza from a restaurant or to set your Internet-connected thermostat \u2014 Home\u2019s success will depend largely on whether Google persuades third-party developers to create tasks that work with it.\u201cTo do this well we really need to work with developers and third parties so we can provide these actions to our users,\u201d said Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, during his announcement of Home.By contrast, Amazon has already made great progress with third-party developers for Echo. Alexa is capable of summoning an Uber car, ordering a pizza from Domino\u2019s, controlling smart light bulbs and much more. Time will tell which company\u2019s speaker gets more third-party support, but Echo, which was released last June, has a major head start.What is Google\u2019s assistant?Here\u2019s where things get confusing. Google is referring to the virtual-assistant portion of its search product as \u201cassistant.\u201d Previously it was called Google Now, and later it was renamed to just Google.The problem was that many consumers had trouble distinguishing Google search from its virtual assistant because the assistant lacked a friendly name like Siri or Alexa. The difference now, Google says, is that its assistant is more capable of being naturally conversational than other assistants. Adding to the confusion: Google\u2019s assistant is what comes with Google Home and Allo, the new messaging app. But you won\u2019t summon it by saying \u201cGoogle assistant.\u201d You\u2019ll just say \u201cGoogle.\u201dWhat is Allo?Allo is Google\u2019s forthcoming messaging app, which has Google\u2019s assistant built into it. Inside the app, you will be able to type \u201c@google\u201d and say conversational things like \u201cLet\u2019s go out for some Italian food.\u201d Google will then respond with some suggestions for tables to reserve at Italian restaurants using, for example, the OpenTable app.What\u2019s more, you will be able to have conversations with friends and type \u201c@google\u201d with questions or requests inside those conversations; all people in the conversation will see how Google\u2019s assistant responds.

Probably he finds it a bit more of a quieter lifestyle than the hustle and bustle of the city,\u201d said Leslie Vadasz, a retired Intel executive whose 200-acre estate is next door to Casa Rosa. The two have become friendly, but there are some topics that are still off limits, it seems.\u201cIn a way, he was quite a pioneer on Wall Street,\u201d Mr. Vadasz said in a recent interview, seated in the spacious living room of his own hillside mansion. \u201cBut when I mentioned it, either Sandy or Joan said, \u2018Look what happened.\u2019 He was not particularly happy about it.\u201d Mr. Weill does not appear to enjoy discussing the topic, Mr. Vadasz added. \u201cThere are subjects that I don\u2019t poke at and he doesn\u2019t volunteer.\u201dIn an interview in an office he keeps in New York, where he still spends a quarter of his time, Mr. Weill acknowledged that the fate of Citigroup, and the role of giant banks in the financial crisis of 2008, do not get discussed much out West.Explaining the couple\u2019s move, Mr. Weill said, \u201cThe two most interesting places in the U.S. are New York City and the Bay Area, and we spent more than 50 years of our married life in New York.\u201d He added that the draws to the San Francisco Bay Area are the exciting innovation and entrepreneurship there, as well as the weather, the food and wine, and the lack of concrete.In recent years, the couple has retired from board leadership roles at three New York institutions they continue to back: Weill Cornell medical school, Carnegie Hall and the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. But until the latest gift was announced, few New Yorkers familiar with Mr. Weill\u2019s storied Wall Street history knew that they had moved.In his heyday in the 1990s, Mr. Weill was \u201ca Sun King \u2014 one of the most powerful and successful financial individuals in New York,\u201d said Roy Smith, a finance professor at New York University business school. Mr. Weill gained that status as a deal maker, with a series of ever-larger mergers culminating with Citicorp and the Travelers Group forming the behemoth Citigroup in 1998. The last deal helped knock down the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act, which separated banking from the riskier securities business.But then he and Citigroup suffered a series of setbacks. He stepped down as Citigroup\u2019s chief executive in 2003, a few months after a bruising regulatory probe of biased Wall Street research uncovered his personal efforts to get the star telecommunications analyst Jack Grubman to reconsider a tepid neutral rating on AT&T stock at a time when AT&T\u2019s chief executive was a Citigroup director; though Mr. Weill was not charged, Citigroup paid the largest fine of any Wall Street company.And he and Citigroup were cited as contributors to the 2008 financial crisis by Time magazine and the Oscar-winning documentary \u201cInside Job.\u201d Knocking down Glass-Steagall helped spawn \u201cswollen banks\u201d that \u201care now one of the country\u2019s major economic problems,\u201d Time said, noting that Citigroup itself required multiple government rescues costing $45 billion. In 2010 testimony before a congressional panel investigating the meltdown, Mr. Weill minimized the role of Glass-Steagall\u2019s repeal, saying it \u201chad nothing to do with the financial crisis.\u201dWhen he retired as Citigroup chairman in 2006, Mr. Weill held 16.6 million Citigroup shares, then worth $768 million. At his peak in 2007, Forbes listed his net worth at $1.8 billion. But the stock lost more than 90 percent of its value after his handpicked successor allowed Citigroup to build up a huge exposure to toxic subprime assets.Sensitive to his image, cultivated through business success, philanthropy and a penchant for putting the Weill name on buildings and institutions, Mr. Weill \u201cmay feel somewhat diminished,\u201d said Mr. Smith of N.Y.U. But Mr. Weill says New York \u201ccontinues to be very welcoming to us.\u201d And he disputed suggestions advanced by two friends in interviews that the move west was motivated partly to get away from \u201call the noise around Citi.\u201dMike Conway, Mr. Weill\u2019s chief of staff, said, \u201cThe Weills are not running away from anything. They are just trying to expand their horizons.\u201dMs. Weill said the couple often enjoyed time they spent on business trips to Carmel, Calif., and once considered buying \u201ca pink house\u201d there but decided it would be \u201ca pain in the neck\u201d to get back and forth while he was still working full time. The idea of the Bay Area came back in mid-2010 during a trip to Napa Valley. She recalls saying, \u201cGee, it\u2019s really nice here. Maybe we should think about this.\u201dIn 2011, Mr. Weill sold his 10-room apartment at 15 Central Park West for $88 million. In 2012, he sold a 200-foot yacht for about $50 million. He has held on to a 12-room mansion in Greenwich, Conn., plus spreads in the Adirondacks and Bahamas. But nowadays, friends say, when he spends the night in Manhattan, he usually stays at a hotel.Sonoma, population 11,000 and situated 40 miles north of San Francisco, stands apart from Silicon Valley to the south, which teems with venture capital investors, start-ups and technology juggernauts like Apple and Facebook. The Weill estate is a few miles to the west of town, reachable via roads dotted with rusting pickup trucks, a Jack in the Box fast-food franchise and a furniture consignment store.Going to California helped Mr. Weill \u201crestart the clock,\u201d said Mr. Banga, who hosted an informal 83rd birthday celebration for Mr. Weill in March at a New York restaurant. \u201cHe\u2019s a good guy. He\u2019s gone through a lot, good and bad. I\u2019ve heard him say you have to go through bad experiences to learn how to handle them and come out of them so you can better deal with the good times.\u201dMichael de la Merced contributed reportingAdvertisement"}

The iPhone brand signals middle- or even upper-class status in China, and many are expected to be willing to pay for a passport cover or other item labeled with the Apple product\u2019s name as a way to show that they have made it.The iPhone ruling, in a high court in the Beijing municipality, is just one of a spate of high-profile trademark and piracy cases in China. The country\u2019s huge number of factories, bolstered by a 100 million-strong class of migrant workers, has made China the workshop of the world, able, among other activities, to quickly pump out products that can make a company a quick profit on the impulse to imitate.Advertisement"}

Google wants to add artificial intelligence to just about every digital experience we have, a goal that I think will make computers far easier to use. Does all this make you happy?Anyway, Google\u2019s Home device really cemented the idea that everyone is duking it out for control over the living room these days.

{"Headline": "Automakers Befriend Start-Ups Like Uber, Girding Against a Changing Car Culture", "Date": "2016-05-24", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Automakers are looking toward a technology-driven future, one where they increasingly acknowledge that getting around may not require owning a car.The alliances are the latest in a string of pairings between technology companies and traditional automakers that are scrambling to reposition themselves. For decades, automakers had abided by the well-worn formula of making bigger and more powerful cars to fuel their growth.But start-ups like Uber and Lyft and technology companies like Google and Tesla have disrupted that cadence. These companies, mostly located in Silicon Valley, have in the last few years sped the development of self-driving cars, electric vehicles and ride services.Automakers have become increasingly concerned about those technologies and their potential to help people travel easily and cheaply without owning a car \u2014 or even without knowing how to drive.In some American cities, small groups of people are already choosing not to own cars by relying on ride-hailing services like Uber, through which consumers can order a ride through their smartphone, and car-sharing companies like Zipcar, where they essentially pick up a car whenever they need to drive one. Eventually, self-driving cars will be a reality, which would let Uber and others field fleets of driverless vehicles that can operate around the clock and further cut the cost of ride services.Karl Brauer, an analyst at the research firm Kelley Blue Book, said there was no sign that car-sharing or ride-sharing \u2014 sometimes called \u201cmobility services\u201d \u2014 was slowing auto sales today. Auto sales in the United States hit a record high in 2015 and are on the rise this year, and China and other international markets will ensure the global auto market continues to grow.Nevertheless, auto companies are investing in companies like Uber \u201cto be ahead of the curve\u201d if they do shake up car ownership down the road, Mr. Brauer said. \u201cHistory has shown that if you wait for the market to decide, you\u2019re dead,\u201d he said.Last June, Uber said it had approximately 20,000 regular drivers in the Chinese city of Chengdu alone, on par with the approximately 22,000 drivers in San Francisco and 26,000 in New York at the time.Toyota said that in its work with Uber, the companies would also cooperate on trials in countries where ride-hailing is growing.The companies also plan to develop in-car apps that support Uber drivers, and to share their knowledge and research, they said.Next month, Volkswagen is supposed to detail a plan to buy back or repair about 500,000 diesel models that had the cheating software and were sold in the United States.About the same time, Volkswagen is also planning to unveil a \u201cStrategy 2025\u201d in which mobility initiatives will play major roles. In April, Volkswagen said it intended to set up a separate mobility company to oversee investments and initiatives on this front.\u201cWe aim to become a world leading mobility provider by 2025,\u201d Matthias M\u00fcller, chief executive of Volkswagen, said in a statement.Shahar Waiser, Gett\u2019s chief executive, stressed the synchronicity his company had with Volkswagen\u2019s European sales, and how the companies were focused on both consumer and business clients. Mr. Waiser said Gett had $500 million in revenue, 30 percent of which came from the company\u2019s 4,000 corporate and business clients, and that it was profitable in some markets.Gett, which is popular in more than 60 European cities, as well as Moscow and New York, said it planned to use the capital to continue expanding its European operations.\u201cBy now, people realize that the landscape is so big \u2014 and every market is so different \u2014 there will be more than a monopoly or a duopoly,\u201d Mr. Waiser said. \u201cYou will always see two, maybe three major players in this space, wherever you go.\u201dMike Isaac reported from San Francisco, and Neal E.

{"Headline": "Fitbit Strives to Escape the Shadow of Apple", "Date": "2016-05-02", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Earlier this year, Fitbit invited guests to a Las Vegas hotel to witness something that it promised would \u201cignite the world of health and fitness.\u201dThe event, held during the International CES in January, was intended to make a splash for the wearable tech company\u2019s new product, the Blaze, a $200 smartwatch that measures a wearer\u2019s steps, heart rate and sleep.\u201cI was going in thinking, \u2018This is going to be awesome,\u2019\u201d James Park, Fitbit\u2019s chief executive, said of the Blaze introduction in an interview last month. \u201cI was definitely pretty surprised when I looked at some of the aftermath of it.\u201dThe reaction to the Blaze encapsulates the predicament facing Fitbit, the young company that has been a leader in wearable technology: In many people\u2019s eyes, it lives in the shadow of Apple, the Silicon Valley behemoth whose touch-screen smartwatch could potentially stomp its smaller rival out of existence.This even though Fitbit has been trying to do everything right \u2014 and has largely succeeded.Yet the fact that Fitbit\u2019s products focus on one thing \u2014 tracking your fitness \u2014 is not helping the company\u2019s image in this era of Swiss Army knife devices, where products like the iPhone and Apple Watch can do multiple things. History has been unkind to single-purpose gadgets, many of which have flopped, like Cisco\u2019s Flip camcorder, or have struggled, like the action camera from GoPro.As a result, Fitbit\u2019s stock has fallen about 10 percent since it went public last June. \u201cThere were concerns around competition, particularly from Apple,\u201d Katy Huberty, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said of investor skepticism around Fitbit.Mr. Park said \u201cit actually does not bother me at all\u201d when people frequently compare his company to Apple. He said the Apple Watch serves a different market than Fitbit\u2019s $60 to $250 accessories that focus on health monitoring.\u201cWe look at it from a consumer point of view,\u201d Mr. Park said. Apple Watch \u201cis a computing platform, but that\u2019s really the wrong way to approach this category from the very beginning.\u201dAn Apple spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment.Indisputably, Fitbit is growing, both in staff and sales. At the company\u2019s San Francisco headquarters, a timeline on the wall in the fifth-floor hallway illustrates the firm\u2019s history. In 2007, when Mr. Park, a Harvard dropout who had worked on photo-sharing software, founded Fitbit with his business partner Eric N. Friedman, who is now Fitbit\u2019s chief of technology, the start-up had just two employees. By 2015, it had 1,101.Inside the offices, furnished in midcentury modern style, employees are constantly shuffling in and out of conference rooms for meetings. On a recent visit, a group of new hires was touring the headquarters.Still, a concern among investors is whether Fitbit can extract more money from existing customers. Most of its sales are from people who buy Fitbit devices for the first time, not those who upgrade.In addition, many people may end up leaving their Fitbit devices in a drawer. Of those who bought a Fitbit device in 2015, 28 percent stopped using it by the end of the year, according to the company.\u201cThat means that many people who buy Fitbits don\u2019t use them for long, and presumably aren\u2019t going to buy another Fitbit device,\u201d said Jan Dawson, an independent technology analyst. \u201cThey have to constantly find new people to sell Fitbits to, whereas most consumer electronics companies can rely on a good amount of repeat business.\u201dAddressing some of these concerns falls partly to Woody Scal, Fitbit\u2019s chief business officer, who oversees sales and marketing for the company. Last year, Fitbit acquired FitStar, which makes apps offering video instructions on workouts. The apps charge a monthly subscription fee for access to exercise programs, an example of how Fitbit could eventually collect money from software services.The big picture for Fitbit, Mr. Scal said, is its evolution into a digital monitoring platform to discover and prevent health problems. Fitbit has teamed up with corporations that offer wellness programs for employees. BP, for example, offers Fitbits to more than 23,000 employees, partly to ensure they are getting enough sleep before they work on oil rigs. Mr. Scal said the data from sleep monitoring, a feature built in to all Fitbit devices, could lead to new health revelations.\u201cI believe we\u2019ve tracked more nights of sleep than have ever been tracked in the history of man,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can actually now compare it to normative data that we have and we can identify irregularities.\u201dAs for Apple, though Mr. Park said he was not bothered by the rival company, it has long been in his sights. When Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, introduced the iPhone 4S in 2011, for example, Mr. Park had a realization.At the time, the new iPhone added a capability to synchronize with wireless accessories using the standard called Bluetooth. Fitbit trackers back then lacked Bluetooth connectivity, but Mr. Park wanted them to be able to synchronize data immediately with the iPhone.\u201cIt could enable a lot of possibilities in terms of real-time feedback,\u201d he said.So Mr. Park gathered a few top employees into a conference room. They decided to re-engineer the Fitbit products to support the new feature. The decision set product releases back about six months, but the revised devices became best sellers.Mr. Park said Fitbit was poised to innovate products to stay competitive. Sensors are getting more sophisticated, so he imagined a situation where high-end Fitbit devices could eventually support mobile payments or control smart home products like Internet-connected light bulbs.Yet the products will stop short of resembling the Apple Watch.\u201cWe\u2019re going to be very careful with how we include these things over time,\u201d Mr. Park said. \u201cI think one of the general knocks against smartwatches is that people still don\u2019t know what they\u2019re good for, so they\u2019ve crammed everything in.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified who introduced the iPhone 4S in 2011. It was Timothy Cook, who was the company\u2019s chief executive then, not Steve Jobs.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Rethinking Apple\u2019s Recipe for Success", "Date": "2016-05-26", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsFor Apple, saying \u201cno\u201d may be getting harder.Eddy Cue, an executive in charge of iTunes and Internet services for the technology giant, raised the possibility of a bid for Time Warner at a meeting with the media conglomerate last year, according to The Financial Times. That seems at odds with the recipe for success championed by Steve Jobs, Apple\u2019s founder: Reject \u201c1,000 ideas\u201d and focus on only the few excellent ones. An aging iPhone, a tepid stock price and a pile of idle cash, however, could make even a mediocre idea look awfully tempting.The deal talk never went beyond a preliminary stage or involved Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook. Making more movies, television shows and other content available on, say, iPads might help strengthen the device\u2019s popularity and sales. It\u2019s unclear, though, why owning content \u2013 not to mention acquiring it by paying perhaps $75 billion for Time Warner, including a control premium \u2013 would make more sense than just agreeing to distribute it. Apple\u2019s resources are better spent creating compelling devices, not trying to develop a sequel to \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201dThe company has been phenomenally successful sticking to Mr. Jobs\u2019s mantra of minimalism. There is growing pressure, though, for something new.Producing beautiful cutting-edge technology is, in some cases, turning into a business of churning out commodities. About 1.4 billion smartphones were sold worldwide last year, so it\u2019s harder to find new customers willing to spend hundreds of dollars extra for an iPhone, no matter how elegant its design. Investors seem to recognize that. Apple\u2019s stock trades at a roughly 30 percent discount to the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.The company\u2019s financial strength also feeds an urge for change. Its net cash exceeds $150 billion, and its free cash flow should easily surpass $50 billion this year. That makes almost any acquisition easier to rationalize.Apple is well known for resisting any impulse to splurge on second-rate ideas. It\u2019s tough to imagine one of its top executives even discussing the purchase of a tangentially related company like Time Warner. Yet the news about Mr. Cue suggests a shift. Apple\u2019s best hope may be that Mr. Cook stands firm on his predecessor\u2019s sage advice.Advertisement"}
