{"Headline": "Inside the Trove of the Genre-Buster Arthur Russell", "Date": "2016-05-27", "News": "Supported byThe public assessment of Arthur Russell, from near-footnote to new-paradigm master, is one of the most curious stories in music of the last half-century.He was noted; to say more would be pushing it.Concerning the archive, Ms. Barwick wrote in an email recently that \u201cit will be like a look into his mind,\u201d adding: \u201cI want to know more about his process. With such varied works, were the processes similar? Or were they different every time?\u201dShe\u2019ll soon be able to find out.These sorts of items may be crucial to understanding Russell. After the paper material is assessed and cataloged with the proper metadata some months from now, anyone interested will be able to come to the library\u2019s division of music and recorded sound to look through it. All the tapes will be digitized and cataloged as well \u2014 a process that may take as long as a year, according to Jonathan Hiam, the library\u2019s curator for the project \u2014 but then will be available for onsite listening. (While the library has been collecting broad amounts of American-music material back to the 1930s, including the papers of John Cage, Henry Cowell, Benny Goodman and Pauline Oliveros, Mr. Hiam said that its next major focus is music of the late 1970s and beyond, both popular and classical; the Russell archive may be a test case for how to do it right.)(p Idea: the construction of structure which can be abandoned at any moment, and that is transparent \u2014 W.O.E.)and(p. Idea: the use of W.O.E. to demystify the process of presentation, packaging and glamor of the music at the same time as mystifying it)The papers and notebooks include scores, personal correspondence, grant proposals, gig fliers and lyrics to hundreds of songs. Among those are some from \u201cWorld of Echo,\u201d which are hardest to decipher \u2014 including the extraordinary \u201cSoon to Be Innocent Fun/Let\u2019s See,\u201d as well as \u201cAnswers Me,\u201d the song Mr. West used. The handwritten material shows Russell as a mixture of things: abstracted, articulate, ambitious, very serious and very funny. Next to the notes about presentation and packaging, he wrote: \u201csend nude photos to critics.\u201dSince the early \u201990s, the papers have been divided among Mr. Lee, Mr. Knutson of Audika and a storage space in Queens. \u201cI think the notebooks show his daily life,\u201d Mr. Lee said in a recent telephone interview. Russell always carried a pen and paper; a lot of lyrics and melodies that eventually found their way to a song are hastily notated, as if subject to change.\u201cFor me, it\u2019s fascinating to look at those books,\u201d Mr. Lee continued. \u201cI\u2019m always seeing the germ of something that became a song. Because I\u2019m so attached to him, after he died I wanted to get inside his head so badly. When you\u2019re living with someone you\u2019re not thinking, how are you creating your work? But after he died, I thought, who is this guy I lived side by side with? That could be revealed through the books and tapes.\u201dOther than Mr. Lee and Mr. Knutson, one of the few people to have seen this material is the composer and scholar Matthew Marble, who just a couple of months ago defended his dissertation on Russell (\u201cBuddhist Bubblegum: Esoteric Buddhism in the Creative Process of Arthur Russell\u201d) for a doctorate in philosophy at Princeton. It was a considerable labor: In focusing on Russell\u2019s shift from esoteric systems to the relative freedom of his later work, Mr. Marble had to try to decode Russell\u2019s methods of musical and numerical notation.\u201cArthur never worked,\u201d Mr. Marble said in an interview. \u201cSo he had nothing but time to work on music, which most people assume means honing cello skills or playing concerts \u2014 but the archive shows that he spent a lot of time working mental alterations on music. He got fixated in this kind of Rube Goldbergian way: His mind functioned like that. He craved complexity.\u201dBut later he seemed to crave uncertainty. The percussionist Mustafa Ahmed told Mr. Marble that Russell used a mantric alphabet to come up with sung melodies; that could be a key to the flexible construction of the \u201cWorld of Echo\u201d lyrics, which were often written down with three possibilities for a single word, and mumbled all the same. (\u201cNON-VERBAL/POP FEEL,\u201d says another note to self in the composition books.)One of the library\u2019s interesting challenges may be in how to catalog Russell\u2019s work. For starters, neither the terms \u201cpopular\u201d or \u201cclassical\u201d really describe him. A group of his lyrics on a notebook page might apply to more than one known and recorded piece of work; a tape of a practice session might or might not be leading toward a finished take. (Mr. Hiam, the curator, said that this was the first time the library has had such a large number of recorded materials demonstrating a composer\u2019s creative process.) He revised and rerecorded and wrote new material in old notebooks. Traditional modes of definition may only help to show the ways that Russell resisted them.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Chelsea\u2019 on Netflix Seems Just Like the Talk Shows It Says It Isn\u2019t", "Date": "2016-05-11", "News": "Supported bySo far, her grade is, at best, incomplete.\u201cChelsea\u201d was promoted as something other than a typical late-night talk show. It posts online at 12:01 a.m. Pacific time, Wednesdays through Fridays, but given the habits of the streaming audience, it\u2019s meant to be watched on the viewer\u2019s schedule. Really, \u201cChelsea\u201d is made in the optimistic spirit of a day drinker: It\u2019s always late night somewhere.\u201cThis is an explanation,\u201d she said.The explanation was that this would be an educational experience. Where Ms. Handler\u2019s \u201cChelsea Lately\u201d on E! was raunchy and celebrity-focused, \u201cChelsea\u201d would be about exploring and learning.On \u201cChelsea,\u201d she\u2019s student and subject. The first guest, the secretary of education, John B. King Jr., gave Ms. Handler a general-knowledge quiz. (To the show\u2019s credit, it did not edit out a geography question in which, asked to name the seven continents, she forgot Africa.)Then it was on to Pitbull and Drew Barrymore. A typical talk show would have reversed the order of the guests, so that\u2019s a change. But the questions mostly stayed in TV talk\u2019s tell-me-about-your-life comfort zone. Ms. Handler asked the education secretary and the rapper about teachers who\u2019d inspired them. Ms. Barrymore brought ros\u00e9 and talked about the dictionary and her divorce.Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with talk, even if \u201cChelsea\u201d wants to be seen as something different. Ms. Handler seemed more at ease chatting with her guests \u2014 and often interrupting them \u2014 than reading the show\u2019s protesting-too-much mission statement. (Adding to the laid-back vibe, her dog Chunk wandered cheerfully around the stage, in lieu of a sidekick.)And she reassured fans that the old unrepentant-libertine Chelsea Handler hadn\u2019t gone anywhere. \u201cI\u2019ve avoided getting pregnant,\u201d she said, running down a comic version of her biography, \u201cmost times.\u201dStrangely, the premiere only teased what might be the show\u2019s most distinctive feature, a string of taped segments, for which Ms. Handler traveled to countries including Russia and Mexico. Instead, there were two clunky comedy videos about Netflix. (Who doesn\u2019t love recommendation-algorithm humor?)Creating episodes to watch on our own time (which, thanks to viral video and DVRs, is increasingly how we watch talk anyway) means a less-topical show: Other than the mandatory Donald J. Trump joke, there were few current events on the curriculum. And while the first episode didn\u2019t leave me itching to stream a second, it\u2019ll be easy to go back and binge if the show finds its footing.But does Ms. Handler want to be more than a mere talk-show host? She knows how to do it, after all. The interesting project of \u201cChelsea,\u201d and its built-in challenge, is the tension between risking growth and playing to your strengths. About that, Ms. Handler seemed to have mixed feelings within the same 37-minute episode. \u201cI\u2019m O.K. with appearing stupid,\u201d she declared in the show\u2019s opening. But to Ms. Barrymore, she said, \u201cI\u2019m so scared of anyone calling me stupid.\u201dStill, by the end of the episode, Ms. Handler was standing on the set\u2019s revolving table, rapping in front of Pitbull. It was excruciating. But it was adventurous, in the put-it-all-out-there spirit of, yes, a talk show. One lesson \u201cChelsea\u201d may need to learn, in its continuing-education project, is that sometimes what you seem to be really is what you are.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Maria Bamford Mines Mental Illness for Her Sitcom, \u2018Lady Dynamite\u2019", "Date": "2016-05-31", "News": "Supported byMaria Bamford has always lived on the cutting edge of comedy, but the world may finally be catching up.Over more than two decades as a stand-up, Ms. Bamford, 45, has become a cult favorite by blending kooky impressions and expertly written jokes with an overdose of human empathy. She has been open about her mental illness \u2014 she has dealt with obsessive-compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder and anxiety, and has spent time in psychiatric wards \u2014 but has managed to turn her struggles into fertile ground for humor.In a phone interview, Ms. Bamford discussed why mental illness is so central in her work, the novelty of starring in her own show and what her parents think of \u201cLady Dynamite.\u201d These are excerpts. How did \u201cLady Dynamite\u201d come about?Mitch had heard my stand-up and then asked me to be on \u201cArrested Development\u201d for a smaller part \u2014 I was called DeBrie, which is a hilarious name. And then he asked me to lunch. I wanted to tell the story of my own experience with mental illness, but I wanted to do it with other people. On my own, I\u2019ve told that story hundreds of times. I also wanted to tell a story of a psychiatric ward, though I don\u2019t think it came across as sad and devastating on the show as it really is. The TV version of a psychiatric ward is more idyllic?Oh, yes. On the show they show us playing with vision boards and playing badminton, which does not happen in a psych ward, at least not ones I\u2019ve been in. [Those were] low budget \u2014 it\u2019s almost as if an art director came in before and said, \u201cO.K., let\u2019s make sure half the chairs are broken, and none of the puzzles have all the pieces, and if we could stack Woman\u2019s Day magazines from the late \u201990s right over here, that\u2019s the look.\u201dFor years you\u2019ve addressed your struggles with mental illness in your act. Has there been a cultural shift that allows such topics to now be the basis of a sitcom?I think it is mainstream now. I would venture to say it is almost hack material. Which is good! I cannot wait until material about a transwoman who is also Muslim becomes tired. Where we go, \u201cYeah, we\u2019ve seen it.\u201d I\u2019m always grateful when people talk about their experience on the planet. It makes me feel so much less isolated and so much more hopeful. I\u2019ve got a subscription to Bipolar Magazine [bp Magazine]; it comes out quarterly. Has your experience with Hollywood been as craven as it is portrayed on the show?Well, I think Hollywood is sort of a mood, or like a virus. It\u2019s not really the people themselves; no one is all that awful. I\u2019ve been writing a joke about Hollywood that it is like having a friend with a drinking problem. Like, you love them so much and if you see them at the right time of the night, they are so much fun and you are best friends forever. And then there\u2019s a crash. And it can\u2019t be maintained. One day you are a star, the next day they are telling you the hot dogs are for principal talent only and the porta-potties are in the back. You\u2019re the star now. You must be feeling some of the benefits.I did not realize this, but when you are No. 1 on the call sheet it is a dream. People ask: \u201cDo you need a water? Are your hands too hot? Are they too cold? How about your feet? Can we rub oils on them?\u201d It was like being a prostitute around Jesus.Your pug Bert also stars in the show. How is he adjusting to fame?He wanted to have a Screen Actors Guild card. I told him about the whole thing, where, yeah, it\u2019s prestigious, but you basically have to kick all your earnings from your first check into becoming a member. I just wonder if this is just another level of Bert not being satisfied with what he has.They are so proud. They called me right after they watched all of them. My dad, of course, showed it to some pals at the lake, which was a mistake. I was like, \u201cDad, don\u2019t do it!\u201d But he did. And I think it was an uncomfortable evening.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Podcasts Surge, but Producers Fear Apple Isn\u2019t Listening", "Date": "2016-05-07", "News": "Supported bySteven P. Jobs put his talent as a master salesman to the test when, in 2005, he introduced new Apple software for downloading digital audio shows. The format was so incipient that he struggled to describe it.\u201cIt\u2019s sort of like TiVo, for radio, for your iPod,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the \u2018Wayne\u2019s World\u2019 of radio, but real radio is jumping onto this.\u201dBut he was clear about the potential. \u201cIt\u2019s getting very, very exciting,\u201d he said.He was talking about podcasting \u2014 radio-style shows made for the Internet that have, in recent years, exploded in popularity. These days, many amateur podcasters are going professional. Major media organizations, searching for answers and bright spots in a fast-changing and confusing digital world, are releasing new shows every week. Advertisers are starting to follow them, and so are millions of dollars of venture capital.It is, in other words, an industry now, one that Apple essentially gave life to and still dominates. Yet at this moment of triumph for podcasting, concerns are growing in the community about how much Apple actually cares.Interviews with over two dozen podcasters and people inside Apple reveal a variety of complaints. The podcasters say that they are relegated to wooing a single Apple employee for the best promotion. That sharing on social media is cumbersome. And that for podcasters to make money, they need more information about their listeners, and Apple is in a unique position to provide it. The problems, they say, could even open up an opportunity for a competitor.\u201cThe lack of podcast data is kind of shocking,\u201d said Gina Delvac, the producer of \u201cCall Your Girlfriend,\u201d a popular show about pop culture and politics.Late last month, Apple brought seven leading podcast professionals to the company\u2019s campus in Cupertino, Calif., to air their case to a room full of employees, according to two people who were there. The people would speak only on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. The company made no promises, the people said, but several pressing issues for podcasters were discussed in frank terms.After the presentations concluded, Eddy Cue, the executive at Apple who oversees software and services, arrived for a closed session with the company\u2019s employees, according to the attendees.\u201cI think everyone who\u2019s seriously involved in this space, they\u2019d at least like to know what the endgame is,\u201d said Chris Morrow, the chief executive of the Loud Speakers Podcast Network. \u201cPeople think there\u2019s another shoe that\u2019s going to drop.\u201dBut podcasting is a product of a different era for digital media \u2014 and for Apple. When Mr. Jobs introduced the updated podcast software in 2005, the company was still in comeback mode, driven by iPods. The iPhone wouldn\u2019t come out for two more years.Now Apple is the biggest public company in the world, but podcasts bring Apple virtually nothing in direct revenue. Perhaps as a result, the iTunes podcasting hub that Mr. Jobs introduced remains strikingly unchanged. Sharing on social media, which basically didn\u2019t exist in 2005, takes multiple clicks.Promotion within iTunes, which is still one of the only reliable ways to build an audience, particularly for a new show, is decided by a small team that fields pitches and does its own outreach. Interviews with people inside and outside the company make it clear that Apple\u2019s small podcast team has been hearing \u2014 and assuaging \u2014 such concerns for years.The question for podcasters \u2014 and for Apple \u2014 is about what comes next. Apple has at least two obvious choices: to rush to accommodate an industry that is quickly outgrowing its origins, or to let podcasting be, at the risk of losing its claim over a medium that owes its very name to the company.Even podcasters are conflicted; a hands-off Apple retains some appeal. \u201cSome would argue that it could have advanced in certain ways,\u201d said Andy Bowers, chief content officer of Slate\u2019s Panoply podcast network. But since 2005, he said, \u201cthey\u2019ve provided a remarkably level playing field.\u201dIn a statement, Mr. Cue of Apple said, \u201cWe have more people than ever focused on podcasting, including engineers, editors and programmers.\u201d He added, \u201cPodcasts hold a special place with us at Apple.\u201dIn terms of revenue, podcasting is still minuscule compared with the technology and entertainment industries. In the early days, hobbyists grew passion projects into businesses and full-time jobs. Now a few established podcast networks and popular podcasters have millions in revenue.Podcasters can sell advertisements at rates ranging from $20 to $100 for every thousand listeners. For podcasts with hundreds of thousands of listeners \u2014 and, in rare cases, millions \u2014 those numbers add up. The spending on advertisements will generate hundreds of millions of dollars for the industry this year, said Matt Lieber, a co-founder of Gimlet Media, a podcasting start-up that has raised $7.5 million from venture capitalists.Expanding the industry much more, though, gets tricky. Apple does not allow shows to charge people to download episodes, for example, and does not support paid subscriptions, as many podcasters would like. Apple has stuck with an advertising model for podcasting that looks almost exactly like what Mr. Jobs predicted onstage in 2005.Measuring how many people listen is also inconsistent and a regular source of frustration. Podcasters know how many times their podcasts are downloaded, for example, but they don\u2019t know how many people actually listened, or how far those listeners might have gotten.With data like listener counts and listening duration \u2014 similar to what Apple provides app developers \u2014 the industry could accelerate quickly, said Ms. Delvac of \u201cCall Your Girlfriend.\u201dBut unlike with downloads of music, movies and apps \u2014 sources of billions of dollars of revenue for Apple, which takes a cut from sales and subscriptions \u2014 the company\u2019s financial incentive in podcasting is limited. The company takes no cut from podcast advertising, and all podcast downloads are free, so there is no cut to take from that, either. As it stands, podcasting is effectively just one more free feature to help the company sell hardware.And it\u2019s a popular one. Apple\u2019s service now contains over 325,000 podcasts. The company expects users to listen to 10 billion episodes in its apps \u2014 on computers, mobile devices and on Apple TV \u2014 by the end of the year.\u201cApple built this village 10 years ago,\u201d Mr. Lieber said. \u201cThere\u2019s really interesting things in the village, and interesting characters. But the village now has the population of a city \u2014 and when a village becomes a city, you need new infrastructure.\u201dApple\u2019s conservative approach may be creating an opportunity for competitors, as has happened before. Apple\u2019s iTunes software helped popularize online music, only to watch streaming services like Spotify and Pandora create compelling alternatives. Apple pressured the television and film industries to sell, and rent, their content online; then Netflix built subscription streaming into a business worth nearly $40 billion.Google abandoned a podcast app in 2012, but this year it added a podcast features to its music app, which is included with smartphones that run the company\u2019s Android operating system. Todd Cochrane, chief executive of RawVoice, a company that tracks podcasts, said Apple\u2019s share of podcast listeners is now about 65 percent, down from 70 percent a year ago. He attributed that change almost entirely to an \u201cupsurge\u201d in listening on Android.In January, Spotify, the streaming music service, began rolling out an ambitious slate of podcasts. Among the company\u2019s promises to podcasters: hosting, streaming and extensive listening data. Audible, the audiobook service owned by the notoriously aggressive Amazon, is investing heavily in original audio content under the guidance of Eric Nuzum, a former vice president at National Public Radio. (The New York Times is among the partners working with Audible.)\u201cWe\u2019re actively distributing our content in many different places right now,\u201d said Laura Walker, president and chief executive of New York Public Radio, whose podcasts include \u201cRadiolab,\u201d \u201cFreakonomics\u201d and \u201c2 Dope Queens.\u201d \u201cEverything is growing.\u201dApple\u2019s stance as the giant of the industry remains undisputed, though, and podcasters are left to navigate a complicated relationship with the company. Most send messages to the company at a general email address. To those who have direct contact, their relationship centers on one person: Steve Wilson.Mr. Wilson, podcasters say, acts as Apple\u2019s de facto podcast gatekeeper. Attention from him can be the difference between a hit and a dud \u2014 and between a podcast that pays and one that doesn\u2019t.The most consistent major source of new listeners \u2014 in some cases, tens of thousands \u2014 is a top spot on iTunes and Apple\u2019s podcast app. That is the real estate that Mr. Wilson helps oversee, and that podcasters covet. (Mr. Wilson directed a request for an interview to a company publicist, who declined to make him available for an interview.)\u201cAs far as I can tell they\u2019re huge podcasts enthusiasts,\u201d said Jody Avirgan, who hosts and produces podcasts for the ESPN data journalism site FiveThirtyEight. \u201cBut you\u2019re trying to cram thousands of new shows into, what, six things that get featured on the home page?\u201dMr. Wilson\u2019s identity and contact information are shared among podcasters like a juicy secret, and his podcast preferences are furtively debated in the industry, as are those of his boss, James Boggs. Mostly, it makes podcasters wonder: At a company the size of Apple, what does it mean that American podcasters are left to lobby a single person?From Apple\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s not that simple. Of the more than 150 iTunes podcast portals around the world, 29 have hand-edited selections and Steve Wilsons of their own. Any change to the way Apple handles podcasting could have wide ramifications.Additionally, the \u201cTop Podcast\u201d list within iTunes is also the subject of constant speculation among podcasters. An apparent change in the system this year resulted in small podcasts from Disney fans \u2014 and a show that hadn\u2019t yet published its first full episode \u2014 being ranked alongside shows with hundreds of thousands of listeners, according to Nicholas Quah, who publishes Hot Pod, a newsletter about the industry.For listeners, quirks like this may only be a little weird. For podcasters, who already struggle to communicate their success to advertisers, it leaves them frustrated.\u201cI think it\u2019s like the question everyone asks of any company,\u201d said Ms. Delvac, the \u201cCall Your Girlfriend\u201d producer. \u201cHow can I keep the good parts of my relationship the same, and get more of what I want?\u201dAdvertisement"}

Joyce had it easier than Franzen, however, in bridging the chasm from the here and now to eternity. For starters, he began \u201cUlysses\u201d nearly a decade after the events described, essentially making it a work of historical fiction; he was already aware of what had gone extinct in its ecosystem.Also advantageous to Joyce was the epoch in which he wrote. Even for a modernist attuned to, well, what was modern, everyday technology wasn\u2019t that hard to keep up with, evolving at a much slower clip in 1904 than in 2001, which had dial-up velocity compared with the 4G bandwidth of 2016. In Joyce\u2019s era, paradigms shifted once in a long while (the light bulb, the automobile, the radio) and then remained generally the same, with incremental improvements. Now entire industries are disrupted overnight.Silicon Valley-era fiction writers are in a bind. To ignore the latest quotidian technology today (at least when concerning the middle and upper classes of developed nations, as most published fiction here tends to be) is to imagine some screenless 19th-century world in which people may as well still be riding in horse-drawn buggies instead of hailing Ubers and Lyfts and, not long from now, self-driving cars. Incorporating up-to-date devices and applications, on the other hand, risks mayfly ephemerality by the time the book has been printed (or, indeed, sent to Kindles). Consider how preposterous a novel composed in 2003 would look today \u2014 or even by 2005 \u2014 if a character logged in to the now-defunct social media site Friendster to check whether he had any new \u201ctestimonials.\u201d Movies, bearing the burden of actually showing graphics and interfaces, suffer more acute retrospective \u00adembarrassment.So what\u2019s a chronicler of the present to do? One tactic is to determine which technologies best represent the decade and also stand the greatest chance of outlasting the book\u2019s shelf life. Facebook and Twitter, for instance, seem like safer bets to me than Snapchat and Seamless. Alternatively, one can anonymize the technology, lest it soon be replaced. Instead of having a character watching a show on Netflix or HBO Go, it might be more prudent to talk of generically \u201cstreaming\u201d it (a term that may someday look as needlessly silly as \u201cword search\u201d). Many post-Pynchon writers invent their own \u00adfuturistic-sounding tech companies and products, too, as a workaround for imminent \u00adoldfangledness and, perhaps, legal repercussions. But such evasions can come off as coy or phony, the same way that made-up celebrity names in fiction typically sound overdetermined and absurd \u2014 although no more overdetermined and absurd than Tom Cruise or Ke$ha.The most radical approach, though, is to put the technology directly under one\u2019s writerly microscope. Analyze it, situate it in a historical context, dissect and reassemble it before our eyes to make us see it \u2014 and our tech-besotted culture \u2014 anew. The result may someday look like the antiquated \u201ce-weary,\u201d but it\u2019s an earnest assessment of current conditions with restricted foresight. A Gchat transcription without any attempt to understand the medium\u2019s message is merely typo-riddled dialogue.Or do the exact opposite. Don\u2019t write about the newest gadget as if it\u2019s a marvel; simply treat it as part of the backdrop, like the landline. We send texts now, a form of communication I expect will seem quaint not too far into the future. \u201cHe texted that he was running late\u201d is sufficient. \u201cHe opened up the text-messaging application on his Apple iPhone 6 Plus and keyed into the 5.5-inch screen that he was running late\u201d is in advertorial thrall and aesthetically ugly.That\u2019s a hyperbolic example, but I nearly fell into a similar trap with my new novel. I had initially written that the protagonist was watching \u201cInternet porn.\u201d Then I realized that few young men these days find their pornography offline and deleted \u201cInternet.\u201d I figure this will provide a little more durability until virtual reality repaves the pornographic landscape and the notion of someone\u2019s being passively \u00adtitillated by a 2-D, low-definition video is risible.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "BBC Faces Turning Point in Mission as Pressures Bear Down", "Date": "2016-05-09", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 The British Broadcasting Corporation is variously seen as a crown jewel of British culture, a producer of refined entertainment and reliable news coverage and as a cumbersome monolith, burdened by scandal and mismanagement.But there is wide agreement that the BBC is at a critical moment in its nearly 94-year history. Challenged by the same forces that have upended traditional news media organizations elsewhere, including the technology-driven fracturing of its mass audiences, it faces intense budget pressures. Accused of using public funds to distort the market for programming, it is under constant assault by private-sector competitors. Criticized by some members of the governing Conservative Party as having a left-leaning institutional bias, it has been caught in political crosscurrents.As the government prepares to set out on Thursday its plans for a new BBC charter \u2014 the document governing its operations, and the first revision in a decade \u2014 Britain is grappling with fundamental questions about what role the broadcaster should play in a world of streaming video, podcasts and proliferating news sites. Already, the BBC has put itself through a series of staff cuts and reorganizations in recent years intended to address its array of challenges, from the legacy of long-ago sexual abuse cases involving big-name stars to lapses in its journalism.Any institution so central to public life and so huge \u2014 it receives 3.72 billion pounds a year, or about $5.4 billion, through the \u00a3145.50 license fee nearly all households pay, plus \u00a31.3 billion in commercial and other income \u2014 is inevitably going to prompt questions about its scope, size and purpose.And the last few years have made it clear that the way the BBC is now governed and overseen has serious design flaws that the new charter will try to solve, though not without controversy.As the publication date for the government draft approached, the debate flared, with newspapers suggesting that the government would dictate BBC programming schedules (fiercely denied), that it would demand that the BBC publish the salaries of its stars (the BBC says it will not) and that it would ask the BBC to share some of its income with independent children\u2019s television producers.John Whittingdale, the culture secretary in the Conservative government of Prime Minister David Cameron, is among those who have given the BBC a major scare as the government prepares to unveil the draft.In a digital age, when the media world is rapidly changing, \u201cwe must at least question whether the BBC should try to be all things to all people,\u201d Mr. Whittingdale told the news media. He has questioned whether the public should be funding commercial enterprises, whether the BBC should be competing so directly with commercial stations in popular entertainment, whether it should be concentrating more on \u201cdistinctiveness\u201d than ratings, and whether its news website is damaging newspapers.Mr. Whittingdale has also made offhand comments that have indicated a deeper animus, as he did recently to Conservative students at the University of Cambridge. He said that he was often \u201cdriven insane\u201d by the way the BBC deals with complaints about impartiality, and by the way it treats those favoring a British exit from the European Union as \u201cfaintly mad.\u201dThe current charter runs out at the end of 2017. \u201cIf we don\u2019t renew it,\u201d he told the students, \u201cit may be that the BBC will cease to exist, which is occasionally a tempting prospect.\u201dMr. Whittingdale has taken a much harder line on the BBC than has Mr. Cameron, who, along with his No. 2, George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, calls the broadcaster a great national institution, if one with flaws. The difference in tone on the issue reflects the deeper split among Conservatives on a variety of topics, not least Britain\u2019s membership in the European Union. Mr. Whittingdale, like many of the BBC\u2019s toughest critics, favors a British exit from the bloc.Mr. Whittingdale\u2019s criticisms threw the BBC \u201cinto a completely juvenile reaction, accusing all critics of being part of ideological assault, and it has done them no credit,\u201d said Steve Hewlett, an analyst who conducts a media show on BBC Radio 4.For now the BBC appears to have escaped radical government-imposed changes, reflecting both the government\u2019s preoccupation with the European Union vote and popular support for the broadcaster. Officials say that Conservatives remain uncomfortable with a publicly funded broadcaster skewing competition with the private sector, but that overall the mood within the government about the state of the BBC has improved.The government\u2019s current demand is that the BBC produce material that is \u201cmore distinctive\u201d from the commercial market. No one has defined what that means, but the argument tends to center on \u201cStrictly Come Dancing,\u201d a major BBC prime-time success that could have been made by the commercial sector.James Purnell, a former Labour Party legislator who is director of strategy and digital at the BBC, argues that \u201cdistinctiveness\u201d means \u201cthat the BBC aspires to make the best possible program in any genre,\u201d whether it is a soap opera or drama, and that the BBC must serve everyone, since nearly everyone is a license payer. And \u201cStrictly\u201d is a BBC production from start to finish.But others, including Chris Patten, the former head of the BBC Trust and a fierce supporter of the BBC and critic of Mr. Whittingdale, say they wonder whether the BBC should have spent millions in bidding to buy the rights for \u201cThe Voice UK,\u201d an adaptation of a Dutch show. \u201cThe Voice UK\u201d is hugely successful on Saturday nights against a homegrown commercial show \u2013 but it is a program to which the BBC added little that is distinctive.Part of the answer, the government concludes, is to increase the amount of material on the BBC that is produced independently or through competition, enlarging the \u201cwindow of creative competition\u201d from its current 25 percent. In response, Mr. Purnell said, the BBC wants to abandon its \u201cin-house quotas\u201d and open nearly everything to competition, while creating its own BBC Studio to compete in every market, including the commercial one.Abroad, the government seems happy to let the BBC compete in the digital market against companies like Netflix and experiment with live-streaming and subscriptions. It has even provided additional money to the BBC World Service, which used to be funded by the Foreign Office and then only by the BBC, again raising questions about government interference.The key question of the BBC\u2019s finances appears to have been settled last July, when Mr. Osborne, needing to fill a hole in his budget, made a deal with the BBC director general, Tony Hall. The BBC agreed to bear the cost over time of free television licenses for subscribers over the age of 75 in return for linking the license fee \u2014 paid by every household for the right to receive television programs, either live or streamed \u2014 to the cost of living.It will mean, however, a cost of up to \u00a3800 million to the BBC, Mr. Hewlett said, about 20 percent of license fee income.Since 2009, the BBC has cut the number of senior managers and its wage expenses by a third, has moved a youth channel, BBC 3, online and has announced that an additional 1,000 jobs will be chopped, while selling property and aiming to cut costs by a further 20 percent over the next five years, Mr. Purnell said.The proposed charter would also change how the BBC is governed, a shift that has ignited a fierce argument about how much influence the government would have on a newly constituted BBC board, in particular whether giving the government the power to appoint a majority of nonexecutive board members would effectively strip the broadcaster of its independence.Even though the BBC gets billions in public money, said Alex Towers, the director of the BBC Trust, which oversees BBC management, \u201cthere needs to be independence, or it can\u2019t do its job for democracy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "TV\u2019s Big Bet on Nostalgia", "Date": "2016-05-16", "News": "Supported by2016 TV UpfrontsThe television industry is facing an uncertain, uncharted future. But next season it\u2019s placing a big bet on the past.MacGyver, the crafty secret agent, is returning to CBS three decades after his 1985 debut. \u201cTales From the Crypt,\u201d an HBO series that first aired in 1989, will be resurrected on TNT. \u201cMTV Unplugged,\u201d whose Eric Clapton heyday was in the 1990s, is back \u2014 and so are \u201c24,\u201d \u201cPrison Break\u201d and \u201cGilmore Girls.\u201d\u201cWe now live in a world where TV shows never die,\u201d said David Nevins, the chief executive of Showtime. He has his own revival on the way: Mr. Nevins helped persuade David Lynch to create a new chapter of \u201cTwin Peaks,\u201d the cult series that went off the air a quarter-century ago.Call it a familiarity fetish. At the network upfront presentations, which began on Monday, executives are expected to unveil new adaptations of favored franchises that extend beyond TV shows, including films like \u201cThe Exorcist,\u201d \u201cTraining Day,\u201d \u201cTaken\u201d and, potentially, \u201cCruel Intentions,\u201d with Sarah Michelle Gellar reprising her role in the 1999 original.\u201cWe are not saying we are out of the original idea business,\u201d said David Madden, president of entertainment at Fox. \u201cHaving said that, there are a lot of shows out there, a lot of material competing for people\u2019s attention. And where you have a title that people recognize, value and appreciate, that\u2019s something we want to take advantage of.\u201dName-brand programs can excite existing fan bases, reduce marketing costs and appeal to an increasingly important international market. (The French, it turns out, are big fans of \u201cPrison Break,\u201d Mr. Madden said.)But there are no guarantees. Fox\u2019s revival of \u201cThe X-Files\u201d was among this season\u2019s best-rated new shows, but the network canceled \u201cMinority Report,\u201d based on the Tom Cruise sci-fi movie, after dismal ratings. ABC is axing its revival of \u201cThe Muppets,\u201d and on Monday, CBS said it was canceling the low-rated \u201cRush Hour.\u201d\u201cIt is irresistible in a world that has 60 or 80 makers of original programming to have something that has pre-existing awareness,\u201d said Mr. Nevins of Showtime. \u201cStill, at the end of the day, it\u2019s going to rise and fall based on its quality.\u201dAnd not all revivals are created equal. Mr. Nevins said he pursued a new \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d only because Mr. Lynch agreed to participate. (\u201cWe\u2019ve persuaded the original creators to complete their mission,\u201d he said.) David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson signed on for \u201cThe X-Files,\u201d but Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker were missing from \u201cRush Hour.\u201dOther titles will be reimagined, even if the name initially helped open doors. Sarah Aubrey, who oversees programming at TNT, described the excitement when M. Night Shyamalan approached the network about revamping \u201cTales From the Crypt,\u201d the kitschy HBO horror series. But the plan is for a new twist on the cackling Cryptkeeper character, and not a shot-by-shot remake.\u201cWe like the idea of it, signifying tone,\u201d Ms. Aubrey said of the title. \u201cIt put out the right kind of thematic indicator of what we were going for in the horror space.\u201dMTV has a similar strategy for \u201cUnplugged,\u201d which returns as the channel pivots back to its music video roots. The new \u201cUnplugged\u201d is meant to appeal to Generation Xers and millennials alike. But \u201cit will not be carpets and candles,\u201d said Erik Flannigan, the channel\u2019s head of music programming, referring to the scenery that distinguished \u201cUnplugged\u201d concerts by \u201990s staples like Nirvana and 10,000 Maniacs.\u201cI don\u2019t think we need to trade on the nostalgia of what \u2018Unplugged\u2019 meant for me and you if you witnessed it the first time,\u201d Mr. Flannigan said. \u201cIt really is a brand-new idea to somebody who is 22 years old.\u201dIn part, the move toward all these reboots is a product of \u2014 and hedge against \u2014 the rise of Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Video, where cord-cutting viewers are rediscovering shows whose syndication days on cable and broadcast networks are long over. In another era, shows like \u201cThe X-Files\u201d would persist only in private DVD collections; now, viewers bored with the latest network offerings are binging on them.For networks that own their old shows, the financial allure of a remake is even greater. \u201cIt refreshes and regenerates the library,\u201d said Peter Rice, chairman of Fox Networks Group, noting that old episodes become newly valuable domestically and overseas.A social anthropologist might wonder if television\u2019s nostalgia craze can be attributed to viewers who are seeking out the familiar in a disruptive, uneasy age (See Trump, Donald J.). But when that question was posed to Martin Kaplan, director of the Norman Lear Center for media and society at the University of Southern California, he laughed.\u201cI would not discount the commercial motivations,\u201d Mr. Kaplan, a screenwriter and former studio executive, said dryly.\u201cMacGyver is a name that\u2019s in the culture,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you see that, you know what you\u2019re getting, as opposed to some name that means nothing.\u201d That\u2019s why, he added, viewers often encounter \u201cendless sequels to things that seem to have come out only 20 minutes ago.\u201dThe nostalgia, he noted, may be on the studios\u2019 end, rather than viewers\u2019. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing as helpful to a programmer as a title or a show that has brand equity already built into it,\u201d he said.So is there anything Mr. Kaplan would like to see rebooted?\u201c\u2018College Bowl,\u2019\u201d he replied. \u201cIt\u2019s a higher-end version of \u2018Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader?\u2019\u201dBrooks Barnes contributed reporting from Los Angeles.Advertisement"}

I may have yelped with joy when the gates opened to reveal Sansa and Brienne. This story has sprawled so prodigiously, there is a visceral thrill that comes from seeing disparate pieces connect, especially pieces of the tortured family that represents whatever good is left in the world.As for the fire portion of the program, well, you saw it. The Dothraki hut went up like a haystack soaked in kerosene, taking the potty-mouthed khals with it and allowing the unburnt dragon mother to emerge from the flames. As Dothraki-cowing parlor tricks go, it\u2019s a good one, which we already know because we saw her do roughly the same thing with Khal Drogo\u2019s funeral pyre in Season 1.Indeed, for many of us, Dany\u2019s effortless bar-b-coup probably inspired the suspicion that the net result of the Slaver\u2019s Bay excursions and Meereen misadventures were to get Daenerys Targaryen back to where she was over four seasons ago: leading a Dothraki force with designs on taking them on wooden horses across the Black Salt Sea.It was more complicated than that, of course, and we\u2019ll come back to Vaes Dothrak.

We were reminded that most of what has happened over the past six seasons, not just the Stark strife but the various wars, betrayals and other machinations that have convulsed the world of this story, were triggered when Robert Baratheon called Ned to King\u2019s Landing.I\u2019m sick of fighting, Jon told Sansa. It\u2019s all I\u2019ve been doing, and did I mention I got killed a few days ago? If you don\u2019t come along, I\u2019m doing it without you, she said. Then Ramsay the Terrible\u2019s mocking letter arrived to put everyone on the same page.The missive signaled Ramsay\u2019s overflowing arrogance (\u201ccome and see\u201d) and why wouldn\u2019t it? Since we met him in Season 3, we\u2019ve seen him break down and enslave a young nobleman; win his legitimacy at Moat Cailin, trick the formidable Petyr \u201cLittlefinger\u201d Baelish into letting him marry Sansa; defeat Stannis; and murder his own father to take control of House Bolton. His only misstep was allowing Sansa to escape but he quickly replaced her with her little brother.A few commenters thought the crafty and capable Osha might spell doom for him, and she apparently had the same idea. But nope. Soon she had a hole in her neck and the kennel master\u2019s hounds had a new special on the menu. (Fun fact: Natalia Tena and Iwan Rheon played a couple in a dystopian sci-fi mini-series last year called \u201cResidue.\u201d I haven\u2019t seen it but it\u2019s on Netflix.)The guy has good reasons to be arrogant, is the point. But the letter\u2019s grandiosity felt like the moment Ramsay finally invited his own demise. Few things undo dramatic characters as effectively as preening hubris \u2014 just ask Joffrey, Oberyn, and any number of killed-off slavers and henchmen \u2014 and Ramsay doesn\u2019t realize how many forces are aligning against him. Over in the Vale, Littlefinger (welcome back!) has manipulated the Suckling Robin into sending troops to help Sansa. Plus Ramsay\u2019s never met Wun Wun, who might not appreciate Lord Bolton\u2019s vile threats against Wildlings. (I realize I\u2019m sort of obsessed with the improbable notion of Wun Wun the giant being the one to kill Ramsay but come on, what would be better?)Sansa\u2019s steadfastness in the face of Jon\u2019s reluctance offered the latest evidence that Sansa has assumed a leadership role within both her own family and her own story, in general. It was also one of several sibling dynamics that found the sisters taking command. Cersei Lannister bossing around Jaime is old news, of course, but on Sunday we also saw Margaery bucking up the disintegrating Loras and Theon volunteering for the committee to elect Yara leader of the Iron Born.It\u2019s become common this season to note that the female characters on \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d are stepping to the fore, but that was especially evident on Sunday. Women took purposeful steps to reshape their fortunes while, on the other side of the fence, our beloved Tyrion Lannsplained slavery to former slaves and the High Sparrow did his usual poverty-porn self-mythologizing for Margaery, who sees his empty brand-burnishing pieties for what they really are.And then we have the woman who literally burned the patriarchy to the ground.I admit that despite the visual flair of the sequence, I mostly sighed as Dany flamb\u00e9ed the khal council. For one thing, there was the easy efficiency of the takeover. (Seriously, was that thing made of kindling or what? Or are we supposed to think Jorah and Daario somehow sprayed it down with lighter fluid in advance?) Then there was the fact that, as I said earlier, it essentially returned her to where she was a few seasons ago: leading a bunch of Dothrakis, with an eye on conquering Westeros.But the more I thought about it, the more the parallelism of her emergence highlighted how far she has come, even as much of her arc has been mired in the mostly cheerless stasis in Meereen. She has conquered cities. She has made mistakes. She has been underestimated and has learned the value of allowing herself to be underestimated. She has acquired the support of the Unsullied and of the oppressed of Slaver\u2019s Bay, even if Tyrion threatens to undo much of that support. And not for nothing, but the baby dragons who emerged from that pyre are now, you know, actual giant fire-breathing dragons.Then there was the symbolism of the thing. The khals collectively represent a distilled, pure-grade dose of the savage aggression that has torn this world apart \u2014 they promised an almost cartoonish level of rape and cruelty and ended up as ash, showing in the process the ultimate fecklessness of bluster, dumb strength and braggadocio in the face of true transcendent power. The kind Dany represented in the early days of this story but is only now beginning to embody.Something tells me things are going to go better for her this time.\u2022 The plot thickens in King\u2019s Landing, where it now seems Cersei and Jaime plan to bring in a Tyrell army to overthrow the High Sparrow, perhaps as Margaery is queuing up for her own walk of shame. I have to admit I\u2019m a little confused by all of this \u2014 last week it seemed like we were headed toward a trial by combat. Maybe we still are. Or maybe Cersei\u2019s playing the Tyrells as part of a broader plot to regain power in the capital. The only thing I\u2019m sure of is: 1. Cersei is destined to underestimate how her actions might come back to bite her; and 2., somewhere Mountainstein is sharpening his sword and/or splattering a loose-lipped drunk against a wall.\u2022 Many people wondered if the Rickon\u2019s arrival at Winterfell was actually a House Umber plot to undo Ramsay, but Osha\u2019s thwarted gambit seemed to contradict that theory. Her actions seemed too impulsive and desperate. Or did you read that differently?\u2022 That Shireen shoe is going to drop at some point and it\u2019s not going to be pretty. Davos and Melisandre have been uneasy allies this season but that revelation will bring an end to all that, to the point that I\u2019m not sure both will survive whatever comes afterward.\u2022 Bronn, however, is still missing in action. Perhaps Cersei and Jaime\u2019s coup will have a place for him.\u2022 What did you think? Are we finally done with Ramsay? But who becomes the big baddie if he goes down? Where does Dany go from here? What sound did you make when Brienne and Sansa arrived at Castle Black? Please share your thoughts in the comments.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Born in the VCR Era, Great Courses Seeks to Evolve", "Date": "2016-05-27", "News": "Supported byLarry Weinberg, 72, typifies the Great Courses\u2019 core customer: A voracious learner, he got hooked on the Great Courses video and audio classes shortly after he retired from Boeing a decade ago. His personal library now includes more than 200 courses, as varied as \u201cUnderstanding Multivariable Calculus\u201d and \u201cYoga for a Healthy Mind and Body,\u201d all carefully cataloged on bookshelves and computer hard drives.\u201cI haven\u2019t watched all of them yet,\u201d said Mr. Weinberg, who has a Ph.D. in math and a law degree. \u201cThey are kind of like books. I have lots of books, but that doesn\u2019t stop me from buying new ones.\u201dWhen so much educational material is available online, much of it free, courses like these are something of a throwback. Nevertheless, for the last 25 years, the format has gained the company a loyal customer base, made up primarily of older professionals and retirees. Customers pay from $35 to more than $500 for audio and video courses that offer the intellectual stimulation of college without the worries of finishing assignments or taking final exams.Now the Great Courses program hopes to broaden its demographics with an all-you-can-learn streaming service, Great Courses Plus, which it introduced late last year. With the streaming option, customers are not limited to a single course. For $19.99 a month, or about $180 for an annual subscription, they have unlimited online access to more than 280 of the most recent and popular courses from the company\u2019s library of roughly 600 courses on topics including astrophysics and wine tasting.\u201cI\u2019m a big believer that we are the Netflix of learning,\u201d said Paul Suijk, chief executive of the Teaching Company of Chantilly, Va., which owns the Great Courses and has $150 million a year in revenue. \u201cLooking at Netflix and where they are going, I think there are many similarities.\u201dFor years, Great Courses was just about the only game in town. Its advertisements have long been familiar to anyone who reads The New York Times Book Review or The New Yorker. But now it faces competition from massive open online courses, or MOOCs, offered by colleges and even from outlets like YouTube.Coursera, for example, offers courses from more than 140 universities and organizations around the world, with topics as varied as grammar and punctuation, and Tibetan meditation. Students can take classes free or pay for a more complete experience, with assessments and interaction with professors.About 25 percent to 30 percent of Coursera users \u201care purely enrichment learners, and the demographics of the Great Courses,\u201d said Daphne Koller, president and co-founder of Coursera. The average age of a Coursera student is 33, versus 45 plus for the typical Great Courses customer.\u201cIf you are interested in community and interaction, MOOCs may be your best option,\u201d Mr. Haber said. \u201cIf you are interested in lectures, the Great Courses are probably your best option.\u201dThe Great Courses do not offer the same opportunity as MOOCs to interact with professors. Instead, writers and producers \u201ctry to predict as much of that exchange as possible\u201d by addressing common questions in the lecture, said Marcy McDonald, who was senior director of content for the Great Courses and is now a freelance course producer.The production quality and depth of Great Courses\u2019 material is still a cut above most of what is available free. \u201cPeople go to YouTube looking for an answer to a question,\u201d said Ron Davis, a chemistry professor at Georgetown University who has a YouTube channel and recently finished his second Great Courses series on chemistry. \u201cThe Great Courses is about immersing yourself.\u201dWhile the plots do not have the same twists and turns as those of \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d or \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d the courses do attract \u201cbinge learners\u201d who power through dozens of 30-minute lectures on a weekend. Data on Plus subscribers show that many are sampling a wide range of courses that suit their moods or circumstances, whether it is a high school student needing to catch up on organic chemistry or a foodie interested in the finer points of French cuisine.The inspiration for the Great Courses came after its founder, Tom Rollins, skipped his evidence class on federal rules during his second year in law school at Harvard. In a panic before the final exam, he found a series of video lectures taught by Prof. Irving Younger of Cornell University.\u201cI was prepared for the worst weekend of my life,\u201d Mr. Rollins said. Instead, he was captivated, got an A on the exam and, after serving as chief of staff to Senator Edward M. Kennedy\u2019s Labor Committee, built a business based on that experience. \u201cIt made me realize that we dramatically undervalue the power of great teachers,\u201d he said.Mr. Rollins filmed the first courses \u2014 which covered psychology, political theory and Shakespeare \u2014 at Georgetown University but quickly realized that taking crews and equipment on location added cost and complexity. In 1992, he brought production in house to the original headquarters in Springfield, Va., shooting with two cameras and the same backdrop.A turning point came in 1996, when Mr. Rollins shifted gears from thinking solely about content to creating a successful business. He pored over Harvard Business School case studies, sought outside expertise and created a 120-page playbook for doing business and building customer loyalty. Through direct marketing and abundant print advertising, he built a loyal audience of repeat customers.Despite the successes, Mr. Rollins started looking for a buyer around 2000, when many of his early investors were ready to leave. He ultimately struck a deal with Brentwood Associates, a private equity firm based in Los Angeles.In 2006, Brentwood invested $50 million, a majority stake, in the Teaching Company with the goal of improving production quality and expanding the company\u2019s reach. When streaming video took off, it made the business model that much more appealing. \u201cWe bought a fantastic DVD company,\u201d which sold DVDs via direct marketing, said Bill Barnum, who helped found Brentwood\u2019s private equity group. \u201cAnd then there was an incredible revolution on the device side and with new online distribution channels.\u201dUnder Brentwood, the company has more than tripled the circulation of its course catalogs to about 70 million. In 2013, it added indirect distribution channels, including Audible.com, Amazon Instant Video, Comcast Video on Demand and even Netflix.In addition, the company has forged partnerships with the Culinary Institute of America, the Smithsonian Institution and the Mayo Clinic, among others, to produce videos. These partnerships offer access to experts, locations and resources, and expand the marketing reach. The Fundamentals of Photography, which is produced with National Geographic, is the best-selling course in the history of the company.Most videos are still produced in one of the company\u2019s two studios, one with a permanent set and one that changes with the topic. One week it resembles the site of an archaeological dig, and the next it is a physiology lab. Increasingly, postproduction animation is part of the equation, though it is still a far cry from Hollywood. Most courses are easily converted into audio-only products, which account for roughly 20 percent of the company\u2019s revenue.New customers might be drawn to a single topic, but the company\u2019s direct marketing aims to turn them into repeat customers. Roughly a third of first-time buyers buy more courses, according to the company.Great Courses producers typically generate ideas for new courses, but those ideas are tested using customer surveys. If a topic gets the green light, internal talent scouts search for the expert best suited to write the course and present it on camera. \u201cYou could be Einstein, but if you\u2019re not engaging, you\u2019re not going to cut it,\u201d said Mr. Suijk, the chief executive. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to find the professors who are truly special.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The rates are published daily for various interest rate derivatives contracts, which banks trade with other financial institutions and sell to clients looking to either hedge against a swing in interest rates or to speculate on the markets. In a separate benchmark fixing case, Citigroup agreed to resolve claims that it had tried to manipulate the Yen London Interbank Offered Rate and the Euroyen Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate. Citigroup\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role in trying to manipulate overseas benchmark rates tied to the pricing of interest rates and the use of derivatives products tied to those benchmarks has been no secret.In 2011, the Tokyo Financial Services Agency sanctioned Citigroup for its actions and temporarily suspended a derivatives product. In February, Citigroup agreed to pay $23 million to settle a lawsuit brought by several hedge funds and a public pension plan over claims that the bank had conspired to manipulate the yen Libor rate.Bitcoin experts and law enforcement officials have spent more than two years trying to establish how hundreds of thousands of Bitcoins disappeared from the Mt. Gox exchange and there have been few solid answers. The trustee said on Wednesday at a meeting with creditors that $414 million of the claims appeared to be legitimate and have been approved. They will get some portion of the $91 million. It is not yet clear how much because of outstanding lawsuits and investigations. Bitcoin investors have complained about how long it has taken to work through the claims. The legal and accounting costs have added up to about $55 million so far. Mr. Karpeles was arrested by the Japanese authorities last August on suspicion of illegally adding money to an account under his control, though not on charges directly related to the missing Bitcoins. Japanese government officials have still given few indications of what they think happened to the missing money. end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chelsea Handler: Impulsive, Provocative and Streaming on Netflix", "Date": "2016-05-05", "News": "With her new talk show, \u201cChelsea,\u201d the comedian intends to break the mold of the seemingly stale topical comedy format.Supported by\u201cI don\u2019t want people turning it on and seeing the same thing,\u201d she explained recently. \u201cMonologue. First guest. Band. Da, da, da. I just can\u2019t do it that way.\u201dShe was here to impart some wisdom to her niece Charley, a guileless, cheerful 11-year-old who hopes to be famous like her aunt. While a camera crew from Ms. Handler\u2019s show followed Charley taking orders and receiving an education in the school of hard knocks, the host herself was giving another kind of lesson. The subject was the seeming staleness of the topical comedy format, and how she hopes to avoid this when her show, \u201cChelsea,\u201d makes its debut on Wednesday, May 11.\u201cAll these shows try to start out selling something different, and ultimately all become the same, just with a different guy,\u201d Ms. Handler, 41, said in a husky voice that never fully shed its New Jersey roots. \u201cI have to do everything I can to prevent that from happening.\u201dThat she is one of just a few women to have hosted a late-night show, Ms. Handler said, was unimportant. \u201cI don\u2019t think of myself as a woman \u2014 I think of myself as a person,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you think that\u2019s what I think about all day? No, I\u2019m just trying to be entertaining.\u201dStill, it is an unusual proposition that Ms. Handler would create \u201cChelsea\u201d for Netflix, the streaming-video service that has no programming grid or daily schedule to speak of.Netflix has touted its ability to get viewers to binge on its content in lengthy doses, but has no track record with topical shows. It is hoping for Ms. Handler to deliver a program that has the freewheeling spirit of a late-night talk show, if not the customary formats or time slot. (New episodes will be posted at 12:01 a.m. Pacific time on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays.)It has made the deal more intriguing by taking this foray with Ms. Handler at a time when she wants to be known for her wider interests in how the world works, and not merely as a comedian who jokes about drinking and not wanting children.She is also a provocative entertainer \u2014 today she wore a necklace bearing a familiar two-word obscene phrase \u2014 who doesn\u2019t disguise her restlessness, and may even consider it her best quality.\u201cI\u2019m totally impulsive,\u201d she said proudly. \u201cI was impulsive when I signed up with E! and that lasted eight years. I was impulsive when I wrote my first book and then I wrote five. I would never want to be another way.\u201dIt\u2019s been nearly two years since Ms. Handler brought the curtain down on \u201cChelsea Lately,\u201d her home for raucous commentary on popular culture, round tables of stand-up comedians and celebrity guests.Though the series ran more than 1,000 episodes, Ms. Handler said by its end she was bristling behind the scenes, tired of being constrained by what she felt was E!\u2019s narrow focus on gossip and reality stars.\u201cWe\u2019re on before the Kardashians or after the Kardashians,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re surrounded by people who are nonsense. No one\u2019s coming to this network looking for news or political stories or human interest or global issues. None of the things I\u2019m interested in are being talked about.\u201dWhen she could feel herself losing interest, it was time to pack it in. \u201cIt\u2019s one-dimensional,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I was one-dimensional.\u201d (E! declined to comment for this article.)Ms. Handler said she intended to take the next year off from the industry, and fended off inquiries from other networks (she would not specify which), believing they would never allow her the independence she desired.But after a few conversations with Netflix, Ms. Handler said its lack of experience in the talk-show arena \u2014 and the freedom to experiment that came with it \u2014 were assets. \u201cI\u2019m my own island,\u201d she said. \u201cI have nothing to compete with. It\u2019s exactly where I want to be.\u201dTed Sarandos, Netflix\u2019s chief content officer, said Ms. Handler\u2019s willingness to inject herself into unfamiliar situations and bring a wry humor to these explorations suggested she could carry a show more expansive than \u201cChelsea Lately.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more boring than an interview where the interviewer is the functional expert,\u201d Mr. Sarandos said. \u201cWhat you want is somebody who\u2019s super-curious and, in Chelsea\u2019s case, remarkably funny. At the end of the day, the show is anchored on Chelsea and her comedy.\u201dAs for Ms. Handler\u2019s spur-of-the-moment nature, Mr. Sarandos said: \u201cIt\u2019s the most exciting part. You don\u2019t want to try too hard to contain that spontaneity, because great things come out of it.\u201dIn Ms. Handler\u2019s personal office, on the fourth floor of the David Lean Building at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City, Calif., hangs a motivational poster of sorts. It reads, \u201cYou are remembered for the rules you break.\u201d(When a departing Rosti customer told Ms. Handler, \u201cI like martinis, too,\u201d Ms. Handler grumbled audibly: \u201cPeople like to tell me they like alcohol. Oh, O.K. Glad to know it.\u201d)She has been open about past relationships that have captured the public\u2019s fascination, whether longer term, with Ted Harbert, the former E! networks president and now NBC Broadcasting chairman, or shorter lived, with the rapper 50 Cent.Even as an increasingly prominent face for an increasingly prominent content service, Ms. Handler has no qualms about posting partly nude photos of herself to her social media feeds, and makes no apologies for doing so.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to see my boobs, you can unfollow me on Instagram,\u201d she said.With a similar candor, Ms. Handler stripped bare the homogeneity of late-night TV, where she said a new generation of hosts had brought little innovation to the genre. \u201cThere are 10 or 11 guys doing what used to be done by two guys,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not interesting.\u201dIn particular, Ms. Handler criticized Stephen Colbert, the former star of Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cThe Colbert Report,\u201d who took over from David Letterman at CBS\u2019s \u201cLate Show\u201d in September.\u201cLook what\u2019s going on with Stephen Colbert and that show,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is that? He\u2019s being himself and he\u2019s not. He didn\u2019t go in and make a different show. He\u2019s just following in the footsteps of someone else.\u201d (A press representative for Mr. Colbert declined to comment.)Now the burden is on Ms. Handler, who is being paid a reported $10 million salary (a figure her representatives declined to confirm), to show that she can do something different. At her disposal she\u2019ll have a series unencumbered by commercial breaks or running times, though each episode will be around 30 minutes long.For the past few months, Ms. Handler and her producers have been busily producing field segments far and wide, trying to find topics that are timely but approaches that are evergreen, for segments that will appeal to viewers in the United States as well as the nearly 200 other countries where Netflix is available.Bill Wolff, the executive producer of \u201cChelsea,\u201d said his role at this stage was to help Ms. Handler \u201cidentify compelling material and stories which make sense with her comedic mechanism.\u201dAs Mr. Wolff, a former executive producer of \u201cThe View\u201d and \u201cThe Rachel Maddow Show\u201d explained, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to be known about Chinese farm subsidies and how they affect the American worker \u2014 what can Chelsea do to talk about that? Is that something she\u2019s really interested in?\u201d\u201cChelsea, sitting in a room, just talking to one person, is not really what we do,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s Chelsea engaged. Chelsea out in the world. Chelsea doing stuff.\u201dPinned to an office wall behind Mr. Wolff were some 50 index cards representing pieces Ms. Handler had already filmed on subjects like the so-called \u201cgig economy\u201d (working as a Lyft driver or taking furniture-assembly assignments from TaskRabbit); and on trips to Moscow and Mexico City. Another recent trip to Florida had yielded segments tied to the 2016 presidential election, like one where Ms. Handler travels on a \u201csouls to the polls\u201d trip with a black church group to illuminate the practice of early voting.At a nearby soundstage on the Sony lot, work was underway on a modular set where Ms. Handler will record segments in front of a live audience, \u00e0 la \u201cChelsea Lately,\u201d including one-on-one interviews and panel discussions.But Ms. Handler said she wants to avoid inviting celebrities just to promote their projects, and would rather emulate hosts like Dick Cavett, \u201cwhen he would put on Janis Joplin with Henry Kissinger,\u201d she said. (Even so, Ms. Handler has also taped a dinner party with actors from the comic-book movie \u201cCaptain America: Civil War.\u201d)Netflix says it has the capability to post episodes of \u201cChelsea\u201d within hours after they are completed. Still, Mr. Sarandos said, \u201cMost people are going to watch it a day or two later, a week or two later, or even a month or two later. And the show is built for that. Meaning that it\u2019s topical, but it\u2019s not a melting ice cube.\u201dGetting Netflix viewers regularly watching a topical show is \u201ca definite break in our normal model,\u201d Mr. Sarandos acknowledged. But, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not really trying to change their habit of coming to Netflix, as much as it is what you do while you\u2019re here.\u201dAsked whether \u201cChelsea\u201d would make content available to share outside the Netflix site, Mr. Sarandos said, \u201cWe\u2019re likely to experiment with ways that we can introduce a broader audience to the show. But it\u2019s not the driver. We\u2019re not trying to create viral moments but we\u2019ll find some.\u201dSome of Ms. Handler\u2019s industry colleagues are confident she will make a smooth transition to her Netflix series and that it will help energize the category.Rob Burnett, a longtime executive producer of Mr. Letterman\u2019s \u201cLate Show,\u201d said that this was no longer a TV era in which \u201cyou got somebody to be a very genial master of ceremonies and it goes on for 30 years.\u201dThe way to make a talk show now, Mr. Burnett said, is to feature someone who can \u201cmake a big splash, and almost by definition, maybe in five years, people are tired of it \u2014 there\u2019s no shame in that.\u201dJo Miller, an executive producer of TBS\u2019s \u201cFull Frontal With Samantha Bee,\u201d said that there was ample room for multiple hosts to cover similar subjects.\u201cLarry Wilmore, Chelsea and we could all do the same topic,\u201d Ms. Miller said. \u201cWe\u2019d have three different points of view and all three would be interesting and funny to watch. There are going to be topics that are perfect Chelsea topics, that she can do better than anybody.\u201dMs. Miller deflected any questions about gender in topical comedy before they could be asked. \u201cIf it\u2019s about our vaginas, I\u2019m going to seriously hang up,\u201d she said, laughing nonetheless. \u201cChelsea\u2019s got a brain. That\u2019s what it\u2019s about.\u201dOn the morning after her taping with Charley, Ms. Handler was in the kitchen of her Bel Air mansion, having her hair and makeup done while she reviewed the script she would be filming that afternoon. Near the home\u2019s front door was a giant book of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll photography, open to a 1970s-era portrait of Bob Dylan; in a den was a vase whose shape was formed from numerous conjoined female breasts.Ms. Handler said at first that she had \u201cno idea\u201d how long her contract with Netflix ran, though when pressed further she said it was \u201ca minimum of three years,\u201d adding that she took the job seriously.\u201cThis is a TV show,\u201d she explained. \u201cI would take a marriage more lightly.\u201dWhatever the duration, Ms. Handler cautioned that \u201cChelsea\u201d \u201cwon\u2019t be the show that I want, probably, the first or second day. It\u2019ll take three months for it to be where I\u2019m like, \u2018This is great. This is what I want to do.\u2019\u201d\u201cBy the way,\u201d she added, \u201cit becomes clearer and clearer as the show gets closer and closer.\u201dWhile her dogs Chunk and Tammy strolled in and out of the kitchen, Ms. Handler pointed to them and said, \u201cThat\u2019s what you do when you don\u2019t have children.\u201dCompared to humans, she said, \u201cDogs can\u2019t talk, and that\u2019s a whole big bonus.\u201dReminded that babies do not talk either, Ms. Handler replied, \u201cYeah, but then they don\u2019t shut up for the rest of their lives.\u201dA picture caption last Sunday with an article about the comedian Chelsea Handler reversed the identities of the two women shown working on her makeup and hair.

You haven\u2019t heard this one quite this way before.The series opens with a fantasy sequence: Ms. Bamford, playing a version of herself, cavorts in a pitch-perfect \u201970s-vintage hair-products commercial. (\u201cA lady\u2019s got to be ready for when it happens. And right now, it\u2019s happening!\u201d) She\u2019s shaken out of her reverie by a production worker, who tells her she needs to get to work on her show \u2014 namely, the one that we\u2019re watching.Within that show, Maria\u2019s TV reality is something like her biographical reality: She\u2019s a comedian and actress in Los Angeles who had a career breakthrough, then a breakdown. (In the first episode, she installs a bench in front of her house to connect with her community, something the real Ms. Bamford did.)Now \u2014 after a stint in recovery back home in Duluth, Minn. \u2014 she\u2019s gingerly creeping back into a routine with the help of her sad-sack manager, Bruce Ben-Bacharach (Fred Melamed), and her friends Dagmar (Bridget Everett) and Larissa (Lennon Parham). When Bruce suggests going after TV roles, she says she\u2019d rather start in smaller venues: \u201cAlone in my living room, or a vintage eyeglass shop.\u201dThe show\u2019s creators, Pam Brady (\u201cSouth Park\u201d) and Mitch Hurwitz (\u201cArrested Development\u201d), have constructed a multipurpose fun house; we jump about in time and flit from meta-show to memoir to hallucination. When Maria lunches with a blustery agent (Ana Gasteyer, in delicious overdrive), she briefly turns into a lamb. When she goes home to her parents (Ed Begley Jr. and Mary Kay Place) and walks up to her childhood house, she\u2019s momentarily played by a small girl.There\u2019s no explanation for either visual; they just render her perspective concrete. Maria explains the show\u2019s format more explicitly in the pilot for Patton Oswalt, who plays himself playing a bicycle cop. He has one request: Please don\u2019t do standup in the show \u2014 every comedian who gets a sitcom does that!Of course, she does it. (Arguably, all the fourth-wall breaking is the more distracting device.) But there\u2019s more to \u201cLady Dynamite\u201d than fun and gamesmanship.Ms. Bamford, at least her persona, is decidedly breakable. So much standup is about the projection of toughness, even if it\u2019s a neurotic kind \u2014 the willingness to go there and damn the consequences. Ms. Bamford builds her work on fragility. (The title \u201cLady Dynamite\u201d isn\u2019t explained, at least in the four episodes Netflix previewed, but it seems ironic; her volatility is more implosive than explosive.)That affect is in her physical presence, as when she jokes in the episode about her unlikeliness as a TV star: \u201cI\u2019m a 45-year-old woman who\u2019s clearly sun-damaged! My skin is getting softer, yet my bones are jutting out, so I\u2019m half-soft, half-sharp!\u201d It\u2019s in her voice, an apologetic Midwestern quiver that sounds as if it\u2019s trying to pack itself into a box.But Ms. Bamford\u2019s brittleness is deceptive; she\u2019s a canny, nimble performer gifted at shifting tones midsentence. (She delivers the phrase \u201chalf-soft, half-sharp\u201d like it\u2019s a tagline in a commercial.) In the fourth episode, Maria impresses a date by adopting a confident Brahmin drawl, pretending that her real voice was an act. \u201cThat shrill, horrible voice was hilarious!\u201d he says. \u201cCan you imagine?\u201d she answers. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a disability!\u201dThe closest comparison for \u201cLady Dynamite\u201d might be the surreal-but-sweet \u201cSarah Silverman Program\u201d (on which Ms. Bamford appeared). There are also traces of Ms. Brady\u2019s alma mater \u201cSouth Park\u201d (a filthy ad for Japanese noodles in the second episode) and Mr. Hurwitz\u2019s pun-happy \u201cArrested Development.\u201d (Maria gets a job on what she thinks is \u201cLocked Up Abroad\u201d but turns out to be a misogynistic reality show called \u201cLock Up a Broad.\u201d)But \u201cLady Dynamite\u201d has its own bizarre-sincere voice and its own dream logic. It\u2019s something else, in a good way: a journey to the center of Ms. Bamford\u2019s mind that dives through fantasy after loopy fantasy and emerges with something real.Advertisement"}

I mean your brain.As for the sources of \u201cIncognito,\u201d well, just take a look at the lengthy list of inspirational books cited in the program for this Manhattan Theater Club production, which have titles such as \u201cThe Paradoxical Brain,\u201d \u201cThe Making of Memory: From Molecules to Mind\u201d and \u201cCase Studies in Neuropsychological Rehabilitation.\u201d It\u2019s reading matter that might well appear on the bookshelves of many of the play\u2019s dramatis personae. (I may be excused for using Latin in this context, don\u2019t you think?)The cast of \u201cfactional\u201d characters (many inspired by real people) embraces a variety of clinical researchers, scientists and psychologists, as well as a lawyer or two and a duplicitous magazine writer, all in pursuit of the elusive knowledge of how the brain works. Then there\u2019s the posthumous Einstein, of course, and his querulous descendants and the keeper of his brain.Most touchingly, there are the amnesiacs whom the doctors study, men whose memories reach back only to the moment before; and those nonamnesiacs \u2014 at least by clinical definition \u2014 who will themselves to forget through alcohol, drugs or plain old denial. Mr. Payne makes it clear that science and sentimentality need not be mutually exclusive.The script\u2019s diverse figures (21 in total) are embodied by an exceptionally supple ensemble of four: Geneva Carr, Charlie Cox, Heather Lind and Morgan Spector, who shift among their identities with crisply delineating stances and accents. They assemble on Scott Pask\u2019s universal conference room of a set (with nuanced lighting by Ben Stanton), and preface the play\u2019s three memory-themed parts \u2014 \u201cEncoding,\u201d \u201cStoring,\u201d \u201cRetrieving\u201d \u2014 with precise, ritualistic dances of cryptic semaphore gestures (choreographed by Peter Pucci).It feels right that so few should incarnate so many, since one of Mr. Payne\u2019s implicit points here is that we\u2019re all siblings under the skull. That philosophy means you\u2019re likely to identify with every one of these characters, all groping for certain knowledge and all destined to be thwarted. The most celebrated \u2014 and reviled \u2014 of the lot is the Princeton pathologist, Thomas Harvey (a piquantly, feverishly defensive Mr. Spector), who winds up schlepping Einstein\u2019s brain all over the place (often in the trunk of his car) and never does manage to crack its (metaphoric) contents.Sorry. I had to pause, both to recover from brain freeze and to stop myself from committing a spoiler. Some mysteries, the kind pursued on tabloid television shows, do indeed find their solutions in \u201cIncognito.\u201d It\u2019s the greater scientific ones that continue to strike baffled awe in the minds of those who should know best about how minds work.This means that \u201cIncognito\u201d doesn\u2019t achieve the raw emotional force of the more narrowly focused \u201cConstellations.\u201d But as befits a work about the vagaries of memory, Mr. Payne\u2019s multilayered works remains in your mind, challenging our most fundamental notions of autonomous selfhood.As one of the play\u2019s neuropsychologists puts it: \u201cOur brains are constantly, exhaustively working overtime to give us the illusion that we\u2019re in control, but we\u2019re not. The brain builds a narrative to steady us from moment to moment.\u201dThat is essentially what Mr. Payne has built for us here, with grace and dexterity. What gives this work its distinctive impact, though, is the vertiginous views it affords of the roiling, impenetrable depths that always lie below.Advertisement"}

Robert Taro (G\u00e9rard Depardieu), mayor of Marseille for 20 years, is ready to pass on power to his slick prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Lucas Barr\u00e8s (Beno\u00eet Magimel). But Taro\u2019s apprentice turns on him, colluding with the mob to scotch plans for Taro\u2019s crowning achievement, a casino in the city\u2019s Vieux-Port. Why? Because, Barr\u00e8s sneers: \u201cReal power isn\u2019t given. It\u2019s taken!\u201d (Netflix offers the series with English dubbing or subtitles. Neither renders the writing any more original.)Taro re-enters the election. The battle enfolds his long-suffering wife, Rachel (G\u00e9raldine Pailhas), and his journalist daughter (St\u00e9phane Caillard) and reveals Barr\u00e8s as a lizardy, omnisexual manipulator. Deals are struck, backs stabbed and pants dropped, much like those you\u2019ve seen on a dozen angst-by-the-numbers American series, but with more cigarette smoking.\u201cMarseille\u201d had the raw material to work with. Mr. Depardieu, with his lumbering frame and bear-browed intensity, is built to be a Tony Soprano-style antihero. And the city could have been a perfect Mediterranean setting for a political story of modern Europe, with its tensions involving immigration, culture clashes and the rise of the right wing.But Taro never becomes more than a generic machine pol, and the show\u2019s politics are shallow, the city\u2019s Muslim population represented mostly by cartoonish street thugs. (There\u2019s a nod at multiculturalism in the vaguely Middle Eastern theme music, by the Oscar-winning composer Alexandre Desplat.)\u201cMarseille\u201d becomes loopier and more ridiculous as it goes \u2014 with telenovela incidental music to match \u2014 introducing a wrong-side-of-the-tracks love affair, a bananas secret-identity twist and a plan to have gangbangers rustle up fraudulent votes from corpses (sometimes by creating the corpses).Unfortunately, \u201cMarseille\u201d is too self-serious to reach a fun \u201cScandal\u201d level of insanity. But it\u2019s instructive as a mirror of American high-gloss dramas, some of which have developed their own tics and formulas \u2014 shock, testosterone, easy cynicism \u2014 that are as internationally replicable as any police procedural\u2019s.And at least it allows Americans and Europeans to be united in the cultural experience that this kind of TV makes possible in any language.

{"Headline": "Warren Buffett Stake Suggests Apple Is All Grown Up", "Date": "2016-05-19", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseWith this week\u2019s imprimatur from the legendary investor Warren Buffett, it should now be official: Apple, the world\u2019s largest company by market capitalization and a symbol of American technological innovation, is a \u201cvalue\u201d stock.That may prove to be a decidedly mixed blessing.Mr. Buffett is the world\u2019s most prominent and successful proponent of value investing \u2014 an approach that seeks stocks that are undervalued and sell for less than their \u201cintrinsic value,\u201d as Benjamin Graham put it his 1949 classic \u201cThe Intelligent Investor.\u201d Mr. Buffett credits Mr. Graham with shaping his own approach to investing.\u201cWe\u2019ve just looked at it again,\u201d said Bill Smead, who manages the Smead Value Fund, one of the most successful large-cap value mutual funds over the last five years, according to Morningstar. \u201cAnybody that discounts the thinking at Berkshire Hathaway does so at their peril, in my opinion.\u201dValue stocks are typically unpopular among many investors, their shares often battered by disappointing short-term revenue and earnings results. They usually trade at very low price-to-earnings ratios, a common valuation measure. Nonetheless, some academic studies have suggested that over time, they outperform other stocks, in part because expectations are so low.Apple \u201cis going to attract more value investors,\u201d said Toni Sacconaghi, a senior analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein who covers Apple. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for beaten-down stocks with negative sentiment. Apple has traded below a market multiple for years and sentiment has become increasingly pessimistic, especially over the past month.\u201dMr. Sacconaghi has a buy recommendation on the stock, \u201cnot because we believe this will be a high-growth company going forward, but because the current price is discounting a decline in cash flow forever, and we think that\u2019s overly pessimistic.\u201dAccording to the market research firm Thomson Reuters Lipper, just 69 of 357 actively managed value funds in the United States \u2014 fewer than 20 percent \u2014 currently hold positions in Apple.That\u2019s because Apple has long been considered a quintessential growth stock: one of the glamorous high-flying cousins to dowdy value stocks. Growth investors think growth stocks are undervalued, too, because they expect their earnings to grow faster (often much faster) than other investors recognize.As a result, valuation measures for growth stocks can go sky-high. In two prominent growth-stock examples, shares of Facebook trade at a price-earnings ratio of about 73, and Netflix at about 312. (The price-earnings average for stocks in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is currently about 24.)This week Apple\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio was just over 10.If Apple is now a value stock, though, plenty of growth investors haven\u2019t gotten the message. Among actively managed growth funds, 249 of 619, or 40 percent, hold Apple shares, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper. That\u2019s more than the 230 growth funds that owned Apple stock in 2014.Should growth funds suddenly decide that Apple no longer meets their criteria, there could be a mass exodus that would be only partly offset by new purchases from value investors.Some prominent value investors aren\u2019t convinced Apple really is a value stock, despite Mr. Buffett\u2019s blessing, or that its stock price is significantly below its intrinsic value. (Intrinsic value considers all aspects of a business, including both tangible and intangible factors.)That means Apple could fall into the neutral zone of stocks that are neither growth \u2014 because they aren\u2019t growing fast enough \u2014 or value, because they\u2019re still not cheap enough.\u201cApple is extraordinarily cheap, but it\u2019s never been a value stock in the traditional sense,\u201d said Bruce Greenwald, who runs the value investing program at Columbia Business School and is a co-author of \u201cValue Investing: From Graham to Buffett and Beyond\u201d (Wiley, 2001).\u201cValue investing has always focused primarily on asset value,\u201d Professor Greenwald told me. Apple\u2019s book value, or asset value, of $130 billion isn\u2019t even close to its market capitalization of about $515 billion.That means, in theory, that other companies could replicate Apple\u2019s assets at relatively low cost, produce rival products and undermine Apple\u2019s enviably high profit margins.Tech companies typically have low asset values relative to their share prices \u2014 one reason Mr. Buffett and other value investors long shunned the sector \u2014 but their patented technologies and intellectual property nonetheless often create formidable barriers to entry by competitors.For an extraordinarily high-profit-margin technology company like Apple, the question is whether there are such \u201cmoats,\u201d as value investors like to put it, that will continue to protect it from these competitive threats.\u201cThat\u2019s always been the issue with Apple,\u201d Professor Greenwald said. \u201cHow sustainable are these profit levels and how big are the barriers? The fear with Apple is that it will get overwhelmed by new entry and new competitors. The moat doesn\u2019t seem that big. It\u2019s not just giant rivals like Samsung, but smaller companies that can survive with even a small share of the smartphone market.\u201dMr. Smead told me this week he had not added Apple to his value fund\u2019s holdings, even though the stock is so cheap that it meets many of his fund\u2019s investing criteria.\u201cOver the past five or six years, when Apple was doing so well, we joked that we were the best-performing large-cap fund that didn\u2019t own Apple,\u201d Mr. Smead said. \u201cNot that we didn\u2019t wrestle with it many times.\u201d\u201cOur difficulty has been that we don\u2019t understand what kind of moat protects their technology over the next 10 years,\u201d Mr. Smead continued. \u201cThat\u2019s the main problem. The other is that, given Apple\u2019s huge success and its sheer magnitude, it needs a monstrous new product or enhancement of an existing product to move the needle on growth.\u201dFor their part, many growth investors were startled on April 26 when Apple reported its first quarterly revenue drop since 2003. Both revenue and earnings fell short of analyst estimates, and Apple shares plunged 8 percent in one day. They rallied some this week on news of the Berkshire Hathaway investment, but are still down sharply from where they were as recently as mid-April.But Apple still has defenders among growth investors.At the end of the year, Apple was the second-largest holding in the Upright Growth Fund, the top-performing large-cap growth fund so far this year, according to Morningstar.\u201cApple\u2019s best and fastest growing days may be behind us,\u201d David Chiueh, Upright Growth\u2019s president and fund manager, told me. \u201cBut even growth-oriented funds like ours don\u2019t just contain high-growth stocks with 35-50 percent growth rates in our portfolio.\u201dHe said such rapid growth was not sustainable, and added that he was happy with companies that showed \u201csolid 8 percent to 12 percent earnings growth,\u201d a category in which he included Apple. \u201dGive them some time and they will show outstanding performance,\u201d he said.Mr. Chiueh said he was also encouraged that Apple had stepped up its spending on research and development, suggesting that new products with strong growth prospects might still be in the offing.At some fund families, Apple seems to be both a value and a growth stock, even though that seems contradictory. At the fund giant Vanguard, Apple is a major holding in the Vanguard Windsor and Windsor II funds (both value funds) and the Vanguard Morgan Growth Fund and US Growth Fund. A Vanguard spokeswoman declined to comment.All of which suggests that when it comes to Apple, \u201cvalue\u201d and \u201cgrowth\u201d may be in the eye of the beholder.Still, Mr. Buffett\u2019s announcement this week underscores that Apple\u2019s once sizzling growth has slowed, and suggests it may well be on the inexorable path from growth to value stock.That\u2019s not an especially good portent for investors. Among technology companies that have already made the same transition, Professor Greenwald cited IBM, Intel, Cisco, Microsoft and Dell, companies whose share prices, after great rocket rides, have mostly languished in recent years. (Dell was taken private in 2013.)For those who failed to buy the stock early enough, \u201cas investments, they all turned out pretty badly,\u201d he noted.Berkshire Hathaway also disclosed this week that it had increased the stake in IBM it first acquired in 2011. IBM shares have declined over the period, but by Mr. Buffett\u2019s long-term standards, the investment is still too new to judge.\u201cIf you believe the iPhone will be the global standard in 25 years, you\u2019d buy\u201d Apple stock, Professor Greenwald said. But many value investors have already seen where smartphones can go, \u201cwhich is where PCs have already gone.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Oettinger, the European commissioner in charge of the digital economy, said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cWith these new rules, we will uphold media pluralism.\u201dSuch rules already exist for traditional broadcasters, like the BBC in Britain and the TF1 Group in France. On average, they pay the equivalent of millions of dollars each year, or roughly 20 percent of their annual revenue in the countries where they operate, to support local content.European policy makers said that online streaming rivals currently invested only around 1 percent of their annual revenue in local content. Netflix has been able to sidestep existing funding rules, most notably in France, because the company\u2019s European headquarters are in the Netherlands.Streaming services will also be required to ensure that at least 20 percent of their online content is from Europe, and that those movies and television programs are given prominence in their digital catalogs. A report funded by the European Commission recently found that both Netflix and Apple already met this requirement.The commission\u2019s digital plans are subject to the approval of the European Parliament and individual member states, a lengthy process that could lead to significant changes.Europe\u2019s proposals on digital services are only the beginning.The European Commission said on Wednesday that it would also propose new copyright rules in the fall that could force companies like Google to pay online publishers when using their content, including in its news aggregation service Google News.Officials also said that they were still reviewing potential new rules to control how so-called online platforms like Facebook and Amazon operate in the 28-member bloc.European officials said they were looking into making it easier for people to move their digital information between online platforms by the end of the year, giving them greater control over data that companies collected on their daily digital lives.\u201cI want online platforms and the audiovisual and creative sectors to be powerhouses in the digital economy,\u201d said Andrus Ansip, the European Commission vice president in charge of the region\u2019s digital single market proposals. \u201cThey need the certainty of a modern and fair legal environment: That is what we are providing today.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In addition, Univision\u2019s sister network UniM\u00e1s will televise \u201cClub de Cuervos,\u201d the Spanish-language Netflix original series.Both series made their debut on Netflix last year, and the Univision networks will broadcast the first seasons of the programs in advance of the second seasons, which will be available exclusively on Netflix later this year. \u201cNarcos\u201d is about Latin American drug kingpins in the late 1980s, and \u201cClub de Cuervos,\u2019\u2019 about a soccer team, is Netflix\u2019s first Spanish-language original series.Netflix got its start streaming television programs that it acquired from traditional TV networks long before the company started making its own series.This will be among the few times that a Netflix original series will be shown on a traditional television network after a debut on a streaming service. (Netflix tested a similar model earlier this year, when the first two episodes of its new French drama \u201cMarseilles\u201d were shown on TF1 in France.)Terms were not disclosed, but one person with knowledge of the deal who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that Univision was paying residuals to performers and that Netflix was not paying anything for the promotion.That is significant because TV networks typically pay large sums for the rights to distribute programing from other outlets, something Univision will not have to do in this deal. At the same time, it will most likely need to pour millions of dollars into marketing campaigns for the shows, saving Netflix that cost. This relationship shows how both sides are seeking to benefit from the deal and innovate their business models.\u201c\u2018Narcos\u2019 is a huge global success on Netflix, and sampling the series to every single Spanish-speaking living room in the U.S. will give additional viewers the opportunity to fall in love with its unique storytelling,\u201d Ted Sarandos, the chief content officer at Netflix, said in a statement. \u201cPromoting these original shows on Univision is a great way to further reach Hispanic audiences and help them discover Netflix.\u201dThe announcement coincided with Univision\u2019s upfront presentation in New York, highlighting its evolution from its roots as the Spanish-language broadcaster into a multicultural media company that incorporates traditional broadcast, cable television and digital outlets. Univision spotlighted its fresh programming across four categories, comedy, sports, music and drama.Also on Tuesday, Netflix and Univision announced that they would co-produce a new \u201cEl Chapo\u201d drama series, based on the life story of the notorious Mexican drug lord Joaquin Guzm\u00e1n. In the United States, the series will be shown on UniM\u00e1s in 2017 before appearing on Netflix. Outside the United States, the show will make its debut exclusively on Netflix.\u201c\u2018El Chapo\u2019 is a great example of how Univision continues to innovate and evolve with premium storytelling formats,\u201d Randy Falco, chief executive of Univision Communications, said in a statement.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018The Good Wife\u2019: A Broadcast Gem Fades Away", "Date": "2016-05-05", "News": "Supported byThe final season of \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d found Alicia Florrick (Julianna Margulies), after a failed stint in politics, rebooting her law career by working in the Chicago bond court. Serving the indigent, she had scant seconds to consult with clients, get the facts, make a plan. Then it was on to the next \u2014 bang bang, no time to fuss or look back.Bond court was a comedown for Alicia, once an elite lawyer. It was also a metaphor, if unintentional, for broadcast TV. That, too, is a kind of piecework.The show\u2019s creators, Robert and Michelle King, turned out 22 or 23 episodes a season on CBS, for seven years. Their peers at HBO or Netflix \u2014 the white-shoe firms of the TV world \u2014 might make half that many, allowing more time for planning and polishing.While the networks had all but ceded ambitious drama to the cable channels, \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d competed with them backward, in heels and twice as fast. It was swaggeringly proud of this, taunting cable with the show-within-the-show \u201cDarkness at Noon,\u201d a parody of pay TV\u2019s sour testosterone-and-pain cocktails.Of course, TV is not Olympic diving. Viewers judge the product, not the degree of difficulty. \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d sometimes showed its strains: plots suddenly abandoned, midseason course corrections, personnel issues (e.g., whatever Nameless Thing We Shall Never Speak Of that kept Ms. Margulies and Archie Panjabi from sharing screen time until Ms. Panjabi was finally written off).But the sheer volume allowed it to be a TV portmanteau, several shows in one. It was a tart backroom-politics story. It was a tragic romance and one of the funniest shows on TV. It was fascinated with technology, building a universe of fictional tech companies (ChumHum! Scabbit!) and basing cases on Bitcoin and N.S.A. surveillance.Above all, it was Alicia\u2019s story. We met her standing by her husband, the state\u2019s attorney Peter Florrick (Chris Noth), as he was taken down by a sex scandal. Hence the title \u2014 but she was more than a wife, and not dully good. Re-entering the law, at a firm whose partners included her old flame Will Gardner (Josh Charles), she applied her political skills, including the ability to make moral trade-offs.Alicia was an unusual network TV protagonist: enigmatic, shrewd, controlled. (She was also an open atheist, another rarity on TV.) She had passions, but unlike the male antiheroes of cable, she didn\u2019t have the luxury of letting them spew volcanically. In court and in the media, \u201cSaint Alicia\u201d had to manage her presentation.She was a private person for whom little was allowed to be private \u2014 not even her for-show marriage to Peter, now the governor. In the penultimate episode, she prepared him to testify in another scandal trial, again involving an alleged affair. Irritated at her grilling, he snapped, \u201cAt what point are we playing husband and wife here, and at what point lawyers?\u201d Her answer: \u201cAll points.\u201dBeing herself \u2014 her selves \u2014 was work, and it was constant. No wonder she kept so much red wine on hand.In the courtroom, \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d saw the law as the exercise of power, for good, for ill or for money. Like \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d it believed power does not accrue to saints. When its principals were accused of wrongdoing \u2014 Peter, Will, Alicia herself \u2014 it would allow the possibility that they might be guilty and that we might be rooting for them to get off anyway.It could be dark, but not dour. It was restless and excited, like a news junkie with too many browser tabs open, jittering from topic to topic, plot to plot. This sometimes induced whiplash, but it kept the series unpredictable. (The aesthetic of play extended to its cold opens, which rivaled \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d for ingenuity.)It had a vast bench of eccentric recurring judges; it employed so many New York theater actors, it should have come with a Playbill. It was well-written not only for women but also for characters beyond the 18-49 demographic, like Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski), who made getting older \u2014 becoming more capable, accruing power and means \u2014 look sexy and enviable.The series stayed lively longer than most, but it lived too long. It sustained collateral damage from the gunshot that killed off Will, after Mr. Charles decided to leave the show. For a while, the death \u2014 and Alicia\u2019s prolonged wrestling with grief and what might have been \u2014 deepened the drama.But the Kings never seemed to figure where to go from there. Alicia ran for Peter\u2019s old state\u2019s attorney job, which might have given the series a vital late-life reboot. (Not to mention the timely resonance with Hillary Clinton running for the office in which her own husband survived a sex scandal.)Instead the series stepped back and reset its premise, having Alicia strike out on her own (again) and rejoin the firm (again). Even the romantic subplots of the last years felt like do-overs, a flirtation with her fellow lawyer Finn Polmar (Matthew Goode), then a fling with Jason Crouse (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), a laconic, bearded sex cowboy straight out of a fan-fictioneer\u2019s dreams.Did \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d need to replace Will at all? Not to deny Alicia a good time, but the show\u2019s most interesting relationship was always between her and her hard-to-know self.\u201cThe Good Wife\u201d finally couldn\u2019t transcend the limits of broadcast TV \u2014 down to the pressure to give the audience what it\u2019s used to. But it did great work trying. And its medium may have been the most fitting one for a series that was, beginning to end, about compromising in an imperfect world.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In an Era of Streaming, Cinema Is Under Attack", "Date": "2016-04-29", "News": "Supported byHow quaint it all sounds. Ebert\u2019s words testify to the lingering power of the old \u2014 digitally stored and projected motion pictures are technically neither \u201cprints\u201d nor \u201cfilms\u201d \u2014 and also to the speed with which the new passes into obsolescence. For the studios, DVDs were a boon to the bottom line, and to consumers they were collectible tokens of movie love. In any case, they didn\u2019t last long and are now increasingly niche items rather than commodities for mass consumption. Why clutter your shelves with special editions of last year\u2019s blockbusters when a whole mobile cinematheque is a few clicks and swipes away?It\u2019s often idealized as a space of collective reverence and aesthetic bliss, where photochemical alchemy unfolds in room full of worshipers. But how often does that really happen? Most of the time aren\u2019t we just eating unhealthy snacks and watching a digital file in obnoxious company? Couldn\u2019t we just do that at home?The key word here is people. After all, what makes movies a mass art is that they are made on a mass scale for a mass audience, which is true even for work that\u2019s largely exhibited on the festival and art-cinema circuit. What happens to that art when we begin to remove, well, people from part of the equation? What happens to its democratic promise, which may be a fantasy at best, a lie at worst, but remains nonetheless? When I think about Mr. Parker\u2019s Screening Room, I flash on the image of Howard Hughes in Mr. Scorsese\u2019s film \u201cThe Aviator,\u201d watching films all alone in his private theater, safely isolated from the contamination known as other human beings.For some, part of the allure of Screening Room, clearly, is that it would allow them to see first-run titles in Hughes-like isolation. There seems to be a high level of dissatisfaction with moviegoing, much of it focused on other people\u2019s behavior, including texting. This brings to mind the days of early cinema, when theaters issued audiences dos and don\u2019ts like take off your hats, don\u2019t spit, don\u2019t talk. (D. W. Griffith even made a film mocking women\u2019s haberdashery: \u201cThose Awful Hats.\u201d)In the postwar years, the rise of car culture and the growth of the suburbs planted drive-ins in wide-open spaces, while grindhouses, art houses and campus film societies flourished in the cities and college towns. Moviegoing has never been just one thing.And people are still doing it! The M.P.A.A. notes that theater attendance increased by around 4 percent in North America in 2015, after wobbling and dipping in the previous few years. The highly scientific explanation for this, as you and I have discussed, is that the studios released a lot of movies that people were eager to leave the house to see, including \u201cJurassic World,\u201d \u201cTrainwreck,\u201d \u201cStraight Outta Compton\u201d and \u201cInside Out.\u201dWe\u2019re increasingly able to bring the movies home, and also to bring the comforts of home with us wherever we go. Moviegoing is not what it used to be, for sure, but I suspect it will flourish as long as it answers to the primal human urge to get out of the house.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Crowdfunding Rules Let the Small Fry Swim With Sharks", "Date": "2016-05-14", "News": "Supported byStarting Monday, new rules will permit anyone, not just the moneyed, to risk $2,000 a year or more investing in small companies in exchange for a stake in the business. Companies can raise up to $1 million a year this way.It is also an opportunity for start-ups and other small businesses, which can raise money with fairly few regulatory burdens. For instance, small companies seeking less than $500,000 and most first-time issuers will not need to provide audited financial statements, just unaudited ones.That was four years ago. It took a long time to iron out the details, in part because the Securities and Exchange Commission was concerned that ordinary people could lose their life savings because of fraud or na\u00efvet\u00e9.\u201cWhen high-growth companies are looking to raise money, it\u2019s not just for the money,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re also looking for validation, and they want it from venture funds or well-known angels. They won\u2019t get that from a crowdfunding offer.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re building a tribe of women around the world who are passionate about African textiles and want to support these emerging designers,\u201d Ms. Anyadiegwu said.Ms. Anyadiegwu wants to increase her part-time workers\u2019 hours, move her base of operations from Sayreville, N.J., to Atlanta, where she has built a clientele, and do more marketing. To finance that, she\u2019s willing to part with some of her equity in the business.\u201cOur customer base is so engaged,\u201d she said. \u201cThis could be a perfect opportunity for them to participate and be a part of the company in another way.\u201d\u201cWe can build a community around our company. That\u2019s an intangible that you don\u2019t get from private fund-raising,\u201d said Kyle Henson, 23, the company\u2019s chief business officer. He is preparing Rorus to comply with the new securities rules, he said, if it chooses to do a crowdfunding offering.But are the 230 million adult Americans who aren\u2019t millionaires really that interested in becoming do-it-yourself venture capitalists? While supporters cheer the new rules as a democratization of high finance, potentially opening up to the masses deals once reserved for the rich, skeptics worry that regular investors might get only the leftovers.They may dream of discovering the next Facebook. But the most promising companies \u2014 the high-growth ventures delivering the monster returns that keep the entire venture-capital industry afloat \u2014 may also be the ones least likely to bother raising money in small dribs from the crowd, they fear.But what got people excited was the crowdfunding provision allowing companies to raise up to $1 million with few regulatory obstacles.The company caught Mr. Hensch\u2019s eye nearly two years ago, after it raised $1.1 million on Kickstarter. He scoured tech blogs for tidbits, signed up for the company\u2019s newsletter and followed along as executives posted updates from China about their production process.So when Virtuix announced in March that it would crowdfund its next investment round, Mr. Hensch and Ms. Roumagoux jumped in. \u201cI\u2019ve seen where Robert\u2019s recommendations have gone in the market. Typically, when he identifies something early on, it becomes a blockbuster item,\u201d said Ms. Roumagoux, recalling her husband\u2019s early enthusiasm for Tesla, Netflix and a \u201creally neat\u201d search engine called Google.Ms. Roumagoux works as a lawyer, and Mr. Hensch is a real estate business manager. As financiers, \u201cwe\u2019re definitely novices,\u201d she said with a laugh, but both like the idea of diversifying their retirement fund and other investments by gambling on a small portfolio of fledgling technology ventures.Jan Goetgeluk, Virtuix\u2019s founder and chief executive, likes the idea of having hundreds or thousands of stakeholders along for the ride. \u201cThis allows us to turn those fans into true brand advocates. It\u2019s incredibly powerful.\u201dMr. Goetgeluk, a 32-year-old mechanical engineer, had dreamed of becoming an entrepreneur since moving to the United States from Belgium nine years ago. The money he raised from 3,000 backers on Kickstarter funded Virtuix\u2019s early production, and the publicity the campaign created got him a spot pitching his company to a panel of rich investors on \u201cShark Tank\u201d \u2014 where he failed to land a deal.\u201cIf my husband brought this into my house, I would divorce him immediately,\u201d Barbara Corcoran, a real estate entrepreneur, announced on the show.The rules that take effect on Monday make crowdfunding far cheaper and easier for companies to use. But the cost of that concession is a $1 million cap on the amount they can raise in a 12-month period.\u201cWe had no idea that it would take the S.E.C. four years to write all these rules,\u201d Mr. Tommarello said. \u201cWe had to figure out how to stay alive and not go bankrupt.\u201dStill, this isn\u2019t like investing in the stock market. Want to sell Facebook? Just call your broker. Want to sell your shares in Ms. Anyadiegwu\u2019s company, Zuvaa? Well, under the new crowdfunding rules, people must generally hold their shares for at least a year. And even then, there are few marketplaces for finding another buyer.But Ms. Roumagoux, who said she had skimmed the circular, isn\u2019t worried. She and her husband may not be millionaires, but she says they\u2019re financially sophisticated enough to judge the risk that they\u2019re taking.\u201cI know all these rules are there to protect us, but honestly, I don\u2019t think we need the protection,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re relatively young, and this is a long-term investment.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender and Not Appearing in This Movie", "Date": "2016-05-02", "News": "Supported byThe number of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender characters in films released by the seven major Hollywood studios held steady in 2015, but many were included only to be the butt of a joke and an overwhelming majority of them were white or male, according to a new report by GLAAD, formerly known as the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation.The number of female characters dropped while the number of males characters rose, it said, and the amount of racial diversity among L.G.B.T. characters fell sharply after making improvements the year before.Those findings come amid criticism aimed at Hollywood over the lack of racial diversity in film that reached a boiling point earlier this year when no people of color were nominated in the acting categories of the Academy Awards for the second year in a row, spawning the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite.The study reviewed 126 films produced by the seven largest studios \u2014 20th Century Fox, Lionsgate, Paramount, Sony, Universal, Walt Disney and Warner Bros. \u2014 and found that only 22 of them, or 17.5 percent, contained a character that was identified as L.G.B.T.More than three-quarters of those films contained a gay male character while only 23 percent featured a lesbian character and 9 percent featured a character who was bisexual. There was only one film, Warner Bros.\u2019s \u201cHot Pursuit,\u201d that contained a transgender character, the group said.There were no lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender characters in any film produced by Disney or Paramount in 2015.Racial diversity fell sharply in 2015 too, the report said. White characters made up 72.3 percent of the total while people of color made up 25.5 percent, compared with 31.1 percent the year before.The report found 47 gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender characters in films produced by the seven studios, an increase from 28 in 2014.(Because this is Hollywood, one character in 2015, or 2.1 percent of the total, was not human: Fabian, a flamboyant makeup artist who is also an egg, in the Lionsgate film \u201cHuevos: Little Rooster\u2019s Egg-cellent Adventure.\u201d)\u201cLeaving L.G.B.T. people out of the picture \u2014 or including them only as a punch line \u2014 keeps old prejudices alive and creates an unsafe environment, not only here in America, but around the world where most audiences see these depictions,\u201d Ms. Ellis said. \u201cHollywood must do better to improve the messages they are sending.\u201dThe group gave higher marks to programs on the small screens, where streaming services like Netflix and Amazon produced critically acclaimed shows such as \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d and \u201cTransparent\u201d that contain diverse casts of fully realized gay and transgender characters, the report said.Ms. Ellis said that in the future her organization would judge Hollywood based on the standard set by \u201cthe steady and remarkable changes in the television landscape.\u201d\u201cIt is clear that what we once considered \u2018adequate\u2019 from the film industry is no longer adequate at all,\u201d she said. \u201cThe film industry must embrace new stories reflective of the actual world if it wants to remain competitive and relevant.\u201dslide showAdvertisement"}

(The film will be shown in theaters with two breaks, said Jay Jay Nesheim, an ESPN spokeswoman. She also confirmed that though Oscar rules require that documentaries play four times a day in theaters, the academy has agreed that the release plan \u2014 showing on two screens per theater each day \u2014 would be acceptable.)Both series were released in 2015 after the equally exalted first season of \u201cSerial\u201d in 2014, the nonfiction multi-episodic podcast about the murder of a Maryland high school student.There has since been a \u201cdeluge\u201d of single-story, immersive projects being pitched, said Josh Braun, a co-president of Submarine, a film sales and production company. But Mr. Braun, who is shepherding three documentaries that began as features and have been reconceived as series, cautions that most projects \u201cdon\u2019t actually have the requisite material that would sustain a four- or six- or 10-part nonfiction series,\u201d he says. \u201cNot everything works.\u201dHBO doesn\u2019t have another documentary series on its slate, but \u201cone or two\u201d films being produced might turn into series depending on the facts under examination, said Sheila Nevins, the president of HBO Documentary Films. \u201cThe story tells you the length,\u201d she said, adding that feature-length documentaries are still the standard.Although Lisa Nishimura, the vice president for original documentary programming at Netflix, hasn\u2019t been flooded by series pitches, she conceded that her industry can be \u201ctrend oriented\u201d and estimated that about half of her filmmaker meetings include discussions about the possibility of going to a multi-episodic format. Because Netflix is a streaming company, \u201cwe do not have parameters of X number of program hours or traditional restrictions around what needs to fall at a particular time,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can be completely liberated, and we can pass that to our creatives.\u201dMs. Nishimura said that her confidence in the power of multi-episodic documentaries dated to the success of the 13-episode, binge-ready release of Netflix\u2019s fictional drama series \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d in 2013. \u201cThere was no reason to think that wouldn\u2019t hold true for nonfiction as well,\u201d she said.True-crime stories lend themselves to the episodic format because they contain a wealth of minutiae, much of it in case files that filmmakers can pick over, filling hours and providing fodder for audience D.I.Y. detective work that the Internet culture fosters. Trial twists and turns, as well as characters in dire predicaments, can propel dramatic narratives toward a verdict.What distinguishes \u201cO. J.: Made in America\u201d from the recent FX dramatization, \u201cThe People v. O. J. Simpson,\u201d as well as the recent crop of true-crime docuseries, is that it redirects audience attention away from the 1994 murders of Ronald L. Goldman and Nicole Brown and the subsequent trial, in which Mr. Simpson was acquitted. The new film doesn\u2019t ignore them but adds perspective through frank interviews with, among others, two jurors and Mark Fuhrman, the former police detective whose record of racist remarks proved damaging to the prosecution\u2019s case. And a possible explanation is proffered for why those infamous gloves didn\u2019t fit. Still, the murders and trial are largely confined to Episodes 3 and 4.What \u201cO. J.: Made in America\u201d does first is plumb the depths of racial tensions in both athletics and Los Angeles during Mr. Simpson\u2019s lifetime while examining his childhood in San Francisco and evolving racial identity. Mr. Simpson\u2019s skills on the football field are also amply displayed. Mr. Edelman said that ESPN and Mr. Schell were consistently supportive of his longitudinal, \u201cslightly elevated\u201d take on the material.\u201cWe approached this the same way we have approached the \u201830 for 30\u2019 series,\u201d Mr. Schell said, referring to the channel\u2019s award-winning series. \u201cHow can we cover this in a way that isn\u2019t obvious?\u201dAs the ground shifts, even the nomenclature isn\u2019t set. Should \u201cO. J.: Made in America\u201d be called a multi-episodic or docuseries or long-form nonfiction? There is no agreed-upon terminology.\u201cI call it a long movie,\u201d Mr. Edelman says.An article last Sunday about a new ESPN documentary about O.J. Simpson misidentified an ESPN spokeswoman who commented on the project. She is Jay Jay Nesheim, not Betsy Rudnick. The article also misstated the number of movie theaters that will show \u201cO.J.: Made in America.\u201d It will be in two theaters, in New York and Los Angeles \u2014 not in four.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s as if the heart of \u201cFriends\u201d had been transplanted into the body of \u201cTransparent.\u201dThe season opener, written by Ms. Kauffman and Mr. Morris, uses a time-honored sitcom device, the sudden medical emergency, to complicate the action and delay a resolution. (Episodes in Season 1 used the stalled elevator, the funeral of an obscure mutual acquaintance and the medium-Richter California earthquake.) The formulaic situations and the dialogue, caught somewhere between snappy and naturalistic \u2014 you\u2019re always bracing for a laugh track that doesn\u2019t come \u2014 undermine the drama.That \u201cGrace and Frankie\u201d generates real feeling has everything to do with its stars.

But the sequence also revealed that, thanks to some convoluted time-skipping, the incident itself is actually what doomed the character to a life of simple-mindedness, sacrifice and a one-word vocabulary. Hodor is short for \u201cHold the door,\u201d both the last phrase the character ever heard and the one that fried his circuits as a young lad named Wyllis. (It made sense if you saw it, sort of.)Have you gotten used to the idea yet? What? Of being dead and irrelevant? No. I\u2019m used to being irrelevant but being dead is novel, I\u2019ll give it that.So he\u2019s definitely dead?Yeah. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to survive that. As far as I know, put it that way.Any chance he\u2019ll come back as a zombie?There\u2019s always a chance. It\u2019s actually very freeing \u2014 I have a really big mouth and it\u2019s difficult for me to not tell things. The fact that I can watch the rest of the show and not have to hold back because I might let something slip is freeing. But I don\u2019t think he\u2019s coming back.What did you think when you read the script for Sunday\u2019s episode?It was a double-edged sword for me. I really wanted him to have a good send-off. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been many better send-offs on the show so far. But I definitely was a bit weepy when I read it. More so because these guys are my friends, who I work with. It\u2019s going to be strange not seeing them on a professional level.Did the fact that Bran was responsible for not only his death, but also his simple-mindedness change your idea about the nature of their relationship? No it doesn\u2019t. Although Bran was responsible for the whole chain of events that killed Hodor, Hodor didn\u2019t have to hold that door. He wasn\u2019t being warged into at that stage. It was Meera who asked him to hold the door, it wasn\u2019t Bran. He wants to protect the little guy. That\u2019s all he\u2019s ever done. He wants to help \u2014 this is the ultimate helping hand here. I just think he would be happy they could continue without him.How did it feel to finally know what you had been saying for all these years?That was great, man. Because I literally had no idea. All my theories were wrong. So it was nice to know it actually meant something. After all the different meanings I\u2019ve given it over the years, it\u2019s strange to know it actually means \u201chold the door.\u201dWhat was your favorite theory about it?What\u2019s your understanding of what actually fried his brain?Bran has some kind of telekinetic force in his brain that can overtake the electronics of animals and obviously Hodor as well. I think it\u2019s almost like a telephone call with crossed wires. Bran\u2019s in this time-shift mode, he\u2019s hearing Meera say \u201cYou have to warg into Hodor.\u201d I just think Hodor got caught up in this vortex and it fried his circuitry. It\u2019s almost like pressing a reset button on him.So you don\u2019t think he had any sense throughout his life of what his destiny was?I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think he had any sense of what was coming. I don\u2019t think he recognized Bran when he saw him the second time around. He maybe felt some sort of connection to him, which was why the bond was there. But I don\u2019t think he said to himself \u201cOh that\u2019s that little [expletive] from the courtyard, stay away from him. Run!\u201dHow did that final scene change your understanding of Hodor?It didn\u2019t change it at all. Obviously it gave me the answers to the reality of the character, but it was very true to him and to, I hope, the way I played him. There was a lot of humanity there and I think he always had a lot of humanity. I think that\u2019s exactly what Hodor would have wanted. Well, I don\u2019t think he wanted to die. But I think he happily did.Why do you think people are taking Hodor\u2019s death so hard?There\u2019s no one else like Hodor on \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d There\u2019s no other character with that warmth, humanity and a little bit of comic relief. People are taking it badly. He\u2019s just such a nice guy and it\u2019s so rare on this show, and he didn\u2019t deserve it. But that\u2019s just \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d for you. I think it was set up earlier in the episode, Jaqen H\u2019ghar asks Arya something like, \u201cDoes death only come for the wicked and leave good people behind?\u201d Because Hodor is such a good person and he\u2019s about to get slaughtered.It was emotional, man. It was the day either before or after my birthday. It was a really heavy day \u2014 you\u2019ve got these 100-mile-per-hour winds being blown into your face with false snow. I was really holding the door \u2014 there were like eight people pushing from the other side and I was really holding them back. It\u2019s definitely Method acting [laughs]. It was a very intense day but one of the nice things was they let Isaac wrap me. He got to come over and say \u201cMr. Nairn, that\u2019s a wrap.\u201d It was very emotional. It\u2019s always been a little group of us together and it felt like our little group was breaking up. And it\u2019s sad!There\u2019s infinite ways to say it, but it\u2019s not all about the word, man. It\u2019s about body language as well.Do you have a favorite one?My favorite one I think was back in Season 3 and Osha was complaining about, \u201cWhy do we always have to do the work? Why do we build the tent and light the fire while Bran talks to the Reeds?\u201d And I just looked up at her and gave her this sort of \u201cWhy are you telling me this\u201d Hodor. What do you want me to do about it? It was such an obscure \u201cHodor\u201d but everyone got it. It was fantastic.You have other shows and films coming up, as well as your music career. But have you made your peace with the fact that you\u2019ll always be Hodor for many people?Absolutely. Some people say that like it\u2019s a bad thing. To play this iconic character from this historically wonderful series of books \u2014 who wouldn\u2019t take that opportunity and be happy about it? I\u2019m happy to be Hodor forever.Great.But ask me that in 10 years.Advertisement"}

Did he simply become lost while on a solo expedition in the jungle, or was he a victim of foul play? What sets this particular television event apart is that the people doing the searching are Mr. Dial\u2019s parents, Peggy Dial and Roman Dial, a wilderness adventurer.For this mini-series, they have enlisted the help of Kenneth Fornier, a retired member of the military, and Carson Ulrich, a former Drug Enforcement Administration agent. But the Dials had, of course, already searched on their own before the camera crews got involved, so the first episode, apparently retracing ground already covered, feels staged.Things pick up a bit after the discovery of Cody Dial\u2019s backpack, and the focus shifts to the possibility of foul play. But by the end of Episode 2 (only two were made available), the series still gives the unpleasant impression that the searchers are as interested in ratings as they are in a happy resolution.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what they said. (The answers have been edited and condensed.)Three summers ago, they showed [it] at Tanglewood [the Boston Symphony Orchestra\u2019s summer home] with David Newman conducting the orchestra synced to the film. It was absolutely exhilarating. Tanglewood was a place where [the film\u2019s composer Leonard] Bernstein spent so many summers, and seeing the film on the grounds with musicians who probably played under him, and hearing it in the shed alongside 5,000 people, was incredibly moving. As for \u201cJaws,\u201d I love those two notes!

You had all these women who were being funny. I don\u2019t think I laughed harder at a movie in my whole life. And there aren\u2019t a lot of movies where everybody is collectively laughing and walks away talking about moments and feels like they\u2019ve seen something that hasn\u2019t been done before.\u2014 Olivia Munn, star, \u201cX-Men: Apocalypse\u201d (May 27)You kind of can\u2019t go wrong, because it\u2019s summery and it\u2019s inspiring and it\u2019s two badass women driving off a cliff.

{"Headline": "Brazil\u2019s Graft-Prone Congress: A Circus That Even Has a Clown", "Date": "2016-05-14", "News": "Supported byBRAS\u00cdLIA \u2014 One of Brazil\u2019s longest-running spectacles features a dizzying array of characters whose theatrics appear on millions of television sets most nights.The ever-changing cast of 594 includes suspects accused of murder and drug trafficking, aging former soccer players, a judo champion, a country music star and a collection of bearded men who have adopted roles as leaders of a women\u2019s movement.The cast even includes a clown who goes by the name Grumpy.But these are not actors. They are the men and women who serve in the national legislature.More than half of the members of Congress face legal challenges, from cases in auditing court involving public contracts to serious counts like kidnapping or murder, according to Transparency Brazil, a corruption monitoring group.Many of the legislature\u2019s problems stem from the generous rewards to be found in Brazil\u2019s hydra-headed party system, an unwieldy collection of dozens of political organizations whose names and agendas often leave Brazilians scratching their heads.There is the Party of the Brazilian Woman, for instance \u2014 a group whose elected members in Congress are all men.\u201cThe electoral process allows many distortions,\u201d said Su\u00ead Haidar, the party\u2019s founder and president. She sighed, acknowledging that many of the men who join have little interest in promoting women\u2019s rights.One of those who joined the party, Senator H\u00e9lio Jos\u00e9 da Silva Lima, was accused of sexually abusing a young niece last year, though charges were later dropped. \u201cWhat would become of us men if there were no women by our side, to bring us joy and pleasure?\u201d he was quoted as saying in the Brazilian news media when asked about his decision to join the women\u2019s party.The same public fury over endemic corruption and governmental mismanagement that helped drive Ms. Rousseff from power has long been directed at the cabal of politicians, most of them white men, whose penchant for back-room deals and self-enrichment has become part of Brazilian lore.\u201cThe reputation of the political class in Brazil really can\u2019t go any lower,\u201d said Timothy J. Power, a professor of Brazilian studies at Oxford University.Dilma Rousseff, Brazil\u2019s president, is facing removal from office. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the proceedings.\u201cPeople compare the legislature to the \u2018House of Cards,\u2019\u201d he said, referring to the Netflix political drama, \u201cbut I disagree. \u2018House of Cards\u2019 is actually more believable.\u201dWith 28 parties holding seats, the Brazilian Congress is the world\u2019s most fractured, according to Mr. Power. The runner-up, Indonesia\u2019s legislature, has a third fewer parties.\u201cBrazil is not an outlier, it\u2019s a freak,\u201d said Gregory Michener, the director of the public transparency program at Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Get\u00falio Vargas, a university in Rio de Janeiro.Polling has shown that more than 70 percent of Brazilians cannot recall what parties the candidates they elect belong to, and that two-thirds of the electorate has no preference for any party.\u201cThe only thing that\u2019s better than being a political party in Brazil is to be a church,\u201d said Heni Ozi Cukier, a political scientist at the university E.S.P.M. in S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cThey\u2019re opportunists who are looking for something that gives them power, influence, protection.\u201dForming a party requires collecting 500,000 signatures. Mr. Cukier said 62 parties were seeking official recognition, including one named after a soccer team.Although Brazil\u2019s president leads one of the world\u2019s largest countries, he or she must forge coalitions with up to a dozen parties to get legislation passed in Congress. The price of loyalty is often a ministerial post, or three, depending on how many votes the party can deliver.In some instances, cooperation involves the illicit exchange of cash. In 2005, a scandal known as mensal\u00e3o, or big monthly payment, revealed the pervasiveness of such arrangements. To win votes in Congress, the party of President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Ms. Rousseff\u2019s mentor and the standard-bearer of the Workers\u2019 Party, had been paying compliant lawmakers a monthly stipend of $12,000.The most recent graft scandal \u2014 known as Opera\u00e7\u00e3o Lava Jato, or Operation Car Wash \u2014 has proved even bigger, with billions of dollars in bribes directed to political parties from the national oil company, Petrobras. More than 200 people, from business tycoons to party leaders, have been implicated in the scandal, and their numbers are expected to grow.Public fury over the scheme played a pivotal role in the ouster of Ms. Rousseff, who was chairwoman of Petrobras when the kickback arrangement was hatched, though she has not been accused of any wrongdoing. In her impeachment trial, she is accused of a budgetary sleight of hand in an effort to conceal Brazil\u2019s economic troubles and win re-election in 2014 \u2014 not of stealing to enrich herself.The need to form alliances of convenience in Congress can lead to legislative chaos, especially when disgruntled partners bolt from the president\u2019s coalition. Ms. Rousseff, who once enjoyed a wide majority in the lower house, was ultimately knocked aside by the house\u2019s now deposed speaker, Eduardo Cunha, a onetime ally who faces a graft trial.Mr. Cunha\u2019s party, the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, called the P.M.D.B., has become a particular source of outrage in Brazil. Critics say the party, founded five decades ago as an opposition party but tolerated by the nation\u2019s military dictatorship, has become a vast patronage trough for its members, who embrace a wide spectrum of ideologies.The party\u2019s ace is its size, which means that presidents have to enter into a partnership that involves doling out coveted cabinet posts. Ms. Rousseff chose Michel Temer of the P.M.D.B. to be her vice president. This year, he turned against her and withdrew his party from her coalition, paving the way for Ms. Rousseff\u2019s impeachment trial. Mr. Temer, who has been convicted of violating campaign finance limits, is now the nation\u2019s president.Political reform can be challenging, given that legislators must approve undoing the system that protects them. There have been some changes, including a recent law that bars candidates with criminal records from running for office for eight years, and a campaign finance law, scheduled to take effect this year, that limits the influence of corporate money.The crush of Brazilian parties tends to favor celebrity candidates, whose name recognition helps vault them to the top of the ballot heap during elections. The most curious example is Tiririca the Clown, whose stage name translates as Grumpy.In 2010, he ran for the lower house on a lark with the slogan \u201cIt can\u2019t get any worse,\u201d and his campaign literature included this tagline: \u201cWhat does a congressman do? The truth is I don\u2019t know, but vote for me and I\u2019ll tell you.\u201dHe prevailed with more than 1.3 million votes \u2014 nearly twice as many as the next candidate.\u201cAt first it was a joke,\u201d he said of his candidacy. \u201cSo I decided that if so many people believe in me, I would have to give it my best, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\u201dAnna Jean Kaiser contributed reporting from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, and Paula Moura from Bras\u00edlia.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: The Rise of the \u2018Matchmakers\u2019 of the Digital Economy", "Date": "2016-05-20", "News": "Supported byBook EntryMany of the young giants of the digital economy share a common characteristic. They are platforms that provide valued connections among their participants. The nature of those connections and the value they provide vary widely.Both Google and Facebook \u2013 together approaching $1 trillion in market value \u2014 are in the business of connecting advertisers to consumers, but their platforms and business models are very different.Another trillion-dollar pair, Apple and Microsoft, have followed similarly divergent paths in monetizing their respective platforms: Both own operating systems that connect application developers and users. And \u201cplatform\u201d businesses of various stripes seem to represent a disproportionate share of the market\u2019s hot tech start-ups, like Uber, Airbnb, Pinterest and Snapchat.A surprising number of business books have been published in the last few months that seek to explore the origins and implications of the emergence of the platform paradigm. The great virtue of the best of these, \u201cMatchmakers: The New Economics of Multisided Platforms\u201d (Harvard Business Review) by David S. Evans and Richard Schmalensee, is that it reminds us that there is nothing new about multisided platforms \u2013 which the authors call matchmaker businesses.The \u201cnew economics\u201d mentioned in the subtitle refers to what the authors misleadingly call the \u201cdiscovery\u201d of multisided businesses by fellow economists in 2000. Although the research cited was certainly important in understanding the dynamics of multisided markets, advertising-based media businesses have successfully operated in these environments for literally hundreds of years.An old-world media example quickly makes clear the unusual management challenges of operating multisided-platform businesses. To be successful, newspaper and magazine publishers need to attract both readers and advertisers, who represent the two sides of the platform. In most instances, however, to optimize overall profits, publishers must subsidize one side of the market. Rarely does the price of a subscription cover even the incremental cost of printing and distribution of the publication.This does not reflect a rookie mistake but a nuanced understanding of the tradeoffs between circulation and advertising revenue. If managers ignore the interaction between the different sides of a multisided market in developing pricing strategies, they will inevitably arrive at erroneous conclusions. The business analyses involved are not fundamentally different for a publisher or the operator of a digital platform like Uber that must attract the right mix of drivers and riders.But what has changed in the world to make these models apparently so much more prevalent? \u201cMatchmakers\u201d identifies \u201csix turbocharging technologies\u201d that it claims have \u201cturbocharged the ancient matchmaker model.\u201dSpecifically, the authors argue that the combined impact of improvements in computing power, bandwidth, networking and storage capacity have allowed the establishment of \u201ctwo foundational multisided platforms\u201d that support all the others that have rapidly emerged: Internet service providers (who provide the fixed and mobile connections among platform participants) and operating systems (which provide the common language that allow app developers to achieve mass adoption).History aside, the heart of \u201cMatchmakers\u201d is an entrepreneurial playbook of sorts for \u201cbuilding, igniting and operating matchmakers.\u201d The strongest part of the book is the detailed description of diverse platform business models, both new and old, some of which readers might not have even previously thought of as \u201cmatchmakers.\u201dFor instance, South Florida\u2019s upscale Aventura Mall is really a platform for commerce between retailers and shoppers. To succeed, the developer had to take into account land values, local demographics, nearby alternatives, which retailers and entertainment services to target and what and how to charge them, and the physical design. Similar complexity faced the founders of M-Pesa, a mobile money transfer service in Kenya that in the course of three years counted 42 percent of the adult population as registered users and transformed that economy.The problem with many of the books about the rise of the so-called platform economy is that they are filled with an unbridled optimism about the collective attractiveness of these businesses, particularly in their digital incarnations. Sure, they argue, incumbents will be disrupted, but in their stead will be bigger, stronger competitors in winner-take-all markets.They focus on \u201cnetwork effects,\u201d which can create a virtuous circle \u2013 sometimes called a flywheel effect \u2013 as new users on one side of a platform attract more on another and vice versa. The crucial attribute of network effects businesses is that every new participant increases the value of the network to existing participants.Alex Moazed and Nicholas L. Johnson are the consultants turned authors of \u201cModern Monopolies: What It Takes to Dominate the 21st Century Economy\u201d (St. Martins). Their book promises the same \u201cframeworks and insights we use to help our clients become modern monopolies.\u201d In their telling, the history of \u201cplatform capitalism\u201d appears to have started with eBay, which in part explains the inability of their \u201cframeworks\u201d to deliver on the assurance of market domination.\u201cPlatform Revolution: How Networked Markets Are Transforming the Economy and How to Make Them Work For You\u201d (Norton), another book written by industry consultants \u2014 these mostly with day jobs in academia \u2014 provides an even more expansive vision of the \u201crevolution\u201d wrought by the emergence of network effects as \u201cthe Internet-era source of market power,\u201d which \u201cis likely to strengthen a market\u2019s winner take all tendency.\u201dThe book\u2019s authors \u2014 Geoffrey Parker, Marshall W. Van Alstyne and Sangeet Paul Choudary \u2014 argue that the ascension of platform business models requires a fundamental rethinking of things as diverse as basic business strategy and government regulation. Their wide-ranging vision and predictions are undermined by frequent factual errors. For example, Sony does not own Time Warner movie and television studios, and Netflix does not have strong network effects.Even \u201cMatchmakers,\u201d which offers the most balanced picture of the challenges and opportunities of multisided platforms, plays down the structural fragility faced by all of the \u201cturbocharged\u201d matchmakers described. Mr. Evans and Mr. Schmalensee insist that \u201cnetwork effects power all multisided platforms.\u201d What\u2019s more, according to them, the digital developments recounted \u201chave resulted in a huge increase in the power and reach of these effects.\u201d Neither statement is true.First, plenty of multisided platforms do not have any significant network effects to speak of. A popular TV show attracts both viewers and advertisers, but it is the quality of the programming, not the presence of more advertisers, that keeps the audience coming back. TV and cable broadcasting networks, like most ad-based media businesses, are multisided platforms, but they have negligible network effects. Google, the mightiest exception to the digital fragility rule, is a platform business that does not benefit primarily from network effects but rather from traditional economies of scale.Second, the strength of network effects is often a function of the existence of reinforcing competitive advantages like economies of scale and, notably, customer captivity. The digital economy has undermined both of these barriers to entry by lowering both customer switching costs and the fixed-cost base that drives scale economies.So the Aventura Mall benefits from the long-term leases signed by retailers on the one hand and the fact that local shoppers need to go out of their way to find a comparable experience. Operators of digital malls, by contrast, rarely secure long-term commitments from either advertisers or sellers, and shoppers have multiple alternatives just a click away. And the fixed costs expended to build a traditional mall could easily fund many dozens of digital retail platforms.Even the authors of \u201cModern Monopolies\u201d concede that \u201ca modern monopoly\u2019s dominance\u201d is likely to be short-lived given \u201cthe competitive threat it faces from adjacent competitors and a constant onslaught of new entrants.\u201dAll three books provide useful, and mostly consistent, insights into how to build more resilient and valuable platforms. The diversity of businesses and outcomes described, however, suggest that the differences among platform businesses are far more important than their commonalities. This is at least good news for consumers who will benefit from multiplying innovations that reduce the annoying frictions of everyday life and the consultants who will be kept busy helping managers devise ways to prolong their increasingly tenuous perch as master of a modern monopoly.Jonathan A.

{"Headline": "\u2018X-Men\u2019 and \u2018Looking Glass\u2019 Disappoint at Weekend Box Office", "Date": "2016-05-29", "News": "Supported byAnd yet very few Champagne corks are popping in Hollywood. Why?But the misgivings in Hollywood extend beyond one disappointing weekend, even one as important as Memorial Day. A troubling box office trend started last summer and has only become more pronounced: The riches are not flowing evenly \u2014 four of the six major movie factories are struggling \u2014 and only expensive event films seem to be drawing crowds, with many general purpose, middle-tier movies being virtually ignored despite aggressive marketing.What seems to be succeeding are familiar and liked brands (Marvel\u2019s \u201cCaptain America: Civil War\u201d), bold interpretations (\u201cDeadpool,\u201d \u201cThe Jungle Book\u201d) or movies that are events for a particular audience (\u201cMiracles From Heaven,\u201d \u201cThe Angry Birds Movie\u201d). Increasingly lost in the mix are films aimed at older audiences or designed as alternatives to effects-driven spectacles: \u201cThe Nice Guys,\u201d \u201cWhiskey Tango Foxtrot,\u201d \u201cMoney Monster,\u201d \u201cMother\u2019s Day,\u201d \u201cThe Finest Hours,\u201d \u201cThe Boss,\u201d \u201cHow to Be Single,\u201d \u201cHail, Caesar!\u201dStudios have long fought through hits and misses. The worry is that audiences \u2014 unhappy with rising ticket and concession prices and increasingly bivouacked in their living rooms \u2014 seem to be saying that an entire section of studio output is no longer viable in theaters: Unless it\u2019s a must-see movie, we\u2019ll catch it on Netflix.\u201cI do still think that smart summer counterprogramming can work,\u201d said Dan Fellman, a box office consultant who previously served as distribution chief at Warner Bros. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to appeal to an older audience, though, you\u2019d better have great reviews.\u201dSome analysts aren\u2019t so sure. Doug Creutz, a media analyst at Cowen and Company, wrote in a recent report: \u201cWith box office trends over the last 16 months suggesting that a few films are likely to take the lion\u2019s share of the returns, it is difficult to envision a scenario in which a significant number of this summer\u2019s releases are not money-losers, or at least disappointments.\u201dIts failure with \u201cAlice Through the Looking Glass\u201d notwithstanding, Disney has been setting the studio pace by focusing on event films that trade on established brands. With smash hits like \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens,\u201d \u201cZootopia\u201d and \u201cThe Jungle Book,\u201d Disney has captured about 32 percent of the domestic box office so far this year, according to the database Box Office Mojo. Hits like \u201cDeadpool\u201d and \u201cKung Fu Panda 3\u201d have powered Fox to second place, with roughly 20 percent market share.That has left four studios \u2014 Warner, Universal, Paramount and Sony \u2014 trying to compete for the balance, and mostly waging their campaigns with lesser properties.Studio executives cautioned against reading too much into lackluster returns for \u201cX-Men: Apocalypse\u201d and the collapse of \u201cAlice Through the Looking Glass,\u201d noting that they faced different challenges.Directed by Bryan Singer, \u201cX-Men: Apocalypse,\u201d which cost at least $178 million to make, not including marketing, lacked some of the franchise\u2019s major stars and received weak reviews. \u201cThis movie is going to play better than people think,\u201d said Chris Aronson, Fox\u2019s president of domestic distribution. \u201cThe critics lashed out, but the exit polls are very good. People like this movie.\u201dMr. Aronson estimated that \u201cX-Men: Apocalypse\u201d would take in $80 million for the four-day weekend. Overseas, the movie has collected an additional $158.8 million.Mr. Depp\u2019s lawyer, Laura Wasser, has rejected Ms. Heard\u2019s claims, saying she is \u201cattempting to secure a premature financial resolution by alleging abuse.\u201dDisney had no comment about Mr. Depp\u2019s situation and whether it contributed to the audience rejection of \u201cAlice Through the Looking Glass.\u201d Mr. Hollis estimated that the movie would generate $36 million over the four-day holiday. Analysts had expected at least $60 million in ticket sales.Advertisement"}

Starting out on TV shows like \u201cSilver Spoons,\u201d he became the rare child star to forge a successful adult career. He\u2019s perhaps best known as Michael Bluth on \u201cArrested Development,\u201d but he has also starred in films like \u201cHorrible Bosses\u201d and \u201cJuno,\u201d and directed movies, too (the dark spelling bee comedy \u201cBad Words.\u201d)How did this movie come to you?Nicole liked \u201cBad Words,\u201d and she had optioned the book and had a pre-existing relationship with [the screenwriter] David Lindsay-Abaire from doing \u201cRabbit Hole,\u201d so once they had their script, they asked me to consider it. I said yes almost before I started reading it.What was it like to direct Oscar winners like Ms. Kidman and Mr. Walken?It was simple, because they don\u2019t need their hands held.What\u2019s your favorite Walken role?None of them suck, that\u2019s for sure. Something he and I talked about as a reference was the monologue he has in \u201cPulp Fiction,\u201d where he presents the watch to the kid. The way in which he spoke to that kid was so unapologetic. He was so convinced that what he was doing was a really nice thing, he didn\u2019t hear anything inappropriate about the story he was relaying. It\u2019s that kind of tone deafness that was important for his character in this film to have.How much did you know much about performance art before making this?Zero. It didn\u2019t really matter to me. What they did for a living was really secondary to how they see what they do in comparison to their responsibilities as a parent.I think I\u2019m actually much too shy to do any performance art. I admire the big swings those guys take, but I\u2019m not a one-man band.You and your sister, Justine, were child performers. Does that echo in the film?The upbringing that Justine and I had was in no way as traumatic as what goes on in this movie. That\u2019s why no script has been written about our life and never will. But there\u2019s certainly thematically some things I could relate to, like how what Annie and Baxter are going through is at times dramatic and at times comedic. I could relate to the confusion of that traditional parent-child relationship sometimes getting wobbly.Will \u201cArrested Development\u201d ever return?There are no plans to do any more at the moment. I haven\u2019t heard about anything solid. I do know there\u2019s a willingness to do more from all parties. Regardless, I hold no power over that being a reality. But speaking purely creatively, it was the best thing I\u2019ve ever done, as far as having fun and what it did for my career.What are you directing next?A series at Netflix called \u201cOzark.\u201d I play a guy who\u2019s laundering money for a drug cartel. I\u2019m going to direct roughly half of these 10 episodes. I\u2019m executive-producing it, so I\u2019ll be able to have my hands on just about every part of process that I would as a director in feature films.

{"Headline": "When TV Ads Go Subliminal With a Vengeance, We\u2019ll Be to Blame", "Date": "2016-05-15", "News": "Supported byMediatorFor decades the annual television industry ritual known as the upfronts has gone the same way.But when the whole shebang kicks off in earnest on Monday morning, there will be an underlying sense of seasickness because of the inexorable, existential question that now faces television this time of year: How long can it go on like this?Maybe it was when you flipped your television input over to your Apple TV last night to watch the commercial-free \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d on Netflix, or when you perused the recorded version of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d after work on Monday and fast-forwarded through every real ad. Maybe you forgot TV altogether and watched YouTube instead.When you started using all the new technology to watch shows on your own terms, and to stop viewing commercials, you threw into question the modus operandi of a roughly $70 billion industry that has been remarkably stable for decades. The billions give television the room to maintain business as usual in the middle of this change-tsunami in a way that, say, newspapers can\u2019t. But some sort of reckoning seems inevitable.That would have big consequences for those who have stuff to sell and who still view television ads as the best way to do it \u2014 and equally big consequences for traditional television\u2019s gatekeepers.That\u2019s a fraction of the many billions Magna spends on television every year for clients that include Coca-Cola and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. But it was a large enough diversion of television dollars to digital media to be of real symbolic importance. Magna pointed to declines in old-fashioned television viewing among those between the ages of 18 and 49, who are important to advertisers.\u201cWhat we are trying to do is signal to the market that it is not business as usual,\u201d David Cohen, the United States president of Magna Global, told me last week. \u201cConsumers have over the past several years been migrating away from linear television, and we need to acknowledge that.\u201dNetwork television executives saw the announcement as something else: a savvy negotiating ploy just as the upfronts were to begin. They could point to motive.For all the talk like mine in this column about the future of television advertising, in the here and now industry executives and analysts expect ad rates to spike in the coming upfront deals for the first time in several years.Economists pointed to factors like rising health care costs and stagnant wages. But Mr. Poltrack said the advertising pullback had a role, too.Mr. Poltrack said it augurs a strong upfront, driven by a fundamental lesson: \u201cIf less people see your advertising, you will sell less things.\u201dStill, there\u2019s the question of who will actually \u201csee your advertising,\u201d given that it\u2019s now easier than ever to tune that advertising out. Television executives like Mr. Poltrack are spending a whole lot of time studying that.Some findings are counterintuitive. For instance, Mr. Poltrack said, two-thirds of viewers watch with a second screen either in their hands or on their lap. Yet those screens can be so distracting that their users forget to fast-forward past the ads in recorded shows. It turns out viewers are overwhelmingly absorbing the messages coming from the TV even as they stare at the other devices, Mr. Poltrack said.Nielsen data does show that those between the ages of 18 and 49 skip fewer than half the ads in recorded shows (42 percent). But two different sets of Nielsen data I saw also showed their overall commercial viewing down by 8 or 11 percent this television season, depending on how you slice it, compared with last year.And it explains the sense of urgency I found on the 51st floor of 30 Rockefeller Plaza on Thursday morning, where NBCUniversal\u2019s chairwoman of advertising sales, Linda Yaccarino, was overseeing the final touches on NBCUniversal\u2019s upfront presentation.Ms. Yaccarino was planning the biggest change in decades to the way NBC does its presentation. Instead of walking advertisers through NBC\u2019s nightly schedule in isolation, it will focus instead on which combinations of shows on NBC, NBC\u2019s sister cable networks, and cable on-demand systems like that of its parent, Comcast, will reach particular audiences. (It will throw in options from its investment partners BuzzFeed and Vox Media, too.)\u201cYou will not hear \u2018Monday night at 8; Tuesday at 9,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see our content presented the way audiences seek it out and consume it.\u201dShe is operating under the assumption that today\u2019s robust commercial breaks will not be around in their current form much longer. \u201cI tell my whole team, \u2018We\u2019re hanging on to them by our fingernails,\u2019\u201d she said.And that\u2019s where it comes back to us \u2014 and I say \u201cus\u201d because I, too, prefer my television ad-free. With the exception of shows on public television or subscription services like Netflix and HBO, commercials pay for the shows we like. If we cut that off, we push television executives into new levels of subliminal trickery. Maybe we\u2019ll decide that\u2019s a fair trade.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trying to Pin Down the Mosaic of Millennial Tastes", "Date": "2016-05-15", "News": "Supported by2016 TV UpfrontsThe television industry is focusing a great deal of attention on millennials these days. Billions of dollars are in play, along with the reputations of industry executives who view this vast, diverse generation \u2014 generally defined as those born between 1977 and 1995 \u2014 as the hot consumers of choice in a bewilderingly changing business.But what, as Freud might have asked if he lived in America in 2016, do millennials want? Does anyone really know? Is it fair to lump together a group of people ages 21 to 39? I was curious. I decided to conduct my own nonscientific study of millennials and their attitudes toward television.It is not hard to find a millennial; there are 79.8 million in the United States. At the Brooklyn Roasting Company\u2019s branch in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, for instance, I found one right there at the counter, arguing with the barista about what \u201crefill\u201d means. He was not free to talk, but Rob Szypko, 25, who was looking up stuff on his laptop, had a moment. He took off his headphones.\u201cI struggle with the term millennial,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe this is a very millennial thing to say, but I don\u2019t feel I\u2019m of the same mind as everyone else just because I happened to be born in the same 15-year life span.\u201dHe had a point. Older people tend to lump millennials together as basically a huge, mysterious group of entitled young people on their phones all the time. They\u2019re fun to mock, just as the baby boomers and Generation X were mocked back in the day.\u201cI think there\u2019s something wrong with this generation,\u201d says Jack Donaghy, the \u201c30 Rock\u201d character played by Alec Baldwin, when a millennial job applicant announces that he has to leave for his \u201cironic kickball league\u201d and that he is \u201cnot interested in this position unless I\u2019m going to be constantly praised.\u201dUnlike that person, or, say, the constantly plugged-in, constantly high, constantly hapless millennial protagonists of \u201cBroad City,\u201d Mr. Szypko (pronounced ZIP-co) already has a respectable job \u2014 he works in city government. But he does not own a television set. He mostly watches shows on Netflix and Hulu. He won\u2019t commit to a series unless he is sure it\u2019s going to be good. He does not like to be told what he likes.\u201cOne of the things people chafe at is the sense that other people are curating things for them,\u201d he said, speaking of his age group. \u201cIf Netflix says, \u2018Hey, Rob, we think you might like this title,\u2019 and it\u2019s too on the nose, it removes part of the fun of discovering an experience for yourself. If I don\u2019t have to scroll past the second line of my Netflix page to find what I want, something is wrong.\u201dLeaving Mr. Szypko to his devices, I set out for Williamsburg, another millennial-heavy section of Brooklyn. I found two \u2014 Austin McAllister and Ryley Pogensky, both 26 \u2014 on a street corner, trying to attract the attention of their friend Danielle, who was crossing the street 20 feet away with her headphones on. She did not respond, even when all three of us shouted, so they sent her a text message to alert her to our location.\u201cPeople have a far-reaching idea of who millennials are, but I don\u2019t know what that word means,\u201d Ms. McAllister, a singer, said.Mr. Pogensky, who identified himself as an editor at a \u201cmillennial media company,\u201d was dismissive of TV programs attempting to portray his generation. (\u201cGirls,\u201d for instance.) \u201cThey try far too hard \u2014 that notion of the over-millenniated hipster,\u201d he said. \u201cThey use, like, slang that no one uses, that your dad would use,\u201d he said.\u201cLOL,\u201d Ms. McAllister said.\u201cShe\u2019s using that sarcastically, rather than in reality,\u201d Mr. Pogensky said.They have televisions, but they do not have cable. (\u201cNo one has cable,\u201d said Danielle, 34, who had finally arrived on the corner and who did not give her last name.) They have had a variety of jobs (Danielle: nurse, maid, sex worker.) Their tastes are almost aggressively idiosyncratic.Ms. McAllister, for instance, said she had watched virtually every episode of \u201cLaw and Order: Special Victims Unit,\u201d because of her love for Mariska Hargitay. Mr. Pogensky said he watched the film \u201cMean Girls\u201d \u201clike once a week.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll binge-watch \u2018House of Cards,\u2019 and then I\u2019ll watch \u2018Daria,\u2019\u201d he said, referring to the classic turn-of-the-millennium animated series about an acerbic high school student.The three of them left for brunch \u2014 it was 3 p.m. \u2014 but it got me thinking about the great challenge for media companies: How do you appeal to people with such splintered, diffuse tastes, who crave novelty and individual experiences and who do not want to be part of a herd?\u201cThey\u2019re the most diverse generation of adults in U.S. history, so that\u2019s a big issue for the entertainment industry,\u201d said Jason Dorsey, whose job as chief strategy officer and millennials researcher at the Center of Generational Kinetics in Austin, Tex., sounds as if it could have its own ironic television show. \u201cHow do we program for such a diverse generation that doesn\u2019t carry checkbooks, a lot of whom don\u2019t carry cash, most of whom are delaying marriage and kids and have a high expectation of diversity and more college debt?\u201dIndeed. \u201cNothing gets all of them, but there are themes that do seem to matter,\u201d said Tom Ascheim, president of Freeform, as the recently renamed ABC Family is now called. While Freeform\u2019s target audience is mostly millennials, the channel is specifically geared to an age group \u2014 people from 18 to 34 \u2014 rather than a generation, on the grounds that what a generation wants changes as that generation becomes older.\u201cWhat unites our shows is that they center around young people in an adult world that revolves around them and that they have the power to shape,\u201d Mr. Ascheim said.That sounds right: Millennials do want to shape their world. \u201cHow long is this going to take?\u201d said Stephane Rochefort, 33, who works in sales and was walking along the street when I asked him about his viewing habits. He had to go. \u201cI don\u2019t watch any TV, but I sometimes watch sports on the Internet,\u201d he said, over his shoulder.Three millennials in the finance industry whom I met in Lower Manhattan were just as difficult to pin down. Morgan Kiss, 23, said her favorite show was \u201cChopped,\u201d because she is learning how to cook. Her roommate likes a program about real estate developers flipping houses. Natalie Urban, 22, likes \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201dIf there is one thing that unites them, it\u2019s their creative way of paying for content (or not) in a world bursting with choice.\u201cWe get our subscriptions through friends,\u201d Ms. Urban said. Kate, the third millennial in the group, who did not want her last name used, mentioned a heady period when she was in possession of a friend\u2019s ex-boyfriend\u2019s friend\u2019s dad\u2019s HBO Go password. \u201cThey didn\u2019t notice, but then he changed the password, so now I use Natalie\u2019s,\u201d she said.Is there a representative millennial? No, just as there is no representative goat.\u201cI don\u2019t think one person in my generation can be representative of the whole thing,\u201d Ms. Kiss said. \u201cThere are so many different shows that are available to us. People can shape their own watching preferences. We can watch what we like.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "ESPN and Verizon Settle Lawsuit Over Cable Package", "Date": "2016-05-10", "News": "Supported byESPN and Verizon announced Tuesday the settlement of a lawsuit that accused Verizon of breaching its contract with the sports network when it created a new cable package for its Fios television service last year.No details of the settlement were announced.In a statement, Terry Denson, Verizon\u2019s vice president of content strategy and acquisition, said: \u201cESPN is an important partner of ours. We look forward to working with them to provide great content to consumers for years to come.\u201dIn the same statement, Sean Breen, senior vice president for affiliate sales for the Disney and ESPN media networks, said, \u201cWe look forward to further collaborating with them to deliver customers content across all of our platforms.\u201dESPN filed suit in New York Supreme Court in April 2015 after Verizon moved some channels off Fios\u2019s basic cable offering \u2014 including ESPN, Lifetime, TBS, USA Network and Comedy Central \u2014 and separated them into category-specific, $10-a-month programming tiers like sports, pop culture, entertainment and children that customers could choose from.At the time, ESPN said in a statement that it was \u201cat the forefront of embracing innovative ways to deliver high-quality content and value to consumers on multiple platforms but that must be done in compliance with our agreements.\u201dThe lawsuit struck at the longstanding practice of bundling channels into broad, increasingly expensive cable packages that consumers have begun to rebel against by abandoning their pay-TV providers and choosing lower-priced Internet services like Netflix, Hulu and Sling TV.ESPN is the most expensive cable network, so Fios\u2019s Custom TV lineup was an attempt to create a \u201cskinny bundle\u201d that would keep customers from fleeing.In defending itself against ESPN, Verizon said, \u201cConsumers have spoken loud and clear that they want choice and the industry should be focused on giving consumers what they want.\u201dIn February, with the lawsuit barely advancing in court, there appeared to be a thaw in the relations between ESPN and Verizon that suggested that a settlement was imminent. Verizon overhauled Custom TV, turning it into two plans that are essentially parallel basic cable packages. The first, Essentials, has no sports channels. The second, Sports & More, includes ESPN, ESPN2 and ESPNU.ESPN said then that it was encouraged by the changes.

{"Headline": "Hulu Aims to Deliver What You Want to Watch Next", "Date": "2016-05-03", "News": "Supported byImagine a television service that knows a viewer watches \u201cToday\u201d every morning and \u201cThe Daily Show With Trevor Noah\u201d at night. On the subway, this TV fan catches up on the news on the phone.When viewers turn on the service, it is already streaming their favorite programming depending on the time, place and device in use. It also understands what she is most likely to want to watch next.That is the new vision for Hulu, which got its start primarily as a rerun service for broadcast TV shows.\u201cHow do we get people to content that they love, fast?\u201d said Mike Hopkins, Hulu\u2019s chief executive. \u201cHow do we make it so personalized that we are thinking ahead for you so that you don\u2019t have to?\u201dSeveral details are still being determined, including the price and which channels will be included in the package. Executives with knowledge of the plans said the service was expected to cost about $40 a month and Hulu was close to deals to include broadcast and cable channels from both Disney and Fox.Hulu now counts more than 10 million subscribers, with a vast majority paying for the ad-supported model. That compares with Netflix\u2019s 45.7 million paid subscribers in the United States.In advance of Hulu\u2019s upfront presentation for advertisers on Wednesday, Mr. Hopkins discussed what is next for the company and for the future of streaming television. His answers have been lightly edited for length and clarity.Why create this new offering that would offer a live and on-demand stream of entire broadcast and cable channels now?Broadband speeds have advanced quite a bit over the last few years. There are a couple of other offerings that have been put out into the market in various forms that show that network groups are willing to license their channels in this way now.Some TV executives described Hulu\u2019s new service as an effort to rethink their approach to streaming video. What needs to be fixed?There is a paradox of choice that is out there today with the number of channels that are available. It is not intuitive or easy always to find them, particularly on your mobile device. We are going to try to solve that by making it more personalized.One major risk of a streamlined bundle from Hulu could be the potential that traditional cable and satellite distributors see the new service as a declaration of war. That could put at risk the billions of dollars that the TV networks receive each year from those traditional distributors. What can you do to prevent that?It is not a declaration of war on anyone. I don\u2019t think we are designing this for people that are really happy with their pay TV service. This is designed for the people that the marketplace is concerned are falling out of love with pay TV. We want to have a product for them.Will viewers be able to skip through commercials or pay for a commercial-free offering? We haven\u2019t made any of those decisions yet.How would you describe the competitive rivalry now among Netflix, Amazon and Hulu? How do you expect that to change?We\u2019re all in this new market and developing it together. I don\u2019t really see it as a rivalry per se between any of us. We certainly compete against each other for content rights, but I am not sure I would say we are rivals just yet.The last year has seen an explosion of new streaming services that allow people to ditch their traditional TV subscriptions that cost an average of $80 a month in favor of cheaper viewing. How many streaming services do you anticipate people will subscribe to?We\u2019re in this phase where a lot of people are going to launch these and test and see how they work. Over time, not all of them will last. It is not an easy business to be in. You are direct to consumer. Every single day you have to make people happy enough to stay a subscriber. It is very easy to sign up and it is very easy to cancel.A big win for Hulu was when it became the exclusive streaming home to episodes of \u201cSeinfeld.\u201d How did that fit into your strategy? What are other hot properties that you are after?TV is very personal for people. So when you think about the shows that you watch, they are different than the shows that I watch and they are different than the shows my daughter watches. When we look at our product, we have to have as many of the shows as you want and love as we can possibly have. And then we have to personalize the service for you so that you know that we have them and that we are recommending the next one that we hope you will enjoy.Last September, Hulu introduced an option that allowed people to pay $12 a month for a commercial-free version of the service. What have you learned from the rollout of the new offering? Giving people choice is really important. Even though a lot more people decided to stick with the ad-supported plan or to choose the ad-supported plan as new customers, by giving them the choice I think we have made people happier with the ultimate choice that they have made.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On DVD: Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll High Schools in Taiwan and America", "Date": "2016-05-19", "News": "Supported byOn DVDA universal tale of wayward adolescence is woven into complex context. Taiwan, a liberated Japanese colony with a large native Chinese population, was ruled from 1949 on by newly arrived Chinese nationalists backed by the American military. \u201cA Brighter Summer Day\u201d depicts but does not directly explicate the political situation. \u201cRather than working its way through a neatly predigested story line, it plunges the audience into a vast social fresco,\u201d the British critic Tony Rayns, one of the movie\u2019s first Western admirers, wrote in 1993.Along with his contemporary Hou Hsiao-hsien, Mr. Yang (1947-2007) helped usher Taiwanese cinema onto the world stage. Mr. Yang was also the new cinema movement\u2019s most cosmopolitan member \u2014 born in Shanghai, raised in Taipei and trained as an engineer at the University of Florida. Early films like \u201cTaipei Story\u201d (1985) and \u201cThe Terrorizer\u201d (1986) are laconic depictions of Taiwan\u2019s disaffected urban elite. \u201cA Brighter Summer Day,\u201d on which Mr. Yang worked for three years \u2014 one of which he said was devoted to rehearsing his cast\u2019s 60 young members \u2014 is more ambitious and personal.\u201cA City of Sadness\u201d (1989), Mr. Hou\u2019s intimate yet panoramic treatment of Taiwan\u2019s turbulent Cold War history, provided a template for Mr. Yang. While not strictly autobiographical, \u201cA Brighter Summer Day\u201d drew on his own experiences; set in 1960, it is based on a juvenile homicide that occurred at Mr. Yang\u2019s school when he was 13. In an interview published in 2005, Mr. Yang called making the movie \u201ca kind of responsibility that I had to take on.\u201d\u201cA Brighter Summer Day\u201d is largely focused on high school turf wars and imported Elvis worship. (The title refers to a misheard lyric from the Elvis Presley hit \u201cAre You Lonesome Tonight?\u201d) But it is also a family drama that evokes Taiwan\u2019s prolonged period of martial law. The protagonist Si\u2019r, a bright, impulsive 14-year-old, is enrolled in a secondary school where the uniforms and regimentation provide an unforced parallel to military rule.Originally on the fringes of a local gang, Si\u2019r is drawn into its power struggles, including an emotional vortex around the murdered gang leader\u2019s girlfriend, Ming. The title notwithstanding, much of the film\u2019s action takes place at night, or is otherwise obscured, reinforcing the sense of a clandestine youth culture coursing beneath the frozen surface of a mobilized society.Seeing \u201cA Brighter Summer Day\u201d in the early 1990s as part of a touring package of Taiwanese films, I was impressed by Mr. Yang\u2019s synthesis of detached European art cinema and florid Hollywood youth films; familiar yet exotic, his movie seemed a Michelangelo Antonioni version of \u201cWest Side Story\u201d or a Wim Wenders remake of \u201cRebel Without a Cause,\u201d with the added frisson of pop ballads by Frankie Avalon and Ricky Nelson performed by Taiwanese singers in phonetic English.To revisit the movie is to appreciate the precision of Mr. Yang\u2019s period details and novelistic touches. An outsize flashlight stolen by Si\u2019r and his friends from a night watchman in one of the movie\u2019s first scenes reappears throughout to illuminate (or not) the tangled conflicts. The school\u2019s proximity to a movie studio allows Mr. Yang to comment both on his film and his characters as historical actors, not least when the duplicitous Ming is given a screen test.Dialogue from \u201cRio Bravo\u201d is heard as well, but Mr. Yang\u2019s lofty aspiration may be gauged by several references to \u201cWar and Peace,\u201d a book seen by the movie\u2019s most romantic character as the Western equivalent of the Chinese martial arts novels in which he imagines he lives. That may have been Mr. Yang\u2019s feeling as well. Interviewed by Mr. Rayns, he remarked, \u201cIf someone asked me to make a 300-episode TV series about these people, I\u2019d have had the material to do it.\u201dMr. Feig (\u201cBridesmaids,\u201d the coming \u201cGhostbusters\u201d reboot) and Mr. Apatow (\u201cTrainwreck,\u201d \u201cKnocked Up\u201d) are now kingpins of Hollywood comedy. A number of the show\u2019s stars, including the three main \u201cfreaks\u201d \u2014 James Franco, Seth Rogen and Jason Segel \u2014 also enjoy great box-office visibility, but the series\u2019s real star is Linda Cardellini. In her mid-20s when the show was shot, she was a more convincing teenager than her co-stars, some of whom, like Mr. Rogen, were still in their teens. (More recently, Ms. Cardellini has appeared in AMC\u2019s \u201cMad Men\u201d and the series \u201cBloodline\u201d on Netflix.)NEWLY RELEASEDAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sexual Freelancing in the Gig Economy", "Date": "2016-05-14", "News": "Supported byOpinionA FRIEND of mine complains about how many of the men she meets on Tinder use corporate language to chat her up. First, they \u201creach out.\u201d Then, after spending the night together, they \u201cfollow up.\u201dThis kind of flirting is banal, but it makes sense. We constantly use economic metaphors to describe romantic and sexual relations. Few people today refer to women as \u201cdamaged goods\u201d or wonder why a man would \u201cbuy the cow when he can get the milk for free,\u201d but we have \u201cfriends with benefits\u201d and \u201cinvest in relationships.\u201d An ex may be \u201con\u201d or \u201coff the market.\u201d Online dating makes \u201cshopping around\u201d explicit. Blog after blog strategizes about how to maximize your \u201creturn on investment\u201d on OkCupid.We use this kind of language because the ways that people date \u2014 who contacts whom, where they meet and what happens next \u2014 have always been tied to the economy. Dating applies the logic of capitalism to courtship. On the dating market, everyone competes for him or herself.When parents worry about how their 20-something kids are (or aren\u2019t) pairing off, or the authors of trend pieces lament \u201cthe death of courtship,\u201d they seem to forget that the pursuit of sex and romance didn\u2019t remain unchanged from the moment when the first Homo sapiens sidled across the savanna toward his soul mate until Steve Jobs rolled out the iPhone.If you want to understand why \u201cNetflix and chill\u201d has replaced dinner and a movie, you need to look at how people work. Today, people are constantly told that we must be flexible and adaptable in order to succeed. Is it surprising that these values are reshaping how many of us approach sex and love?And those are just the hours on the clock. They don\u2019t include time spent outside normal hours answering emails or maintaining a social media presence \u2014 activities that many jobs require. In other words, single people today tend to work longer hours than they would have in the Norman Rockwell, soda-fountain era that many people seem to have in mind when they get misty-eyed about \u201ctraditional\u201d dating. No surprise they have less time and energy left over to go out.Sometimes social class can make a difference. Growing numbers of working-class Americans are eschewing marriage and having children outside of marriage. In a 2013 study conducted by researchers at Harvard and the University of Virginia, working-class respondents cited low wages and a lack of job security as the primary reasons for these changes.Still, for all of the challenges, it\u2019s worth noting that the gig economy has also brought some much-needed flexibility to dating and relationships. Young women today face less pressure to build their lives around marriage and childbearing than their mothers or grandmothers did. If you are gay or lesbian or if you want a relationship that is not monogamous you are likely to meet less resistance than you might have in the past. Still, as the work of dating has become increasingly flexible, it has also become increasingly precarious.DATING itself is a recent invention. It developed when young people began moving to cities and women began working outside private homes. By 1900, 44 percent of single American women worked. Previously, courtship had taken place under adult supervision, in private places: a parlor, a factory dance or church social. But once women started going out and earning wages, they had more freedom over where and how they met prospective mates. Because men vastly out-earned women, they typically paid for entertainment.Today, we refer to a man inviting a woman to dinner as \u201ctraditional.\u201d At first it was scandalous: A woman who arranged to meet a man at a bar or restaurant could find herself interrogated by a vice commission. In the 1920s and \u201830s, as more and more middle-class women started going to college, parents and faculty panicked over the \u201crating and dating\u201d culture, which led kids to participate in \u201cpetting parties\u201d and take \u201cjoy rides\u201d with members of the opposite sex.By the 1950s, a new kind of dating took over: \u201cgoing steady.\u201d Popular advice columnist Dorothy Dix warned in 1939 that going steady was an \u201cinsane folly.\u201d But by the post-war era of full employment, this form of courtship made perfect sense. The booming economy, which was targeting the newly flush \u201cteen\u201d demographic, dictated that in order for everyone to partake in new consumer pleasures \u2014 for everyone to go out for a burger and root beer float on the weekends \u2014 young people had to pair off. Today, the economy is transforming courtship yet again. But the changes aren\u2019t only practical. The economy shapes our feelings and values as well as our behaviors.The generation of Americans that came of age around the time of the 2008 financial crisis has been told constantly that we must be \u201cflexible\u201d and \u201cadaptable.\u201d Is it so surprising that we have turned into sexual freelancers? Many of us treat relationships like unpaid internships: We cannot expect them to lead to anything long-term, so we use them to get experience. If we look sharp, we might get a free lunch.But for all the hand-wringing, this kind of dating isn\u2019t any more transactional than it was back when suitors paid women family-supervised visits or parents sought out a yenta to introduce their children at a synagogue mixer. Courtship has always been dictated by changes in the market. The good news is that dating is not the same thing as love. And as anyone who has ever been in love can attest, the laws of supply and demand do not control our feelings.Advertisement"}

The Soviet Union seized the islands at the end of the war. There were 17,000 Japanese living there at the time; today, there are 30,000 Russians.The dispute is not just a matter of national pride. Control of the islands means gaining access to fish-rich waters and oil and gas fields.Japanese people migrated to the islands in the 18th century, and an 1855 treaty gave Japan ownership of the four southern islands and Russia everything that lay north.The 1951 San Francisco Peace Treaty, which formally ended World War II, didn\u2019t clearly establish ownership of the four islands.The informal talks are not expected to bring a peace accord to formally end their World War II hostilities right away.

Does the thought of spending a day in tasteful company sound enjoyable or unbearable? Would you want to see a tasteful movie? Hear a tasteful joke? Do you think a professional critic should be tasteful? Does \u201ctasteful\u201d entail a cultivated aesthetic, one arrived at through formidable powers of judgment and discernment, or a contrived affectation that degenerates into an automaton-like weakness for bamboo cheese boards and artisanal-coffee-shop playlists?A figure known as the \u201chipster barista\u201d makes an appearance in Tom Vanderbilt\u2019s \u201cYou May Also Like: Taste in an Age of Endless Choice,\u201d a tour through the world of human preferences and the companies that try to divine them. Vanderbilt, a journalist and the author of \u201cSurvival City: Adventures Among the Ruins of Atomic America\u201d and the best-selling \u201cTraffic: Why We Drive the Way We Do (and What It Says About Us),\u201d has set out to answer what sounds like another basic question \u2014 \u201cWhy do we like the things we like?\u201d \u2014 that turns out to be full of complications and caveats. At one point Vanderbilt participates in \u201cWhat\u2019s Your Stereotype?,\u201d a \u201cplayful experiment\u201d developed by the Echo Nest, a \u201cmusic intelligence company\u201d that promises to match people to music (it\u2019s now owned by Spotify): \u201cI was dubbed a \u2018Hipster Barista,\u2019 which, given that much of my music listening these days occurs in Brooklyn coffee shops, seemed predictive enough.\u201d\u201cNothing is more predictive of a person than his music preference,\u201d Vanderbilt continues, paraphrasing what he learns from one of the Echo Nest\u2019s founders, who points to correlations between genres and, for instance, political affiliations (country and Republicans; rap and Democrats; metal apparently has bipartisan appeal). These genres are determined less by the sound of the music itself than by the people who listen to them. Vanderbilt gives the example of Miley Cyrus, whose music might sometimes sound, acoustically speaking, like some other \u201cindie singer-songwriters,\u201d he writes, but is \u201cnot appropriate\u201d to play for a fan of those other indie singer-songwriters. \u201cThe cultural impedance mismatch would just be too bad,\u201d an Echo Nest engineer explains (\u201cimpedance\u201d being engineer-speak for \u201cresistance\u201d).Vanderbilt reports all of this \u00admatter-of-factly, though one imagines that this hypothetical listener\u2019s response to having her aural safe space invaded by Cyrus might be reflexive, as so many culturally conditioned responses are, especially the negative ones. Something makes us \u201ccringe\u201d or \u201cwince,\u201d or prompts a \u201cknee-jerk\u201d or \u201cgut\u201d reaction, or \u201cleaves a bad taste in your mouth\u201d: The metaphors we use to describe what offends our sensibilities frequently involve the body, as if our dislike lies beyond the realm of reason and explanation, which it very often does. Even when we do articulate why we abhor something, words have a hard time capturing the force with which one\u2019s entire being might revolt when faced with the offending song or novel or film.Or joke, for that matter. Vanderbilt gives us a few groaners of his own making: \u201cBirds of a feather tweet together\u201d (like-minded people follow each other on Twitter); \u201cEaters had nothing to lose but the chains\u201d (on how Yelp helped travelers ditch chain restaurants for independent gems); \u201cThis Pop-Tart wears Kevlar\u201d (on the military\u2019s creation of a shelf-\u00adstable toaster pastry); \u201cDeath by Chocolate never kills us\u201d (we like over-the-top desserts); \u201cHaters gonna hate, as it were. But haters also gonna rate\u201d (self-explanatory but awful nonetheless). But then that\u2019s just me and my taste. Clearly Vanderbilt had his own very different reaction when he came up with these lines and committed them to print, as undoubtedly will many people who read his book. (And no, there\u2019s nothing to indicate that he included bad jokes in a book about taste as some sort of ironic conceit.) He is a generally amiable and thorough guide to a subject that can get either fussy or murky fairly quickly, and he has an obsessive determination to get to the bottom of something we exercise so often and unthinkingly we tend to take it for granted.Vanderbilt makes frequent reference to \u201cDistinction,\u201d Pierre Bourdieu\u2019s pioneering 1979 study of taste as correlated largely with social and educational class, in which the French sociologist asked people of varying educational attainment to say whether scenes like a sunset or \u201ctramps quarreling\u201d would make for a \u201cbeautiful, interesting, meaningless or ugly photo.\u201d Vanderbilt\u2019s travels bring him to a cat show in Paris, where a cat judge who also happens to be a psychology professor distinguishes between the \u201canalytical\u201d and the \u201cholistic\u201d style of judging, and he visits Netflix headquarters in Los Gatos, Calif., where he learns how people \u201crate in an aspirational way\u201d that\u2019s often at odds with their actual behavior. He asks lots of questions, ranging from the anodyne \u2014 \u201cWhat is your favorite number?\u201d \u201cWhen I drank the Pabst, did I enjoy it?\u201d \u2014 to the more philosophical: \u201cWhat did it mean when I thumbed a \u2018like\u2019 on an Instagram post?\u201d \u201cCan we find our own opinion amid the roar of the crowd?\u201dHis own tastes are harder for a reader to make out. He doesn\u2019t specify what a \u201chipster barista\u201d might listen to, though he mentions, more than once, how his younger self used to \u201cflip through cutout bins at record shops.\u201d He recalls a Damascene moment as a teenager in the 1980s, when he \u201cquickly became a fan of this strange cacophony\u201d of \u201cpunk rock and other eclectic forms of music,\u201d though the most enthusiasm he musters in its favor is to note that it \u201csounded little like anything I had heard before.\u201d This lukewarm vagueness, whether deliberate or not, makes for a book that has a lot of interesting bits and pieces but seems to be missing a larger animating principle.Questions of taste tend to get people worked up. Yet the closest we get to seeing Vanderbilt push hard for something is in a short passage about the term \u201cguilty pleasure.\u201d He becomes uncharacteristically distraught over the argument \u2014 one with which I happen to agree \u2014 that a pleasurable cultural experience, even if popular and mass-\u00adproduced, shouldn\u2019t be attended by guilt. This argument, he insists, \u201csmacks of condescension even as it flaunts its democratic inclusiveness\u201d: \u201cYou can almost feel the mix of pity and raised-eyebrow disdain as someone asks, \u2018Oh, you feel weird about liking this?\u2019\u200a\u201d To which I wanted to say: Who actually said that sentence, ever?But when it comes to taste, the field seems to be populated by condescending straw men sneering down at us from their perch. In \u201cPretentiousness: Why It Matters,\u201d Dan Fox makes the case for pretentiousness, not as a form of snobbery and social jockeying, but as \u201cthe engine oil of culture,\u201d a patience for the unfamiliar and a willingness to take artistic risks. Fox, a co-editor of the art magazine Frieze, begins with the word\u2019s Latin roots \u2014 prae, meaning \u201cbefore,\u201d and tendere, \u201cto stretch or extend\u201d \u2014 and argues that pretension, or pretending to something else, is what allows us to shake off complacency and move beyond the status quo. Pretentiousness in his definition is not self-serious but playful, exemplified by the likes of Brian Eno (who has written about wanting \u201cto turn the word \u2018pretentious\u2019 into a compliment\u201d), Kate Bush and David Bowie, to name a few. (Fox is originally from Britain, as are many of his music examples.) \u201cThe potential to construct yourself in the image of something you\u2019re not has been one of the traditional promises of pop music,\u201d Fox writes. \u201cPop history is littered with pretentious follies, with ambitious projects overreaching themselves.\u201dFox is a nimble writer, and his brief book includes surprisingly rich detours through history, philosophy, criticism, literature, \u201cWithnail and I\u201d and more besides \u2014 and if you hear that list and immediately assume his defense of pretentiousness must be pretentious, you\u2019d be half right while also missing the point. The typical use of \u201cpretentious\u201d as a pejorative assumes that the pretentious person is uninterested in other people, and wants only to lord his rarefied tastes over the plebes; Fox, though, is trying to open up a conversation about art rather than shut it down. If anything, he says, it\u2019s the person who uses \u201cpretentious\u201d as an insult who may be the less tolerant one: \u201cThe pretentious flaws of others affirm your own intellectual or aesthetic expertise. Simultaneously, their fakery highlights the contours of your down-to-earth character and virtuous ordinariness.\u201dFox concedes that the suspicion of pretentiousness taps into deeper anxieties about authenticity. \u201cThese worries are ancient,\u201d he writes. \u201cStories about people not being who they say they are, or who we think they are, can be traced back to tales of shape-shifting gods playing among mortals, or changelings taking the place of human children.\u201d But he also shows how authenticity has served as a false idol. We get so caught up in determining what\u2019s \u201creal\u201d and \u201cauthentic\u201d that we deny the possibility a person interested in experimenting with new and unusual forms, whether in clothes or music or art, might in fact be truly and authentically himself. You sense that Fox\u2019s connection to this notion is intensely personal, and he ends his book with a \u201cpostscript\u201d about growing up in the English village of Wheatley, where he had his Damascene moment (Damascene moments tend to be a feature of the genre) sometime around 1989, when he realized that a larger world lay beyond his local one of 17th-\u00adcentury cottages and the poetry of John Betjeman. With the support of his parents and siblings, he \u201cunderstood pretension as permission for the imagination.\u201dThis sweetly earnest coda is a bit of a letdown, considering the analytical sharpness of the polemic that comes before, but Fox is attuned to the way tastes feel important because of everything that goes into them \u2014 class, education, upbringing \u2014 making them the embodiment of where we were from, and where we want to be. He is also self-aware, allowing for the question of whether his own teenage aspirations were as pure as they might have seemed to him at the time: \u201cBut doesn\u2019t all that daydreaming imply a snobbery of geography that equates the small town with the small mind and the big city with promises of success and creative self-realization?\u201dHe never really answers this question, and his defense of pretentiousness doesn\u2019t fully reckon with the existence of people who believe their enlightened tastes are indeed license for self-congratulation. (We\u2019ve all met them, or read them, and no doubt an unlucky number of us have been subject to some endless disquisition on why something we like is the result of false consciousness.) In this, the music critic Carl Wilson\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Talk About Love: A Journey to the End of Taste,\u201d from 2007, continues to be one of the best contemporary books about taste; Wilson, in an attempt to explore his instinctive loathing for the work of Celine Dion, ends up putting his own presumptions and pretensions on the line.Like Vanderbilt, he pays a lot of attention to Bourdieu, but Wilson\u2019s book is necessarily aware of taste\u2019s political implications. Taste might seem like the ultimate in, yes, pretentious topics, far removed from the concrete realities of how we actually live, but it\u2019s part of how we take in the world, the filter that shapes our immediate reactions before conscious deliberations begin. To try to understand someone else\u2019s tastes, as well as our own, is the first step in an arduous but necessary path in a democracy like ours, whether we like it or not.YOU MAY ALSO LIKETaste in an Age of Endless ChoiceBy Tom Vanderbilt305 pp. Alfred A.

{"Headline": "The Psychology of Genre", "Date": "2016-05-28", "News": "OpinionWhy we don\u2019t like what we struggle to categorize.Supported byWHEN the musician Lucinda Williams was shopping around an early demo tape of what would become her self-titled album, she was at first turned down by all the record labels she tried.\u201cAt Sony records here in L.A.,\u201d she said, they told her \u201c \u2018it\u2019s too country for rock, and so we sent it to Nashville.\u2019 \u201d In Nashville, they said, \u201cit\u2019s too rock for country.\u201dHer album was eventually released by Rough Trade Records \u2014 an English record company better known for punk and indy music \u2014 but it became a touchstone in an entirely new genre: \u201calt-country\u201d (\u201cwhatever that is,\u201d in the cheeky refrain of the movement\u2019s chronicling magazine, No Depression).We listeners are endless and instinctual categorizers, allotting everything its spot like bins in a record store. The human brain is a pattern-matching machine. Categories help us manage the torrent of information we receive and sort the world into easier-to-read patterns.When we see a rainbow, note the psychologists James Beale and Frank Keil, we see it as distinct bands of colors, rather than the \u201cgradual continuum we know it to be.\u201d Even though two colors may be the same distance apart in terms of wavelength, we can distinguish them more easily when they cross a color category.This \u201ccategorical perception,\u201d as it\u2019s called, is not an innocent process: What we think we\u2019re looking at can alter what we actually see. More broadly, when we put things into a category, research has found, they actually become more alike in our minds.\u201cSimilarity serves as a basis for the classification of objects,\u201d wrote the noted psychologist Amos Tversky, \u201cbut it is also influenced by the adopted classification.\u201d The flip side holds: Things we might have viewed as more similar become, when placed into two distinct categories, more different.Genre is also the way we most commonly make sense of music. But here, too, a form of categorical perception reigns.Even though a computer might struggle to see a strong difference between two forms of music, humans seem intent on finding one. As an example of two genres where the music sounds quite alike but isn\u2019t, Mr. McDonald cites \u201cvegan straight edge\u201d versus \u201chatecore.\u201d If you didn\u2019t know the categories, you might have trouble telling them apart \u2014 but meet the two groups of fans and the difference would be pretty apparent.Categorization affects not just how we perceive things, but how we feel about them. When we like something, we seem to want to break it down into further categories, away from the so-called basic level. Birders do not just see \u201cbirds,\u201d gardeners do not just see \u201cflowers\u201d; they see specific variations. The more we like something, the more we like to categorize it.As the psychology professor Debra Zellner has found, people who put drinks like coffee or beer into particular categories actually liked the everyday beverages more than the people who simply labeled everything as undifferentiated \u201cbeer\u201d or \u201ccoffee.\u201d Thus one online reviewer at the site BeerAdvocate described a brew as a \u201cperfect lawn mower beer.\u201d Is it the best beer ever? No. Is it good enough on a hot day after sweaty yardwork? Absolutely.These connoisseurs experienced less \u201chedonic contrast\u201d \u2014 the \u201clawn mower\u201d beer might suffer by comparison with a Belgian saison, but rise in a drinker\u2019s estimation if it were simply lumped with other beers of its type.When we struggle to categorize something, we like it less. In a study recently published in the journal PLOS One, the subjects were shown a variety of \u201cgender-ambiguous\u201d morphed images of men and women.One group was asked just to evaluate the attractiveness of the figure in each photo; another group was asked to first classify the people in the photos by gender, and then rate attractiveness. The first group tended to prefer faces that appeared more feminine, but the second group found all the morphed faces relatively unattractive.The mental work of classifying hard-to-classify stimuli seemed to produce \u201ccognitive disfluency,\u201d and this effort, the researchers speculated, produced \u201cnegative affect that transferred to the face itself.\u201dEven if we seem to like easy categorization, we\u2019re not rigid about the categories themselves. A few decades ago, for example, the idea of beer in America meant a pale-colored lager, strongly carbonated, low in alcohol and lacking flavor. Following the craft beer revolution, the very category of beer has expanded enormously, with any number of subcategories.Viewers going in expecting \u201cscience fiction\u201d or \u201ccomedy\u201d may have felt more than a touch of cognitive disfluency. Over time, people figured out new ways to look at them, new categories.The movies didn\u2019t change. We did.An opinion article last Sunday about why we like to categorize things misidentified the journal in which a study about responses to \u201cgender ambiguous\u201d images was published. The study appeared in PLOS One, not The Journal of Experimental Psychology.Tom Vanderbilt is the author, most recently, of \u201cYou May Also Like: Taste in an Age of Endless Choice.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Several movies \u2014 including Paramount\u2019s \u201cFences\u201d and Disney\u2019s \u201cThe Queen of Katwe\u201d \u2014 are being assembled by major studios.

On Nov. 4, Focus Features, an art house rival to Fox Searchlight, will release the period drama \u201cLoving,\u201d about the interracial couple (played by Ruth Negga and Joel Edgerton) whose arrest for marrying in 1958 and subsequent legal battle led to the end of America\u2019s anti-miscegenation laws. Directed by Jeff Nichols, \u201cLoving\u201d will play in competition at this month\u2019s Cannes Film Festival.Paramount, which pushed Ava DuVernay\u2019s \u201cSelma,\u201d released in 2014, for the Oscars, has high hopes for \u201cFences,\u201d an adaptation of August Wilson\u2019s Pulitzer Prize- and Tony Award-winning play about the black experience in the 1950s. Denzel Washington, a two-time Oscar winner for his roles in \u201cTraining Day\u201d and \u201cGlory,\u201d is directing \u201cFences\u201d and playing a lead role. Mr. Washington won a Tony in 2010 for his performance in a Broadway revival of the play.\u201cIt\u2019s his passion project,\u201d said Aaron L. Gilbert, managing director of the Bron group of companies, which is backing the film, and who is an executive producer on a team that includes the producer Scott Rudin. (Mr. Rudin, of course, is an Oscar perennial, whose \u201cNo Country for Old Men\u201d won best picture in 2008.)If \u201cFences,\u201d currently shooting in Pittsburgh, is indeed finished in time for awards consideration, Mr. Gilbert may end up competing against himself. He also served as a backer of \u201cThe Birth of a Nation.\u201dA24 is also looking at an awards season release for \u201cMoonlight,\u201d a 1980s-era drama based on the play \u201cIn Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue.\u201d The movie, directed and written by Barry Jenkins, has production support from Brad Pitt\u2019s Plan B Entertainment, known for \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d and \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d which scored five Oscar nominations and won one, for adapted screenplay.The list goes on: Will Smith, snubbed by the academy this year for \u201cConcussion,\u201d though twice nominated in the past, will star as a depressed advertising executive in the drama \u201cCollateral Beauty,\u201d to be released in December. It is directed by David Frankel, a past Oscar winner for the 1996 short film \u201cDear Diary,\u201d and also stars Kate Winslet, who has been nominated for seven Oscars, and won one for \u201cThe Reader.\u201dBlack youth, and young black directors, may have their moment in Steven Caple Jr.\u2019s \u201cThe Land,\u201d a drama acquired by IFC about four impoverished friends in Cleveland, and in Mr. McMurray\u2019s \u201cUnderground,\u201d which counts the producer Reginald Hudlin (\u201cDjango Unchained\u201d) as a member of its creative team.Mr. Hudlin is just now resuming his work as the director of \u201cMarshall,\u201d an independent film in which Chadwick Boseman plays a young Thurgood Marshall in a quest for racial justice that predated Marshall\u2019s years on the Supreme Court.\u201cWe\u2019d love to get it out this year, but it has to be right,\u201d said Paula Wagner, a producer of the film. Mr. Hudlin, Ms. Wagner noted, had interrupted work on the film to help produce this year\u2019s Oscar ceremony.If \u201cMarshall\u201d indeed makes it to the screen soon, with its story of a black lawyer in a United States just emerging from its Jim Crow era, it will share the stage with \u201cHidden Figures,\u201d a tale of black women using math to rise in the same, often difficult milieu. Theodore Melfi (\u201cSt. Vincent\u201d) directed the adaptation of Ms. Shetterly\u2019s book.\u201cIt\u2019s been such a whirlwind,\u201d said Ms. Shetterly, who described her forthcoming book\u2019s part in the sudden eruption of the kind of films that only months ago were said to be on Hollywood\u2019s endangered list.\u201cIt\u2019s an African-American story,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a woman\u2019s story. Now it\u2019s part of the national narrative.\u201dAdvertisement"}
