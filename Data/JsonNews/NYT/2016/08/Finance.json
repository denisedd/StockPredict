In recent days, both deals have become major land mines.In January, it unveiled a $5.8 billion acquisition of Alere, which makes medical tests. Alere has been subjected to a series of regulatory inquiries over foreign sales practices, which caused its annual financial report to be delayed. Even though some of those investigations were known before the deal was signed, Abbott has since appeared to have buyer\u2019s remorse.But analysts became concerned with Abbott\u2019s audacious plans for taking on debt to finance two huge deals at the same time.On Thursday, problems within both target companies surfaced.Les Funtleyder, a health care portfolio manager at E Squared Asset Management, said that Alere was a case study in what not to do with a transaction, given a breakdown somewhere in due diligence. Mr. Funtleyder said the risks surrounding St. Jude Medical would have been more difficult to foresee, but that Abbott may have lost some clout with investors, regardless.\u201cMaybe they did these deals out of desperation to bridge a growth gap or something, in terms of being willing to overlook things,\u201d said Mr. Funtleyder, who also is an adjunct professor of public health at Columbia University. \u201cWall Street is not going to think this is an honest mistake.\u201dThe health care industry has been undergoing extensive consolidation over the last few years, driven in part by larger companies buying smaller ones to help cut costs and fuel growth. Abbott has been a key player in the flurry of deal activity.\u201cAlere\u2019s lawsuit is without merit,\u201d an Abbott spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. \u201cAbbott is compliant with its obligations under the merger agreement and continues to work toward regulatory approvals, despite Alere\u2019s nearly six-month delay in filing its 2015 10-K.\u201dEven if the report were true, that alone would not give Abbott a way out of the deal if it wanted one. If the devices were recalled, Abbott might be able to terminate the deal, but there would be no guarantee.The distinction analysts make between St. Jude Medical and Alere is that the issues with Alere were known before Abbott signed the deal.\u201cIt\u2019s unusual to have these events, but it\u2019s also unusual to have two major deals pending,\u201d said David Toung, an analyst at Argus Research. \u201cAbbott certainly has its hands full in deciding which way it really wants to go, which companies it wants to acquire.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Plans Take Shape for Fran\u00e7ois Pinault Museum in Paris", "Date": "2016-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cIn the face of this barbarism, the only possible reaction is to move forward,\u201d Mr. Pinault, 79, said in an interview, conducted in person and through email exchanges. \u201cAs Andr\u00e9 Malraux said, \u2018Art is the shortest path from man to man.\u2019 That is what prompted me to accelerate the completion of my project in Paris.\u201dIn this case, Mr. Pinault has struck a 50-year lease on the building with the City of Paris, and he is financing both the anticipated 50 million euro, or $55 million, makeover and future operating costs.\u201cMy design is exactly the opposite of a pyramid,\u201d said Mr. Pinault, a high-school dropout who built a lumber business into the luxury-goods conglomerate Kering, which includes the brands Gucci, Saint Laurent, Stella McCartney and Balenciaga. Now he is also a power in the art world, not only as a collector but also as the owner of Christie\u2019s, the auction house.For the new project, Mr. Pinault \u2014 who with his probing blue eyes appears younger than his years \u2014 is personally presiding over all its details with a small team of advisers, including a former French culture minister, Jean-Jacques Aillagon. On his smartphone, encased in a cover with a picture of his dog, Polka, he keeps photos of potential ideas for the museum, like a unisex bathroom that he spotted on a trip to Los Angeles.\u201cIt is a project that must adapt and evolve constantly, and so it is not a monument frozen for all eternity,\u201d Mr. Pinault said.\u201cThis is not my mausoleum,\u201d he added.The plans are taking shape at the headquarters of Mr. Pinault\u2019s investment group, Artemis, in a 19th-century mansion off the Avenue Montaigne that also mixes classic architecture with contemporary art.Is there room in Paris for yet one more museum devoted to contemporary art?Danielle Simonnet, a far-left member of the Paris City Council, suggested that Mr. Pinault should have just donated his collection to the state, noting the existence of another contemporary art newcomer, the Louis Vuitton Foundation.The $143 million foundation building opened two years ago on the edge of Paris, a study in billowing sails designed by Frank Gehry and commissioned by Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, like Mr. Pinault a French luxury goods magnate and a longtime collector of contemporary art.The rivalry between the two French billionaires dates to the so-called \u201chandbag wars,\u201d when they vied for control of the Italian luxury group Gucci. (Mr. Pinault emerged victorious in 2001.) They have since bought works by some of the same artists, including Mr. Hirst and Richard Serra.Asked about any competition, Mr. Pinault demurred. \u201cIn the field of art, we don\u2019t speak of competition,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more places to present works, the better. Each collection is the history of a singular view.\u201dStill, the Louis Vuitton Foundation has set a high bar; it drew more than 1.2 million visitors last year.Harald Falckenberg, a German industrialist and collector with a private contemporary art museum of his own outside Hamburg, Germany, said that in the rarefied universe of billionaires it did not really matter whether there was a demand for a new contemporary art institution in Paris.\u201cA museum is absolutely a must for a good collector,\u201d Mr. Falckenberg said, noting that public museums could not highlight new artists in the same way as private museums because they need to appeal to visitors with mainstream, well-known art.\u201cPrivate collectors can take more risks because they are so rich,\u201d he said. \u201cIf only 2,000 visitors come, they say it\u2019s wonderful because they can look better at the works.\u201dIn general, for such largess, the French state also offers generous tax deductions. Individuals can deduct 66 percent of the value of financial contributions toward art acquisitions or restoration, up to 20 percent of their income.Mr. Pinault, the son of a farmer in Brittany, did not visit his first museum until after he was 30. Since buying a Mondrian for $8.8 million in 1991, he has intensified his collecting and now said he was building on his works from Sigmar Polke and Charles Ray while searching for new art forms from what he calls the post-internet generation.He tends to shun big art fairs, he said, preferring to visit artists in their studios \u2014 sometimes single-handedly reviving interest in a forgotten painter such as Martial Raysse, or drawing attention to young artists such as the Danish artist Danh Vo or the French painter Claire Tabouret. Two years ago, Mr. Pinault restored a historic rectory in Lens, in the north of France, to create an annual residency program for emerging artists.Mr. Pinault \u201chas this appetite for risk. He doesn\u2019t stay in his comfort zone, regarding the works he collects,\u201d said Ms. Tabouret, who added that she was shocked when he came to her Paris gallery opening in 2013. \u201cThat compares to some people in the art world who are looking to be reassured by seeing the same look-alike works.\u201dNow, Mr. Pinault\u2019s biggest challenge is what he can accomplish with a museum, which he insists is not just for the elite. Another of his advisers, Martin Bethenod, said the new art center was determined to reach beyond the core of the French capital to the banlieues, the suburbs that are concentrations of poverty and social isolation.What does Mr. Pinault want to leave as his legacy? \u201cBy creating a museum in Paris, I do not seek to impose a trace, but to make my contribution to history,\u201d he said. \u201cThe works of art will always have the last word.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname the chairman of LVMH. He is Bernard Arnault, not Arnaud.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Coup, Terrorists and Inflation, Yet Investors Rush to Turkey", "Date": "2016-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn the face of it, this might not seem the right time to be investing in Turkey.Terrorists attacked the main airport in Istanbul, a foiled coup raised questions about political stability, and the country\u2019s debt is being downgraded by rating agencies \u2014 all of this happening within a span of two weeks.So what were the best-performing investments in the global economy last week?You guessed it: Turkish stocks and bonds \u2014 up 6.6 and 3.8 percent in dollar terms, according to Merrill Lynch.Emerging markets are known for their wild, discordant swings, but this mini-rally in Turkey, brief as it may be, highlights just how much risk yield-starved investors are willing to take on when $11 trillion worth of bonds of governments around the world are offering up negative returns.That is why a Turkish 10-year bond that offers a 9 percent reward can be tempting, even if that country\u2019s inflation rate is 8.7 percent and rising and its currency is heading south.Stocks and bonds in developing markets have been on a tear since early last year, with once-scorned countries like Brazil (stock market up 54 percent in dollar terms for the year) and South Africa (up 24 percent during the same period) leading the way.The surge has been driven in part by a shift in mood by investors choosing to scoop up beaten-down assets in these countries. Emerging-market stocks as a whole are trading at steep discounts to their counterparts in the United States and Europe.A partial recovery in oil prices, political calm in Brazil and a growing sense that Chinese authorities will not allow the renminbi to collapse have also had their effect.At the root of this sudden rush of money into high-risk assets is the pressure that many institutions, from large pension funds and insurance companies to some hedge funds, are facing to find returns in a world of zero to negative interest rates.These pressures have increased since the market shock of the British vote to leave Europe. Bonds yields have continued to shrink and stock markets have hit record highs, giving investors further pause about their overweight positions in developed market stocks and bonds.\u201cIn places like Europe, the U.K. and the U.S., you have lots of risks but no reward,\u201d said Gavin Serkin, an emerging-markets expert at Frontier Funds, a consulting firm based in London. \u201cIn the developing world, you have risks, but at least you are getting paid for it.\u201dAnd that even includes Mongolia, where a new government and a view that commodity markets have bottomed have prompted a stampede into Mongolian government bonds.Other unlikely markets that are now in demand include Russia, where stocks year to date are up over 20 percent in dollar terms. A big factor driving these rallies, traders say, is the sense the currencies of these countries that have suffered from a strong dollar in recent years are now in recovery mode.And while there is still potential for the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates, there is less fear than there was a year ago that rates will push persistently upward and lure money out of emerging economies.Investors are also finding bargains among established companies in emerging markets that have improved their profitability in recent years but still trade at 30 percent discounts to their developed-market peers.\u201cWe are seeing a real shift in sentiment,\u201d said Nick Robinson, a portfolio manager at Aberdeen Investment Management which oversees $420 billion, a large chunk of which is in developing markets. \u201cAnd you really don\u2019t have to look too hard to find good stories with cheap valuations.\u201dAccording to the Institute of International Finance, a bank lobby that tracks global capital flows, about $25 billion poured into emerging markets last month. Asia and Latin America absorbed most of these funds.Combined with the $13 billion that swept into these markets in June, the last two months reflect a sharp shift in sentiment after one of the worst periods ever for emerging-market capital flows.According to the institute\u2019s calculations, $81 billion exited these markets in the months after the Chinese devaluation scare last August \u2014 an amount that approached that $96 billion that fled during the financial crisis.Economists at Institute of International Finance say that the flows surged in the weeks after Britain\u2019s surprise vote to leave the European Union when investors doubled down on their safe-haven bets by buying Japanese, European and United States government bonds.As the yields on these securities vanished late last month, government bonds in Brazil, South Africa and Turkey that yielded around 10 percent began to look attractive.That was especially so when compared with Italy, where comparable securities offered a 1 percent return even with concerns mounting that the country\u2019s banking crisis might force it to leave the euro.Or Japan, where investors in July took the extraordinary step of paying to borrow money for 20 years from a government with the highest debt burden among developed nations.Such minuscule returns are the result of an unprecedented era of monetary policy activism. The world\u2019s central banks have bought up 15 percent of global corporate and sovereign bonds in an effort to stimulate economic recovery.But, as Jan Dehn, the head of research at Ashmore in London, which oversees $51 billion in emerging market assets, points out, these securities do not hail from emerging markets.And that is why, he says, there is such a contrast between bond yields in the developed as opposed to the developing world as investors worldwide have, for the most part, ignored emerging markets in favor of following in the path of central banks.\u201cThe Q.E. trade is over,\u201d said Mr. Dehn, referring to the central bank policy of quantitative easing. \u201cAnd people are now looking to the non-Q.E. world, where the bonds in countries representing 58 percent of G.D.P. had an average yield of 5.6 percent \u2014 which is higher than when the Fed had rates at 5 percent before the crisis. That is pretty extraordinary.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump Wants to Cut Visa Program He Used for His Own Models", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 On the campaign trail, Donald J. Trump has excoriated the nation\u2019s visa program for high-skilled workers as a job killer, pledging to end it with \u201cno exceptions.\u201d But his own companies have used it to bring in hundreds of foreign workers, including fashion models for his modeling agency who need exhibit no special skills.The little-known corner of the H-1B visa program for models has been controversial for years, questioned not only by Americans facing competition from foreign models but by technology companies whose engineering and scientific visas may instead go to men or women with no more specialized skills than their cheekbones.Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee for president, has said the H-1B program allows companies to import foreign workers to replace American workers at lower pay.Such questions have reinvigorated opponents of the H-1B visas for fashion models, shining a fresh light on the people who shaped it and used it \u2014 including Mr. Trump; Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who sponsored legislation to add fashion models to the H-1B program; and the disgraced former New York congressman Anthony Weiner, who tried to reshape it. Mr. Weiner\u2019s wife, Huma Abedin, is a senior aide to Hillary Clinton.The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment.Legal authorization for a model is easier to attain than it is for most professionals. United States Citizenship and Immigration Services declined to say how government screeners evaluated applicants who were models on their \u201cdistinguished merit and ability.\u201d Angelo A. Paparelli, an immigration lawyer in Los Angeles, said, \u201cAs the Supreme Court said: It\u2019s like porn. You know it when you see it.\u201dSince 2001, American companies have filed nearly 5,000 applications to hire fashion models from abroad, according to Labor Department data. Last year, 67 applications were filed for 76 models (employers can ask for more than one worker on an application). The high-water mark for fashion models was 2004, when there were more than 800 requests. Since then, the numbers have declined to fewer than a hundred a year on average, the data shows.Once the Labor Department approves an application, it is forwarded to the Citizenship and Immigration Services, which decides whether to approve the H-1B classification for the worker. The State Department then issues a visa.The immigration agency declined to say how many visas it had approved for fashion models.The H-1B program for fashion models has long been a source of controversy. The suit against Mr. Trump\u2019s modeling management company in 2014 was filed by Alexis Palmer of Jamaica, who said that instead of being paid the $75,000 a year she had been promised, she received less than $4,000 over four years.The company found work for her just 21 days during the years she worked for Mr. Trump\u2019s modeling agency, Ms. Palmer said in her lawsuit.Alan Garten, a lawyer for Mr. Trump\u2019s agency, said Trump Modeling Management helped Ms. Palmer with the immigration process and fronted her the money to pay for it against future earnings.\u201cBut she was never an employee, she was self-employed,\u201d he said. \u201cShe hired us to be her manager. The way she was handled is standard across the fashion industry.\u201dJudge Analisa Torres of Federal District Court dismissed the case this year, saying Ms. Palmer should have first exhausted the administrative procedures at the Labor Department or raised it in a state court.\u201cThis is not the end of this case by any means,\u201d said Naresh Gehi, an immigration lawyer in New York representing Ms. Palmer, who added that the case was pending at the Labor Department.Get the latest national and state polls on the presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.A broader controversy has been stoked by the technology sector. Businesses clamor for the H-1Bs, which are intended to help companies fill positions for high-skilled jobs when they cannot find Americans with the necessary qualifications. Trade groups for engineers and programmers complain that including models in the visa program eats into the supply of skilled scientists, engineers and other professionals they need. The visas are capped by Congress at 65,000 per year.Last year, it took just five days for the number of H-1B applicants to reach that limit, according to the Department of Homeland Security. The visas are initially approved for three years and can be extended for another three.\u201cIt is odd that fashion models are grouped in with visas for these high-skilled workers,\u201d said Neil G. Ruiz, director for the Center on Law, Economics and Finance at George Washington University Law School. \u201cAnd it makes you scratch your head that it\u2019s the only H-1B category that does not require a bachelor\u2019s degree.\u201dMr. Ruiz said that while the number of visas for models was small \u2014 fewer than 1 percent \u2014 it still affected the overall program because every visa granted to a model means one less goes to other workers in the H-1B categories.Fashion models, which were overlooked in the original 1990 immigration reform laws that created the worker category in the H-1B visa program, were added a year later by Mr. Kennedy, a liberal stalwart and pro-union Democrat.Other categories were created that allowed the universities and sports teams to bring in workers with \u201cextraordinary ability\u201d in the areas of science, the arts, education and athletics.In 2006, Mr. Weiner tried to move models into the category of actors and athletes but he was criticized after it was disclosed that a lawyer representing fashion models had sponsored a fund-raiser that added $10,000 for his failed campaign in 2009 to be mayor of New York City.In an interview, Mr. Weiner said he sought the change after the being approached by New York publishing and modeling industry representatives about the effect of having models compete for visas in same category as tech workers.\u201cThey had to jump through all these hoops for people who come in for a day or two at a time to do a photo shoot and then want to go back home,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people just got tired and said, \u2018We\u2019ll just go to Europe and do the shoots.\u2019 It was creating a burden for the industry here.\u201dJeremy Bowers contributed reporting from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Treasures of Saint Pierre", "Date": "2016-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the remains of a former bell tower and an adjoining deconsecrated chapel in the cathedral of Saint Pierre, Mr. Othoniel has created what he describes as a totally immersive artwork, a three-room grotto in blue, gold and silver that serves as a showcase for about 200 liturgical objects and vestments from the cathedral\u2019s pastDestroyed and rebuilt several times over the centuries, the cathedral now combines a 12th-century Romanesque front with a 19th-century neo-Romanesque body designed by Paul Abadie, the architect of Sacr\u00e9 Coeur de Montmartre in Paris. For the project, which has taken eight years from design to completion, Mr. Othoniel sought to stay within the Romanesque stylistic tradition, translated into his own idiom of colorful glass beadwork.\u201cI am interested in how an artist can delve into the past and revisit and rework classic designs,\u201d he said in an interview last month. \u201cAbadie already worked with the original Romanesque design. I\u2019m following him, in a continuum.\u201dThe result, which will open to the public on Sept. 30, has similarities to his Versailles fountains \u2014 not surprisingly, since Mr. Othoniel worked on them in parallel. But where the fountains play on the intricacies of baroque choreography, the motif in Angoul\u00eame is more geometric. A braided Roman-knot maze winds across a blue stained-glass window speckled with gold and is repeated in the rooms\u2019 hand-printed wallpapers and patterned cement-tiled floors.The window itself is mantled in a crochet-like aluminum valance that is echoed in the glass-beaded pedestals and vitrines that display the objects.Those artifacts, mainly in gold plate and paste glass, are modest in value but rich in the spirit and color of 19th-century romantic medievalism. Mr. Othoniel\u2019s vitrines display flamboyantly gilded and decorated chalices, thuribles (incense burners), monstrances (for displaying relics), chasubles and stoles.\u201cThe aim has been to retranscribe the spirit of the age, the popular fervor of the late-19th century,\u201d said Pierre Cazenave, the French Culture Ministry\u2019s regional curator of historic monuments, who commissioned the project with the bishop of Angoul\u00eame. \u201cYou need to understand the emotion in an object to understand its sense. That\u2019s exactly what Jean-Michel has done.\u201dThe second half of the 19th century was \u201ca very proactive period for the church,\u201d Mr. Othoniel said, noting it was the time when Lourdes, also in southwest France, emerged as a place of mass pilgrimage and miracle cures after reported apparitions of the Virgin Mary in 1858. \u201cIt was a time of spontaneous religious activity\u201d and the Angoul\u00eame treasures, whose purchase or fabrication was financed by donations from the congregation, reflected that spirit, he said.\u201cI\u2019m really happy to be working here,\u201d Mr. Othoniel added, \u201cBecause France isn\u2019t just the monuments of Paris. It also has rich and interesting places, in terms of the history of art, in the provinces.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Frank Hodsoll, Who Navigated Arts Funding Under Reagan, Dies at 78", "Date": "2016-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHis wife, Mimi Hodsoll, said the cause was cancer.Following Roger Stevens, Nancy Hanks and Livingston Biddle, Mr. Hodsoll was the fourth chairman of the endowment, which was established by Congress in 1965 to support American artists of various stripes, arts organizations and arts education.An unlikely choice for the post, Mr. Hodsoll had no working background in the arts. A lawyer, he had spent 14 years in the Foreign Service, worked on Reagan\u2019s 1980 election campaign and was deputy to the White House chief of staff, James A. Baker III, when he asked to be put in charge of the arts endowment.On hearing the request, Mr. Baker looked at him in astonishment and rolled his eyes, Mr. Hodsoll recalled. Others told him he was undermining his career. At the time, David L. Stockman, Reagan\u2019s budget director, had just proposed halving the annual appropriation for the endowment with the aim of phasing it out altogether.As someone who was interested in the arts, Mr. Hodsoll later told The Los Angeles Times, that prospect was the reason he volunteered.\u201cI didn\u2019t know what the appropriate amount for the arts endowment should be, but I didn\u2019t think it ought to be cut,\u201d he said.Mr. Hodsoll successfully lobbied against such draconian measures; the president, though intent on cutting the federal budget considerably, was not wholeheartedly behind the Stockman plan for the endowment.The endowment did see its budget cut by 10 percent in the early years of the administration, but under Mr. Hodsoll, who was chairman from 1981 to 1989, it largely maintained its level of appropriation and even saw a slight increase. In 1981, before the 10 percent cut, Congress allotted $159 million; by 1989 it had risen to $169 million.During his tenure the endowment created what is now known as the annual NEA Jazz Masters Fellowships and took on management of the National Medal of Arts, which each year honors artists in a variety of fields.Mr. Hodsoll emphasized making the arts more accessible to the public, increasing audiences for arts organizations and expanding arts education, a goal that has proved especially difficult to achieve. A study published by the endowment in 2008 showed that the percentage of 18-year-olds reporting that they had received arts education in childhood held fairly steady, from 63 to 65 percent, during Mr. Hodsoll\u2019s tenure; it has been in decline since.It was also during his chairmanship that the seeds of crisis were planted \u2014 one that would erupt at the endowment in the 1990s in the political battle over the suitability of government financing of controversial, so-called \u201coffensive\u201d works of art.In 1984, Representative Mario Biaggi, Democrat of New York, joined by Rudolph W. Giuliani, then the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, objected to an endowment-funded production of Verdi\u2019s \u201cRigoletto\u201d at the Metropolitan Opera because it was set among Mafiosi in Little Italy and thus, they said, disparaging of Italian-Americans.In 1985, three Republican congressmen from Texas \u2014 Dick Armey, Tom DeLay and Steve Bartlett \u2014 led a campaign to monitor the endowment\u2019s grant-making process and to prohibit awards to artists whose work could be considered \u201cpatently offensive to the average person.\u201dMr. Hodsoll and the endowment fended off that effort, but by the time he departed, he had unknowingly left his successors, John Frohnmayer and Jane Alexander, with much bigger headaches.One could be traced to a $75,000 grant that the endowment, in 1987, had given to the Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art in Winston-Salem, N.C., in support of a traveling visual arts exhibition that included a photograph titled \u201cPiss Christ,\u201d Andres Serrano\u2019s depiction of a crucifix floating in a golden liquid.The next year the Institute of Contemporary Art at the University of Pennsylvania received a $30,000 grant for a retrospective exhibition of works by the photographer Robert Mapplethorpe featuring explicit homoerotic images.For these and other grants the endowment came under fierce criticism by conservatives like Senators Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Alfonse M. D\u2019Amato of New York; the commentator and presidential candidate Patrick Buchanan; the speaker of the house, Newt Gingrich, and the columnist George Will.Mapplethorpe, who died in 1989, did not live to see much of the brouhaha, but he and Mr. Serrano became emblems of the battle over the endowment, which eventually led the House Appropriations Committee to slash the agency\u2019s budget in 1996 by 39 percent, to $99 million from $162 million. The budget has never returned to the level of 1989-94. For 2016, its appropriation was $148 million (about $91 million in 1994 dollars).Francis Samuel Monaise Hodsoll was born in Los Angeles on May 1, 1938, the son of Frances Hodsoll, who ran an import-export company in the Philippines, and the former Whitney Monaise. He attended the Cate School in Santa Barbara County, Calif., and graduated from Yale, where he majored in art history and American studies. He served in the Army and then studied law at Cambridge University and at Stanford.For a time he was with the law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell and then worked for the State Department in Belgium. Before joining the Reagan administration, he worked in the Environmental Protection Agency and the Commerce Department. After he left the endowment he served in President George Bush\u2019s administration, in the Office of Management and Budget.Mr. Hodsoll married Mimi McEwen in 1963. In addition to her, he is survived by a half sister, Monaise MacDonald; a daughter, Lisa; a son, Francis, and two grandchildren.\u201cEveryone said I was nuts,\u201d Mr. Hodsoll recalled years later about his wish to lead the endowment. But interviewed at the time, in 1981, by The Washington Post, he said he had his reasons.\u201cEncouraging creativity is like being at the cutting edge of human development,\u201d he told The Post. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m crazy, but I think that would be an exciting thing to do. Not being a member of the creative sector myself, I think it would be interesting to help develop a climate within which creative people would find it easier to do their thing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. O\u2019Keefe executed a textbook dive and shredded one of the slow-moving Val dive bombers with his Browning .50-caliber machine guns.Leveling off, he spotted six more Japanese planes ahead of him and quickly closed the gap. \u201cIt was my intention to shoot all six of them down, but it didn\u2019t work out that way,\u201d he said.He fired and missed the leader, who broke off from formation and dived into the clouds, seeking cover. Mr. O\u2019Keefe gave chase. \u201cI decided I was going to stay with him until we settled the matter,\u201d he said.When the clouds thinned, he took dead aim and let loose with his guns. \u201cHe just blew up,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Keefe said.As he headed back to the Japanese formation, a Val attacked him head on, and a classic dogfight ensued. The two planes crisscrossed, each trying to get inside the other\u2019s path for a clear shot. Mr. O\u2019Keefe struck first, and smoke began streaming from the Japanese plane. The pilot, in a desperation move, tried to ram Mr. O\u2019Keefe.\u201cI guess he realized that he was gone and wanted to take me with him,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Keefe said. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t want to go.\u201d Pulling back hard on the stick, Mr. O\u2019Keefe brought his plane up sharply, narrowly avoiding a collision, as the Japanese plane fell into the sea.After taking out a fourth Japanese plane in a swooping dive, Mr. O\u2019Keefe caught up with a distant kamikaze heading toward American ships and, running low on ammunition, took him out with a few short bursts. On landing at Kadena Air Base on Okinawa, he found that he had exhausted the ammunition in four of his plane\u2019s six machine guns.Mr. O\u2019Keefe shot down two more kamikazes later in the week, putting him in a tie for first place among the squadron\u2019s 12 aces at the end of the war. For his exploits he was awarded the Air Medal, the Navy Cross and the Distinguished Flying Cross. In 2015 he was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian award given by Congress, in a ceremony in Ocean Springs, Miss.Jeremiah Joseph O\u2019Keefe III was born on July 12, 1923, in Ocean Springs. His father, Jeremiah O\u2019Keefe Jr., known as Ben, ran a livery and funeral home. His mother, the former Teresa Slattery, was a homemaker.After losing their home in the Depression, the family moved to Biloxi, where Jerry attended high school at Sacred Heart Academy, then went on to Soul\u00e9 Business College in New Orleans.Before shipping out with the Marine Corps, he married Annette Saxon. She died in 1998. In addition to his son Joseph, he is survived by his wife, the former Martha Peterson; three other sons, John, Jeffrey and Justin; seven daughters, Maureen Ward, Cecilia Neustrom, Kathryn Kaye, Virginia O\u2019Keefe, Susan Snyder, Mary Snell and Mercedes Huval; 40 grandchildren; and 33 great-grandchildren.A longtime champion of equal rights for black Mississippians, Mr. O\u2019Keefe confronted the Ku Klux Klan by rescinding a parade permit that the group had been granted without his knowledge. When the Klan members went ahead and marched, he had them arrested. The Klan responded with death threats and by burning a cross on his lawn.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Silver, Like Skelos, Can Remain Free While Appealing Graft Conviction", "Date": "2016-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a search on the federal Bureau of Prisons website, the names of two familiar New Yorkers \u2014 Sheldon Silver and Dean G. Skelos \u2014 now appear.Both were once powerful state lawmakers. Then they were convicted on corruption charges. Now they are listed with prisoner registration numbers: Mr. Silver is 71915-054; Mr. Skelos is 72196-054.But for each man\u2019s entry, the federal website also adds: \u201cNot in B.O.P. custody.\u201d And based on a court ruling on Thursday, neither man is now required to report to the authorities anytime soon as the convictions are appealed, a process that could take more than a year.Ever since they were found guilty last year in separate trials, Mr. Silver, 72, a Manhattan Democrat who was speaker of the State Assembly, and Mr. Skelos, 68, a Long Island Republican who served as the State Senate majority leader, have moved aggressively to stave off the day that they had to begin serving their prison sentences and pay the imposed fines.Prosecutors had charged that Mr. Silver had obtained nearly $4 million in illicit payments and bribes in return for official actions that benefited a prominent cancer researcher at Columbia University and two real estate developers.Judge Caproni, in her opinion, made it clear she believed that Mr. Silver had engaged in such conduct. \u201cThere is no question that Silver took a number of official acts \u2014 most obviously passing legislation and approving state grants and tax-exempt financing \u2014 as part of a quid pro quo\u201d in two schemes, she wrote.But, citing the recent McDonnell decision, she added that there was a \u201csubstantial question\u201d whether the court\u2019s instructions to the jury, which defined official action, were in error, and if so, whether that error was harmless.Mr. Skelos was convicted with his son in December. Prosecutors showed that they had used the senator\u2019s position to pressure various firms to provide the son with consulting work and other benefits. The elder Mr. Skelos faces a five-year sentence and his son received a term of six and a half years.Judge Wood, in a brief order on Aug. 4 continuing their bail, said they had shown that their appeals presented \u201ca substantial question regarding whether this court\u2019s jury instructions were erroneous\u201d in light of the McDonnell case.The office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, declined to comment on the ruling on Thursday. Mr. Silver\u2019s lawyers, Joel Cohen and Steven F. Molo, said in a statement: \u201cWe are grateful that the trial judge agreed there is now a substantial legal question about the conviction. We look forward to vigorously pursuing Mr. Silver\u2019s appeal.\u201dThe ruling drew varied reactions in the legal community, where the men\u2019s efforts to obtain bail were being watched with interest by lawyers with no involvement in the cases. Jennifer G. Rodgers, the executive director of the Center for the Advancement of Public Integrity at Columbia Law School and a former federal prosecutor, said she believed that all three men would eventually lose their appeals.\u201cThe problem from the public\u2019s perspective,\u201d she said, \u201cis that, whether or not the judges\u2019 bail decisions were technically legally correct, leaving Silver and Skelos free feeds into the notion that these corrupt officials continue to succeed in working the system to their advantage.\u201dBut Gerald B. Lefcourt, a veteran defense lawyer who has represented clients in corruption cases, said that the McDonnell decision might indeed offer a strong basis for appeal and that fairness dictated continuing bail for Mr. Silver and the Skeloses.\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t have to serve time when they may never have to,\u201d he said. \u201cI have no love for these men, but I do care about the system.\u201dTo obtain bail pending appeal, a defendant must show an appeal raises a \u201csubstantial question of law or fact\u201d that is likely to result in a conviction\u2019s reversal.That is why the McDonnell decision has been at the center of the current debate. In it, the Supreme Court appeared to narrow the definition of the kind of conduct or \u201cofficial acts\u201d that may serve as the basis for a corruption prosecution. The court said such conduct had to involve formal and concrete government actions or decisions, not just the setting up of meetings or making phone calls.The Silver and Skelos defense lawyers have argued that the judges in their clients\u2019 cases instructed the juries more broadly about what constituted an official act than may now be allowed under the McDonnell decision. As a result, they say, there is no way to tell whether the juries, in convicting the men, \u201cimproperly relied on acts that are not \u2018official\u2019 under McDonnell,\u201d as Mr. Silver\u2019s lawyer wrote in a court filing.Federal prosecutors had strongly opposed the bail requests. In a recent filing in Mr. Silver\u2019s case, Mr. Bharara\u2019s office argued that the actions for which he was convicted fit squarely within the narrower McDonnell definition.\u201cMcDonnell will not save Silver on appeal, nor should it entitle him to bail pending appeal,\u201d the prosecutors said. And even if the jury instructions were erroneous in light of the McDonnell case, they said, \u201cthe error clearly would be harmless.\u201d There was no chance, they said, that the jury\u2019s verdict could have been based on acts that fell short of the McDonnell standard.\u201cThe proof was overwhelming,\u201d Mr. Bharara\u2019s office wrote, \u201cthat in exchange for millions in personal payouts, Silver took or agreed to take actions that by any definition were \u2018official\u2019 \u2014 including securing state funding and favorable state legislation.\u201dJudge Caproni, in her ruling, noted that her jury instruction had not included \u201ckey language from McDonnell\u2019s definition of official action.\u201d She said Mr. Silver\u2019s case differed from the McDonnell case because most of the official acts presented to the jury \u201care undoubtedly official acts under McDonnell.\u201dBut, she added, the government had also introduced evidence of actions taken by Mr. Silver in exchange for money \u201cthat may not qualify as official acts under McDonnell but were argued to the jury \u2014 consistent with pre-McDonnell law \u2014 as official acts.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Colombia and FARC Reach Deal to End the Americas\u2019 Longest War", "Date": "2016-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byColombia\u2019s government and the largest rebel group in the country have reached a deal to end more than 50 years of conflict, the two sides announced Wednesday, paving the way for an end to the longest-running war in the Americas.This time, the two sides declared that a final deal had been clinched.\u201cToday begins the end of the suffering, the pain and the tragedy of war,\u201d President Juan Manuel Santos said in a nationally televised address after the agreement was announced. \u201cLet\u2019s open the door together to a new stage in our history.\u201dBut to most Colombians, the deal is simply a promise that the war, which has lasted 52 years, claimed some 220,000 lives and displaced more than five million people, is at last coming to an end.Peace in Colombia now looks more likely than ever, but a big hurdle still needs to be cleared before the deal is ratified. Mr. Santos, who has staked his legacy on a deal, must now sell it to his people, who will be asked to vote in an up-or-down referendum.Rallying against that approval is Mr. Santos\u2019s predecessor, former President \u00c1lvaro Uribe, whose term ended in 2010 with the FARC diminished.Mr. Uribe is widely credited with the military gains that forced the rebels to the negotiating table. But he is now leading a growing campaign against the deal, saying it amounts to an unjust amnesty for the rebels.\u201cThey will spend zero days in prison, they will be awarded with political representation,\u201d Paloma Valencia, a senator in Mr. Uribe\u2019s party, said of the rebels. \u201cThis deal breaks the rule of law.\u201dStill, others hailed the deal as a major step for a country of 50 million people whose growing economy has long been hampered by the simple fact that the state does not control all of its territory.\u201cIt\u2019s an enormous opportunity for the country to create a democratic state, which will allow us to live in peace,\u201d said Maria Emma Wills, a political analyst at the National Center for Historical Memory, a government research group.She warned, \u201cThe deal has strong political opposition, and the next job is going to be public advocacy for it.\u201dThe war remains one of the most emotionally charged issues in Colombia, characterized by kidnappings and the massacre of civilians caught between the rebels and the military. Waves of Colombians left the country fearing the violence. Few who remained were untouched by it.Now the two sides say they have settled many of the last sticking points that kept them at loggerheads for years.But even if the deal is approved by the public, its success is anything but guaranteed.How will thousands of guerrillas \u2014 many of whom were kidnapped as children and know only life in the jungle \u2014 find their way into mainstream society, and will they be accepted there?Two FARC peace negotiators were named in a 2006 federal indictment, charged with helping to make the organization a narcotics powerhouse responsible for more than \u201c60 percent of the cocaine sent to the United States.\u201dStill, the peace deal makes wide-ranging promises to reshape a post-conflict Colombia.In a nod to longstanding grievances among the rebels, the government promised to make significant investments in rural areas, which the rebels say have long been neglected at the expense of cities like Bogot\u00e1.Far more contentious, however, has been the subject of what will become of the rebels themselves.For decades, the FARC financed its insurgency by kidnapping people and holding them for ransom, a business that terrorized thousands, including a former presidential candidate who was held for years.The agreement tries to resolve past grievances with the stroke of a pen: Under a so-called transitional justice system, all but the most grievous crimes may be resolved with reduced sentences.Silvio Hern\u00e1ndez, whose son Erik was a soldier killed by the rebels in combat in 2011, said he felt the agreement would not bring justice.\u201cThe FARC are not going to pay for the crime against my son,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s good that we are reaching peace, but this leaves me with many doubts.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Walmart Is Said to Be in Talks to Acquire Jet.com", "Date": "2016-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJet.com was born out of a dream of taking on Amazon and its grip on the world of e-commerce. But the online discount retailer may instead be poised for a humbling sale to the biggest traditional store chain around.Jet.com is in talks to sell itself to Walmart, two people briefed on the matter said on Wednesday. The talks are continuing and may not lead to a deal.The discussions are an acknowledgment of the tough reality of America\u2019s $350 billion e-commerce market, which has for years been dominated by Amazon. While plenty of competitors \u2014 including physical retailers and online start-ups \u2014 have tried to take on Amazon with strategies like focusing only on specific niches of the market or having flash sales, none have succeeded.From offices in Hoboken, N.J., Jet.com tried to chart a different course in the e-commerce market. It attacked Amazon directly, seeking to build a national network of warehouses while offering a similarly broad selection of goods. But it also sought to undercut Amazon on price, using complex formulas that adjust the cost of items based on factors like the quantity of products bought at once. For an annual membership fee of $50, Jet.com consumers could get access to goods priced 10 to 15 percent less than anywhere else on the web.Mr. Lore also tried to make Jet.com different from other start-ups at the workplace. Most start-ups try to bend a reluctant universe to their will, which means employees sweat 12-hour days and seven-day weeks. Private lives go by the wayside. But Jet promoted itself as a start-up with a difference: one focused on employee well-being.His approach in e-commerce and the workplace may have seemed quixotic, but Mr. Lore succeeded in raising more than $500 million from many investors, including venture capital firms like New Enterprise Associates and the mutual fund company Fidelity. Jet.com quickly gained a valuation of roughly $1 billion.Along the way, it was hailed as a particularly ambitious \u201cunicorn,\u201d the once-ballyhooed class of Silicon Valley start-ups valued at $1 billion or more.A month later, after Jet.com had finished a fund-raising round, Mr. Lore said: \u201cIt was challenging. The market conditions have turned, and there is a lot of negative press around private company financing. The fact that we got it done was on the back of the company\u2019s performance.\u201dFor Walmart, pursuing Jet.com in what would be one of its biggest takeovers, a deal would help the retailer reproduce its off-line dominance in the online world. The Bentonville, Ark., company has pumped millions of dollars into efforts to expand its e-commerce business, such as offering more items online and expanding locations for its grocery pickup service.At the end of 2015, Walmart had about eight million items available at Walmart.com. That\u2019s now up to 10 million. Four years ago, it was under two million, Walmart has said. The retailer does not break out a quarterly figure for online sales, but it said its e-commerce business had grown 7 percent in the last quarter.Walmart recently announced a two-day subscription shipping service for $49, its version of Amazon\u2019s $99 annual Prime membership. Walmart is also trying to take advantage of its position as the nation\u2019s largest grocer, nearly tripling the number of markets where customers can order groceries and pick up curbside.Jet\u2019s model of encouraging bulk buying would complement Walmart in areas where the retailer has lagged, according to Neil Saunders, a retail analyst with Conlumino, a research and consulting firm.A decade ago, consumers might have been more inclined to stop at Walmart for household items like toilet paper and laundry detergent in \u201cfairly reasonable quantities\u201d and pick up other items while they were there, Mr. Saunders said.\u201cWhat\u2019s happened, though, with these online sites is that people first of all are much more likely to buy in bulk because they can get better deals,\u201d he said.Reporting was contributed by David Streitfeld, Rachel Abrams, Leslie Picker and Katie Benner.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Forest Hills, Queens: City Life in a Suburban Setting", "Date": "2016-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLiving In11 PhotosGeorge and Chi Hae Chen carried out an exhaustive house hunt that took them to Westchester County and New Jersey before they settled on their two-bedroom two-bath co-op in Forest Hills, Queens.Having also ruled out Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn as overpriced, Mr. Chen, 33, said the neighborhood in central Queens gave them exactly what they wanted \u2014 value with an easy commute to their jobs in Midtown Manhattan. Proximity to good restaurants sealed the deal.Recent home buyers like the Chens often land in Forest Hills after looking elsewhere \u2014 including other Queens neighborhoods such as Astoria and Long Island City \u2014 ultimately drawn by its relatively reasonable housing prices, excellent transportation, shopping and proximity to parks. Housing options range from modest co-ops in prewar buildings to Tudor mansions in the upscale Forest Hills Gardens section.\u201cWe\u2019re a well-packaged neighborhood, a condensed mini-Manhattan,\u201d said Maxine Savel, a real estate agent with Charles Rutenberg Realty, who lives and works in Forest Hills.Jacques Ambron, a broker with Madeleine Realty who has lived in Forest Hills his whole life, said he sees many young families buying in the neighborhood. \u201cWe call them the baby brigade,\u201d he said.Among them are Monica Smith, a 35-year-old schoolteacher, and her husband, Dr. Jules Beal, 34, a pediatric neurologist, who moved with their 2-year-old son in June from Manhattan into a renovated townhouse they bought for $1.1 million.Ms. Smith, who is expecting a second child, said Forest Hills fulfilled her desire for a walkable neighborhood and her husband\u2019s wish for a more suburban setting. \u201cWe feel that Forest Hills is the perfect balance,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has the conveniences of shops, restaurants and trains and also these beautiful tree-lined streets.\u201dSo far, she said, she has not looked back at her old life on the Upper East Side. \u201cI\u2019m sure there will be things I miss about it, but right now we are really loving the elbow room,\u201d Ms. Smith said.Birjees Barakat, who had lived in Manhattan since moving to New York as a teenager in the 1970s, said she, too, has taken quickly to life in Forest Hills.Ms. Barakat, an administrative assistant at an investment firm, paid less than $300,000 in March for a one-bedroom co-op, where she has been living since late April while undertaking a renovation.\u201cPeople say about Manhattan that \u2018I can\u2019t live anywhere else,\u2019 and that\u2019s what I used to think as well,\u201d she said. \u201cMy new place is on Austin Street, and I love all the stores. Everything is here. I won\u2019t have to leave except to go to work.\u201d\u201cThere is life after Manhattan,\u201d she said.Forest Hills, covering about 2.5 square miles, is bordered mainly by Rego Park, Middle Village, Kew Gardens, the Grand Central Parkway and beyond that, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. Of its several subsections, the most distinctive is Forest Hills Gardens, a private development built in the early 20th century, with pocket parks, Tudor and colonial homes and old-fashioned lampposts. The nearby Van Court area has homes of similar character that are more modest and closely spaced.On the other side of Queens Boulevard are many large brick prewar co-op buildings. Beyond them is a section called Cord Meyer after the developer that first built in the area, with more single-family houses. Some older homes in this area have been replaced with McMansions.A search on July 28 of the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island, which includes Queens, showed 174 properties for sale in Forest Hills, ranging from a studio co-op listed at $129,000 to a contemporary four-bedroom home in the Cord Meyer area for $3.9 million.George Herrera, a listing specialist and the director of marketing for Queens Home Team Keller Williams, said the median sales price of single- and multi-family homes in the 11375 ZIP code, which includes Forest Hills, for the year ending June 30 was $943,350, up 18.4 percent from the same period two years earlier. For co-ops, his research showed the median price increased 32.2 percent over two years, to $299,500.While most older apartment buildings are co-ops, newer condominium towers have sprung up, including the Aston on 71st Avenue and the Windsor on 71st Road. A two-bedroom two-and-a-half-bath condo with a terrace in the Aston is listed at $1.888 million.A search of StreetEasy.com early this month showed around 150 rentals, ranging from a co-op studio for around $1,300 a month to a seven-bedroom colonial for about $10,000. One-bedrooms were about $1,700 to $3,850 a month; two-bedrooms, about $2,000 to $4,500.The West Side Tennis Club is a neighborhood institution that owns Forest Hills Stadium, where the United States Open was held until it moved to Flushing Meadows in 1978. Besides tennis, it has an outdoor pool and a Tudor clubhouse. In 2013, the club reintroduced outdoor concerts at the stadium.The Community House, in the Gardens section, has a gym and indoor pool and offers a variety of classes for children and adults.Austin Street has a mix of independently owned stores and restaurants as well as national and chain businesses. A Target opened there in July, replacing a Barnes & Noble. The street also has a Shake Shack and clothing stores such as Gap and Loft.Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, site of the 1939 and 1964 World\u2019s Fairs and home to the Queens Museum, the New York Hall of Science and the Queens Zoo, is to the east and northeast of the neighborhood; to the south and southwest is Forest Park. Both have playgrounds, ball fields and courts and bike trails, among other facilities.Public School 196 Grand Central Parkway has 915 students in kindergarten to Grade 5. According to the city Department of Education\u2019s 2014-2015 School Quality Snapshot, 73 percent of its students met state standards in English, compared with 30 percent citywide; 86 percent did in math, compared with 39 percent.P.S. 101 the School in the Gardens has 612 students in kindergarten through Grade 6. There 63 percent of students met standards in English and 79 percent in math. At P.S. 144 Col. Jeromus Remsen, with 834 students in kindergarten through Grade 5, 60 percent of students met standards in English and 68 percent did in math.Junior High School 190 Russell Sage, with 1,035 students in Grades 6 to 8, had 44 percent of students meeting standards in English, compared with 30 percent citywide, and 49 percent in math, compared with 30 percent.A Long Island Rail Road train leaving Forest Hills at 8:25 a.m. is scheduled to arrive at New York\u2019s Penn Station 17 minutes later. One-way peak fare is $8.25; a monthly ticket, $184. The neighborhood\u2019s three subway stops are along Queens Boulevard. The 67th Avenue station is served by the E, M and R trains, the Forest Hills-71st Avenue station by the E, F, M and R, and the 75th Avenue station by the E and F. A ride on the E train from 71st Avenue to Rockefeller Center at 8 a.m. takes just under half an hour, according to the MTA\u2019s TripPlanner.The return of outdoor concerts to Forest Hills Stadium revives a musical legacy. In the 1960s, some of the biggest performers in the world played there. According to the stadium\u2019s website, the Beatles had two sold-out shows there in 1964, arriving by helicopter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump, With Bare-Bones Campaign, Relies on G.O.P. for Vital Tasks", "Date": "2016-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDonald J. Trump is leaning heavily on Republican Party organizations to provide crucial campaign functions like getting out the vote, digital outreach and fund-raising, at a time when some leading Republicans have called for party officials to cut off Mr. Trump and focus instead on maintaining control of Congress.Despite an influx of campaign cash from small donors in July, Mr. Trump\u2019s operation still largely resembles the bare-bones outfit that he rode to victory during the primary season, more concert tour than presidential campaign, according to interviews and documents filed with the Federal Election Commission through Saturday night. And some Republicans believe he is effectively out of time to invest in the kind of large-scale infrastructure that the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, will bring to the polls in November.In July, when Mrs. Clinton spent almost $3 million to field a staff of 700 people at her Brooklyn headquarters and in swing states around the country, according to Federal Election Commission payroll data, Mr. Trump spent more money on renting arenas for his speeches than he did on payroll. A senior Trump campaign official, who asked for anonymity because he was not permitted to discuss staffing publicly, said Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign had fewer than 200 total staff members at the end of July, about evenly divided between field offices and New York.Although he has opened offices in Ohio and Florida in recent weeks, Mr. Trump\u2019s field efforts rely primarily on roughly 500 Republican National Committee organizers scattered across 11 swing states.The arrangement is a kind of throwback to the pre-Citizens United era, when party organizations \u2014 not independent \u201csuper PACs\u201d and political nonprofits \u2014 assumed many of the financial and organizational burdens of national campaigns.But it also highlights the bind in which Republican leaders find themselves as Mr. Trump\u2019s struggles threaten to undermine the party\u2019s Senate and House candidates in November: As dependent as Mr. Trump is on their organization, the party is now deeply dependent on Mr. Trump\u2019s surging base of small donors to finance it.\u201cThere is no moving the turnout operation or the absentee ballot program away from Donald Trump and in some senator\u2019s favor,\u201d Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, said in an interview on Sunday with CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work that way. There\u2019s no hundred million dollars in a drawer that might not be spent on one person, but in favor of another.\u201dIn contrast with campaign financing in 2012, there is no outside cavalry of deep-pocketed super PACs preparing to buttress Mr. Trump\u2019s television and field efforts. Two of the largest outside groups backing Mr. Trump began August with less than $4 million combined cash on hand, according to Federal Election Commission filings, half of it from a single donor, the wealthy New York investor Robert Mercer. The primary super PAC backing Mrs. Clinton, Priorities USA Action, reported $38.6 million in the bank and claimed an additional $44 million in committed funds from wealthy donors.The parties cannot raise unlimited \u201csoft money\u201d contributions \u2014 money raised into state rather than federal accounts and parlayed into large-scale political advertising campaigns \u2014 as they could during the 1990s, before super PACs became legal.\u201cIn 1996, national party committees could raise both federal money and nonfederal money,\u201d said Benjamin L. Ginsberg, a former chief counsel at the Republican National Committee and a longtime Republican election lawyer. He added, \u201cThe 1996 R.N.C. raised significant money on its own it could spend as it saw fit.\u201dSome Republicans believe that with the fall campaign weeks away, the party should focus its money and efforts down ballot to protect Republicans\u2019 congressional base. That would mean quietly ignoring Mr. Trump\u2019s call this month for a 50-state field operation and instead emphasizing congressional districts and swing states that are also Senate and House battlegrounds.\u201cThey can\u2019t do anything publicly \u2014 you can\u2019t rebuke your nominee,\u201d said Liam P. Donovan, a former aide to the National Republican Senatorial Committee. \u201cBut you could allocate resources to places where it helps up and down the ballot.\u201dThe difficulty, though, is that as November approaches, the Republican National Committee is more reliant on Mr. Trump for cash than on other recent nominees. Millions of dollars are coming in through a small-donor-focused committee operated jointly with the committee, which is splitting a share of the proceeds with Mr. Trump. Over half the money raised by the Trump campaign and the committee combined in July came from donors giving less than $200, far more than for any recent Republican nominee. (That figure does not include additional small donations raised by a joint fund-raising committee that Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign treasurer controls, which is not required to file disclosures until October.)The campaign\u2019s large-dollar fund-raising, also run jointly with the Republican National Committee, yielded $16 million in cash in July, but much of it is reserved under law for party accounts dedicated to the Republican National Convention, legal expenses and expenditures on offices. Despite being able to collect far more from each of the biggest Republican donors under new campaign finance rules passed in 2014, the committee is well off pace from its July fund-raising in 2012, when Mitt Romney was the party\u2019s nominee.While Mr. Trump has expanded his field operation in August \u2014 he announced the opening of 15 regional offices in Ohio, among other moves \u2014 his ability to find and turn out low-propensity Republican voters, a crucial group given his campaign strategy, will most likely turn on the Republican National Committee\u2019s operation, set up three years ago to provide a basic grass-roots foundation for the party\u2019s eventual nominee.Mr. Trump also relied on the committee to front $3 million in cash to ramp up his direct mail, money the party recouped in July, according to Federal Election Commission reports.The party is in turn providing much of the fund-raising expertise and technological backbone, including up-to-date donor lists and systems that will send roughly a billion emails by Election Day.A third of the party\u2019s digital team is now embedded at the San Antonio firm that formerly built websites for Mr. Trump\u2019s properties and is now leading his campaign\u2019s online efforts. Payments to that firm, Giles-Parscale, amounted to $8 million in July, most of which was paid out for online advertising to reach grass-roots supporters and donors, according to party officials.\u201cThe R.N.C. has built the most efficient and effective ground game in the party\u2019s history,\u201d said Lindsay Walters, a party spokeswoman. \u201cNo other campaign, committee or organization has been doing this for as long as we have. We are the infrastructure for the entire G.O.P. ticket. And the Trump campaign has embraced that.\u201dMaggie Haberman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "When Every Company Is a Tech Company, Does the Label Matter?", "Date": "2016-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesApple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon have created something of a watershed moment in the stock market.They became the four most valuable companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index at the close of trading on Aug. 1, according to S.&P.\u2019s official tally. That meant that tech companies, by one common definition, occupied the four top spots in the market capitalization rankings, a rare and brief occurrence.\u201cIt may never have happened before at the close of trading,\u201d said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. The full history of daily rankings isn\u2019t readily available, however, so we can\u2019t be certain, and such rankings are evanescent, shifting with every tick of the stock market. In fact, on Friday, Amazon dropped back into sixth place.But no matter: The early August rankings were a reminder of how far tech has come. It is a dominant force in the stock market and the economy, one so all-encompassing that tech may no longer even be a useful concept for understanding today\u2019s stock market.One of them is Exxon Mobil, the energy giant and the most valuable company in the S.&P. as recently as 2012. But Exxon Mobil has been cut down in size by the oil price debacle. The other is Berkshire Hathaway, Warren E. Buffett\u2019s conglomerate, which the S.&P. categorizes as a financial services company \u2014 the only such company left in the Top 10 market cap list. Berkshire announced its own earnings after trading closed on Friday. We\u2019ll soon learn whether the market is pleased enough to vault Berkshire further ahead of Amazon.The three tech companies at the very top in market cap \u2014 Apple, Google and Microsoft \u2014 have held high positions for a long while. (Google, ranked second, trades as Alphabet, the name of its parent company.) Google passed Apple in value briefly this year, but Apple regained the top perch, which it has held since 2012. Microsoft, now No. 3, was the most valuable company during the last tech boom, in the early 2000s.Virtually no one disputes S.&P.\u2019s formal classification of Apple, Google and Microsoft as \u201cinformation technology\u201d companies. The same is true of Facebook, which held seventh place in the latest list of most valuable companies. But while Amazon is often described as a tech company \u2014 and undoubtedly uses and creates innovative technology \u2014 S.&P. has never classified it as one.In fact, Amazon is formally known as a \u201cconsumer discretionary company,\u201d like Walmart, which it has displaced as a member of the Top 10 most valuable companies. Amazon is the only consumer discretionary company left in the Top 10. Is it in some sense a tech company? Certainly, and we\u2019ll get back to that.But the same can be said, to one degree or another, about the three other members of the Top 10 \u2014 old companies that are still prospering in large part because of their mastery of advanced technologies. Johnson & Johnson, for example, which is ranked eighth, is a health care company, yet it is heavily involved in technology of a biological kind. Then there is General Electric, the diversified industrial company (and, until recently, also a financial services company), once described as a bellwether for the entire market. It conducts advanced research and sells tech products.Last on the list is AT&T, a telecommunications company, which, in an early form, helped create computer languages and operating systems on which modern tech companies are built. In 1957, when the S.&P. 500 was born, an ancestral version of AT&T was the most valuable company in the United States by a very wide margin, said Jeremy J. Siegel, a Wharton business school professor, the author of \u201cStocks for the Long Run\u201d and a market historian.\u201cAT&T back then was a highly regulated old phone company,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a giant, later broken up into smaller companies. And it was an outlier, because the other big companies in the S.&P. 500 in that era were mainly materials companies \u2014 like United States Steel, DuPont and Union Carbide \u2014 and an awful lot of oil companies.\u201dIn 1957, the economy ran on oil, and the biggest energy company was Standard Oil of New Jersey \u2014 an ancestor of Exxon Mobil. No pure tech company ranked in the Top 10 back then, not even IBM, which soon became the dominant tech company, a position it held until Microsoft surpassed it in the mid-1990s. That was the decade of the great tech boom, culminating in the bubble that burst in March 2000. Microsoft was No. 1 in market cap at the end of 1999, and four other tech companies \u2014 Cisco Systems, Intel, IBM and America Online \u2014 were also among the Top 10 most valuable companies. The stock market celebrated tech\u2019s ascendance then, as it does now.But this is a different era. When you dig deeper into the S.&P. 500, it\u2019s clear that while the valuations of tech companies swelled to unrealistically high proportions in those bubble years, the valuations of most companies are far more modest now. In March 2000, the height of the bubble, the value of information technology companies swelled to 34.5 percent of the total market cap of the S.&P. 500. At the moment, the comparable figure is only 20.7 percent, data from the Bespoke Investment Group shows. That\u2019s not much more than the 15.7 percent share of financial companies or the 15.2 percent share of the health care sector. By contrast, finance ballooned as high as 22.3 percent at the end of 2006, in what can be seen in hindsight as a financial bubble.On the other hand, materials and energy companies, which together constituted almost half of the total value of the S.&P. 500 in 1957, now account for less than 10 percent of it. That reflects the collapse of energy and commodity prices over the last few years, and it may well be a temporary phenomenon. In the meantime, diversified energy companies like Exxon Mobil are investing heavily in technology, a necessity if they are to flourish.It\u2019s clear even to energy companies, in other words, that tech\u2019s abiding power in the marketplace is not temporary. Technology permeates every sector of the economy, even those not formally classified as high-tech. Whether companies like Amazon and Johnson & Johnson should carry tech labels is beside the point. Tech has already taken over.These days every company is a tech company, but some have better niches, faster growth, more attractive offerings or more favorable share prices than others. These kinds of fundamental distinctions will influence the Top 10 rankings of the future.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

More than $700 million in new retail, office and residential space is under construction or about to start in the district, according to the River City Company, an economic development nonprofit organization.Tiffanie Robinson, 31, the president of Lamp Post Properties, said the market for the co-living project is young entrepreneurs who can spend time in Chattanooga to see if it suits them.\u201cThere is a really big need for smart real estate investment within the innovation district,\u201d Ms. Robinson said. \u201cThe point is to create density for start-ups and technology companies in our community. We want to show how real estate can mold a city and mold next-generation companies.\u201dA few blocks away, Lamp Post is renovating the Mayfield Annex, a 28,000-square-foot, 109-year-old building that was once an Elks lodge and offices for Hamilton County. It is being turned into a $3.2 million office building for new-media companies and is scheduled to open next spring.Another of Lamp Post\u2019s downtown projects is converting the 45,000-square-foot Newton Chevrolet dealership, which operated for 68 years before closing in 2007. It will become a distillery for Tennessee Stillhouse, the maker of Chattanooga Whiskey. The $6 million project is scheduled to open in March.Almost a dozen other residential, retail and office projects are under construction, many of them designed for the high-tech business market or to coax young tech entrepreneurs to live and work downtown.AMCA, a Virginia developer, is spending $31 million to renovate the 10-story Chattanooga Bank and Trust building on Broad Street. The 89-year-old building will be turned into a 162-room Aloft Hotel with two ground-floor restaurants.On the other side of Broad Street, Heritage Land and Development, a Memphis company, is renovating the 92-year-old Maclellan Building. The 100,000-square-foot space once housed an insurer and has been empty for 11 years. It will be converted into 90 apartment units for $13.5 million.Many of Chattanooga\u2019s city leaders and business development executives anticipated the growing popularity of the downtown area. In the late 1960s, the newly formed Environmental Protection Agency declared Chattanooga the most polluted city in the nation. Three decades of investment cleared pollutants from the Tennessee River and the air, replaced old riverfront plants with parks and trails, strengthened the 11,000-student University of Tennessee at Chattanooga campus and constructed attractions, like a freshwater aquarium that opened in 1992.Chattanooga started to market itself to young entrepreneurs and attracted some well-known brands. For instance, the online reservation service OpenTable bought Quickcue, a local workflow app developer, for $11.5 million in 2013. OpenTable, based in San Francisco, also opened a Chattanooga office in a newly renovated innovation district building at Cherry and Seventh Streets.\u201cI can\u2019t think of another place that has made this kind of infrastructure investment to promote job growth and real estate development,\u201d said R. Byron Carlock Jr., the national real estate practice leader for PricewaterhouseCoopers. \u201cTypically, it\u2019s creating venture capital or grant funds.\u201d\u201cBoth the broadband and the smart grid infrastructure were built out ahead of schedule,\u201d Mr. Lobo said in an email. \u201cThe fiber investment in Hamilton County appears to deliver benefits at a faster pace than previously predicted.\u201dJust as rail links galvanized 19th-century communities and interstate highways spurred 20th-century development, Chattanooga\u2019s fast broadband network changed the city\u2019s view of itself and encouraged new development.Fletcher Bright, who has developed property in Chattanooga since 1953, said the city was experiencing a stronger surge in downtown construction than at any other time in his career.\u201cAll of a sudden, people want to be downtown,\u201d said Mr. Bright, the chairman of the Fletcher Bright Company. \u201cThat was unheard-of just a few years ago.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Accounting Error May Not Derail Deal, but Ex-Director Bails Early Anyway", "Date": "2016-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameWhen a company delays the release of its financial results because of an accounting error, spooked investors typically flee, and shares plummet.Not so for Diamond Resorts International, a timeshare operator based in Las Vegas. Its stock has fallen just 2.2 percent since it postponed its second-quarter earnings release on Aug. 1.It is unclear why Diamond\u2019s auditor, BDO USA, just spotted a problem that began some time ago. BDO did not respond to an email seeking comment.Seth Lubove, a Diamond spokesman, said the earnings delay was \u201can unexpected and unfortunate occurrence.\u201d But fixing the problem will be \u201cnoncash in nature,\u201d he said, and would have little impact on the company\u2019s financial performance. Changing the figures will have no effect on Diamond\u2019s compliance with the terms of its credit agreements, the company said.The main reason Diamond\u2019s stock has remained steady in the face of a possible restatement is its pending $2.2 billion acquisition by Apollo Global Management, the private equity giant. That buyout, announced in late June, is still on, Diamond said, regardless of the accounting problem.After discussing the matter with Diamond, Apollo said in a statement that it was \u201cconfident this will not impact the timing of our acquisition on the terms previously announced.\u201dBut it is notable that one longtime insider at the company decided not to wait for the deal to go through to cash in a bounty of his Diamond shares. Lowell D. Kraff is a principal at Trivergance L.L.C., a private equity firm he co-founded with David F. Palmer, Diamond\u2019s chief executive. Mr. Kraff, a former vice chairman of Diamond\u2019s board and a director since 2007, resigned his position in May at the company\u2019s annual meeting.On July 14, Mr. Kraff began selling his Diamond shares in the open market, regulatory filings show. He made his last sale on July 28, just days before the accounting disclosure. Over the period, he exercised call options on the company\u2019s stock and sold 1.26 million Diamond shares. That represented 28 percent of his holdings and generated $38.2 million. Had he tendered his shares at the offer price, he would have received approximately $75,000 more.I asked Mr. Kraff about the timing of his sales. In a statement provided by his lawyer, Mr. Kraff noted that his board service at Diamond ended in May. \u201cI had no knowledge of the possible restatement prior to the company\u2019s public announcement in early August,\u201d he said.As for why he chose to sell in the open market rather than tender his shares to Apollo at a slightly higher price only a few weeks later, Mr. Kraff cited \u201cpersonal financial reasons, including to repay borrowings associated with the exercise of the call options earlier in July.\u201dThe company said it was not aware of Mr. Kraff\u2019s sales until they were disclosed publicly.The terms of the Diamond deal are $30.25 per share with tender offer documentation due Aug. 10. The transaction will go through if more than 50 percent of Diamond\u2019s shareholders submit their shares.Support from shareholders seems likely. The transaction price represented a 25 percent premium over Diamond\u2019s shares the day before the bid was made and almost double the stock\u2019s $16.19 closing low in early February.Diamond defends its practices. Such complaints are anomalies, the company said, and are not representative of its relationships with 525,000 member families.Mr. Lubove, the Diamond spokesman, said the company tracks and monitors every comment and complaint received, whether from customer surveys or other direct contacts, from Better Business Bureaus or regulatory bodies. It also tracks the resolution of all complaints.\u201cOver the past several years, the complaints we receive regarding sales practices generally represent fewer than 2 percent of the total sales tours which we conduct,\u201d Mr. Lubove said in a statement. \u201cOther non-sales-related complaints represent an even smaller percentage of our total member and guest visits.\u201dThe accounting hiccup may well be a nonevent. It did, however, cause Diamond to delay a $1.8 billion debt sale intended to help finance the acquisition. Debt investors require accurate financial statements from the issuing company, after all. Without that cash, the deal could well founder.Those statements are coming soon, Mr. Lubove told me late on Wednesday. Diamond expects to meet the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s deadline of Aug. 9 for filing its delayed second-quarter financial results, he said. And to the extent required, the company expects to file any amended reports from earlier periods within the same time frame.During a deal\u2019s marketing period, the presentation said, certain requirements must be met. Among them: The target company\u2019s auditors \u201cshall not have withdrawn any audit opinion covering financial statements,\u201d and the target company \u201chas not announced a restatement.\u201dGiven that the Apollo-Diamond merger agreement contains similar language, I asked Apollo about the impact a restatement from Diamond could have on the acquisition process. Charles Zehren, a spokesman, reiterated Apollo\u2019s previous statement that it was confident the matter would not affect the timing of the deal.It remains to be seen whether debt buyers flock to the deal and what yield they demand.Clearly, Diamond\u2019s shareholders want the Apollo takeover to go through. So do Diamond\u2019s top executives and directors, who are among the bigger beneficiaries of the buyout, regulatory filings show.As of July 13, Diamond\u2019s top executives and directors beneficially owned almost 23 million shares in the form of options and company stock. If the transaction is completed, a filing stated, those 15 people \u201cwould be entitled to receive an aggregate amount of $624,131,129 in cash.\u201dThe bulk of that will go to Stephen J. Cloobeck, Diamond\u2019s founder, and Mr. Palmer, the chief executive. Mr. Cloobeck would be entitled to $384 million and Mr. Palmer would receive $173 million.If everything remains on track, that will be a nice payday.Twitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}

The figure could rise again, given that some people remain unaccounted for.\u201cFor this phase, it\u2019s important that we continue to dig through the rubble and also offer assistance to the population, providing beds, and food, and letting them know that they\u2019re not alone,\u201d Nicola Zingaretti, the president of the Lazio Region, said as he walked briskly through the Amatrice neighborhood where various emergency coordination operations had been set up. \u201cIn tragedy there is complete solidarity.\u201dThe number of missing in Amatrice remained unclear on Thursday, as local residents wondered aloud about tourists and seasonal workers, mostly from Romania, who arrive during the busy summer months. Romanian officials confirmed that five of their citizens had died in the quake, that four had been injured and that 11 others were missing. Two Spaniards also died, Italian officials said.Speaking from Rome, Immacolata Postiglione, who runs the emergency unit at the Civil Protection Department, said that 215 people had been rescued from the wreckage of the earthquake. At least 264 people had been hospitalized, the Health Ministry said.In Saletta, another town damaged by the quake, Adriana Ciocchetti, a homemaker and a grandmother from Pagliano, near Frosinone, said she had not known what to expect when she arrived as a volunteer for the Italian Red Cross. \u201cIn cases like this, you just go,\u201d Ms. Ciocchetti said.But the work was heartbreaking, she said. One woman she comforted on Wednesday had lost her family. \u201cI was looking at a crushed house and said out loud, \u2018I hope no one lived there,\u2019 and a woman turned and said, \u2018That\u2019s where my daughter and grandchildren lived,\u2019\u201d Ms. Ciocchetti said.\u201cPeople are so disoriented that many don\u2019t even really realize what\u2019s happened.\u201dThe Italian Red Cross was one of the first organizations to arrive in Amatrice. \u201cWithin two hours of the quake we were ready to move,\u201d said Ignazio Schintu, the organization\u2019s emergency manager. By Wednesday evening, the Red Cross \u2014 with about 400 workers and volunteers \u2014 had set up medical services, emergency kitchens, washroom facilities and tents.On Thursday, they were setting up a base camp on an athletic field in Amatrice for the workers assisting those left homeless and now living in tents. \u201cOur psychologists are here to assist them,\u201d Mr. Schintu said. \u201cMany earthquake victims don\u2019t want to sleep under any sort of covering, even a tent.\u201d15 Photos\u201cPeople have to get over this first moment,\u201d though the two strong aftershocks felt on Thursday \u201ccertainly don\u2019t make it easier,\u201d he said.Though temporary in nature, for some, they could become home for months.Some Amatrice residents found themselves pressed into service as emergency workers, like the Rev. Savino D\u2019Amelio, a parish priest, who helped guide to safety 27 people from his retirement home shortly after the quake hit. \u201cThere were three of us, moving wheelchairs,\u201d Father D\u2019Amelio said, still shaken. \u201cWe got them all out without a scratch.\u201dTowns in a mountainous stretch of central Italy were severely damaged by an earthquake that killed hundreds of people and trapped scores under debris.\u201cNow we\u2019re trying to help people, ease the desperation of those who lost children and teenagers,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope our strength holds out.\u201dAcross Amatrice, volunteers collected clothing, blankets, toiletries and food donated by people and institutions throughout Italy. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen incredible solidarity, closeness, love, help from all of Italy,\u201d with even the country\u2019s struggling municipalities offering funds, said Giancarlo Carloni, the town\u2019s deputy mayor. \u201cIt makes me proud to be an Italian.\u201dOutside the temporary morgue in Amatrice, a small crowd of residents waited for names of the dead to be called.Some sobbed, while others clutched at one another for support.\u201cThe identification has to be done right away \u2014 it\u2019s hot,\u201d Mr. Carloni said.Fabrizio Curcio, the chief of Italy\u2019s Civil Protection Department, praised the \u201cgreat generosity\u201d and \u201cpositive enthusiasm\u201d on the part of the rescue workers and volunteers who had raced to the earthquake zone. But, he said, some volunteers will be asked to go home.\u201cWe are many, and only those who are necessary must remain,\u201d he said.Those residents who could leave Amatrice, now a ghost town, did so, finding refuge with relatives or at second homes on the seaside, said Mr. Carloni, the deputy mayor, who spent the night with his wife in their car. His house was standing, he said, but she was afraid to stay in it.Bishop Domenico Pompili of the nearby town of Rieti and the Rev. Fabrizio Borrello, a priest from the town, came to Amatrice on Thursday to offer spiritual comfort to the survivors and bless the bodies in the morgue.\u201cThere were a lot of them,\u201d Father Borrello said. \u201cBut there are still many people missing,\u201d including many families, so \u201cthere is no one to come and identify them.\u201dEfforts to find survivors in the rubble continued throughout the day, \u201cbut the probabilities are about down to zero,\u201d said one officer with Italy\u2019s Finance Police who declined to give his name because he was not authorized to speak to the news media.Mauro Bellavita, a volunteer who came to Amatrice with four other volunteers from the town of Acquapendente, said he was not ready to give up. \u201cHope is the last thing to die,\u201d he said.Reporting was contributed by Elaine Allaby from Rome; Dan Bilefsky from London; Gaia Pianigiani from Siena, Italy; and Kit Gillet from Bucharest, Romania.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Middle-Income Jobs Finally Show Signs of a Rebound", "Date": "2016-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe American economy is finally creating more middle-income jobs, according to a new analysis released Thursday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in a turnabout from the feast-and-famine pattern earlier in the recovery, when hiring was strongest at the bottom and top of the wage scale.The findings suggest that it may soon be time to retire a familiar criticism of the long but lackluster economic rebound that has been underway since the end of the Great Recession in 2009: the hollowing out of the American middle class.Between 2013 and 2015, employers added nearly 2.3 million workers earning from $30,000 to $60,000 a year, primarily in fields like education, construction, transportation and social services. That was roughly 50 percent more than in either the high-wage or low-wage categories during the same period.By contrast, the Fed researchers found, of the nearly 7.6 million jobs created from 2010 to 2013, only about a fifth fell into the middle-tier category, with the largest number instead coming from lower-paid sectors like food preparation and health care support.\u201cThe tide has begun to turn,\u201d said William C. Dudley, president of the New York Fed. \u201cFor the first time in quite a while, we are seeing gains in middle-wage jobs actually outnumber gains in higher- and lower-wage jobs nationwide.\u201dAlthough the economy has created nearly 15 million jobs since employment bottomed out in early 2010, the gains in the recovery have been noticeably uneven. While many cities along the East and West Coasts have been prolific job creators, parts of the Midwest and South have not experienced similar improvements.At the same time, most American workers have made only paltry wage gains until recently, despite steady hiring that has helped bring the national unemployment rate down to 4.9 percent last month from a high of 10 percent in late 2009.\u201cIt\u2019s important, but we are coming off of a really low threshold,\u201d said Diane Swonk, a veteran independent economist based in Chicago, referring to the new Fed study. \u201cWe\u2019ve shifted gears, but we\u2019re only now beginning to regain the quality in terms of jobs.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve got a long way to go,\u201d Ms. Swonk added, noting that after inflation, family incomes were still below where they were in 2000. \u201cIt\u2019s more than a lost decade.\u201dThe nascent national improvement identified by the Fed researchers in New York also held true in the metropolitan region in recent years, with New York City and surrounding suburbs adding 179,000 middle-wage jobs from 2013 to 2015, compared with just 18,000 from 2010 to 2013.The shift coincided with the passing of the baton from finance to technology as the major driver in local job creation.More than any area in the United States, with the possible exception of San Francisco, New York City has come to symbolize an economy built on vast gains for a lucky few, with most everyone else largely standing still.But as the motor of New York\u2019s economy, Wall Street is yielding to Silicon Alley and Brooklyn, as technology companies like Google and smaller start-ups bulk up while banks and hedge funds slim down.Since 2010, tech employment in New York City has jumped by 53,000, while securities industry jobs have increased by just 12,000.In fact, with 172,400 workers in 2015, employment in the New York securities industry remains well short of where it peaked before the financial crisis. There were more than 125,000 tech workers in New York City last year, nearly double the total a decade ago.\u201cIn the past, the city has counted on job growth from Wall Street to fuel economic growth during recoveries and expansions,\u201d Mr. Dudley said. \u201cThis time around, however, job gains in the securities industry have been quite meager.\u201dHiring in fields like internet publishing, online shopping and scientific research and development, Mr. Dudley added, \u201cis picking up much of the slack created by the softness of the securities industry.\u201dThe local tech boom has also spread the largess well beyond the canyons of Wall Street. Private sector job growth in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx was stronger last year than it was in Manhattan.While technology companies are still mostly based in Manhattan, Brooklyn has benefited from what economists call a multiplier effect, as young tech workers move to the borough in search of more affordable housing and patronize restaurants, clubs and other services there.The South Bronx, once synonymous with urban decay, is also on an upswing, especially around the markets in the Hunts Point area, said Jason Bram, a researcher with the New York Fed. Queens has benefited from its proximity to local airports.Suburban counties like Rockland, Westchester and Nassau are also prospering again, and closer-in counties in New Jersey, like Bergen, Essex, Middlesex and Monmouth, are finally showing signs of life.Still, large parts of upstate New York, including Binghamton, Elmira and Syracuse, are struggling economically. Ithaca and Albany have been exceptions upstate, paced by gains in education and emerging fields like nanotechnology.There\u2019s plenty of need for further improvement, Mr. Dudley said, but he suggested that the increase in middle-class jobs since 2013 may mark a turning point in the recovery.\u201cThis is an important development in the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it were to continue, it would create more opportunities for workers and their families who have been struggling up to now.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump, the Bad, Bad Businessman", "Date": "2016-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionThe greatest scoop of my journalism career started at a poker table with a tip from an agitated banker.It was a Thursday night in late May 1990. I was a 32-year-old Wall Street Journal reporter who had written dozens of articles about Donald J. Trump\u2019s business affairs. I was closing in on the biggest one of all \u2014 Mr. Trump was on the brink of financial ruin. He was quietly trying to unload his assets. His Atlantic City casinos were underperforming, and prices for his casino bonds were plummeting, suggesting that he would have trouble making interest payments.\u201cDonald Trump is driving 100 miles per hour toward a brick wall, and he has no brakes,\u201d the banker told me. \u201cHe is meeting with all the banks right now.\u201dThe next day, I called sources at the four banks I knew had large Trump exposures. The first three calls yielded \u201cno comment,\u201d but the fourth hit pay dirt, and I was invited to visit the bank late that afternoon.Behind a large mahogany desk sat the bank\u2019s chief lending officer. He explained that all of the banks would have to agree to a huge restructuring of Mr. Trump\u2019s loans or Mr. Trump would have to declare personal bankruptcy. Unknown to the banks when each had lent him money, Mr. Trump ended up personally guaranteeing a staggering $830 million of loans, which was reckless of him, but even more so for the banks.In a front-page Wall Street Journal article on June 4, 1990, I wrote: \u201cDonald J. Trump\u2019s cash shortage has become critical. The developer is now in intense negotiations with his main bank creditors that could force him to give up big chunks of his empire.\u201d One banker said, \u201cHe will have to trim the fat; get rid of the boat, the mansions, the helicopter.\u201dBetween 1985 and 1991, working mainly for The Daily News and The Wall Street Journal, I covered Mr. Trump\u2019s travails and interviewed him dozens of times. On several occasions he threatened to sue me, though he never did. But he didn\u2019t hide his opinion of me. In \u201cTrump: The Art of the Comeback,\u201d his 1997 book, he wrote: \u201cOf all the writers who have written about me, probably none has been more vicious than Neil Barsky of The Wall Street Journal.\u201dAt the time, he was a glamorous New York City personality and an Olympic-level self-promoter who had persuaded banks and bondholders to extend him billions of dollars of credit to buy everything from a yacht to the Plaza Hotel to the Eastern Air Lines Shuttle.He was also a skilled negotiator with an almost supernatural ability to pinpoint and attack his adversaries\u2019 vulnerabilities, as several of his Republican primary opponents discovered. Since his financial emergency in the 1990s, he appears to have sworn off taking on large amounts of debt, and instead has used his brand to collect fees on real estate and other projects. This has greatly limited his downside risk, but has also capped the amount he can earn, since he often does not own the underlying equity on the projects that bear his name.Since leaving journalism in 1993, I have been a Wall Street real estate analyst and a hedge fund manager. I have studied how businesses thrive and why they fail. Mr. Trump\u2019s political rise has been maddening for me to watch, and I sometimes feel like the character played by Kevin Bacon in the movie \u201cDiner\u201d who screams the right answers to a TV quiz show as the contestants get them wrong.\u201cThe issue isn\u2019t that he\u2019s crass,\u201d I want to shout. \u201cIt\u2019s that he\u2019s a bad businessman!\u201dHanging on my office wall is a letter written on gold-leaf stationery, dated March 22, 1990. \u201cDear Neil,\u201d it reads. \u201cFrom your first incorrect story on Merv Griffin \u2014 to your present Wall Street Journal article, you are a disgrace to your profession! Sincerely, Donald J. Trump.\u201d (Mr. Griffin was a Trump rival.)The article I had just written took a skeptical look at the ability of Mr. Trump\u2019s newly opened Trump Taj Mahal Atlantic City casino to make the interest payments on its bonds. I quoted an analyst saying, \u201cOnce the cold winds blow from October to February, it won\u2019t make it.\u201d Mr. Trump complained to the man\u2019s employer. Within days, the analyst was fired. But his prediction would prove prescient.At 70, Mr. Trump is 12 years older than I am. As I watched his career soar in the 1980s and the inordinate amount of press attention he attracted, I was struck by two things: His list of real estate accomplishments were minuscule compared with those of more successful New York developers who garnered far less publicity, and he lied a lot. He made up the prices he was getting for his condominiums, the value of bids he had turned down for various properties and his prospects for luring corporate tenants to his buildings.And, of course, he lied about his wealth.Then and now, we in the media helped enable the Trump myth. He made great copy. Early on, I noticed that any article I wrote about him \u2014 whether for the tabloid Daily News or the serious Wall Street Journal \u2014 would get great play. This invariably led me and others to dig deeper for Trump news.Once, in April 1990, as I was trying to glean the extent of his financial distress, he produced as evidence of his financial strength a letter from an accounting firm saying he had close to $400 million in cash and cash equivalents. The letter did not include liabilities, however, and less than two months later, Mr. Trump was negotiating a lifeline with his bankers.Ultimately, the banks decided Mr. Trump was \u201ctoo big to fail,\u201d and extended further credit. When the dust settled, he retained some important assets, like Trump Tower, and gave up control of others, including the Eastern Air Lines Shuttle. Under bankers\u2019 orders, he altered his high-spending lifestyle.This disconnect between the public\u2019s perception of Mr. Trump as a self-made mogul and the reality of his being a rich kid who lost other people\u2019s money and made far less for himself than he claims is still his Achilles\u2019 heel.Things did not end well between us. One day in early 1991, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s senior executives, Nick Ribis, invited me to a boxing match that his boss was sponsoring in Atlantic City. I declined at first, but my editor encouraged me to go. Then, in an act of bad judgment, I accepted free tickets for my brother and father.Weeks later, after I wrote a tough article about Mr. Trump\u2019s finances, his public relations representative called The New York Post\u2019s Page Six and said, as I was told later by a senior Post reporter, \u201cHow would you like to destroy the career of a Wall Street Journal reporter?\u201d The story that resulted made a series of wild and bogus accusations, saying I had extorted the tickets, asked for a suite at the Taj, and that out of anger that I hadn\u2019t received more favors, had written negative articles about him.My editors stood by me, but they and I agreed that I would stop covering him. By then Donald Trump had stopped being front-page news, but I had put my paper in a difficult position, and the episode stung.Did he set me up? Did I set myself up? Several years later, I ran into a Trump executive who offered an explanation. A few months before the boxing match, I had reported that as Mr. Trump faced a cash shortfall, his father had bought $3.5 million worth of casino chips to help his son make an interest payment on the casino\u2019s bonds. Mr. Trump was subsequently fined $30,000 by New Jersey\u2019s gambling regulators for not reporting what was essentially a loan from his father. He was livid, the executive told me, and had vowed revenge. As Mr. Trump himself wrote in \u201cThe Art of the Comeback,\u201d he told Nick Ribis to give me the tickets, then added, \u201cbut the next time he writes anything I\u2019m going to blast him like he never got blasted before.\u201dI last met with Donald Trump in 2007, by which point I had been managing a hedge fund for a decade. He was a reality television star, and his financial troubles were behind him. I was sponsoring a golf tournament at his club in Westchester County to raise money for a foundation that supported a Miami youth center.Concerned that we might bump into each other, I called to see if he might want to meet first, and he invited me to his Fifth Avenue office. He couldn\u2019t have been nicer. He boasted about a recent golf club purchase and said he was \u201cbigger than ever.\u201d He complimented me on my decision to go into finance. I asked him for a major donation for the youth center, and soon the conversation turned to our past squabbles.\u201cYou hit me, then I hit you,\u201d he said, with the wistful air of a nostalgic boxer. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, we\u2019re even.\u201dA week later, someone at the foundation told me it had received a check for $5,000.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Duel of Suitors Yields an M.L.S. Franchise for Minnesota", "Date": "2016-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byST. PAUL \u2014 A David and Goliath story generally requires a David to root for, but neither side competing for the M.L.S. expansion franchise in Minnesota resembled a boy with a slingshot.Instead, this one featured two Goliaths: The rich, powerful Wilf family, owner of the Minnesota Vikings and their new $1 billion fixed-roof stadium, versus a formidable soccer-centric group that included some of the richest people in the state but lacked a stadium.William W. McGuire, the former chief executive of UnitedHealth Group and the owner of the Minnesota United of the North American Soccer League, heads the second group, and last year he outmaneuvered the Wilfs and landed the expansion franchise by promising to build an open-air soccer-specific stadium with private money \u2014 a rarity in American professional sports.McGuire\u2019s group committed $250 million \u2014 a $100 million M.L.S. expansion fee and $150 million for the new stadium \u2014 to bring top-level professional soccer to a state that has had five professional teams since the 1970s.At a rally on Aug. 19 at the downtown minor league baseball stadium, about 1,400 fans watched as M.L.S. Commissioner Don Garber confirmed that Minnesota United would begin play in 2017.\u201cI\u2019m glad somebody who\u2019s strictly going to focus on soccer is going to keep a team in the Twin Cities and push it as high as it can go,\u201d said Bruce McGuire, a Minnesota soccer blogger and scarf-wearing member of the United\u2019s primary fan group, the Dark Clouds. \u201cIt\u2019s thrilling,\u201d said McGuire, who is not related to the team\u2019s owner.The bid by the Vikings owners, Bruce McGuire said, \u201cscared the hell out of me.\u201d\u201cThe sport I love would be a second priority,\u201d McGuire said. \u201cThe N.F.L. is a gold mine, and everything else has to be second.\u201dWilliam McGuire, too, feared that the Vikings group would land the franchise.\u201cThere was always a chance the league would look at that situation and say, \u2018This is what we want to do,\u2019\u201d said William McGuire, who is widely known as Bill. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think it was the right thing to do. Obviously, we had our own bias. Our view was, the best thing for soccer is to have soccer-specific stadiums, if it could be pulled off, rather than putting the sport into a stadium that\u2019s fundamentally built for something else.\u201dIn the end, M.L.S. officials preferred McGuire\u2019s vision of an intimate 20,000-seat outdoor field on natural grass over the soaring 66,000-seat U.S. Bank Stadium, the new home of the Vikings. Construction of the soccer stadium, midway between Minneapolis and St. Paul, should begin this fall, McGuire said. The club will play on artificial turf at the University of Minnesota\u2019s TCF Bank Stadium next season and most of 2018.Curiously, the Vikings\u2019 stadium opened Aug. 3 with an International Champions Cup match between A.C. Milan and Chelsea that drew 64,101, the largest crowd to watch professional soccer in the state.The same night, United played in the northern suburb of Blaine, timing that irritated United supporters and hurt the club\u2019s ticket sales. The N.A.S.L. match attracted 6,101, about 2,000 below United\u2019s league-best average.Bill McGuire read nothing sinister or vindictive into the overlap, preferring to celebrate how 70,000 people turned out on a Wednesday night to watch professional soccer in Minnesota. (ESPN, International Champions Cup officials and the competing clubs chose the date, not the Vikings.)\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate it was the day we had a home game,\u201d McGuire said. \u201cI don\u2019t even know if they knew we had a game. I assume they didn\u2019t until after the fact, and then it\u2019s what it was.\u201dHe added: \u201cI think everybody\u2019s fine. We\u2019re all going to work together to do things to make this a better place.\u201dUnlike many of United\u2019s fans, McGuire came late to soccer. Born in Troy, N.Y., the 6-foot-6 McGuire played basketball at Clear Creek High School in Texas, near Galveston. He paid much more attention to butterflies and fishing than soccer, at least until 2011, when the N.A.S.L. assumed control of its failing Minnesota franchise known as the Stars.The N.A.S.L. commissioner at the time, David Downs, contacted an old roommate of his daughter\u2019s at Amherst College, Marissa McGuire (Bill\u2019s daughter), to ask about potential owners. Bill McGuire was not interested. He reconsidered in 2012 after attending two games and meeting fans who traced their soccer allegiance to the Minnesota Kicks, a popular 1970s N.A.S.L. franchise that shared the old Metropolitan Stadium in Bloomington with the Minnesota Twins and the Vikings.\u201cWe looked at it, watched a few games, said we\u2019ll step in and do this \u2014 far, far underestimating what the \u2018it\u2019 was,\u201d said McGuire, who viewed it as a philanthropic endeavor.McGuire said that it made sense to keep the team going and to see what would happen. It was not analyzed extensively on a financial basis, he said.\u201cIt was something we should not let disappear from the community after 35, 36 years,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would be inconsistent with the demographics of our society and certainly this community.\u201dMcGuire saw room for significant growth of Minnesota soccer among millennials and the soccer-loving Hmong and Somali immigrant communities. He renamed the club Minnesota United F.C. in 2013, with a local branding firm incorporating Minnesota\u2019s state bird, the loon, into its logo.Downs also had no quarrel with McGuire\u2019s past. A pulmonologist, McGuire resigned as UnitedHealth\u2019s chief executive in 2006 while the Securities and Exchange Commission investigated him because he was suspected of backdating stock options.Without admitting guilt, McGuire paid a $7 million penalty to the S.E.C., agreed to forfeit $620 million in stock option gains and retirement pay and was barred for 10 years from serving as a director or officer of a public company. The ban ends in 2017.In 2014, led by midfielder Miguel Ibarra, who played well enough to earn a rare N.A.S.L. call-up to the United States national team, Minnesota United finished with the league\u2019s best record. Season ticket sales jumped to 5,200 this season from 242 in 2013. Last year, the club added bleachers to its National Sports Center stadium in Blaine, for a capacity of about 9,000.McGuire said that he had had no plans to take United out of the N.A.S.L. until M.L.S. began sniffing around the Minnesota market.\u201cWhen we realized M.L.S. wanted to be here, we thought, We\u2019re the ones that should be involved with it, because we\u2019re all about soccer at that point,\u201d he said.And McGuire realized he could not wait for the slow-moving State Legislature to approve stadium financing, which was unlikely. So McGuire and seven partners agreed to finance the stadium themselves, and are going ahead with construction while awaiting the Legislature\u2019s approval of minor tax breaks.The group includes the Minnesota Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor; the Pohlad family, which owns the Minnesota Twins; and Marilyn Carlson Nelson, a former executive at Carlson, a large hospitality firm. After a dalliance with a property in Minneapolis, the team struck a deal to build it in St. Paul. Before joining M.L.S., it must upgrade its roster, which most likely will bear little resemblance to the current one.To Manny Lagos, a former M.L.S. player and a 1992 United States Olympian from St. Paul who gave up coaching the team this season to become United\u2019s technical director, that two groups were competing for an M.L.S. franchise shows how far the Minnesota market has come in soccer. He is just glad his Goliath won.\u201cI don\u2019t look at that scenario as a battle,\u201d Lagos said. \u201cIt\u2019s significant, because it tells me more people are going to start looking at Minnesota and the potential. As someone who grew up here, that\u2019s pretty amazing, because for a while we were trying to raise our hand and get recognized, and it was very hard.\u201dAn article on Monday 29 about the new Major League Soccer franchise in Minnesota, which was awarded to a group headed by the owner of the Minnesota United of the North American Soccer League, misstated, in some editions, the year in which Manny Lagos, United\u2019s technical director, participated in the Olympics. It was 1992, not 1972.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Extremist Pleads Guilty in Hague Court to Destroying Cultural Sites in Timbuktu", "Date": "2016-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Mahdi, a teacher who was born in or around 1975 near Timbuktu and who studied Islamic law in a Saudi-sponsored school in Libya, was also accused of leading a \u201cmorality brigade\u201d that meted out punishments like public floggings for minor infractions.\u201cIt is with deep regret and great pain that I had to enter a guilty plea on all the charges brought against me,\u201d Mr. Mahdi told the court on Monday. Begging for forgiveness, including from the people of Timbuktu, he said, \u201cI would like them to look at me like a son that has lost his way, and to accept my regrets.\u201dMr. Mahdi added that he was \u201cinfluenced by a group of deviant people from Al Qaeda and Ansar Dine,\u201d a Qaeda offshoot in Mali, and said that he hoped his punishment would \u201cserve as a purging of the evil spirits I got involved with.\u201dHe faces a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison, but prosecutors will request a sentence of nine to 11 years as part of a plea agreement.Mr. Mahdi is suspected of committing other crimes, but legal experts said the case was narrowly focused to highlight how cultural and religious buildings are deliberately singled out for destruction to obliterate an enemy\u2019s history and identity.\u201cThe ethnic cleansers in the Balkans, like the jihadis in Iraq, Syria and Timbuktu and other places, are keenly aware of the significance of this, which is why they devote so much personnel and resources to the destruction of religious and cultural landmarks,\u201d Mr. Riedlmayer said.If Mr. Mahdi had not pleaded guilty, his trial would probably have been a lengthy one, with witnesses brought to The Hague from Timbuktu and other West African desert cities. Instead, the court can now turn directly to sentencing, with a few days of hearings to help the judges assess the case.No international court currently has jurisdiction over crimes in those countries, or over the continuing cultural devastation reported in Yemen.The Mali case has its roots in 2012, when armed rebels and homegrown Islamic jihadists allied with Al Qaeda established a breakaway ministate in the northern half of the country. The jihadists imposed a harsh form of Islamic law on the population and recruited local people, including Mr. Mahdi, to help them enforce it.After a French-led military force recaptured Timbuktu the next year, some of the jihadists disappeared and others appeared to receive amnesty under a peace deal. Mr. Mahdi, who was later arrested in Niger when French troops intercepted an arms-smuggling convoy, was the only one to end up in court in The Hague.Most of the destroyed tombs in Timbuktu have been rebuilt using traditional masonry methods, financed by foreign donors. But tensions still run high in the city, and many residents who fled from the jihadists have yet to return \u2014 notably women. Human rights activists have said that women and girls were particular targets of the extremists\u2019 abuse in Timbuktu, including rape, forced marriage and sexual slavery, and that Mr. Mahdi\u2019s brigade was complicit in that abuse; they have requested that the court expand the charges against him accordingly.At the end of his prepared statement to the court on Monday, Mr. Mahdi said, \u201cI would like to give a piece of advice to all Muslims in the world not to get involved in the same acts I got involved with, because they will not lead to any good for humanity.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018A Spirit of Charity\u2019 Probes Struggle of Public Hospitals", "Date": "2016-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooksAll hospitals deliver an endless loop of drama. In America\u2019s great public hospitals, the show is nothing short of operatic.Most chroniclers confine themselves to the human interest stories, reasoning that the funding of these hospitals is unlikely to be as gripping. It turns out that\u2019s not necessarily the case, certainly not in this first strange decade of reformed health care, as the federal government drapes the nation in a health safety net full of holes.Where does that leave the venerable hospitals of last resort, the nets beneath the net?Still, his outrage on behalf of our continuously threatened public hospitals should be immensely gratifying to all of their fans.Back then, Grady was a bizarre amalgam of charity and racial hatred. Now the hospital is different in all respects, bolstered by its world-class academic programs and its ongoing social mission.But its financing still relies on a hodgepodge of funds grudgingly contributed and newly withheld by every echelon of government, as the states and the feds continue to toss the big burdens of health care back and forth like sputtering firecrackers.The Affordable Care Act specifically excludes noncitizens from its benefits, leaving public hospitals like Grady as the sole care providers for both foreign transients and illegal residents. At the same time, new increases in reimbursements for some services and in the number of insured people under the health care law have made the private sector take intense interest in caring for previously unattractive customers.In Mr. King\u2019s eyes, though, the biggest problem is that many states in the South, including Georgia, have chosen to forgo the expansion of Medicaid, the largely state-run health insurance for the poor, under the Affordable Care Act. Thus, working Atlanta residents who make too little for private insurance and too much for Medicaid under the old guidelines tumble right through the health care act\u2019s safety net and land at Grady, a hospital of last resort.Grady handles about 3,500 trauma cases a year in a hugely expensive Level 1 center equipped to handle all injuries. But for-profit health care is now getting into the trauma business, specifically seeking victims of so-called blunt trauma, often caused by falls or car accidents, as opposed to victims of penetrating trauma caused by knives and guns. Blunt trauma victims are often insured; penetrating trauma victims often not.About half the estimated 5,000 homeless people in Atlanta are thought to be mentally ill or addicted, Mr. King writes. Had Georgia agreed to Medicaid expansion, many would now be insured. Instead they receive outpatient care at charity clinics, and when they are admitted, Grady pays the bill.Similarly, about 60 percent of patients in Grady\u2019s AIDS clinic live below the poverty level; had the state expanded Medicaid, an estimated half of them would be insured. Instead, they and the hospital must rely on increasingly thin federal AIDS dollars.Well, it\u2019s just one more verse in our sad, old health care song. I had hoped Mr. King might step back a little and try to pinpoint exactly why it is that so many Americans (rich, poor, doctor, patient) are such fierce partisans of our public hospitals, given that other hospitals must struggle hard to inspire the same degree of brand loyalty.Mr. King does not venture a guess, so I will do it for him. All the addictive drama aside, I bet it\u2019s because within public hospital walls lie the few square miles in this country where health care is an unquestioned right, not a grudgingly granted privilege. It\u2019s a good feeling, to be in those spaces. We should create more of them.Advertisement"}

And then, after weeks of testing and fine-tuning, America\u2019s first offshore wind farm will begin pumping power into the New England electric grid.The idea of building turbines offshore, where strong, steady wind could, in theory, generate large amounts of power, has long been seen as a vital step toward a future based on renewable energy.

They had a lot of help from the political leadership of Rhode Island, which has seized the lead in this nascent industry, ahead of bigger states like New York and Massachusetts.Now, offshore wind may be on the verge of rapid growth in the United States.Equally important, state governments in recent months have been making big, new commitments to renewable power, driven by a rising sense of urgency about climate change.Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York set a goal of getting 50 percent of the state\u2019s power from renewable sources by 2030, and the state will probably need large offshore wind farms to help achieve that. In Massachusetts, a Republican governor, Charlie Baker, just signed a bipartisan bill ordering the state\u2019s utilities to develop contracts with offshore wind farms for an immense amount of power, 50 times the expected output of the Block Island Wind Farm.If that sounds ambitious, consider that the country has installed some 50,000 wind turbines on land over the past two decades. They now supply roughly 5 percent of the nation\u2019s electric power, a figure that reaches double digits in particularly windy states like Kansas and Iowa.The turbines are easier and cheaper to build on land. But the wind is also weaker on land, and the power the machines produce there is intermittent. The stronger breezes in the ocean can produce steadier power, potentially helping to balance out intermittent renewable sources like solar panels and onshore turbines.The technology has been proved in Europe, where offshore wind farms as large as 300 turbines are being developed, with each turbine costing up to $30 million to build, install and connect to the power grid.But the first major proposal in the United States, an immense project off Cape Cod that was to be called Cape Wind, was too big \u2014 130 turbines \u2014 and too close to shore, many experts now believe. It drew ferocious opposition from oceanfront homeowners, gradually lost political support in Massachusetts and appears unlikely to go forward.The companies now trying to start an offshore wind industry are determined not to repeat the mistakes that plagued Cape Wind. That is one reason Deepwater Wind decided to start with a small project.The focus is still on the Northeast. That region has dense cities with strong electrical demand, high power prices, opposition to new power plants on land and some of the world\u2019s stiffest ocean breezes off the coast. And the water remains relatively shallow many miles from shore, so wind farms could be installed far enough away that most of them would not be visible from the beaches.With Northeastern states committing to the idea, the big question is: How much would it cost to get thousands of offshore turbines up and running?When the first offshore projects were built two decades ago, European nations had to promise the developers extremely high prices for the electricity generated by their turbines, sometimes three or four times the wholesale power price, to get a new industry going.Since then, offshore wind turbines have become a big business in Europe, worth billions, and the companies installing them have been able to create economies of scale. Recently, European nations have scrapped their old subsidy methods and have used competitive bidding to drive down the cost of the projects.In some ways, the United States benefited by waiting for the industry to mature, as it can now take advantage of those falling costs. Installation is still pricier here than in Europe, and may be for a while, because few American companies have invested in the boats and other gear necessary to do the work.The Block Island turbines were built overseas by a division of General Electric and were installed by a ship from Norway, brought over at a cost of millions of dollars, with help from an American vessel.Yet if states go forward with their plans, experts say the costs are likely to fall sharply as domestic industry scales up to meet the demand. On the Block Island project, a company in Houma, La., won the contract to build the metal foundations in the water, and other Gulf Coast businesses that have long built offshore oil structures see wind power in the Northeast as a potential new market.For now, the construction of the first wind farm off an American coast sends a simple message to governments, investors and citizens: It can be done.\u201cSpectacular!\u201d Mr. Grybowski said from the deck of a boat last week as he watched the final stages of construction.The Block Island project was a marriage of Rhode Island political will and New York financial expertise. Initial financing for the $300 million project came from the D. E. Shaw Group, a big investment firm based in Manhattan.D. E. Shaw\u2019s head of United States private equity investment, Bryan Martin, had invested huge sums over the years on the firm\u2019s behalf in onshore wind farms, convinced that renewable energy was poised to displace fossil fuels. He saw offshore wind power as the next step and has been pushing the Block Island wind farm and other Deepwater Wind projects forward for more than a decade.The turbines are about three miles off Block Island and can be seen easily from land. That drew some opposition, and could have been fatal.But Block Island is a rustic vacation spot where residents turned out to be largely supportive of the project. Not only does it help the environment, but it will connect their power grid to the mainland for the first time, giving them a more reliable supply.Competitors are moving to challenge Deepwater Wind for the coming wave of offshore contracts, but the company hopes to hold its lead and win the next project, a proposed wind farm 36 miles off Montauk, N.Y., meant to supply the power-hungry South Fork of Long Island.\u201cI do believe that starting small has made sense,\u201d said Mr. Martin, who is also Deepwater Wind\u2019s chairman. \u201cI would say that the next projects are going to be substantially bigger.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bus of Nepal Earthquake Survivors Plunges Off a Road, Killing 27", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKATHMANDU, Nepal \u2014 The second time the overloaded bus stalled, passengers stayed put. They had already exited once to push. With the bus stuck on a one-lane mountain dirt road, its occupants stuffed inside and on the roof amid luggage and rice sacks, the driver backed up first to regain uphill momentum.But something was horribly wrong: The bus kept going in reverse.Because of widespread confusion, some mistakenly thought only a few days remained before a 45-day window to sign the agreements expired. Others thought, in error, that they were nearing a deadline to receive the money, which will not be released until later.Now, those who survived face another round of recovery, physical and emotional \u2014 and the bureaucratic quandary of having to find or duplicate lost documents needed to gain access to the grants of about $1,900, a lot of money for a Nepalese homeowner.\u201cWe thought we would get the grant today, so we left yesterday, both me and my husband,\u201d Radhika Pariyaar, 43, said through an oxygen mask on Tuesday at the National Trauma Center in Kathmandu, Nepal\u2019s capital. \u201cBut where are our belongings now? Where are our victim identity cards?\u201dRecounting the accident, Ms. Pariyaar said people panicked as the bus inexplicably started accelerating backward.\u201cThe passengers were screaming: \u2018What is happening? Why isn\u2019t the driver hitting the brakes?\u2019\u201d she said, recalling how she somersaulted twice before blacking out as glass shards pierced her head.Tumbling at least 1,000 feet, the bus, carrying more than twice its 35-passenger limit, ripped into pieces.It took the police and Nepalese soldiers more than an hour to arrive. They then worked with local volunteers to pull bodies from the wreckage with ropes in the rain. Some said the driver, who survived, was found in a tree.Sushant Adhikari, the deputy police superintendent in the area, said it was unclear how the driver had lost control and why the brakes had failed.\u201cTalking to other people, the bus couldn\u2019t climb the inclined road, so it reversed downhill,\u201d he said.Devnath Gautam, who lives near the accident site and was among the first to call the police for help, said, \u201cThere were dead bodies all over the place.\u201dNepal\u2019s National Reconstruction Authority, an agency established to distribute earthquake aid, offered assurances on Tuesday that survivors would still be able to get the grants.But the agency is known for giving contradictory and confusing information, much of it conveyed by word of mouth. Some Nepalese mistakenly thought this week was a deadline set by the agency to get their rebuilding money. The real deadline, said Sushil Gyawali, the agency\u2019s chief executive, is Sept. 18.Mr. Gyawali said survivors would need to get duplicate victim identity cards from their local Village Development Committees.\u201cThose people who have victim identity cards and sign their agreements, the money will be transferred in the bank,\u201d Mr. Gyawali said.When Nepal was hit with a powerful earthquake the tremor shattered lives, landmarks and the very landscape of the country. The scope of the disaster in photographs.Under the earthquake compensation system, victims have to shuttle from their home villages to Kathmandu, then back to their villages, to fill out all the paperwork, even if they are not able to reside in the villages until their homes are livable again.Asked if the agency had needlessly complicated life for villagers who have limited access to transportation, telephones and the internet for information, Mr. Gyawali said he did not think so.\u201cThe process is easy,\u201d he said.For many on the bus, this was the final push to recover enough money to at least partly rebuild.After more than a year of living in a shed of donated tin, Ms. Pariyaar said she and her husband, who is also being treated at the National Trauma Center, had been looking forward to obtaining the reconstruction money.In Kathmandu, they had filled out their application and made photocopies of their earthquake victim identity cards. They had planned to claim the grant the day after the bus ride.Ms. Pariyaar said she and her husband, along with his brother and his brother\u2019s wife, had been sitting at the back of the bus. Her in-laws did not survive.Jay Bahadur Pariyaar, 31, a survivor who had been riding on the roof and is not related to the other Pariyaar couple, said he had read about the deadline for signing the grant agreements in a newspaper. He criticized the government for taking so long.\u201cThey should have given this grant earlier, but we cannot blame the government for this accident,\u201d he said at the trauma center, where he was treated for a head injury.Mr. Pariyaar said he owned two homes, one of which collapsed; the other was unlivable. He had already taken out a small loan to finance reconstruction, but with a family of eight, he said, the reconstruction money would be a big help.Recalling how the bus tipped over, Mr. Pariyaar said he had been flung from the roof like a \u201ccatapult,\u201d knocking him out.\u201cWhen I regained consciousness, I saw people and parts of the bus below me,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople were screaming and crying.\u201dRamesh Bardewa, whose wife, Sita, was killed, broke down in shock as he prepared to identify her body. The couple, with two children, had hoped the grant money would be enough to rebuild their home.\u201cShe was going to get the grant,\u201d he said, \u201cbut that same grant killed her.\u201dRick Gladstone contributed reporting from New York.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Price to Keep France Safe? Perhaps a Nation\u2019s Core Values, Many Fear", "Date": "2016-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Soldiers are patrolling French beaches through the August holiday. There has been talk of Guant\u00e1namo-style holding pens for thousands of terrorism suspects. The prime minister has suggested ending foreign funding for mosques.For now, the more extreme measures have been rejected by the government or have gained little traction in the wake of a deadly accumulation of terrorist attacks this summer.But that they have been floated at all is a measure of France\u2019s struggle to find solutions to a security problem that is now drawing comparisons to the one in Israel, or to the Islamist insurgency in France\u2019s former colony of Algeria in the 1990s.With a presidential race primed to heat up in the fall, the debate over how France should respond seems likely to intensify, forcing the country to confront whether it can maintain its aversion to sweeping changes in its security and judicial systems and live with the grim knowledge that there will be further attacks.The fatalism that has marked the country\u2019s response so far stems in part from France\u2019s distinctive position among the targets of Islamic extremists: Its own citizens are often the ones carrying out the attacks.France has a Muslim minority that is the largest in Europe \u2014 estimated at 7.5 percent of the population \u2014 and a minuscule part of it is keeping the country on edge.That fact has given the government a narrowing set of options for dealing with the problem, short of turning the country into an Israel-style security state, which no one here, left or right, seems to want.Already, the government has assumed wider powers of surveillance and house detention under a state of emergency, to limited effect. For now, calls to go still farther up that road are losing out to appeals to defend civil liberties.Worries over terrorism are forcing the cancellation of big events like the Braderie de Lille, perhaps Europe\u2019s largest flea market, normally held in the northern city of Lille each September.The judge was sympathetic last March to the young man, who insisted he was giving up on attempts to reach Syria and merely wanted to settle down. Three appellate judges confirmed the decision to let Mr. Kermiche go home, over the protests of prosecutors.Mr. Kermiche turns out to have been practicing the art of taqiyya, or dissimulation, explicitly counseled by the Islamic State to fool the enemy. Judges have now been advised by the French prime minister, Manuel Valls, to be on the lookout for it. But he also cautioned against second-guessing the country\u2019s independent judiciary.After a long season of police raids, house arrests, and endless parliamentary debate over how to confront the threat, there is no sustained pitch, even from the far-right National Front, for a more intrusive police presence in French daily life.At least three different security-state models for France have been debated in the media over the last three weeks: Israel, the United States and Algeria, which carried out a bloody 10-year repression of an Islamist insurgency in the 1990s, at a cost of thousands dead or \u201cdisappeared.\u201dAll have so far been rejected.\u201cWhat is at stake is the republic,\u201d Mr. Valls said in an interview in the French newspaper Le Monde last week, rejecting demands for more repression. \u201cAnd our shield is democracy.\u201dHis justice minister, Jean-Jacques Urvoas, appealed to France\u2019s history, as French politicians often do, in pushing away the center-right\u2019s plea for mass preventive detention \u2014 \u201cadministrative retention for those individuals classified as the most dangerous,\u201d as the former president Nicolas Sarkozy put it immediately after Father Hamel was killed.This could potentially involve rounding up some 10,000 individuals, French citizens and others, who are in the government\u2019s loose category of Islamist-inspired potential security threats \u2014 the so-called \u201cS-Files\u201d that are a principal fixation of the French media.The Socialist government rejects the idea categorically for now.This would \u201camount to wiping out Article 9 of the Declarations of the Rights of Man and the Citizen of 1789,\u201d Mr. Urvoas wrote in an op-ed in the same newspaper. This article guarantees the presumption of innocence.In recent days, the focus of public debate has shifted toward greater government control over the country\u2019s mosques, perhaps an indication of the government\u2019s desperation in its quest for remedies.Mr. Valls has said he wants the foreign financing of these mosques to end, and the training of imams to take place in France. But the usefulness of such measures appears doubtful, since many of those who have struck had only tenuous relations with official religion.The threat facing France is all the more redoubtable in that those who \u201cpass into action,\u201d according to the French formula, fall into unpredictable and widely varying categories.Some are firmly on the antiterrorism authorities\u2019 radar, like Mr. Kermiche. Others are completely unknown, like the driver in the deadly truck attack in Nice, Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel. Still others have made it into the \u201cS-Files\u201d but were not considered overt threats, like many of the participants in the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris.In all, the government has identified more than 2,000 people as \u201cimplicated in the phenomenon of violent religious radicalization or the jihadist recruiting pipeline,\u201d as an official declaration put it last month. But as the attacks have shown, that in no way covers all who are potentially dangerous.\u201cWhat are we going to do, put a cop behind everybody with a beard?\u201d Fran\u00e7oise Cotta, a veteran defense attorney who is one of the few here who represents those accused of terrorism, asked in an interview this week. \u201cBut what if they shave the beard? It\u2019s ridiculous.\u201dShe continued, \u201cWe are going to put 10 percent of the population under surveillance?\u201d\u201cThere are no miracle-remedies,\u201d Ms. Cotta said, pointing to the overarching issue of France\u2019s failure to integrate its Muslim minority.\u201cYou have to first understand why we are where we are, in order to come up with appropriate solutions,\u201d she said. \u201cThat whole labor of integration \u2014 it\u2019s got to be done.\u201dIn the short term, \u201cthere\u2019s no zero risk,\u201d Ms. Cotta said. \u201cThere will be other attacks.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Airbus Targeted by British Anticorruption Watchdog", "Date": "2016-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe inquiry by the Serious Fraud Office, which investigates complex instances of corruption, relates to the company\u2019s dealings with third-party agents to sell passenger jets overseas. The European plane maker admitted in April that it had failed to accurately report the involvement of independent consultants in deals in which Airbus had sought loans on behalf of customers from Britain\u2019s export credit agency.The anticorruption agency declined to provide further details, citing the confidentiality of the inquiry, which, based on past such investigations, could take years to conclude.The opening of the investigation nevertheless casts a shadow over the company at a time when a recent boom in global aircraft sales had been showing signs of slowing.Uncertainty over whether Airbus properly vetted its dealings with outside consultants had already prompted UK Export Finance, a British agency, to suspend all Airbus financing deals this spring. French and German agencies have taken similar steps.Airbus says the impact of the export credit freeze has so far been minimal. Just 6 percent of new plane deliveries are currently dependent on state-guaranteed loans, according to the company. That is well below the levels seen at the height of the global financial crisis, when up to one-third of jet sales by Airbus and its American rival, Boeing, relied on export credit. The two companies each control roughly half of the global market for passenger jets with more than 150 seats.Airbus has nevertheless said that restoring access to export credit remains a priority. The company is negotiating with the British, French and German agencies over a process for doing so before the end of the year, Martin Aguera, an Airbus spokesman, said.In a statement, the company said that it was cooperating with the Serious Fraud Office investigation.The case is not the first time that Airbus has run afoul of Britain\u2019s strict anticorruption laws.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Is a Scandal Really a Scandal?", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe crown prince of Bahrain gives millions of dollars to a charitable organization that works with the family foundation of the secretary of state. Later, he asks for a meeting with the secretary of state, through both formal and informal channels. He gets it.Is this proof of illegal influence peddling, or just how the intermingling worlds of politics and philanthropy work? And at what point does the difference between an apparent conflict of interest and an actual conflict cease to matter?Craig Minassian, a spokesman for the Clinton Foundation, acknowledged that recent reports on how the foundation operated while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state have led to \u201cperception issues.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s pretty obvious,\u201d he added, then laughed.The Clinton Foundation is a nonprofit organization founded by former President Bill Clinton in 2001, after he left the White House. It brings in money through fund-raising, which it spends on its programs in other countries. Since 2000, the Clinton Foundation has brought in more than $2 billion in donations. Representatives from at least 16 foreign governments have donated as much as $170 million to the foundation.Last week, a newly published batch of emails detailed correspondence between the foundation and the State Department when Mrs. Clinton was in office as secretary of state. Critics have claimed that the emails are evidence of wealthy donors \u2014 among them foreign citizens \u2014 requesting favors from the State Department, including private meetings with Mrs. Clinton.One specific exchange the report highlighted: Douglas J. Band, a Clinton Foundation executive, reached out on behalf of Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa, the crown prince of Bahrain \u2014 a country that has given between $50,000 and $100,000 to the foundation \u2014 and was granted a meeting with Mrs. Clinton.But the foundation\u2019s good works are a separate issue from donors\u2019 links to Mrs. Clinton in her role representing the public. The rules that apply to private citizens are much different from the rules (written or unwritten) that we apply to presidential candidates. And sometimes, the simple suggestion of corruption can be as damaging as real corruption to a candidate\u2019s reputation.Lawrence M. Noble, the general counsel at the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center, said the Clintons had been \u201csomewhat tone deaf\u201d about how their relationship with donors would be perceived. Still, he said the focus on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s meetings as secretary of state is a \u201cdistraction\u201d from the real problems with our campaign finance system \u2014 a system that the Clintons and other politicians benefit handsomely from.\u201cThe problem is that we\u2019ve developed this culture in part thanks to the Supreme Court that seems to sanction the idea that donors will get special access,\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as we see this potential influence, we\u2019re not going to trust it, because it\u2019s human nature that one is influenced by those who are trying to help them.\u201d\u201cBut they\u2019re the most corrupt enterprise in political history, that\u2019s your statement,\u201d Ms. Maddow responded.\u201cApparently you can be both,\u201d Ms. Conway said.Cynically speaking, this is just how politics works, though that doesn\u2019t make it good or acceptable. Rich people simply have more influence in American politics than not-rich people do. The emails between the Clinton Foundation and the State Department have unveiled the political sausage-making machine everyone assumed was already there.Ami Dar founded the website Idealist, a job-posting board for nonprofit organizations. He has experience raising money from wealthy foundations, and said, \u201cAccess matters greatly, because once you\u2019re in the room, you can make stuff happen.\u201d\u201cThe question is, who gets to make a case?\u201d he added. \u201cWho even gets to be in the room?\u201dMr. Minassian said the criticism surrounding the latest batch of emails stems from the public\u2019s lack of understanding about how global development works.\u201cGlobal development work takes global engagement,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are perception issues if she wins the presidency, but the work can continue helping people.\u201dThe Clintons live in a political kaleidoscope \u2014 everyone sees something different in each story about them, depending on his or her personal ideology. If you can bring yourself to care about this semi-obscure (by Clinton standards) controversy, you\u2019ve probably already made up your mind about it. If you think the Clintons have been the victims of a decades-long coordinated attack by Republicans, then you probably think the Clinton Foundation story is a big nothing-burger. But if you think the Clintons are fundamentally untrustworthy people, taking advantage of a flawed political system for their personal gain, the latest revelations will serve only to reinforce that idea.An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the crown prince of Bahrain gave $32 million to the Clinton Global Initiative. The donation went to an educational program run in conjunction with the Clinton Global Initiative, not directly to the initiative.Advertisement"}

She nailed it.\u201dIn one scene, Michelle talks about the racism she encountered at Princeton and Harvard \u2014 some subtle, some less so \u2014 and how, even at her current firm, she has to navigate between \u201cPlanet Black and Planet White.\u201d Ms. Sumpter admitted that there were parallels in her own field. \u201cYou see the differences in the way certain movies are treated,\u201d she said. \u201cBut once you come to terms with that, you have to go, O.K., I\u2019m not going to allow that to hold me back. Which is what I love about Michelle. She never allowed the color of her skin and all the things she was up against to keep her from breaking through.\u201dA lot of that confidence came from Mrs. Obama\u2019s family, just as it did for Ms. Sumpter, who is expecting her own daughter this fall. \u201cBecause of my mom, I never felt less than,\u201d she said, looking back on her early days trying to make it in the business. \u201cI never came into this world thinking, I\u2019m a brown-skinned girl going to Hollywood. I was always like, I\u2019m talented and I\u2019m beautiful and I\u2019m smart. Why wouldn\u2019t you want me?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Gamble of Tronc\u2019s \u2018Just Say No\u2019 Defense", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDeal ProfessorGannett\u2019s battle to acquire Tronc, the newspaper publisher formerly known as Tribune Publishing, raises the question of whether a board should continue to \u201cjust say no\u201d or give in to a hostile acquirer.So far, Mr. Ferro\u2019s plan for independence seems to be bearing out. Gannett raised its initial bid several weeks later to $15 a share. In response, Tribune sold a 12.9 percent interest to a billionaire entrepreneur, Patrick Soon-Shiong, at $15 a share for $70.5 million, justifying the sale as needed to protect journalism and fend off the underpriced Gannett bid. The deal made Dr. Soon-Shiong the company\u2019s second-biggest shareholder.This last disclosure comes in the wake of reports that Gannett, which some thought would quietly go away, has raised its bid.It is up to Tronc to either spurn Gannett again or accept a bid if Gannett is willing to pay.If Mr. Ferro\u2019s goal in resisting was to push up Gannett\u2019s price, then he is doing a masterly job. To be sure, he is getting an assist from Gannett itself, which announced its offer after the deadline to nominate directors to Tronc\u2019s board, removing any leverage it could have had to force Tronc to negotiate. This means that Gannett must persuade the board to accept the offer, and Tronc\u2019s board seems willing to defy the majority of its shareholders who want to sell.It all raises the questions of when should a board say no and what shareholders can do about a \u201cjust say no\u201d defense.The \u201cjust say no\u201d defense was first raised in the 1980s, a time of hostile raiders and buyouts financed by Michael Milken\u2019s junk bonds. Back then, companies lacked takeover defenses, something that suited many academics just fine. These professors theorized that the takeover market served to discipline management. If management underperformed, an acquirer would buy the company on the cheap and operate it more efficiently. The threat of a takeover would discipline poorly performing companies.Named after Nancy Reagan\u2019s antidrug campaign at the time, the \u201cjust say no\u201d defense left it up to a board\u2019s judgment to accept or reject a bid no matter the price. The reason may have been simple dislike of the acquirer or a need by the directors to keep their jobs. Whatever the real reason, the ostensible one was based on the shenanigans of these hostile takeovers, premised in the board\u2019s ability to judge whether a bid was underpriced.\u201cJust say no\u201d as a defense is a gamble. It depends on how steely the management and board are and what the decision means for the future. There is a negotiating element to this \u2014 adopting a \u201cjust say no\u201d defense leaves no doubt that Tronc has succeeded in getting more potential money. The risk in this strategy is that Gannett goes away instead of acquiring Tronc, leaving the company to wither like Yahoo or find its own path to success.It is not certain whether Tronc\u2019s resistance is a brilliant negotiating defense to push the offer higher or whether the board is saying the company is not for sale at any price. If the former, Mr. Ferro has earned his accolades from shareholders. If the latter, he perhaps has also, but we will not know the outcome for years to come.Luckily for Tronc shareholders, Gannett has stuck around. Whether inadvertently or not, Tronc\u2019s obstreperousness has resulted in a higher bid, which would mean more money for shareholders, money that would not have come if the board had first listened to them.The \u201cjust say no\u201d defense has lots of elements, and it is one that few companies can pull off successfully because there is so much uncertainty. We will find out whether Tronc adds new justification. But in the face of this, most companies these days sell, whether or not they can mount a defense after a few rounds of negotiations. It is perhaps better to take the money and run, provided the bid is in the range of fairness. That just may be fine, at least for shareholders.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Dilma Rousseff Is Ousted as Brazil\u2019s President in Impeachment Vote", "Date": "2016-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRAS\u00cdLIA \u2014 The Senate on Wednesday impeached Dilma Rousseff, Brazil\u2019s first female president, and removed her from office for the rest of her term, the capstone of a power struggle that has consumed the nation for months and toppled one of the hemisphere\u2019s most powerful political parties.\u201cShe lacked it all,\u201d said Mentor Muniz Neto, a writer from S\u00e3o Paulo who described Ms. Rousseff\u2019s final ouster as a \u201cdeath foretold,\u201d asserting that she lacked charisma, competence and humility. \u201cWe deserved better.\u201dMichel Temer, 75, the interim president who served as Ms. Rousseff\u2019s vice president before breaking with her this year, is now expected to remain in office until the end of the current term in 2018.\u201cIt\u2019s painfully obvious that Temer is a slap in the face to Brazilian democracy,\u201d said Creuza Maria Oliveira, the president of the National Federation of Domestic Workers, which represents millions of maids who benefited from the strengthening of labor laws by Ms. Rousseff.\u201cDilma is a champion of the poor,\u201d said Ms. Oliveira, who was among the supporters of Ms. Rousseff who accompanied her to the Senate this week. \u201cTemer is a champion of his own political class, which he wants to shield from justice.\u201dMr. Temer\u2019s administration has \u201call the conditions needed to embark on a new route,\u201d Philipp Schiemer, the head of Mercedes-Benz\u2019s operations in Brazil, told reporters in recent days. \u201cWe need to decide if we want a Brazil like Venezuela or a Brazil inserted in the new world.\u201dStill others, including Ms. Rousseff, contend that the ease with which the political elite shunted aside the president will bring more divisiveness and political tumult in Brazil.\u201cThis is serious because other presidents of the republic will have to deal with this,\u201d Ms. Rousseff said this week in her testimony in the Senate, comparing her ouster to the coups toppling Brazilian leaders throughout much of the 20th century. \u201cIf that isn\u2019t political instability, then I don\u2019t know what is.\u201dUnlike many of the politicians who led the charge to oust her, Ms. Rousseff, 68, remains a rare breed in Brazil: a prominent leader who has not been accused of illegally enriching herself.Ms. Rousseff repeatedly insisted that she did nothing illegal, pointing out that her predecessors also manipulated the federal budget. But her opponents argued that the scale of her administration\u2019s transfers of funds between giant public banks, to the tune of about $11 billion, seriously eroded Brazil\u2019s economic credibility and helped her get re-elected unfairly in 2014.Ms. Rousseff will not go to jail after her conviction, but she expressed defiance throughout her trial, insisting that Brazil\u2019s economic crisis was largely the result of shifts in the global economy that cut commodities prices.Many voters also felt betrayed after Ms. Rousseff\u2019s re-election campaign, when she narrowly won on promises to maintain extensive state control over the economy, resulting in generous public spending. But once re-elected, she went in another direction, appointing a finance minister who tried to win approval for market-friendly policies.\u201cShe simply lied through her teeth to get re-elected, forming a wave of national indignation,\u201d said Antonio Ris\u00e9rio, a historian and cultural commentator. \u201cUpon perceiving that they voted for one person and elected another, the majority of the population started to want her head.\u201dWith Ms. Rousseff deposed, the Workers\u2019 Party, a dominant force in Brazilian politics for much of the past decade and a half, is now scrambling to find its way in a political landscape where conservative voices are growing more powerful.Even more damaging for the party, federal investigators are seeking graft charges against Mr. da Silva, the former labor leader universally known as Lula, who was president from 2003 to 2010. The move adds to mounting legal problems faced by Mr. da Silva, who is still signaling that he plans to run for president in 2018.Ms. Rousseff found herself increasingly isolated in recent months, with many in her party quietly withdrawing their support. But senators offered her a morsel of consolation by voting to allow her to run for public office, overruling an effort to make her ineligible from doing so for several years.And some in Ms. Rousseff\u2019s party defended her as she made her last-ditch effort before the Senate this week.\u201cYou veered from the narrative when you were elected president of the republic as a woman, from the left, a former militant against the dictatorship, without a husband to pose by your side in the photographs,\u201d said Regina Sousa, a Workers\u2019 Party senator from Piau\u00ed in northeast Brazil.\u201cYou never fit in the cute little dress designed by the conservative elite of this country,\u201d Ms. Sousa added.Heated tempers marked the trial in the Senate. Crying as she spoke, Jana\u00edna Paschoal, the law professor who was an author of the impeachment request, said she had been inspired by God and that she was seeking impeachment for the good of Ms. Rousseff\u2019s grandchildren.Ms. Rousseff\u2019s lawyer, Jos\u00e9 Eduardo Cardozo, said he was stunned that her opponents had dragged Ms. Rousseff\u2019s family into the acerbic debate, pointing out that Ms. Rousseff was never accused of embezzling public funds to benefit her family.\u201cIf you want to condemn her, go ahead, but don\u2019t mock the honor of a dignified woman,\u201d said Mr. Cardozo, also crying as he spoke.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trumponomics Is Reform Conservatism\u2019s Evil Twin", "Date": "2016-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLong before Donald Trump, the Republican Party had an obvious problem. Its core economic agenda \u2014 tax cuts, free trade, deregulation and a promise to shrink the federal leviathan \u2014 was seen by many Americans, including many of the party\u2019s own voters, as distant from their concerns and too skewed toward the rich.The last attempt to do something about this problem, George W. Bush\u2019s compassionate conservatism, foundered with his presidency, and in 2008 and 2012 the party swung back to a more generic Reagan-era message, without particularly impressive results.Instead we got a different response to the G.O.P.\u2019s economic policy problem: Trumpian populism, which won the votes of working-class Republicans and carried all (or at least a plurality) before it. And after Monday\u2019s speech in Detroit, in which Trump \u2014 notionally \u2014 committed himself to a tax agenda, we can say definitively what Trumponomics represents.It\u2019s reform conservatism\u2019s evil twin.Now, I identify with reform conservatism, so the word \u201cevil\u201d might be a touch biased. But let me explain. Basically, reform conservatives tend to think that the Republican Party\u2019s longstanding commitments to free markets, free trade and entitlement reform are all well worth preserving. But while pursuing this broadly Paul Ryan-ish agenda, we think the party needs to offer more direct support to working Americans who have struggled with stagnant wages and rising health care and education costs. And the obvious way to pay for this support, ultimately, is to be less monomaniacal about sweeping tax cuts for the rich.Trumpism takes roughly the opposite approach. Despite his rhetorical flirtations with making the rich pay more, the supply-side monomania has been the aspect of conventional G.O.P. economics that Trump has consistently embraced. Tellingly, he has even embraced the longstanding supply-side dogma against tax credits, which is why the pro-family policy he unveiled this week only offers a tax deduction for child care \u2014 one that disproportionately benefits working mothers in what we might call the Ivanka bracket.I think this combination \u2013 more tax cuts for the rich, married to protectionism and \u201cMedicare Today, Medicare Forever\u201d \u2013 is objectively bad policy. But as types of populism go, it has two advantages as a strategy for dealing with the G.O.P. coalition as it currently exists.First, Trumponomics appeals directly to older voters, seniors and near-seniors: its message on entitlements in obvious ways, its implausible promises about bringing back factory jobs via the deep power of nostalgia.A lot of the conservative intelligentsia\u2019s ideas for a new G.O.P. populism were consciously pitched to younger voters \u2014 the more libertarian ideas to millennials and minorities, the reform conservative agenda to thirtysomethings and fortysomethings trying to get ahead in the work force and raise families. But in the Republican coalition, over-fifty voters predominate (and turn out), and Trump\u2019s form of populism resonates much more with them.Second, by keeping supply-side economics front and center, Trumponomics satisfies the slice of the donor class for whom all conservative policy goals are secondary to keeping their own tax bill as low as possible.If this sounds like a cynical view of my fellow citizens\u2019 motivations, a view heretofore advanced mostly by liberal critics of the right \u2014 well, look, it\u2019s been a year in which cynical interpretations of the conservative establishment have been vindicated time and time again.I\u2019d like to believe that certain Republican donors aren\u2019t justifying their support for Trump on the grounds that his upper bracket tax cuts are really awesome. But the Trump campaign is certainly acting like that\u2019s the pro quo required to get the quid.Alas for Trumponomics, neither G.O.P. donors nor white seniors are the constituencies that Trump needs now if hopes to to save his foundering campaign. His populism\u2019s primary-season strengths are weaknesses in a general election, in which Republicans need a lot more of the votes (from suburban women, above all) that a different, less backward-looking form of conservative populism might have helped them win.Alas for those of us who championed that different form, in 2016 we lost the battle of ideas, and Trumponomics won.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A 600-Year-Old Money Pit in the Scottish Highlands", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIsle of Mull JournalISLE OF MULL, Scotland \u2014 Anyone who has despaired over home improvement should spare a thought for Sir Lachlan Hector Charles Maclean of Duart and Morvern.The Scottish lord has been repairing his home since he inherited it from his father in 1990, with no end in sight.His is no ordinary house. Rather, it is a crumbling 14th-century castle \u2014 with a dungeon \u2014 that has collapsed ceilings and rainwater seeping through its 16-foot-thick walls pretty much all of the time \u2014 even during summer, which can be exceedingly wet and blustery in Scotland.The cost of repairs? So far, 1.5 million pounds, or $1.94 million, and counting.\u201cWhat does one do with a property like this?\u201d Sir Lachlan, the 28th chief of the clan, asked rhetorically one recent afternoon as he sipped tea in his living room, probably one of the snugger parts of the castle where he and his wife, Rosie, have retreated, though it was still mildly damp with a whiff of stale curry.Strong rains lashed against the windows, and the constant buzz of drilling forced him to speak up. The Macleans\u2019 private living room was cluttered with modern bric-a-brac while, just below, tourists tramped about in the stately banquet hall looking at clan paraphernalia and trying to locate a public toilet. There are, in fact, two toilets, but they are both unusable \u2014 one put in nearly a century ago, and another 600 years ago.\u201cA lot of people wouldn\u2019t want to live here,\u201d Sir Lachlan said, before proceeding to list, like an overly candid real estate agent, the property\u2019s shortcomings. \u201cIt\u2019s cold, it\u2019s never really warm. It\u2019s very windy and it\u2019s very wet \u2014 and that\u2019s not a very good combination. Some people must be thinking, \u2018What a silly old fool living there.\u2019\u201dPerched on a craggy cliff on an island slightly bigger than New York City, the castle has, at various stages in its history, been invaded, attacked and demolished by rival clans loyal to Scottish kings or by troops fighting on behalf of Oliver Cromwell, the antimonarchist revolutionary.At one point, the castle\u2019s dungeon held Spanish prisoners after a failed attempt to invade England in the 16th century. The clan had lands on the Isles of Mull, Coll, Tiree and Jura \u2014 all also along the west coast of Scotland.In modern times, however, Duart Castle has been under assault primarily by Scotland\u2019s relentlessly bad weather.Befitting a modern-day clan chief, whose complete title is Sir Lachlan Hector Charles Maclean of Duart and Morvern, 12th Baronet, Commander of the Royal Victorian Order, Deputy Lieutenant and Eighth Lord Maclean (he goes by Sir Lachlan), his primary job is to defend the castle from decay and, more important, from oblivion.There are 283 days of rainfall on average per year on the Isle of Mull. When winds are particularly strong, he said, the only way to leave the castle, which is surrounded on three sides by water, is by crawling on his hands and knees down the steps of the main entrance.Duart, which means black point in Gaelic, a nod to the black volcanic rock where the castle stands, is one of the last surviving clan castles still privately owned.Maintaining it is a moral responsibility, Sir Lachlan said. \u201cIt is a sort of focal point for the clan,\u201d he added, as he carefully descended a narrow staircase that was designed in 1360 to be just wide enough to allow one man wielding a sword. (A sign nonetheless read: \u201cWe apologize for any congestion on the stairs.\u201d)The castle receives about 25,000 visitors a year, some of them part of the Maclean diaspora living in the United States, Canada and Australia. The name Maclean can be spelled in at least 15 ways.People are increasingly searching for their heritage and their identity, Sir Lachlan said, leading some to visit Duart Castle.In a globalized world, \u201cpeople are becoming less sure about themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they want to find home.\u201dHe recalled meeting one visitor, a Maclean from Australia, who had promised his family back home that he would visit Duart Castle. As the visitor was leaving, he turned to Sir Lachlan and said, \u201cThank you for looking out for us.\u201d A young woman in Florida, another Maclean, sends monthly donations from her supermarket wages.But Sir Lachlan is worried that he will be unable to finance repairs to the castle after 2017.In 2013, four ceilings crumbled when water came through the chimneys. Water has also washed away some of the mortar between the stones of the castle\u2019s walls.A year earlier, Sir Lachlan had convened a clan congress, announcing then that the family was no longer able to afford the repairs undertaken at the castle over the past century.Now, work on the castle is increasingly dependent on donations from the public. \u201cI really would like to redo the whole thing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut is one able to raise that amount of money?\u201dThe castle was founded in the 14th century and was well maintained until the 1600s when the Macleans aligned themselves with the House of Stuart, a losing cause, leaving them poor and eventually landless.Duart was seized and sacked by the rival Campbell clan in 1688 and was garrisoned by government troops until 1751.The Macleans were monarchists who summoned clan members from France to participate in the Jacobite risings of 1715 and 1745 on the side of the Stuart family against government forces. That culminated in the 1746 Battle of Culloden near Inverness in the Highlands, when the Jacobites were defeated and the Stuart pretender to the throne, Bonnie Prince Charlie, escaped into exile.Duart was restored in 1911 when Sir Lachlan\u2019s great-grandfather, Sir Fitzroy Maclean, bought back the castle, which had been left in ruins for 150 years.The clan animosity with the Campbells is deeply ingrained, possibly the fruit of family disputes, including the failed attempt by the 11th chief of the Macleans, Lachlan Cattanach, to murder his wife, Elizabeth, a Campbell, because she had failed to produce an heir.According to the castle\u2019s history, she was marooned on a rock in seas off Duart Castle and left to drown when the tides rose. She was rescued by fishermen and returned to her family, but not before her husband, thinking she had died, offered his condolences to her father, the Earl of Argyll.In a twist worthy of a telenovela, the earl invited him to dinner at the Campbell castle, where, to the Maclean chief\u2019s astonishment, she was found sitting at the table. He later married twice more, but was eventually murdered by a Campbell around 1523.That rivalry is long gone now, though Sir Lachlan has vowed never to wear a kilt with the Campbell pattern.There is a greater, more urgent matter at hand. \u201cScotland cannot let this building fall into disrepair because it\u2019s too important for history,\u201d he said.Another uncertainty is whether his eldest son, Malcolm, 43, will move into the castle when he inherits it.\u201cI was brought up here. I love living here,\u201d Sir Lachlan said thoughtfully. \u201cIt\u2019s an old building that I\u2019m very fond of.\u201dThe Isle of Mull Journal on Aug. 31, about Duart Castle, a 600-year-old monument on an island off the western coast of Scotland that is in constant need of repair, misspelled part of the title of the Scottish lord who owns it. He is Sir Lachlan Hector Charles Maclean of Duart and Morvern (not Morven).Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Meg Whitman, Calling Donald Trump a \u2018Demagogue,\u2019 Will Support Hillary Clinton for President", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMeg Whitman, a Hewlett Packard executive and Republican fund-raiser, said Tuesday that she would support Hillary Clinton for president and give a \u201csubstantial\u201d contribution to her campaign in order to stop Donald J. Trump, whom she berated as a threat to American democracy.\u201cI will vote for Hillary, I will talk to my Republican friends about helping her, and I will donate to her campaign and try to raise money for her,\u201d Ms. Whitman said in a telephone interview.She revealed that Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic nominee, had reached out to her in a phone call about a month ago, one of the first indications that Mrs. Clinton is aggressively courting Republican leaders. While acknowledging she diverged from Mrs. Clinton on many policy issues, Ms. Whitman said it was time for Republicans \u201cto put country first before party.\u201dUsing remarkably blunt language, she argued that the election of Mr. Trump, whom she called \u201ca dishonest demagogue,\u201d could lead the country \u201con a very dangerous journey.\u201d She noted that democracies had seldom lasted longer than a few hundred years and warned that those who say that \u201cit can\u2019t happen here\u201d are being na\u00efve.\u201cTime and again history has shown that when demagogues have gotten power or come close to getting power, it usually does not end well,\u201d Ms. Whitman said. She asserted that Mr. Trump had already \u201cundermined the character of the nation.\u201dA billionaire who spent $140 million of her own money in a failed bid for governor of California in 2010, Ms. Whitman, the former chief executive of eBay, is a prized defector for Mrs. Clinton. She is close to Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee; has deep ties to the country\u2019s business elite; and is a rare female Republican executive in Silicon Valley.While many leading Republican donors have made clear that they will not donate to Mr. Trump, few have taken the next step of throwing their support, and financial largess, to Mrs. Clinton.While Donald J. Trump or Hillary Clinton will represent the entire country, the Americans who selected them are a small part of it.Ms. Whitman was a leading fund-raiser for Mr. Romney\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign and was a chairwoman of Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s presidential finance team this year. But after Mr. Christie withdrew from the campaign and endorsed Mr. Trump, Ms. Whitman excoriated the New Jersey governor for what she said was an \u201castonishing display of political opportunism.\u201dOn Tuesday, Ms. Whitman said she had not spoken to Mr. Christie since he endorsed Mr. Trump, and pointedly noted that she had not changed her view of his decision.Ms. Whitman, who said she would remain a Republican, brings with her a considerable network of contributors, some of whom she said were open to giving to Mrs. Clinton.

{"Headline": "How Dell Raised $67 Billion for the Biggest Tech Deal Ever", "Date": "2016-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYet after months of complicated financial maneuvering, EMC shareholders voted overwhelmingly last month to approve the sale.Dell isn\u2019t out of the woods yet. It still needs approval from Chinese regulators. And once the deal closes later this year, the computer giant faces the challenge of integrating a fellow old-line tech company in a world in which new technologies have already upset other venerable names and other old-guard companies are breaking apart.How Dell, led by Michael Dell, and its financial backer, the investment firm Silver Lake, made it this far is in part a tale of an unusual struggle to finance the biggest-ever takeover in the tech industry, one that drew on debt raised in the face of tumultuous markets. The undertaking included the fourth-largest investment-grade corporate bond ever raised, the second-largest this year, as ranked by Thomson Reuters.The goal ultimately was to raise nearly $50 billion in all major debt markets. Jim Casey, the head of debt capital markets at JPMorgan Chase, the lead bank in raising financing, said there had never been a deal done before where every single major market was tapped. \u201cWe were looking for every vein of money that was available.\u201dAnd even more, Dell and EMC managed to push more than $40 billion of that borrowed money into investment-grade ratings territory even though Dell is rated below investment grade \u2014 a feat that will save billions of dollars a year in interest.Mr. Dell and Egon Durban, the Silver Lake managing partner who helped lead the leveraged buyout in 2013 that made Dell a private company again, said they strongly believed that the computer maker should seek to get bigger \u2014 even as rivals like Hewlett-Packard were shedding businesses to become more focused.\u201cWe\u2019ve created the leader in an impressive number of categories,\u201d Mr. Dell said in an interview. \u201cWe definitely have tough competitors, but I like to think that some of them may be running around trying to figure out how to respond to this combination.\u201dMr. Durban added, \u201cThe doubling \u2014 no, quintupling \u2014 down with investment is in stark contrast to what many other mature technology companies are doing.\u201dPlans for taking on a target as big as EMC began as far back as October 2014. In addition to the tens of billions of dollars worth of loans and bonds that needed to be arranged, more than $6 billion worth of assets, including major divisions, had to be sold.Dell and Silver Lake also devised a \u201ctracking stock,\u201d a publicly traded security tied to the performance of the virtualization software maker VMware, which was spun out of EMC into the public markets but is still mostly owned by it. The tracking stock would force Dell to publicly disclose some financial information, something it has not had to do since going private in 2013, but the move proved vital for the financing, since the stock could be used as collateral for some of the debt.Some of Dell\u2019s own potential banks balked early on, arguing that they simply could not sell enough junk bonds to finance the deal, and other lenders refused to participate if they could not easily resell some of the loans to other investors.Then Dell, Silver Lake and the bankers came up with an idea, pushed hard by Mr. Durban: Sell more high-rated loans and bonds, a questionable idea for a junk-rated company like Dell.An internal Silver Lake finance team that included Joerg Adams, Geoff Oltmans and Frank Walters, as well as their counterparts at Dell, Tyler Johnson and Ryan Weninger, pored over the plans and spent hours pitching to prospective investors.\u201cWe had a rolling thunder campaign, where we followed one step after another,\u201d Mr. Durban said.The financing was arranged in stages. Timing for the sales of the first part, the highly rated bank loans, proved to be tricky. The Dell-Silver Lake team waited anxiously during the winter of 2015, wary of market conditions. Things worsened by January and February, as markets across the globe whipsawed in fear of a slowing China and looming global recession.By March 28, Dell and Silver Lake had sold $9.4 billion, drawing $2 billion more than they had expected.Still, more debt needed to be raised. Less than two months later, Dell\u2019s banks went out to sell what was originally going to be $16 billion worth of investment-grade rated bonds. But investor demand for the debt proved significantly higher than anticipated, prompting Dell and the banks to increase the order size to $20 billion, the second-largest investment grade bond offering this year after a $45.8 billion deal for Anheuser Busch, according to Thomson Reuters.The Dell and Silver Lake teams held some 40 calls for the offering between May 9 and May 17, eventually reaching roughly 200 investor accounts. During those meetings, executives pointed to Dell\u2019s record of paying down debt from its leveraged buyout, as well as explaining the logic of the deal and the combined company\u2019s ability to cover the debt payments.The success of the investment-grade bonds made selling the remaining debt much easier. Less than two weeks later, Dell\u2019s banks went to market with the so-called Term Loan B, a lower-grade bank loan that was broken into pieces and sold to institutional investors. The company\u2019s advisers reduced the size of that offering to $5 billion from $8 billion.Then about a week later, on June 8, Dell\u2019s banks staged an offering for the final piece of the debt puzzle: traditional junk bonds. Appetite for the offering again proved strong, allowing the bankers to sell the debt at an interest rate of 6.5 percent, or nearly half of what they had anticipated. Again, the banks were able to cut the size of the offering, to $3.25 billion from roughly $9 billion.Two weeks later, on June 20, Dell was able to complete the final stage of its financing puzzle, selling its software businesses to two investment firms \u2014 including Elliott Management, the activist hedge fund that had pushed for a sale of EMC a year earlier \u2014 for more than $2 billion.By the end of the financing campaign, Dell and Silver Lake fashioned a capital structure where the combined company generates about $7 billion in annual earnings before interest, depreciation, taxes and amortization. Its overall annual interest payments total roughly $2 billion.That helped pave the way for last month\u2019s shareholder vote, where 98 percent of the votes cast were in favor of the deal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Zen and the Art of 401(k) Maintenance", "Date": "2016-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneyHere\u2019s how to get better returns in your retirement account: Pay as little attention to it as possible.Fidelity, which has received inquiries about the study ever since, without knowing why, told me this week that it had never produced such a study.How disappointing, given how tantalizingly counterintuitive the supposed conclusion was: Perhaps chasing headlines and darting in and out of stocks and bonds as hedge fund managers do wasn\u2019t necessary after all.We humans tend to experience pain from losses much more acutely than whatever joy we might experience from an equal-size gain. \u201cIf you\u2019re watching as the markets go down, you are twice as unhappy as you would be happy if they went up by the same amount,\u201d Professor Pagel said. \u201cSo looking at the market is, on average, painful.\u201dSo stop looking so much. Consider turning off paper statements and email notifications for retirement accounts that you won\u2019t need to draw on for several years. Most people\u2019s accounts fall into that category \u2014 even those on the brink of what will hopefully be a multidecade retirement. The less we look, the less tempted we\u2019ll be to act to try to alleviate that pain.But many of us will look anyway. We are rubberneckers, masochists, cravers of information. We convince ourselves that since the facts are different this time, then perhaps our behavior should be, too.So should we touch our investments the next time markets take a prolonged dive? This is something Fidelity actually has studied. After the stock market collapse in 2008 and early 2009, the company noticed that 61,200 401(k) account holders had sold all of their stock. So the company started tracking them to see whether that move would pay off.Since then, 16,900 had not bought stocks in their retirement accounts through the end of 2015. About 13,000 of them are under 60, so they probably didn\u2019t just cash out and take early retirement either. Through the end of 2015, their account balances rose by 27.2 percent, including new contributions.People who had at least some stock exposure, however, saw their accounts jump 157.7 percent. That left them with an average balance of $176,500, $82,000 more than the people who got rid of all their stock. Now imagine that $82,000 difference compounding over 20 or 30 more years, and think hard about whether you want to touch the stocks in your retirement fund the next time the markets fall far.This is an extreme example but an important one, given that plenty of smart people capitulate when faced with the pain of looking too hard at fast-falling balances. Even when market moves aren\u2019t quite as severe, people still tend to fiddle with their holdings. In the second quarter of this year, 13 percent of Fidelity 401(k) account holders did so.Left to our own devices, picking and choosing among a variety of funds, we\u2019re likely to change our minds often and flit in and out of things. According to Morningstar data examining 1,930 stock mutual funds over 15 years ending in June, the difference between what the funds would have delivered to steadfast investors and what the average investor (who did not hang around for that long) actually earned was 0.99 percentage points. That doesn\u2019t seem like much, but a one percentage point difference in returns can mean missing out on many hundreds of thousands of dollars in returns over the decades.But when I told Professor Pagel that Mr. Shaughnessy\u2019s interviewer, Barry Ritholtz, had wondered whether the punch line to the study might be that the most successful Fidelity account holders were the dead ones, she thought he might be onto something. \u201cEven if it\u2019s not true, it\u2019s actually true,\u201d she said. \u201cDead people can\u2019t get upset from seeing the market go down.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Danish Wind Turbine Maker Harnesses Data in a Push to Stay Ahead", "Date": "2016-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAARHUS, Denmark \u2014 A project to install hundreds of wind turbines in the Fosen peninsula area of Norway at one point was shelved as unfeasible. The strong breezes that whip off the sea can shift and swing unpredictably, while the soaring cliffs and steep drop-offs create turbulence that wears out expensive equipment.The venture was rescued with a lot of help from the mathematical calculations of Vestas Wind Systems, a Danish wind power company.Vestas used data to figure out how to use more powerful turbines for the project, and precisely where to place them. That meant the utility developing the facility could buy fewer turbines, helping cut costs and balancing the economics of the $1.2 billion project.The company is at the forefront of efforts to make wind a competitive source of energy, rather than just a subsidized experiment. In doing so, it has become a model for the renewables industry, which has struggled at times to remain viable while facing cuts in government subsidies and volatile oil and gas prices.Vestas understands the fickleness of the renewable energy business.After the financial crisis and global downturn, Vestas struggled with costs that were too high, as subsidies fell and orders for wind turbines plummeted. It was not the first misfortune for Vestas \u2014 it nearly went bankrupt in the 1980s.Confidence in the company had \u201chit rock bottom,\u201d acknowledged Bert Nordberg, who became chairman in the midst of the recent crisis. A painful round of cost-cutting followed. Vestas closed or sold off 19 of its 31 factories around the world, cut its work force by about a third to 15,500, and focused on fewer lines of wind turbines.The broader industry is in better shape, as well. The revenues of a group of eight large turbine makers, including Vestas, grew 17 percent last year to \u20ac27 billion, according to David Vos, a renewable energy analyst at Barclays in London.Producing wind power is also getting cheaper. In some parts of the world, like India, setting up a wind farm to power a factory or a town nearby can even be more practical than conventional methods like building a natural gas pipeline.It is competitive with fossil fuels even in oil-rich places like the Texas Panhandle in the United States, the company\u2019s largest market. Under favorable circumstances, Mr. Vos pegs Panhandle wind costs at about $29 a megawatt-hour, a wholesale measurement, over the life of a project, compared with $33 a megawatt-hour for a new gas-fired plant in the United States.The global nature of the industry plays to the strengths of a company like Vestas.Unlike its rivals \u2014 such as General Electric, which focuses on the Americas \u2014 Vestas sells across a broader area of the world. It sold wind turbines in 34 countries last year, and it holds the biggest portion of the worldwide onshore wind turbine market, excluding China (which is dominated by domestic players).\u201cThe scale advantage they have is phenomenal,\u201d Mr. Vos said.Founded as a family owned blacksmith shop in 1898, Vestas over the years manufactured a wide variety of products, including dairy equipment and cranes. It began experimenting with wind turbines in the 1970s as an alternative energy source for local farmers during an era of volatile oil prices. The first turbine it sold, which was based on a design by local blacksmiths, had a rotor just 10 meters, or 33 feet, in diameter.Now, its turbines are not only far bigger but also much more productive.The company installs giant turbines that may stretch more than 500 feet into the air, with individual blades nearly 190 feet long, whirring at over 180 miles per hour. Its latest devices generate 25 times as much electricity over a year as those made in the 1980s.Crucial to that progress has been data collection, which Vestas has been doing for years on a large scale.\u201cWhen you work with siting and selling wind power plants, you need to know exactly the weather conditions of where you want to put up a turbine,\u201d Lars Christian Christensen, Vesta\u2019s vice president for plant solutions, said in an interview at the company\u2019s headquarters on the outskirts of Aarhus, a harbor city on Denmark\u2019s Jutland peninsula.Vestas has been refining mathematical techniques to predict the speed, variability and other characteristics of wind for more than a decade. In 2006, the company bought a few computers to test the benefits of matching wind forecasts to potential sites for turbines. When customers liked the results, Vestas scaled up to a supercomputer in 2008. It has upgraded the technology and added a team of meteorologists to help it adapt climate models.That means the company can, for example, predict how the wind is likely to behave over any 10-square-meter patch on Earth during the 20-year life of a wind turbine. By plugging in other variables like the price of a turbine, the cost of renting the land and the tariff a customer would be paid for electricity, Vestas can quickly provide a buyer with the probable financial return for a given location.The models also allow the company to figure out where the turbines should be placed, and which of its turbines would produce the most revenue. Like its rivals, Vestas now designs turbines for places with light winds as well as heavy ones. It can identify calm periods when the turbines can be shut down for maintenance with the smallest loss of revenue.In the case of Fosen, that meant the company was able to help Statkraft, the Norwegian state-owned utility building the project, save money and salvage the venture. It offered more powerful turbines that were not yet on the market, meaning Statkraft could buy fewer devices and save on installation costs for Fosen, which is capable of producing a gigawatt of electricity \u2014 comparable to the output of some nuclear power plants \u2014 when the wind is blowing hard enough.\u201cThey are very well advanced,\u201d said Espen Hagstrom, technical manager for Statkraft. \u201cMaybe they are the best.\u201dDespite the advantages, Vestas must still navigate industry turbulence, from uncertainty over the future of government subsidies to the volatility of oil and gas prices.\u201cThe focus is on staying ahead,\u201d said Mr. Runevad, the chief executive of Vestas. \u201cWe are very much focused on that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How One Family\u2019s Deep Pockets Helped Reshape Donald Trump\u2019s Campaign", "Date": "2016-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast week, as Donald J. Trump endured one of the most tumultuous stretches of his presidential campaign, a few longtime allies in New York conservative circles met for dinner and a drink. As the evening progressed, the conversation turned to an inevitable topic: What would it take to give Mr. Trump his best shot at winning?Mr. Bannon\u2019s ascension on Wednesday \u2014 urged on Mr. Trump by Ms. Mercer, among others \u2014 shows how a cadre of strategists, \u201csuper PACs\u201d and political organizations quietly nurtured by her family have emerged to play a pivotal role in Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.Over more than half a decade, Ms. Mercer\u2019s father, the New York investor Robert Mercer, has carved an idiosyncratic path through conservative politics, spending tens of millions of dollars to outflank his own party\u2019s consultant class and unnerve its established powers. His fortune has financed think tanks and insurgent candidates, super PACs and media watchdogs, lobbying groups and grass-roots organizations.Mr. Bannon has worked particularly closely with the family in recent years.\u201cI think they have complete confidence, and rightly so, in Steve Bannon\u2019s decisions and what he brings to the table politically,\u201d Mr. Bossie said. \u201cHe has been smart and successful in running these different political operations. And those things have come to the Mercers\u2019 attention.\u201dPeople who donated to establishment Republican candidates in the primary season are more likely to give money to Hillary Clinton than to Donald J. Trump.Like many elite donors, the Mercers shun mainstream media attention \u2014 even while financing alternative outlets that provide content for conservative activists. That includes not just Breitbart, but also the self-described watchdog organization Media Research Center and the Government Accountability Institute, home to Peter Schweizer, the author of \u201cClinton Cash,\u201d a book examining the Clinton family philanthropies. (Mr. Bannon co-founded the institute and Ms. Mercer, 42, has served on its board; she also co-produced a documentary based on the book and released last month, just before the Democratic National Convention.)They have given to libertarian organizations, such as the Cato Institute, and political organizations like the Club for Growth, which spends millions of dollars each election cycle in Republican primaries, hoping to promote orthodox conservative policies on taxes and spending. The Mercers are also significant donors to the sprawling political network overseen by the political activists Charles G. and David H. Koch, which is also libertarian-leaning.But unlike the Koch brothers, who remained neutral in the Republican primary and have said their organizations will focus on congressional races this fall, the Mercers were deeply involved in the Republican nominating battle this year. And they have shown a taste for more bare-knuckled and populist politics than most of Mr. Mercer\u2019s fellow hedge fund magnates.The family originally backed Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a more traditional conservative but one who, like Mr. Trump, is disliked by much of the party establishment. During the early phase of the campaign, Mr. Mercer donated $13 million to a super PAC supporting Mr. Cruz. In doing so, he broke with many peers in the elite donor world, who looked to candidates like Jeb Bush or Senator Marco Rubio of Florida.The Mercers maintained close control over the group\u2019s purse strings, installing Ms. Conway to oversee the group and coordinate with several other pro-Cruz groups, an unusual move for a super PAC. During the Republican primary, the group ran ads questioning Mr. Trump\u2019s conservative credentials, hoping to outflank Mr. Trump.In an extraordinary rebuke, the Mercers issued a rare public statement, calling themselves \u201cprofoundly disappointed\u201d in Mr. Cruz.In late June, the Mercer-financed super PAC quietly re-formed as Make America Number One, now a pro-Trump entity. Mr. Bossie, a longtime conservative activist who has produced documentaries about the Clinton family and illegal immigration, is leading the group, which is likely to raise more money from the Mercers to pay for attacks on Hillary Clinton.Maggie Haberman and Jonathan Martin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Secret Ledger in Ukraine Lists Cash for Donald Trump\u2019s Campaign Chief", "Date": "2016-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 On a leafy side street off Independence Square in Kiev is an office used for years by Donald J. Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, when he consulted for Ukraine\u2019s ruling political party. His furniture and personal items were still there as recently as May.Handwritten ledgers show $12.7 million in undisclosed cash payments designated for Mr. Manafort from Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s pro-Russian political party from 2007 to 2012, according to Ukraine\u2019s newly formed National Anti-Corruption Bureau. Investigators assert that the disbursements were part of an illegal off-the-books system whose recipients also included election officials.Anti-corruption officials there say the payments earmarked for Mr. Manafort, previously unreported, are a focus of their investigation, though they have yet to determine if he actually received the cash. While Mr. Manafort is not a target in the separate inquiry of offshore activities, prosecutors say he must have realized the implications of his financial dealings.\u201cHe understood what was happening in Ukraine,\u201d said Vitaliy Kasko, a former senior official with the general prosecutor\u2019s office in Kiev. \u201cIt would have to be clear to any reasonable person that the Yanukovych clan, when it came to power, was engaged in corruption.\u201dMr. Kasko added, \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to imagine a person would look at this and think, \u2018Everything is all right.\u2019\u201dMr. Manafort did not respond to interview requests or written questions from The New York Times. But his lawyer, Richard A. Hibey, said Mr. Manafort had not received \u201cany such cash payments\u201d described by the anti-corruption officials.Mr. Hibey also disputed Mr. Kasko\u2019s suggestion that Mr. Manafort might have countenanced corruption or been involved with people who took part in illegal activities.\u201cThese are suspicions, and probably heavily politically tinged ones,\u201d said Mr. Hibey, a member of the Washington law firm Miller & Chevalier. \u201cIt is difficult to respect any kind of allegation of the sort being made here to smear someone when there is no proof and we deny there ever could be such proof.\u201dThe developments in Ukraine underscore the risky nature of the international consulting that has been a staple of Mr. Manafort\u2019s business since the 1980s, when he went to work for the Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos. Before joining Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign this spring, Mr. Manafort\u2019s most prominent recent client was Mr. Yanukovych, who \u2014 like Mr. Marcos \u2014 was deposed in a popular uprising.Before he fled to Russia two years ago, Mr. Yanukovych and his Party of Regions relied heavily on the advice of Mr. Manafort and his firm, who helped them win several elections. During that period, Mr. Manafort never registered as a foreign agent with the United States Justice Department \u2014 as required of those seeking to influence American policy on behalf of foreign clients \u2014 although one of his subcontractors did.It is unclear if Mr. Manafort\u2019s activities necessitated registering. If they were limited to advising the Party of Regions in Ukraine, he probably would not have had to. But he also worked to burnish his client\u2019s image in the West and helped Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s administration draft a report defending its prosecution of his chief rival, Yulia V. Tymoshenko, in 2012.Whatever the case, absent a registration \u2014 which requires disclosure of how much the registrant is being paid and by whom \u2014 Mr. Manafort\u2019s compensation has remained a mystery. However, a cache of documents discovered after the fall of Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s government may provide some answers.The papers, known in Ukraine as the \u201cblack ledger,\u201d are a chicken-scratch of Cyrillic covering about 400 pages taken from books once kept in a third-floor room in the former Party of Regions headquarters on Lipskaya Street in Kiev. The room held two safes stuffed with $100 bills, said Taras V. Chornovil, a former party leader who was also a recipient of the money at times. He said in an interview that he had once received $10,000 in a \u201cwad of cash\u201d for a trip to Europe.\u201cThis was our cash,\u201d he said, adding that he had left the party in part over concerns about off-the-books activity. \u201cThey had it on the table, stacks of money, and they had lists of who to pay.\u201dThe National Anti-Corruption Bureau, which obtained the ledger, said in a statement that Mr. Manafort\u2019s name appeared 22 times in the documents over five years, with payments totaling $12.7 million. The purpose of the payments is not clear. Nor is the outcome, since the handwritten entries cannot be cross-referenced against banking records, and the signatures for receipt have not yet been verified.\u201cPaul Manafort is among those names on the list of so-called \u2018black accounts of the Party of Regions,\u2019 which the detectives of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine are investigating,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe emphasize that the presence of P. Manafort\u2019s name in the list does not mean that he actually got the money, because the signatures that appear in the column of recipients could belong to other people.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a very vivid example of how political parties are financed in Ukraine,\u201d said Daria N. Kaleniuk, the executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center in Kiev. \u201cIt represents the very dirty cash economy in Ukraine.\u201dWhile working in Ukraine, Mr. Manafort had also positioned himself to profit from business deals that benefited from connections he had gained through his political consulting. One of them, according to court filings, involved a network of offshore companies that government investigators and independent journalists in Ukraine have said was used to launder public money and assets purportedly stolen by cronies of the government.The network comprised shell companies whose ultimate owners were shielded by the secrecy laws of the offshore jurisdictions where they were registered, including the British Virgin Islands, Belize and the Seychelles.In a recent interview, Serhiy V. Gorbatyuk, Ukraine\u2019s special prosecutor for high-level corruption cases, pointed to an open file on his desk containing paperwork for one of the shell companies, Milltown Corporate Services Ltd., which played a central role in the state\u2019s purchase of two oil derricks for $785 million, or about double what they were said to be worth.\u201cThis,\u201d he said, \u201cwas an offshore used often by Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s entourage.\u201dThe role of the offshore companies in business dealings involving Mr. Manafort came to light because of court filings in the Cayman Islands and in a federal court in Virginia related to an investment fund, Pericles Emerging Markets. Mr. Manafort and several partners started the fund in 2007, and its major backer was Mr. Deripaska, the Russian mogul, to whom the State Department has refused to issue a visa, apparently because of allegations linking him to Russian organized crime, a charge he has denied.Mr. Deripaska agreed to commit as much as $100 million to Pericles so it could buy assets in Ukraine and Eastern Europe, including a regional cable television and communications company called Black Sea Cable. But corporate records and court filings show that it was hardly a straightforward transaction.The Black Sea Cable assets were controlled by a rotating cast of offshore companies that led back to the Yanukovych network, including, at various times, Milltown Corporate Services and two other companies well known to law enforcement officials, Monohold A.G. and Intrahold A.G. Those two companies won inflated contracts with a state-run agricultural company, and also acquired a business center in Kiev with a helicopter pad on the roof that would ease Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s commute from his country estate to the presidential offices.Mr. Deripaska would later say he invested $18.9 million in Pericles in 2008 to complete the acquisition of Black Sea Cable. But the planned purchase \u2014 including the question of who ended up with the Black Sea assets \u2014 has since become the subject of a dispute between Mr. Deripaska and Mr. Manafort.In 2014, Mr. Deripaska filed a legal action in a Cayman Islands court seeking to recover his investment in Pericles, which is now defunct. He also said he had paid about $7.3 million in management fees to the fund over two years. Mr. Deripaska did not respond to requests for comment.Mr. Manafort\u2019s lawyer, Mr. Hibey, disputed the account of the Black Sea Cable deal contained in Mr. Deripaska\u2019s Cayman filings, and said the Russian oligarch had overseen details of the final transaction involving the acquisition. He denied that Mr. Manafort had received management fees from Pericles during its operation, but said that one of Mr. Manafort\u2019s partners, Rick Gates, who is also working on the Trump campaign, had received a \u201cnominal\u201d sum.Court papers indicate that Pericles\u2019 only deal involved Black Sea Cable.At Mr. Manafort\u2019s old office on Sofiivska Street, new tenants said they had discovered several curiosities apparently left behind, including a knee X-ray signed by Mr. Yanukovych, possibly referring to tennis matches played between Mr. Manafort and Mr. Yanukovych, who had spoken publicly of a knee ailment affecting his game.There was another item with Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s autograph: a piece of white paper bearing a rough sketch of Independence Square, the site of the 2014 uprising that drove him from power.Andrew E. Kramer reported from Kiev, and Mike McIntire and Barry Meier from New York. Steven Lee Myers contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}

Grainy images of undocumented immigrants being escorted to a waiting patrol car by a police officer. A handcuffed suspect who came into the United States from somewhere else.The shadowy images soak the screen in Donald J. Trump\u2019s first television ad in his general election fight against Hillary Clinton. That dystopian view of America, overrun by people looking to cheat the system and threaten its security, offers a grim image of life under a second Clinton presidency.The ad stands in contrast to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s television spots, dozens of which have been aired since she declared her candidacy. They are gauzy and soft, looking to make her more appealing to voters and paint a portrait of melting-pot America.But Mr. Trump\u2019s entrance into the ad wars of 2016, after months of ceding the television airwaves to Mrs. Clinton and the groups supporting her, will be dwarfed by the ads being run by the Clinton campaign in each state. In total, the Clinton campaign is spending $12.9 million in Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania, compared with Mr. Trump\u2019s $4.84 million in reservations in the same states across three weeks, according to the ad tracking firm Kantar Media.Mr. Trump, who has shunned conventional campaign tactics throughout his presidential bid, has been off the airwaves since before he clinched the Republican nomination in May, but has been backed by nearly $10 million in ads from Rebuilding America Now, the leading \u201csuper PAC\u201d supporting his candidacy, and several million dollars more from the National Rifle Association.Mr. Trump had sought to delay airing spots until after Labor Day, often boasting that he did not need them to connect with his supporters. But the ad buy is a tacit admission from his campaign that his recent decline in public polling is due, at least in part, to the fact that he has been swamped by advertising sponsored by Mrs. Clinton and her backers.Many Republicans cheered the change in approach, hoping that it would stem his decline in the polls and also help candidates in state and local races. But they cautioned that if the buy was not followed by a significant investment in advertising that extended until November, it would most likely be insufficient to bolster his support.\u201cMaybe what\u2019s most important is that this isn\u2019t an isolated stunt, but rather the start of a prolonged traditional media campaign,\u201d said Nick Everhart, the president of Content Creative Media, a Republican advertising firm.Those concerns may be warranted. So far, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign has yet to make reservations for airtime beyond August. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign has reserved time into early September, totaling more $18.1 million, according to Kantar Media. And Priorities USA, the primary group supporting Mrs. Clinton, has put almost $80 million behind ads through the election.Mr. Trump\u2019s aversion to television spending has been one of the biggest curiosities of his campaign. Mr. Trump waited until a month before voting began in the primary races to start airing television spots, instead banking on the free exposure he had received from seemingly endless interviews. His campaign announced this month that it raised $82 million in July for his campaign and Republican Party committees, leading many in the party to believe an advertising onslaught was imminent.The Clinton campaign has already spent $55.8 million on television advertising so far this cycle, with $32.3 million of that going to local broadcast television in nine states: Colorado, Florida, Iowa, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia, according to Kantar Media.Regardless of the recent additions, the advertising spending is notably less than the 2012 election on both sides. At this point in 2012, President Obama\u2019s re-election campaign had already spent more than $136 million, and Mitt Romney\u2019s campaign $55 million. Restore Our Future, the super PAC supporting Mr. Romney, had also spent an additional $15 million in support by this point, according to Kantar Media.Not all Republicans see Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to hold back on spending as a mistake.\u201cThere is very little evidence that paid advertising has made any difference in this presidential election to date,\u201d said Neil Newhouse, a Republican who was the lead pollster on Mr. Romney\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign.Steve Murphy, a Democratic ad-maker and strategist, disagreed, pointing to recent polling.\u201cHillary Clinton has a lead in most swing states out of proportion with her national lead, demonstrating the huge success of her advertising campaign,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. \u201cThe race should be closer in swing states.\u201dHe added that in Colorado, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Virginia, states with large suburban communities, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s lead among college-educated women had strengthened.Rebuilding America Now, the pro-Trump group, has purchased time in the core group of states that the Trump campaign views as necessary for victory \u2014 Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania \u2014 and it plans to be on the air through Election Day, said Laurance Gay, the group\u2019s main strategist.But Mr. Trump has forfeited months that are generally seen as crucial to shaping the way the electorate views him, a mistake Mr. Romney made in 2012, when he emerged from his primary race starved for campaign donations and unable to sustain an advertising offensive. Mr. Obama\u2019s campaign and Priorities USA, which supported him in that race, systematically ripped into Mr. Romney from May through September, and he never recovered.Mr. Newhouse, recalling his campaign\u2019s struggles that year, said that Mr. Trump might be better off saving his spending for other uses.\u201cOur experience is, paid advertising late in a presidential campaign, you\u2019ve got to wonder how valuable it is in moving a message forward for a campaign,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Envisioning Bitcoin\u2019s Technology at the Heart of Global Finance", "Date": "2016-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA new report from the World Economic Forum predicts that the underlying technology introduced by the virtual currency Bitcoin will come to occupy a central place in the global financial system.\u201cRather than to stay at the margins of the finance industry blockchain will become the beating heart of it,\u201d the head of financial services industries at the World Economic Forum, Giancarlo Bruno, said in a statement released with the report.The blockchain originally referred to the database where all Bitcoin transactions are recorded and stored.Unlike existing financial ledgers or databases used by banks and other institutions, the blockchain is updated and maintained not by a single company or government. Instead it is run by a network of users. It\u2019s akin to the way Wikipedia is maintained by users around the globe.Initially, bank executives shied away from endorsing Bitcoin because it had been used for drugs and crime. Now, however, many have focused on ways to create blockchains without using Bitcoins for transactions in any way.This is attractive because blockchains \u2014 or \u201cdistributed ledgers,\u201d as they are often described \u2014 could offer a new way to move money and track transactions across borders and other networks in a more secure, transparent and effective way than the current system.Distributed ledgers are often viewed as most attractive to industries with businesses that lack a central institution they can trust to keep their records.The World Economic Forum report notes that most developments are likely to happen behind the scenes. So consumers won\u2019t see the changes to infrastructure, but the changes could lead to cheaper and faster financial services. The report says the technology could help improve both mainstream transactions, like global payments and stock trading, and lesser-known areas like trade finance and contingent convertible bonds.The 130-page report from the forum is the product of a year of research and five gatherings of executives from several major institutions, including JPMorgan Chase, Visa, MasterCard and BlackRock.The report estimates that 80 percent of banks around the world could start distributed ledger projects by next year. Large central banks are also studying how the blockchain will alter the way money moves around the globe.The World Economic Forum report suggests that it will take some time for such problems to be worked out. In addition to the technology issues, the report says that the industry will have to work with governments to create standard rules and laws to govern transactions.The report does not make a single mention of Bitcoin. That mirrors the pronouncements from banks, which have often said that they can harness distributed ledgers without using existing virtual currencies. Rather, these ledgers would be run by groups of institutions that want to keep common records.Just this week, 15 global banks, including Wells Fargo and UBS, said that they had completed a prototype of a distributed ledger that could track trade financing around the globe \u2014 providing a single record for a series of scattered, hard-to-track transactions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Medicare Law to Notify Patients of Loophole in Nursing Home Coverage", "Date": "2016-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In November, after a bad fall, 85-year-old Elizabeth Cannon was taken to a hospital outside Philadelphia for six and a half days of \u201cobservation,\u201d followed by nearly five months at a nearby nursing home for rehabilitation and skilled nursing care. The cost: more than $40,000.The hospital insisted that Ms. Cannon had never been formally admitted there as an inpatient, so under federal rules, Medicare would not pay for her nursing home stay. The money would have to come from her pocket.\u201cIt was extremely distressful to my mother, who was frugal her whole life,\u201d said Cynthia Morgan of Chadds Ford, Pa., Ms. Cannon\u2019s daughter. \u201cShe asked, \u2018How can I pay into Medicare for so many years, and now Medicare won\u2019t help pay for my care?\u201d\u2019 Ms. Cannon died in April.Time spent under observation does not count toward the three days, even though the patient may spend five or six nights in a hospital bed and receive extensive hospital services, including tests, treatment and medications ordered by a doctor.Under the new law, the notice must be provided to \u201ceach individual who receives observation services as an outpatient\u201d at a hospital for more than 24 hours. Medicare officials estimate that hospitals will have to issue 1.4 million notices a year.\u201cThe financial consequences of observation stays can be devastating for seniors,\u201d said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine and the chairwoman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging.Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, the chief sponsor of the Senate version of the legislation, said it would \u201csave seniors from the sticker shock that comes after they are discharged from the hospital and realize that Medicare will not cover the cost of care in a skilled nursing facility.\u201dThe median cost for a private room in a nursing home is roughly $92,000 a year, according to a survey by Genworth Financial, an insurance company. Medicare covers up to 100 days of skilled nursing home care at a time.The text of the standard \u201cMedicare outpatient observation notice\u201d is subject to approval by the White House Office of Management and Budget. In its current form, the notice to beneficiaries says: \u201cYou\u2019re a hospital outpatient receiving observation services. You are not an inpatient.\u201d And it explains that Medicare will cover care in a skilled nursing home only if the beneficiary has had an inpatient hospital stay of at least three days.Patients can then consult their doctors and may ask to be reclassified as inpatients.Hospitals have found themselves in a squeeze. They increased their use of \u201cobservation status\u201d in response to close scrutiny of their billing practices by Medicare auditors \u2014 private companies hired by the government to review claims. In many cases, these companies challenged decisions by doctors to admit patients to a hospital, saying the services should have been provided on an outpatient basis. The auditors then tried to recover what they described as improper payments.Doctors and hospitals said the auditors were like bounty hunters because they were allowed to keep a percentage of the funds they recovered.But patients now will at least be better informed. The Senate Finance Committee explained the reason for the law this way:\u201cThe number of Medicare beneficiaries receiving outpatient observation care over the last several years has been steadily increasing. Some beneficiaries are surprised to learn that although having received treatment overnight in a hospital bed, the beneficiary was never formally admitted as an inpatient but was instead a hospital outpatient.\u201dFederal officials acknowledged that Medicare beneficiaries sometimes had to pay more as outpatients under observation than they would have paid if they had been formally admitted to the hospital and received the same services as inpatients.The administration issued rules last week to carry out the new law. The purpose, it said, is \u201cto inform beneficiaries of costs they might not otherwise be aware of.\u201d\u201cEven if you stay in a hospital overnight, you might still be considered an outpatient,\u201d the administration said in a publication for beneficiaries.Consumer advocates and nursing homes support the new requirement.\u201cMedicare beneficiaries are spending more and more time in the hospital without being formally admitted,\u201d said Joyce A. Rogers, a senior vice president of AARP, the lobby for older Americans, adding that this \u201ccan expose beneficiaries to unexpectedly high out-of-pocket costs amounting to thousands of dollars.\u201dMark Parkinson, the president and chief executive of the American Health Care Association, a trade group for nursing homes, said, \u201cPatients often have no idea what their status is in a hospital.\u201d Observation stays impose a \u201cfinancial burden on seniors,\u201d he said, and increase the likelihood that they will have to turn to programs like Medicaid, the federal-state program for low-income people.\u201cThe new law is an important first step, but Congress and the administration need to do more to protect beneficiaries,\u201d said Judith A. Stein, the executive director of the nonprofit Center for Medicare Advocacy.Under the law, hospitals can still keep Medicare patients in observation status, and some of the patients will be responsible for nursing home costs. Twenty-four senators and more than 120 House members are supporting bipartisan legislation to address that concern. Under that bill, time in a hospital under observation would count toward the three-day inpatient stay required for Medicare coverage of nursing home care.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.E., the 124-Year-Old Software Start-Up", "Date": "2016-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt may not qualify as a lightning-bolt eureka moment, but Jeffrey R. Immelt, chief executive of General Electric, recalls the June day in 2009 that got him thinking. He was speaking with G.E. scientists about new jet engines they were building, laden with sensors to generate a trove of data from every flight \u2014 but to what end?That data could someday be as valuable as the machinery itself, if not more so. But G.E. couldn\u2019t make use of it.But in 2011, G.E. also quietly opened a software center in San Ramon, Calif., 24 miles east of San Francisco, across the bay.Today one of San Ramon\u2019s most important projects is to build a computer operating system, but on an industrial scale \u2014 a Microsoft Windows or Google Android for factories and industrial equipment. The project is central to G.E.\u2019s drive to become what Mr. Immelt says will be a \u201ctop 10 software company\u201d by 2020.Silicon Valley veterans are skeptical.Many industries see digital threats, of course. Yet the scope of the challenge is magnified at G.E., a 124-year-old company and the nation\u2019s largest manufacturer, with more than 300,000 employees worldwide. Employees companywide have been making pilgrimages to San Ramon for technology briefings, but also to soak in the culture. Their marching orders are to try to adapt the digital wizardry and hurry-up habits of Silicon Valley to G.E.\u2019s world of industrial manufacturing.6 PhotosG.E.\u2019s success or failure over the next decade, Mr. Immelt says, depends on this transformation. He calls it \u201cprobably the most important thing I\u2019ve worked on in my career.\u201dApparently, there is no Plan B. \u201cIt\u2019s this or bust,\u201d he said.The march of digital technology \u2014 mainly inexpensive sensors, powerful computing and clever software \u2014 into the industrial world has been underway for years under the guise of \u201cthe internet of things\u201d or \u201cthe industrial internet.\u201d It is the next battlefield as companies fight to develop the dominant software layer that connects the machines.It promises to be a huge market for new products, improved service and efficiency gains in industries like energy, transportation and health care. By 2020, the industrial internet market will reach $225 billion, G.E. executives predicted in a recent meeting with analysts.So far, a major application has been predictive maintenance. Software analyzes the data generated by a machine to identify early warning signals that it needs repair, before it breaks down.The data volumes are exploding as machines new and old spawn sensors. By 2020, G.E. estimates that the data flowing off its machines in use will jump a hundredfold. That should enable far more detailed analysis, giving G.E. a chance to sell its customers not machines but \u201cbusiness outcomes,\u201d like fuel savings. Mr. Immelt sees this as a move up the industrial food chain.Yet all of this exposes G.E. to new competition beyond its traditional rivals like Rockwell Automation, Siemens and United Technologies. Tech giants, including Amazon, Cisco, Google, IBM and Microsoft also have their eye on the industrial internet market, as do a bevy of start-ups.There is precedent for trouble in other industries, of course. Google and Facebook transformed media and advertising, Amazon redefined retailing, and Uber applied an entirely new business model to taxis, which hadn\u2019t changed much in generations.\u201cThe real danger is that the data and analysis becomes worth more than the installed equipment itself,\u201d said Karim R. Lakhani, a professor at the Harvard Business School. \u201cG.E. has no choice but to try to do that itself.\u201dUntil this year, Darren Haas hadn\u2019t thought about G.E., certainly not working there. To him, G.E. meant little more than than kitchen appliances and light bulbs. \u201cI had no idea,\u201d Mr. Haas said.But he was intrigued after he met with Harel Kodesh, an expert in mobile and cloud computing who led teams at Microsoft and VMware, a maker of data-center software. Less than two years ago, Mr. Kodesh joined G.E., and he is now chief technology officer of GE Digital.That someone of Mr. Kodesh\u2019s caliber was a G.E. convert got Mr. Haas\u2019s attention. Then, Mr. Haas started grasping the role that G.E. equipment plays across the economy \u2014 in transportation, in hospitals \u2014 \u201ca whole world,\u201d he said. \u201cI found that really, really compelling.\u201dThe other thing Mr. Haas, 41, found appealing was the big computing challenge that lies ahead for the company. In May, he joined G.E. from Apple, where he was a member of the founding team at Siri, the voice-based digital assistant start-up Apple acquired in 2010. When he left Apple, Mr. Haas was head of cloud engineering, managing the computing engine behind Siri, iTunes and iCloud.At GE Digital, Mr. Haas has a similar title, head of platform cloud engineering, but in a different setting. He describes his job as applying modern software technology \u2014 machine learning, artificial intelligence and cloud computing \u2014 to the industrial arena. \u201cI\u2019ve got my work cut out for me,\u201d he said.Mr. Haas is working on the centerpiece of G.E.\u2019s software strategy, a product called Predix. Its evolution mirrors G.E.\u2019s software ambitions.Predix began as little more than a brand of software used by G.E. to service the gear it sells. One showcase use was in jet engines to do predictive maintenance, saving downtime. Around 2013, William Ruh, a former Cisco Systems executive brought in to put together the San Ramon software center, started expanding Predix to other G.E. industrial businesses.But that soon felt too small. The issue was \u201coutside disrupters,\u201d Mr. Ruh said, citing the online lodging start-up Airbnb as an example of rivals that can appear seemingly out of nowhere and that \u201cbring greater productivity \u2014 but don\u2019t own the assets they sell.\u201d G.E., Mr. Ruh notes, is the ultimate big-asset company.The other threat was rising interest among tech companies to take their internet connectivity expertise and try to apply it to industrial businesses. To get ahead of all this, G.E. reimagined Predix as a cloud-based operating system for industrial applications.Mr. Kodesh leads that effort. He ticks off the looming competitors: Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft and others. \u201cThose companies are going to encroach on the territory,\u201d Mr. Kodesh said. \u201cAre we going to capitulate, or build something like Predix?\u201dThe basic idea is that G.E. and outside software developers will write programs to run on Predix. This software might, for instance, monitor the health and fine-tune the operation of equipment like oil-field rigs and wind-farm turbines, improving performance, reducing wear and adapting to changing environmental conditions. It amounts to software delivering the equivalent of personalized medicine for machines.Like any other computer operating system, Predix aims to take the complexity out of writing programs, so more people can create them. And while the instincts of the industrial world are proprietary, G.E. is following an open-source model with Predix, providing a basic design, but one open to outside contributors \u2014 more like Android from Google than Windows from Microsoft.Predix, Mr. Kodesh said, will be improved using the software equivalent of Lego blocks. \u201cSome will be G.E.\u2019s, and some will be made by third-party developers,\u201d he said.G.E. is betting that its deep knowledge of industry will give it an edge in this software arms race. The stakes for this kind of programming can be high.For a regular consumer using the internet, a misfiring algorithm in the software \u2014 \u201ca false positive\u201d \u2014 might mean a person sees an irrelevant online ad, or a bad Amazon book suggestion or Netflix movie recommendation, Mr. Kodesh said. Useless, perhaps, but not necessarily costly. But a false positive that prompts an airline to take a jet engine off the wing, Mr. Kodesh said, is a $100,000 mistake.\u201cWe really do need to have different technology, different algorithms and a different cloud, than in the consumer internet,\u201d he said.G.E. has set an ambitious target for Predix. It hopes to attract $100 million in orders this year, on its way to $4 billion in revenue by 2020. By then, the company forecasts that its total digital business \u2014 more than 90 percent of it software \u2014 may reach as much as $15 billion, up from $6 billion now.For Predix to reach its potential, though, G.E. needs outside programmers to write software for it. The company, with its deep pockets, can start the software-writing parade, but will others follow?This will be a major test. And G.E.\u2019s campaign to build an industrial operating system and create a flourishing ecosystem of software for it is just getting underway in earnest.In late July, G.E. hosted a Predix conference in Las Vegas, which attracted 1,200 software developers. Such developer gatherings are part of the playbook of every major software company but unusual for an industrial corporation.G.E. has some built-in advantages. Its installed base is huge. For example, the company says more than a third of the world\u2019s electricity is generated on G.E. equipment. It can make progress simply by winning over the aircraft makers, oil companies, hospitals and utilities that now depend on G.E. machinery.G.E. is starting to attract a developer following. Tata Consultancy Services, for one, says it now has 500 programmers designing and developing Predix applications for customers in the electric-utility, aviation and health care industries. G.E. also promotes partnerships with Infosys, Wipro and Capgemini to help business write Predix software.When he joined in 2011, Mr. Ruh had no illusions that making software a strength at a heavy-industry company would be easy. At the time, he told Mr. Immelt that would be \u201ca 10-year journey,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of that journey.\u201dPart of that is an effort to change an engineering culture that stretches back generations. \u201cIf G.E. is truly going to be a digital-industrial company, we can\u2019t be separate here,\u201d Mr. Ruh said of his software division. Digital \u201ctools and habits\u201d need to be embedded \u201cin how people do their jobs,\u201d he said.In its factory in Greenville, S.C., G.E. produces both giant power generators and evidence that this metamorphosis might work.The three-story building is crowded with immense cranes and milling, grinding and welding machines, overseen by manufacturing engineers and technicians. The finishing touches are being put on one of G.E.\u2019s new gas turbines.It looks like the business end of a rocket ship lying on its side, a gleaming steel dynamo at rest. It weighs 950,000 pounds. It fires up at nearly 2,900 degrees Fahrenheit, and it can generate enough electricity to supply more than 500,000 households.The gas turbine was brought to market in half the typical five years. That kind of accelerated product development is a performance that G.E. hopes to replicate across its industrial businesses. And it is a story of changes in design and manufacturing practices made possible by digital technology.John Lammas, the 56-year-old vice president for power generation engineering, started his working career 40 years ago, on the shop floor of a Rolls-Royce jet engine factory in Birmingham, England. He has been with G.E. for 31 years, moving up the ranks of the company\u2019s jet engine and power turbine divisions.\u201cI\u2019m an old mechanical guy,\u201d he said. But a couple of years ago, he issued an edict: no more paper drawings.In the past, a model of a new part would be made and then converted to detailed blueprints running to 70 pages or more. These would then be physically sent to G.E. manufacturing engineers and outside suppliers to begin setting up the tooling, casting and cutting for the part.This prototype-and-blueprint routine took up to eight weeks. Now, engineers use 3-D computer models, skip the prototype step and instantly send the models electronically.This goes a step beyond computer-aided design, which is commonplace. In Greenville, the designers are for the first time linked directly with manufacturers and suppliers in real time, in what G.E. calls a \u201cdigital thread.\u201d This means they can collaborate in ways that have changed the work process while making it more likely that problems or defects are spotted sooner.Traditionally, one set of engineers designed a part, and only then passed it on to manufacturing. If a problem arose on the supplier side, the design was kicked back and the process started over. \u201cJobs are combining in this digital world,\u201d Mr. Lammas said.Greenville\u2019s own equipment has been a Predix guinea pig. The machinery and factory were retrofitted with data-generating sensors and the software. Matt Krause, the plant manager, said that last winter, when a snowstorm shut the factory for a day, the sensor network detected that the plant had consumed 1,000 pounds of argon, an inert gas used in coatings for parts. The leak was fixed, saving $350,000 a year.\u201cWe can see things we never did before,\u201d Mr. Krause said. Over all, 60 of 200 steps in design and production have been automated or eliminated, reducing work time by 530,000 hours over three years, G.E. estimates.Not all the start-up ideas that G.E. is trying to breed translate comfortably to heavy industry. Lean proponents urge companies to come up with \u201cminimum viable products,\u201d particularly test versions of software programs. But no one wants a minimum viable jet engine or power generator.Yet in Greenville, engineers in the design stages are encouraged to move faster in smaller steps, conduct more experiments, and be willing to fail and try again. It amounts to a sea change in the engineering culture of heavy industry.\u201cAs an engineer, not getting it right the first time, I find painful,\u201d said Bill Byrne, an engineering manager. \u201cIt\u2019s uncomfortable. But it\u2019s been incredibly liberating.\u201dThe old ways, said Mr. Lammas, the engineering chief, had merit. Each step and rule was logical on its own. But the emphasis on flawless execution and perfection fostered a fear of failure. \u201cOvercoming that culture was probably the biggest challenge,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Grant. President Bill Clinton was known for glad-handing his way through shops and restaurants, attending parties with stars like Carly Simon, going to clambakes with William Styron, and ingratiating himself in ways that have created enduring good will.Far from a sense of Clinton fatigue, in this place there is nostalgia for a time when a vacationing president actively participated in the local social milieu.Mr. Obama has come to Martha\u2019s Vineyard every summer during his presidency except in 2012, when he was campaigning for re-election. But unlike the Clintons, the Obamas have largely limited their socializing to a small circle of family members and friends.Mr. Obama and Michelle Obama, the first lady, have gone out for dinner almost every night since arriving here on Aug. 6. And on Sunday, they attended an annual birthday party for the civil rights activist Vernon E. Jordan Jr. at Lola\u2019s, an Oak Bluffs restaurant specializing in Southern seafood.But when the Obamas go out to dinner, they often enter through a back door. Fellow diners describe them as unfailingly gracious patrons who apologize for the intrusiveness of their Secret Service detail.There is a yearning among some here, however, for more from the Obamas. Many longtime residents recall the Clintons attending parties given by island socialites. And when the couple arrived at a restaurant for dinner, Mr. Clinton would often work the room. Mr. Clinton also made stops for ice cream and waded into crowds, something the Obamas have largely avoided.\u201cI am a great admirer of President Obama, and I certainly respect his need for privacy on the Vineyard,\u201d said Rose Styron, Mr. Styron\u2019s wife and a poet, widely seen as one of the doyennes of the island\u2019s elite social set.And yet the Obamas have never attended a party at Mrs. Styron\u2019s house, she said, while the Clintons came many times, and also visited the homes of many of her friends.\u201cWe enjoyed our times here with the Clintons immensely,\u201d said Mrs. Styron, whose husband, now deceased, wrote \u201cSophie\u2019s Choice\u201d and other works.The Obamas have found other social circles in the section of the island they frequent, Oak Bluffs, long a retreat for wealthy African-Americans.Get the latest national and state polls on the presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.The Clintons vacationed on the Vineyard most years of Mr. Clinton\u2019s presidency. In 1995, worried that spending his vacation among the rich and famous made him appear out of touch, he vacationed outside Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming so he could be shown camping.There is some hope here that if Mrs. Clinton wins the presidency, the Clintons and their highly social ways will return.And that has made tickets to this week\u2019s fund-raisers particularly popular.About 60 guests, each paying between $10,000 and $33,400, attended the party on Monday hosted by Mr. Goldberg, which benefited the Hillary Victory Fund. Attendees were treated to breathtaking views of the Atlantic Ocean, champagne and a raw bar. Hundreds of people paying $2,700 each, with some doling out much more, are expected at a fund-raiser on Saturday hosted by Frank Biondi, an investment banker, and his wife, Carol, that Mrs. Clinton is expected to attend.And Lady Lynn Forester de Rothschild is holding a fund-raiser that night for a few dozen guests who will pay up to $100,000 per couple. Other fund-raisers, including one attended by the dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov, have already been held.Those selling tickets said they had never seen such interest.\u201cWe have sold many more tickets than we would have ever dreamed was possible,\u201d said Betsy Sheerr, a longtime summer resident and Democratic fund-raiser. \u201cThe enthusiasm all over the island is palpable.\u201d\u201cPeople love giving to a winner,\u201d said Ann Brown, another longtime Democratic fund-raiser here. \u201cIt\u2019s suddenly become incredibly easy raising money for Hillary.\u201dBut the personal experiences so many on the island had with the Clintons are a dominant factor. Many summer residents live in Washington, where the Obamas rarely appear at parties held by the city\u2019s social elite.\u201cOther than fund-raisers, the Obamas don\u2019t go to many parties in Washington, and they don\u2019t here,\u201d said Willee Lewis, a longtime Vineyard summer resident who lives in Washington.Mr. Jordan, among the only Vineyard residents who has regularly entertained both the Clintons and the Obamas, said in a telephone interview that no one could attend every summer party on the island and that staying home with family was admirable.\u201cPeople cannot determine for the Obamas or the Clintons how they should spend their vacations,\u201d Mr. Jordan said. \u201cThey have to respect their privacy and their decision of how they\u2019re going to stay on the Vineyard.\u201dGender also plays a role. Older women dominate much of the social scene, and they tend to see Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign as historic. And besides ignoring their parties, Mr. Obama has stumbled with them in other ways here.\u201cI love that Obama plays golf, but when is he going to play a round with a woman?\u201d asked Anne Getz, an island summer resident and golfer who offered while walking her dog on a beach here to spot Mr. Obama a couple of strokes per round.\u201cIs he afraid of getting beat?\u201d she asked with a competitive twinkle in her eye.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On Field and in Hometown, Neymar Tries to Change the Narrative", "Date": "2016-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPRAIA GRANDE, Brazil \u2014 A Summer Games for children held its opening ceremony here Friday at the Neymar Jr. Institute, founded by the Brazilian soccer star who has accepted two Olympian responsibilities.The more public one involves the Rio Games, where Neymar, 24, will try to restore Brazil\u2019s flagging soccer esteem. The country most synonymous with the sport has won five World Cups but never an Olympic gold medal. An opening 0-0 tie against South Africa on Thursday did nothing to heal lingering trauma from a devastating 7-1 loss to Germany at the 2014 World Cup, a national shame that even Neymar\u2019s mother can refer to only euphemistically as \u201cthe situation.\u201dBut Neymar is also attempting to resuscitate his ravaged childhood neighborhood in Praia Grande, a coastal city an hour outside S\u00e3o Paulo. The area surrounding his youth institute is beatifically called Garden of Glory, but it is a poor and dangerous community troubled by drugs, prostitution and a lack of good schools and jobs.The facility, with its classrooms, turf fields and high white walls, opened in December 2014, a few blocks from where Neymar once lived on B Street, playing soccer on a road that was not yet paved. He spent more than $6 million of his own money to build the institute, in addition to securing sponsors, officials at the institute said.Each day, before school or after, 2,400 boys and girls ages 7 to 14 come at no cost for two hours. They read and write and work on computers and study English, Spanish and Portuguese. Older children come at night. Parents are invited, too, for vocational training.A dentist and doctors are available. On Wednesday, 32 children were given eyeglasses free of charge, officials said. And dozens rehearsed for Friday\u2019s ceremony, twirling ribbons in the colors of the Olympic rings and preparing paper flags representing 78 countries.During the Rio Games and the Paralympics, the boys and girls will participate in a mini-Olympics featuring soccer, basketball, volleyball, swimming and judo. But institute officials stressed that this is a facility for developing opportunity, not athletes.\u201cIt is not a soccer school,\u201d said Altamiro Bezerra, the institute\u2019s finance director. \u201cNeymar\u2019s family wants to change the conditions here and give these children the basics: health and education and hope. When you are young, you need to believe in the future, that there is something good in the end.\u201dAway from this neighborhood, where Neymar lived from about 7 to 13, he has a more complicated relationship with Brazil.He is one of the world\u2019s best players, elegant and cunning, immensely popular with his 55.9 million followers on Instagram. Playing alongside Lionel Messi and Luis Su\u00e1rez in a fearsome front line at the Spanish club Barcelona, he won a European Champions League title in 2015 after beginning his career at Santos, the Brazilian club made famous by Pel\u00e9.And yet, while wearing the yellow, green and blue of Brazil\u2019s national team, Neymar is also a reminder of elusive success, even in his absence.He was not chosen as an 18-year-old for the 2010 World Cup, when Brazil fizzled in the quarterfinals. He sat out with a broken vertebra in his back when Brazil lost to Germany in the semifinals in 2014. And at Barcelona\u2019s request that he play only one tournament this summer, he vacationed during the Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario in June. Without him, Brazil was ousted in group play and the team\u2019s coach, Dunga, was fired.Recent off-the-field news about Neymar has also not always been flattering. In March, the Brazilian news media reported that he had been found guilty of tax fraud by a federal court in Rio in a case related to contracts with Santos, Barcelona and Nike. According to the reports, he was ordered to repay about $52 million in fines and back taxes. He has said he paid all the taxes he owed.An Olympic gold medal would give Neymar a prize that even Pel\u00e9 does not have. But Neymar also may need to deliver the gold to reaffirm his status as a superstar athlete and product endorser, said Milton Neves, a sports commentator at the Brazilian TV network Bandeirantes.\u201cNeymar needs to win the Olympic gold medal more than the Brazilian team needs to,\u201d Neves said.Soccer gold may be the most coveted prize for Brazil at the Rio Games, but it is only one of 28 sports, and it is not the spotlight event that it is at the World Cup.The men\u2019s Olympic tournament is for players under 23 years of age, with three older players permitted on each team. Unlike the World Cup, Thursday\u2019s opening match did not inspire people nationwide to leave work and gather in their yellow shirts and jerseys. Few sat at beach bars here, or in nearby Santos, to watch the game. Brazil could not muster a goal, even though South Africa played short-handed after one of its players was ejected with 30 minutes remaining.\u201cFor us, the draw is a defeat,\u201d Neymar told reporters.The Olympics arrive with Brazil engulfed in political and economic crises. Even a close friend of Neymar\u2019s, Ciro Lopes, said he would not open his bar in Santos early for Thursday\u2019s afternoon match.\u201cWith the economic crisis,\u201d Lopes, 51, said, \u201cpeople don\u2019t have money.\u201dAt the Neymar Jr. Institute, Ana Paula dos Santos made the sign of the cross Wednesday as she came to deliver an Olympic T-shirt to her granddaughter. If Brazil wins soccer gold, \u201cit would cleanse my soul,\u201d she said. \u201cI could sleep peacefully.\u201dShe was referring to the 7-1 loss to Germany two years ago, Brazil\u2019s biggest defeat ever in the World Cup. The match, when it is spoken of at all, is simply referred to in dreary shorthand by its score: Sete a Um.Nadine Goncalves, 49, Neymar\u2019s mother and the chief executive of his youth institute, said that as she watched that match at home with her injured son, she could see questioning in his face along with shock and sorrow: \u201cWhat if I was there? Would I have been able to change what happened?\u201dMore than a match was lost that day. A brightness about Brazilian football dimmed, along with a certainty that flair and improvisation could always overcome an opponent\u2019s technical and tactical resistance, said Flavio de Campos, a professor of the sociocultural history of soccer at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo.\u201cPeople pinned their hopes on this magic thing that we believe our soccer has,\u201d de Campos said.Many, probably most, Brazilians believe that an Olympic gold medal would come nowhere close to redeeming the embarrassment of the 2014 World Cup.\u201cErase 7-1? Never,\u201d Nilson Luiz de Marco, 56, said as he stood near the Neymar Jr. Institute. \u201cThe only way is if we play Germany again and win 7-1.\u201dGermany is also playing in the Olympic tournament, which could give Brazil a chance at an emancipating victory, or \u2014 shudder \u2014 another stunning defeat. If that happened, Bezerra, the Neymar Institute official, said with gallows humor, \u201clet\u2019s move to Germany.\u201dThe children at the institute seemed far more excited about the mini-Olympics than any outcome at the actual Olympics. Guilherme Sousa Gomes, 9, said: \u201cThis place is safe. Outside it\u2019s not safe. There are a lot of robbers walking around.\u201dGiovanna Moreira Andrade, 10, said her mother got a job showing other women how to apply makeup after taking a vocational class at the institute. Her life had gone \u201cfrom worse to better,\u201d she said. Her family has bought a barbecue grill, and she dreams of a pool.Tania Franco contributed reportingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "$76 Where There Should Be $600,000: Missing City College Donation Prompts Inquiry", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe City University of New York is investigating whether a recent $500,000 donation intended to bolster the humanities and arts at its flagship school may have been improperly diverted.The inquiry was prompted by senior faculty members at the school, the City College of New York, who learned that an account that should have contained roughly $600,000, thanks to the donation, had just $76. Faculty members asked City College officials for an explanation, but were met with \u201csilence, delay and deflection\u201d before appealing directly to the university\u2019s chancellor, James B. Milliken. Mr. Milliken then asked Frederick P. Schaffer, the university\u2019s general counsel and senior vice chancellor for legal affairs, to look into the \u201cthe expenditure of monies donated,\u201d according to documents obtained by The New York Times.It is unclear whether federal prosecutors are also looking at the $500,000 donation in June to the Sosnoff Fund. But Mr. Milliken\u2019s willingness to conduct an internal investigation suggests that the finances of City College, and the leadership of Ms. Coico, are likely to be under more scrutiny, just as a new school year has started.Indeed, CUNY announced in July that it had hired an outside counsel \u2014 Andrew J. Levander, the chairman of Dechert L.L.P. and a former federal prosecutor \u2014 to ensure that the 21st Century Foundation complied with \u201call applicable laws\u201d because \u201cthe faithful stewardship of funds, regardless of amount or source, is a matter of the highest importance.\u201dAs for the Sosnoff Fund, it is unclear who withdrew the money, when and for what purpose. Only a few officials have authorization, including the president, the provost and top finance and development officials.A spokeswoman for City College, Deidra Hill, did not respond specifically to questions about the $500,000 donation or about the investigation. However, Ms. Hill said in a statement: \u201cDuring the past year, the fund was used to support more than 100 adjunct professors and lecturers in the Division of Humanities and Arts to ensure that students have access to courses they need to successfully pursue their programs of study. Humanities and arts faculty will be meeting this week to review funding priorities for the coming year.\u201dMs. Hill added, \u201cThe Sosnoffs are very pleased that their donation is used to offer courses to students to enable them to graduate sooner.\u201dAccording to documents reviewed by The Times, City College faculty members learned in July \u2014 about a month after the donation \u2014 that the fund had been depleted. That prompted widespread concerns, because \u201cdiverse programmatic initiatives, student projects and salaries for some faculty and staff depend upon the Sosnoff Fund\u201d and \u201cthere are outstanding invoices now.\u201d Several faculty members worried that the money had been spent instead on helping the college close a budget deficit at the end of its fiscal year on June 30.But faculty members were met with \u201cstonewalling,\u201d according to a letter to the chairman of the 21st Century Foundation, Martin Cohen. As a result, more than a dozen department leaders \u2014 backed later by a City College faculty senate committee \u2014 contacted Mr. Milliken directly.\u201cWe are deeply concerned about the practical, ethical and legal implications of the situation,\u201d the department leaders wrote on Aug. 9. \u201cFunds dedicated to a certain purpose in a binding legal agreement between the college and the donor have been removed for purposes unknown to us, and we believe, to the donor.\u201dNine days later, Mr. Milliken asked Mr. Schaffer to help.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democrats Step Up Pursuit of House Republicans Left Limping by Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDemocrats are particularly enticed by Mr. Trump\u2019s dwindling support in affluent suburban areas \u2014 including those near Kansas City, Kan.; San Diego; Orlando, Fla.; and Minneapolis \u2014 where Republicans ordinarily win with ease. Mr. Trump is so disliked among college-educated voters, especially white women, that he is at risk of losing by double digits in several districts that the 2012 Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, carried comfortably.\u201cIt\u2019s a remarkable situation. We, the Republicans, ought to be in a much stronger position in many suburban areas,\u201d said Representative Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, whose district includes both suburbs and small cities. \u201cBecause of the nature of the nominee, it\u2019s going to be a lot more competitive than it ought to be.\u201dFew Democrats say they believe their party is positioned, at this point, to take control of the House, where Republicans hold their largest majority in 87 years. Because of the way congressional districts are drawn, Republicans have a powerful structural advantage even in a punishing political environment.But Republicans are also bracing to take more forceful steps if Mr. Trump continues to drag down their candidates. Multiple strategists involved in the campaign for control of Congress said Republican outside groups were prepared to run ads treating Mr. Trump as a certain-to-lose candidate and urging voters to elect Republicans as a check on Hillary Clinton.Republican candidates and groups are also weighing a renewed television barrage against Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California and the House minority leader, who is unpopular in many swing districts in her state.The stakes are high: Should Mr. Trump lose the presidential race and take the Republicans\u2019 Senate majority with him, handing Democrats the power to break the deadlock over appointees to the Supreme Court, the House could become the party\u2019s last line of defense in Washington.While Democrats have sought publicly to temper expectations that they could win the House, in private meetings they are laying out ways to expand their battle plan to fight for more seats.And their donors appear increasingly motivated: Last month, the House Democratic campaign raised $12 million while House Republicans raised just $4.6 million, a remarkable disparity given that the party in control usually dominates fund-raising.Ms. Pelosi emailed fellow lawmakers on Thursday and highlighted an academic study that suggested the majority might be within reach, according to someone who received the message, who requested anonymity because the message was supposed to be private.And at a retreat this month in California that Ms. Pelosi convened in Napa Valley, Representative Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n of New Mexico gave a presentation to donors outlining plans to put new seats in play.Some of the party\u2019s most promising candidates from those districts attended the gathering, which featured California chardonnays and \u201cred to blue\u201d cards distributed to donors identifying which candidates had the most potential to flip Republican seats.Republican Senate seats that were considered to be tossups before Donald J. Trump became the Republican nominee may be even more vulnerable now.Mr. Luj\u00e1n, who heads the House Democratic campaign committee, said Mr. Trump\u2019s toxic standing with women had put a range of additional Republican incumbents in jeopardy, according to several people who attended the presentation.Alixandria Lapp, a Democratic strategist who leads a \u201csuper PAC\u201d focused on House races, told the group that the Bergen County, N.J., seat held by Representative Scott Garrett was the kind of Republican district where Democrats could make gains.Democratic strategists say they believe as many as a dozen districts could become competitive late in the race, depending on Mr. Trump\u2019s fortunes. Among the Republican districts that Democrats see as newly threatened are those held by Representatives John L. Mica of Florida, who represents the Orlando area; Kevin Yoder of Kansas, from the suburbs of Kansas City; and Michael G. Fitzpatrick, a lawmaker from outside Philadelphia who is retiring. Several others represent diverse, economically comfortable areas of California, including Representatives Darrell E. Issa and Ed Royce, from the San Diego and Los Angeles suburbs.Both parties are also eyeing a set of moderate- to conservative-leaning open seats in states like Indiana and Minnesota, where incumbents are retiring or running for other offices. Republicans fear that Mr. Trump has tainted the party\u2019s brand for any prospective successor in areas without a well-known lawmaker already in place.Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, who attended the Democratic retreat, said winning the majority was \u201cfeasible\u201d because of Mr. Trump.\u201cWe\u2019d need to win tossups or even safer Republican seats, but that\u2019s what happens in a wave: People get sucked in the undertow,\u201d Mr. Schiff said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a real chance of that happening thanks to the Donald.\u201dWhat may ultimately block Democrats from winning the 30 seats they need to take the House majority are their continued struggles in rural, working-class districts. And many of the suburban districts Democrats hope to contest are expensive to advertise in.\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re to the point of losing the majority, but we\u2019d be foolish to be complacent,\u201d said Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma. \u201cWe don\u2019t know from one day to next how the top of the ticket will perform.\u201dAt their own donor retreat last week in Jackson Hole, Wyo., House Republicans were frank about the difficulties Mr. Trump had created for their candidates.Still, strategists for the National Republican Congressional Committee told donors that private polling showed voters were not yet equating vulnerable Republican lawmakers with Mr. Trump directly, and stressed that Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Pelosi\u2019s unpopularity could be a check on Democratic gains, according to people who attended the retreat.But at the Four Seasons resort where they assembled, there was open talk \u2014 and worry \u2014 about why House Democrats were outraising their Republican counterparts.\u201cThis pattern is unsustainable,\u201d wrote Megan Cummings, the finance director of the House Republican campaign committee, in a pleading email to Washington lobbyists last week. \u201cWe can\u2019t go another month with the Democrats outraising us by such significant amounts.\u201d (House Republicans still have slightly more cash on hand than the Democrats.)So far, only a small number of Republicans, mainly in moderate suburbs, have taken the unusual step of disavowing their party\u2019s presidential nominee.What worries Republican strategists is not that suburban voters turned off by Mr. Trump would migrate en masse to Democrats, but that many might not show up on Election Day at all.\u201cOur biggest concern would be that they would choose to stay home because they are so disgusted with both people at the top of the ticket,\u201d said Mike Shields, the president of the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC that backs Republicans. \u201cIf they show up, then I think we\u2019re in very good shape.\u201dMr. Trump has long faced resistance in suburban areas; during the Republican primaries, he often lost upscale suburbs even in states he carried, like Virginia and Georgia.In Ms. Comstock\u2019s northern Virginia district, swing voters expressed deep dismay last week about Mr. Trump in interviews.Jean Dura, a retired middle school administrator here in Leesburg, said the 2016 election was \u201cterribly confusing.\u201d She said she was undecided about how she would vote for president and Congress, but would definitely not vote for Mr. Trump.\u201cThe things he says are atrocious,\u201d said Ms. Dura, a political independent. \u201cEverybody I\u2019ve talked to has said the same thing \u2014 they say they don\u2019t know who to vote for.\u201dLuAnn Bennett, a Democratic real estate developer challenging Ms. Comstock, said she intended to link her opponent closely to Mr. Trump. She predicted that Ms. Comstock, who represents a district where most voters have college degrees, would suffer for failing to reject Mr. Trump. (A spokesman for Ms. Comstock did not respond to an interview request.)\u201cShe\u2019s trying to kind of dance on the head of a pin on the Donald Trump issue,\u201d Ms. Bennett said, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t think she has the political courage that our leaders need.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "War and Pillaging Couldn\u2019t Break an Afghan Village, but a Tumbling Economy May", "Date": "2016-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIstalif JournalISTALIF, Afghanistan \u2014 To survive the last catastrophe, when their town was sacked and burned by the Taliban, the potters of the northern Afghan town of Istalif buried the tools of their trade and fled, some enduring years of exile until the threat finally passed.The town has long been coveted for its rustic, riverine beauty, nestled among bands of orchards that overlook the parched Shomali Plain, and for its strategic location on the road to Kabul, the capital. Istalif\u2019s resurgence after the fall of the Taliban in 2001 hardened its reputation for resilience, earned over centuries as it repeatedly survived pillaging by invaders.Yet now, Istalif is endangered again, and the peril this time is more difficult to escape: imposed not by marauders but by neglect, as Afghanistan\u2019s government grapples with accelerating violence and a collapsing economy, and as the foreign presence evaporates.Afghans who picnicked by Istalif\u2019s river or visited its famous shrine have stopped coming because of growing insecurity across the country. With unemployment chronically high, those who do visit spend little on the town\u2019s distinctive turquoise pottery or the mass-produced knickknacks that shopkeepers hawk to survive.Gone, too, are the foreigners who descended on the village over the last decade, sometimes on day trips from Kabul, flush with cash. The offices of various international organizations that sought to aid the town and its residents have been forsaken, as they have across much of the country, leaving behind only rusted signs detailing the foreigners\u2019 lofty and now discarded ambitions.In lettering faded by the sun, one sign for a Belgian group called Mothers for Peace advertises projects including English and literacy courses, a mothers-and-children clinic, agriculture education and a \u201cpottery section.\u201d Beyond the sign, a padlocked and emptied building is a vestige of passing Western interest in this place.The shops on Istalif\u2019s main street were open on a recent morning, but devoid of shoppers. \u201cI have forgotten what a dollar looks like,\u201d said Mir Golom Rasool, a 70-year-old store owner \u2014 exaggerating for effect, but only a little.A different nonprofit founded by an American couple provided financing for the restoration of more than 100 shops in Istalif, and by 2007, news reports were hailing the town as an Afghan success story.But even as development improved people\u2019s lives, one of the town\u2019s foundations \u2014 its centuries-old pottery production \u2014 was struggling. In recent years, the local market for pottery had been \u201cobliterated,\u201d Mr. Liddle said. \u201cHardly any foreigners go there, and fewer Afghans.\u201dTurquoise Mountain, which once had a branch in Istalif, is still trying to connect the town\u2019s craftspeople with international markets, and recently included its pottery in a landmark exhibition at the Smithsonian Institution \u2014 where their wares were the best-selling items, Mr. Liddle said.But of the various Afghan crafts the group was trying to promote, including jewelry and woodwork, \u201cceramics is the most challenging one and the hardest to commercialize internationally,\u201d because of the difficulty in shipping delicate pieces and ensuring that the quality of the pottery is up to the high standards of buyers in London or New York, Mr. Liddle said.The loss of business seemed an especially cruel turn for a place that had managed to survive far more crippling shocks.Mohamed Islam Malekzada, who manages a pottery business started by his grandfather and spoke in his shop on the main street, spent years in a Taliban prison after the insurgents raided Istalif in the late 1990s. He was rounded up with other residents and beaten \u201cafter they burned our homes,\u201d he said.\u201cIt was a very dark era,\u201d he said.The family returned to Istalif after the fall of the Taliban and revived their pottery business, with help from Turquoise Mountain, which worked to improve the quality of the ceramics and revived a distinct, natural glaze \u2014 measures that were supposed to help Istalif\u2019s craftspeople market their wares abroad.Yet Mr. Malekzada said he hardly ever received international orders. \u201cThere was one shipment to America, for 25 pieces, about two months ago,\u201d he said. With international support drying up, Afghanistan\u2019s government had not jumped in to support the struggling pottery industry, he said.As he spoke, a family stopped by, browsing past the pricier pottery before settling on a large, unglazed pot that cost less than a dollar.\u201cWe are not going to give up,\u201d Mr. Malekzada said. \u201cWe kept the business in bad days, and we will keep going as long as we can.\u201dIn his book \u201cBazaar Politics: Power and Pottery in an Afghan Market Town,\u201d Noah Coburn, an anthropologist who spent several years working and living in Istalif, described the central role of pottery production in the town and on local politics.It \u201cshaped the rhythm of life for the potters\u201d by requiring a high level of integration in families and collective labor, he wrote. That, in turn, \u201cencouraged loyalty and hierarchy.\u201dBy contrast, the foreign nongovernmental organizations that worked in Istalif had little impact, \u201cdespite large amounts of money being spent,\u201d Mr. Coburn wrote.Across the street from Mr. Malekzada\u2019s stall, another shopkeeper, Abdul Jabar, was also trying to seize any opportunity, handing a young man a small clay pot that the boy said he needed to feed his partridge, on the promise that the boy\u2019s father would pay later.Abdul Jabar traced the history of Istalif through Afghanistan\u2019s recent eras, recalling the Taliban occupation, when he hid in Kabul, moving from house to house until he was able to restart his business. Years later, the town prospered as Afghanistan became more secure, and \u201cpeople would come from all over the country for picnics,\u201d he said.Now, like other potters on the street, Abdul Jabar and his family are suffering, contending with the resurgence of the Taliban and a broader sense that the country \u2014 or his corner of it \u2014 had been abandoned. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get the help we expected,\u201d he said, reflecting on the role of foreign groups in Istalif.

{"Headline": "The Real Clinton Foundation Revelation", "Date": "2016-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWhen I was the chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, I asked many prospective administration officials if they would sell stock in companies, give up stock options, step down from nonprofit boards or make other painful choices to enter public service. Some balked. I told them that someone more important than I was, perhaps the president or the White House chief of staff, would ask them, \u201cDo you want this job or don\u2019t you?\u201dI know about the difficult questions, and entanglements, that crop up in public service. I believe that Hillary Clinton has asked and successfully answered those questions as they pertain to the Clinton Foundation. There is little if any evidence that federal ethics laws were broken by Mrs. Clinton or anyone working for her at the State Department in their dealings with the foundation. Unfortunately, the foundation is still fuel for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s persistent critics.These critics have yet to point to any provision of the federal statutes or ethics regulations that was violated by Secretary Clinton or her staff in their dealings with the foundation and its principals, agents and donors. Was there favoritism? Probably, yes. But laws were not broken. If favoritism by political appointees toward outside persons and organizations were illegal, the United States government would be quite different than it is today.White House political appointees and members of Congress show favoritism regularly, from how quickly they return campaign contributors\u2019 telephone calls to which meeting requests they honor to who gets what they want in the policy arena.This kind of access is the most corrupting brand of favoritism and pervades the entire government. Under both Republican and Democratic presidents, top ambassadorial posts routinely go to campaign contributors. Yet more campaign contributors hound these and other State Department employees for introductions abroad, preferred access and advancement of trade and other policy agendas. More often than not the State Department does their bidding.Meanwhile, those of us who know and are frustrated about the way our government works breathe a collective yawn at the unsurprising news that the Clinton Foundation or some other nonprofit also gets what appears to be favorable treatment by a government agency. Lots of people and groups get favorable treatment, and most of these are interested in making money rather than giving it away.The problem is that it does not matter that no laws were broken, or that the Clinton Foundation is principally about doing good deeds. It does not matter that favoritism is inescapable in the federal government and that the Clinton Foundation stories are really nothing new. The appearances surrounding the foundation are problematic, and it is and will be an albatross around Mrs. Clinton\u2019s neck.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s critics \u2014 many of whom have spent more than 20 years exploiting every opening the Clintons give them (of which there are many) \u2014 will continue to hound Mrs. Clinton about the foundation throughout the campaign and, should she win, during her presidency.This is not the typical foundation funded by family wealth earned by an industrialist or financier. This foundation was funded almost entirely by donors, and to the extent anyone in the Clinton family \u201cearned\u201d the money, it was largely through speaking fees for former President Bill Clinton or Hillary Clinton when she was not secretary of state. This dependence on donations \u2014 a scenario remarkably similar to that of many political campaigns \u2014 means that the motivations of every single donor will be questioned whenever a President Clinton does anything that could conceivably benefit such donors.As for Chelsea Clinton, anti-nepotism laws, strengthened after President Kennedy appointed his brother Robert as attorney general, could prevent her mother from appointing her to some of the highest government positions. But she could give her mother informal advice, and there are a great many government jobs for which she would be eligible. She does not need the Clinton Foundation to succeed in life.Millions of American voters will want to know whether Hillary Clinton really wants this job, which is the highest office in a government that spends more money in a single day than the entire net worth of the Clinton Foundation.I\u2019m a Republican, but I believe that Hillary Clinton is the only qualified major party candidate in the race and she should become president. Yet to win, and certainly to succeed as president, she needs to demonstrate that she understands how much appearances matter, as well as facts and law, and that the president should not unnecessarily open herself up to attack.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bankruptcy for Banks: A Sound Concept That Needs Fine-Tuning", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnother ViewThe House of Representatives is pushing to enact a bankruptcy act for banks.It has passed a bankruptcy-for-banks bill, sent it to the Senate, and now embedded it in its appropriations bill, meaning that if Congress is to pass an appropriations bill this year, it may also have to enact the bankruptcy-for-banks bill.Is that a good idea?In concept, bankruptcy for banks makes sense: Why should they get the benefits of government bailouts that industrial companies rarely receive? The answer usually is that a bank failure can bring down the economy, while an industrial failure cannot. But if banks can be reorganized in bankruptcy, the possibility of a win-win result is in the cards. We could restructure a big bank to stop it from damaging the economy, but without having to bail it out.The two of us support this concept \u2014 and indeed one of us worked extensively with the Hoover Institution to draft such a bankruptcy proposal. But the bill in play has several dangerous features that could make bailouts more likely, not less likely.First and most problematic, only the bank and not the regulator can make the bankruptcy happen. If the regulators think that a bankruptcy is needed, but that a bailout or alternative resolution process is not needed, they cannot directly force a filing.Typically, creditors of a failing company can force a bankruptcy and the United States is effectively a major creditor for banks \u2014 guaranteeing deposits and more. Earlier bankruptcy-for-banks proposals had the regulators able to put a big troubled bank into bankruptcy, but the House bill mistakenly does not. Regulators can resolve banks under the Dodd-Frank Act, but can do so only under specific conditions that may take time to invoke.True, regulators can pressure bank managers to reluctantly file, but the regulators may have to concede conditions to bank executives to make them file quickly; if the bank does not file quickly, the regulators may decide that to save the economy, they have to bail the bank out. In the extreme case, bank management may just refuse to file for bankruptcy.Second, the bill broadly exempts bank executives from lawsuits and liability for pre-bankruptcy actions. Banking law anticipates that bank officers and directors could be held personally liable for gross negligence in mismanaging the bank. With executives fearing lawsuits, the thinking was that they would run risky, wobbling banks more soundly. The House bill exempts bankers from liability not just for the actual filing for bankruptcy \u2014 an exemption needed to encourage them to file voluntarily when needed, and which we support \u2014 but also for any actions taken \u201cin connection with\u201d the filing.As lawyers know, the phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d has no sharp boundary; it could readily shield the bankers from liability for serious errors that made the filing necessary. After all, \u201ceverything is connected to everything.\u201dThird, the bankruptcy bill contemplates only one kind of bankruptcy: one where all of the bank\u2019s derivatives contracts and short-term funding, or repo, are fully paid off, with longer-term creditors being hit to support the short-term debt. This mechanism is potentially a good way to restructure a failed bank and stop a run on the banking industry more broadly. Today\u2019s bankruptcy law allows those with derivatives and repo contracts with the bank to terminate them as soon as the bank files for bankruptcy. This wide termination when Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in 2008 caused havoc in financial markets around the world.The House bill is putting all its bets on this mechanism of fully paying off derivatives and repos in a 48-hour bankruptcy. But such a rapid-fire bankruptcy has never before been tried, and under the bill, it must be completed in 48 hours \u2014 faster than almost any bankruptcy on record.As military generals know, no battle plan survives first contact with the enemy; and as financial policy makers in and out of Congress should understand, no financial plan will survive first contact with a crisis. A viable bankruptcy structure needs to have a backup to the House bill\u2019s near-overnight restructuring plan, because it may not work. One piece that is needed, in case a quick bankruptcy does not work, is a mechanism to smoothly disassemble a supposedly \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d bank so that it does not drag the economy down with it. That would need a provision preventing the bank\u2019s creditors from terminating its derivatives and short-term funding contracts until the derivatives book can be disassembled in an orderly way and the short-term financing wound down.The good news is that the core concept behind the bill \u2014 bankruptcy for banks \u2014 is sound. Although the problems we outlined are fundamental, they can be fixed with more thought and straightforward changes. But if these adjustments are not made, the system would depend on a quick bankruptcy that might not work. If it does not, we fear that the House\u2019s proposed bankruptcy bill would then leave only one alternative for the regulators: to bail out the failed bank and its executives.Mark J.

{"Headline": "Japanese Government Urges Another Increase in Military Spending", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 The government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is requesting another increase in spending on Japan\u2019s armed forces, with a plan to expand missile defenses that would test the nation\u2019s commitment to pacifism and escalate a regional arms race with China and North Korea.With rising threats from North Korea\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile program and repeated incursions by Chinese ships into waters surrounding a string of islands claimed by Japan, the request would let the Defense Ministry develop new antiballistic missiles and place troops on southern islands closer to the chain in dispute with China.If approved, the budget proposal for 5.17 trillion yen, or $50.2 billion, formally submitted on Wednesday, would be the nation\u2019s fifth-straight annual increase in military spending. It is a 2.3 percent rise over last year.The request includes proposals to develop and potentially purchase new antiballistic missiles that can be launched from ships or land, and to upgrade and extend the range of the country\u2019s current land-based missile defense systems, a significant expansion of Japan\u2019s missile defense capabilities.The budget also details plans to buy an additional submarine and new fighter aircraft, and to put close to 1,300 soldiers from the Self-Defense Force, Japan\u2019s military, on the southern islands of Kagoshima and Okinawa. These locations are closer to the Senkaku, the chain of islands where both China and Japan claim territorial rights.Despite Japan\u2019s longstanding postwar pacifism, initially imposed by a Constitution that was largely written by American occupiers, the country has long argued that the Constitution does not prevent it from maintaining defensive equipment and troops.But the definition of what is needed to defend the country has evolved as Japan confronts new dangers. Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, government assessments of security in the region led to a decrease in defense budgets every year.Yet five years ago, the government began increasing its budget again as new provocations emerged from China and North Korea.Japan\u2019s current land-based missile defense systems have a medium range for intercepting incoming ballistic missiles. By expanding that range, the new systems should be able to shoot down missiles before they get so close.Japan\u2019s defense budget proposal includes funds to help proceed with development, in conjunction with the United States, of advanced antiballistic missiles that can be launched from ships and that have much longer ranges than previous incarnations.Experts said these missiles could be used not only to shoot down North Korean missiles, but also to deter China from invading the disputed islands. Placing more troops on the southern islands of Japan is also intended to deter China from moving closer to the Senkaku.\u201cWhen one nation does something which it believes to be defensive and in its own interests, its competitor will see it as threatening and see it as offensive, and then you get this arms race and security dilemma,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s very much in play here.\u201dThe Defense Ministry\u2019s budget request must be reviewed by the Finance Ministry and approved by Parliament before any purchases can be made.Analysts said nothing in the new budget request suggested that Japan would cross the line from a primarily defensive stance to a more offensive one.\u201cIf they started to procure long-range bombers or intercontinental ballistic missiles, those would be the things where I would say, \u2018Now we are seeing something radically different,\u2019\u201d said Jeffrey Hornung, a research fellow for security and foreign policy at Sasakawa USA, a think tank in Washington.The new equipment proposals also seem carefully calibrated to address current threats. The plan to extend the range of existing PAC-3 missile defense systems from the current limit of about 19 miles, for example, would help Japan protect against North Korean missiles but avoid the appearance of instigating new confrontations, analysts said.\u201cI think these ranges are very carefully selected,\u201d said Bonnie S. Glaser, senior Asia adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. She noted that Japan would, for instance, be aware of China\u2019s objection to any hint that Japan might get involved in disputes over Taiwan. The distances of the missiles proposed, she said, would not extend to Taiwan.All told, the budget request remains less than 1 percent of Japan\u2019s gross domestic product, a self-imposed constraint that few Japanese administrations have breached.Some analysts noted that with China rapidly increasing its military budget, Japan\u2019s current military spending might not be sufficient. \u201cIn the long run, if the military balance in East Asia shifts in favor of China significantly, we might have to do much more than what we are doing right now,\u201d said Narushige Michishita, director of the Security and International Studies Program at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo.Tooru Miyamoto, a Communist Party member of the House of Representatives, said he did not approve of the increased expenditures at a time when the economy continues to stagnate. \u201cI want such money to be spent on day care centers,\u201d he said.At an annual review staged by the Ground Self-Defense Force in the foothills of Mount Fuji last weekend, 25,000 spectators gathered to watch a parade of tanks, helicopters and other armored vehicles, with soldiers detonating artillery against artificial targets.In one segment described as a demonstration of how troops would respond to an attack on unspecified islands, soldiers dropped from Chinook helicopters and tanks rolled across a muddy field.Naoko Matsumaru, 42, who works in a flour mill, attended the drills with her young daughter and son.She said that she had been concerned about threats from North Korea and China, but that \u201cafter seeing today\u2019s show, I feel maybe we are actually O.K.\u201dThose who value Japan\u2019s pacifism said they were concerned about the expanded military role.\u201cIn these times, I am a little bit worried,\u201d said Toru Matsuzaki, 71, a woodworker. He referred to a generation of \u201cheiwa boke,\u201d people who innocently take peace for granted. \u201cRealistically, it may be necessary to increase the budget,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t like it.\u201dMakiko Inoue contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

It is up to them to upgrade building codes and zoning laws to reflect the increased risk of storms and floods.

Industry officials said they decided to embrace the legislation after becoming increasingly concerned that a decline in consumer confidence could hurt their sales.Major national environmental, consumer and health nonprofits, such as the American Cancer Society, the Environmental Working Group and the Good Housekeeping Institute, have also backed the plan.But even before Ms. Feinstein formally introduced her legislation in April 2015, the Independent Cosmetic Manufacturers and Distributors, in which Guthy-Renker has been a dues-paying member for over a decade, moved to defeat it, internal documents obtained by The Times show.\u201cWe can\u2019t just be out there saying, \u2018No, we don\u2019t like Feinstein\u2019s bill,\u2019\u201d Mr. Harmala said in an interview.More industry donations were sent to Representatives Eddie Bernice Johnson, Democrat of Texas, and Bill Flores, Republican of Texas, the only other two House lawmakers to help sponsor the bill.Crayton W.

There was a work call with someone in a different time zone \u2014 a \u201cfinance person\u201d for a movie he plans to direct \u2014 and the conversation left Hill so jazzed that he couldn\u2019t fall asleep, so he took his French bulldog Carmela (named after Tony Soprano\u2019s wife) for a walk around the neighborhood, and when he finally dozed off he left a window open, leaving him speckled with \u201ca thousand\u201d mosquito bites, visible in rosy constellations across his arms. The coffee was helping.Hill, at 32, has appeared in enough movies (currently 29) that he was recognized, in the space of 10 minutes, by a female SPiN employee in her 20s who requested a photo, by a 40ish camp counselor who asked that Hill take a picture with his campers and by the campers themselves, who clustered around the actor and stared stoically into the camera for a photo in which Hill was the only one smiling. These people probably knew Hill from his role as a hilarious sidekick in the \u201c21 Jump Street\u201d remakes, or from his role as a hilarious sidekick in \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street,\u201d or from his role as a hilarious sidekick in \u201cSuperbad.\u201d The hilarious-sidekick roles make up a numer\u00adically small but neon-bright portion of Hill\u2019s career, and no number of contrasting performances \u2014 in indie comedies directed by the Duplass brothers, in Oscar-nominated dramas like \u201cMoneyball\u201d \u2014 can seem to override the public impression of him as a man who might, at any moment, start humping the furniture.This is fair, because Hill is excellent at delivering coitus jokes. It\u2019s also unfair, because his acting career didn\u2019t begin in a raunchy-comedy place and it doesn\u2019t seem to be heading in that direction, even if his IMDb page is dotted with the presence of Judd Apatow. Hill has received two Oscar nominations and produced six movies and has writing credits on both of the \u201cJump Street\u201d movies. He is not Seth Rogen, although people sometimes confuse the two men, which feels vaguely anti-Semitic given that they look nothing alike. Next year he\u2019ll direct a movie that he wrote (not a comedy). This summer he appears in \u201cWar Dogs,\u201d directed by Todd Phillips, of the \u201cHangover\u201d movies. Though it\u2019s strewn with giggly moments, the movie is ultimately alarming. Hill plays a sociopathic arms dealer.In the basement at SPiN, Ping-Pong patrons continued to recognize the actor, who didn\u2019t wear a hat or sunglasses or other protective camouflage, until a manager registered the ogling and transferred Hill to a private room behind a double-layered curtain. By now the coffee had kicked in. I asked Hill if he was ready to play Ping-Pong. \u201cYeah!\u201d he said. \u201cI was just thinking that I\u2019d love to.\u201d Pause. \u201cYou didn\u2019t think of that idea \u2014 I thought of it.\u201d This last sentence came across as a joke in real life \u2014 he was doing an impression of a surreally bratty person \u2014 but it reads horribly on the page, which turns out to be true of many things that Hill says. His humor is transcription-resistant. This may be one reason that profiles of the actor have not historically been ultraflattering. Another reason may be Hill\u2019s face. \u201cI have resting bitch face,\u201d he explained to me once. \u201cI really do. It\u2019s heartbreaking. I don\u2019t mean anything by it.\u201d This is borne out by paparazzi photos of Hill sternly alighting from a vehicle, angrily riding a Citi Bike and resentfully hanging out with Leonardo DiCaprio. \u201cI know I look really pissed off,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019m not.\u201dIf life were a reality TV show, it would be accurate to say that Hill has received a \u201cbad edit,\u201d in part because of the above factors. In 2013 he did an interview with Rolling Stone that resulted in the following words being used by media outlets to describe him: humorless, insufferable, angry, defensive, pompous jerk, and \u201c20 Most Hated Celebrities!\u201d Today\u2019s Jonah Hill, rallying at a Ping-Pong table, seems like someone who might do yoga, or drink green tea, or practice Transcendental Meditation. Maybe it is just the residue of his youth in California. Maybe \u201ccenteredness\u201d is just Los Angeles leaving the body. Whatever it is, he comes off as mellow and polite, keeping his phone out of sight during interactions and asking if I have any dietary restrictions. He behaves in a way that would assure his mother that she did a good job. He says that the trait he values most in others is being nice. Most famous people have a thin oleaginous layer of social grace that tops a bottomless well of impatience to get their press duties over with, but Hill seemed to be in no particular hurry to do anything, except lose at Ping-Pong.While his serve is 90 percent unreturnable and his backhand is evil, Hill\u2019s forehand is unreliable. Midway through Round 1 an employee popped his head in and asked for the score. \u201cFourteen to 20,\u201d Hill replied. \u201cShe\u2019s winning.\u201dThe guy scoffed. \u201cYou\u2019re losing to a girl?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not a very feminist attitude, my friend,\u201d Hill said.\u201cDoes that make you mad?\u201d he asked, after the employee left. \u201cIt\u2019s not the dumb outlook that bothers me. It\u2019s that he expects me to share that sentiment. He expects me to be like, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m really embarrassed that a girl is beating me.\u2019\u2009\u201d For Round 2, which he also lost, Hill plugged his iPod into a speaker and selected a playlist of almost-underground \u201990s rap acts like the Coup and Jeru the Damaja. When the game ended, he briefly howled in grief, bounced over to shake hands and then floated the idea of barbecue for lunch. Not a bad loser.Vulnerability is a counterproductive trait for a famous person to have, but Hill is funniest on-screen when he plays characters thumping up against their feeble natures, and he is most affecting in dramatic roles doing the same. It makes you wonder whether the kind of person most suited to being an actor \u2014 sensitive, expressive, slightly weird \u2014 is the kind of person least suited to being a celebrity.Hill has been sensitive and weird since infancy. He grew up in Los Angeles, the son of an accountant and a costume designer, enjoying a childhood that he characterizes as \u201cfun\u201d yet \u201csuper emo.\u201d He cried frequently. For a year starting at age 4 he pretended to be a dog and padded around the house on all fours, woofing, which may have been his first acting experience. He intended to grow up into a writer until he became obsessed with skateboarding at around 10. His dreams of becoming a professional skater eventually receded because of a lack of skill, and he enrolled in college at The New School with plans to write and direct. \u201cIn school I was always a decent athlete, a decent student, but I was never exceptional at any of that stuff,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I started taking acting classes, it was the first time teachers were like, \u2018You\u2019re good and you should keep doing this.\u2019\u2009\u201dAnother adult who recognized Hill\u2019s potential was Dustin Hoffman, who happened to be the father of Hill\u2019s former schoolmate Jake Hoffman and who suggested that Hill audition for \u201cI Heart Huckabees.\u201d Hill got the part and appears halfway through the movie as a cherub-faced teenager arguing with his sister and playing video games at a family dinner across from Mark Wahlberg. The role is a blip, but Hill earns his few minutes on-screen, appearing at ease despite never having been in a movie and having no idea, he told me, when the camera was on him. This confidence apparently stretches back to his youth: A Jewish Journal profile from 2012 \u2014 a rare flattering one \u2014 includes a quote from Cantor Yonah Kliger of Temple Emanuel of Beverly Hills, where Hill had his bar mitzvah, describing him as \u201cdestined for something great\u201d and \u201celectric\u201d even at 13, reciting his Torah portion in a prayer shawl. Three years after \u201cHuckabees,\u201d Hill co-starred in \u201cSuperbad\u201d as a high-schooler who cries, dances, lies, has his heart broken, is struck by a number of vehicles and exchanges tender I-love-yous with Michael Cera\u2019s character in a final scene that still makes me weep in a way that no Pixar movie ever will. This was his breakthrough.If \u201cSuperbad\u201d cemented Hill\u2019s status as an entertaining accent piece, \u201cMoneyball\u201d (2011) suggested that pegging him as a novelty actor was an error. His character in that movie, an economics geek named Peter Brand, is an introvert who walks the earth as if he\u2019s about to be pantsed. He underplays the part so deftly that Brand\u2019s emotional climax \u2014 when he sees that his methods actually work \u2014 is conveyed by no more than a few euphoric seconds of rapid blinking and a half-smile. The next movie he appeared in was a critical disaster of a comedy called \u201cThe Sitter.\u201dBecause of this seesawing, the best way to make sense of Hill\u2019s career is to divide it roughly in half, not chronologically but by the two kinds of movies he makes: on one side, the goofy com\u00adedies, and on the other side, well-received movies by respected directors, like \u201cDjango Unchained\u201d and \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street\u201d and \u201cHail, Caesar!\u201d After \u201cSuperbad,\u201d it would have been easy for Hill to take the Adam Sandler route and ride the wave of his own typecasting, making bad copies of the same movie over and over again. Instead, he exercised discretion in his roles and did a good-enough job to hammer out the kind of career that hilarious sidekicks in gross-out teen com\u00adedies have not traditionally enjoyed. (Jason Biggs offers a useful point of comparison; it took him a decade and a half to recover from the abasement of \u201cAmerican Pie.\u201d)The parallel movie tracks have one thing in common, which is that Hill tends to play obsessive characters in both. In \u201cWar Dogs\u201d he is obsessed with selling weapons to the United States government for piles of money. In \u201cTrue Story,\u201d he is obsessed with a murderer. In \u201cMoneyball,\u201d he is obsessed with sabermetrics. In \u201cCyrus,\u201d he\u2019s obsessed with his mom. In \u201cSuperbad,\u201d he is obsessed with the probability of losing his best friend. Even in \u201cHail, Caesar!\u201d though he is onscreen for approximately two seconds, the gag of Hill\u2019s character is that he is too engrossed in processing legal papers to take note of Scarlett Johansson\u2019s predatory innuendoes.Obsessiveness is a good filter for choosing roles, because there is nothing with more comic potential than a character who desperately wants something, and there\u2019s also nothing with more tragic potential; the distinction is in how that obsession pans out. It can be a poignant trait, as with Jay Gatsby; or an evil one, as with Hannibal Lecter; or a creepy one, as with Annie Wilkes; or a mesmerizing one, as with Willy Wonka; or an epic one, as with Charles Foster Kane; or a pa\u00adthetic one, as with Norma Desmond. Monomania is infinitely versatile.Ellen Lewis, who cast Hill as Donnie Azoff in \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street,\u201d had been particularly impressed with his performance in \u201cSuperbad.\u201d \u201cWolf\u201d wasn\u2019t necessarily written to be funny, she said, but Martin Scorsese wanted a Donnie who could improvise. \u201cObviously it was a different way to go,\u201d she said. \u201cJonah\u2019s got depth, but at the same time, he\u2019s extremely charismatic. And really funny people can be very dangerous. He showed that edge.\u201d He reminded her a little, Lewis said, of Robin Williams.\u201cSuperbad\u201d (2007).Hill shrugged at the question. \u201cIf it was your job to think of those things, you would. You just would.\u201dBut what\u2019s his secret?\u201cThe acting juice I drink every morning.\u201d\u201cI watch things over and over again,\u201d Hill said. Like, 20 times. Most recently, \u201cBehind the Candelabra.\u201d Before that, the French film \u201cA Prophet.\u201d All the great Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola movies, obviously. All the Paul Thomas Anderson movies. He loves Lena Dunham and Spike Jonze. When he finds a movie he likes, he watches it compulsively \u2014 and at a loud volume, because he has bad hearing from listening to live music as a youth without taking the proper precautions. He watches movies until he is able to forget that he is watching a movie, which to Hill is the sign of a really great movie.He picks the roles he plays using the same rubric he uses to pick the movies that he watches, which is by director. \u201cIf you have a great script, it\u2019s hard to [expletive] it up \u2014 but I\u2019ve kind of had that happen,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve had scripts that were not even complete, and the director was amazing, and I ended up being proud of the movie.\u201d Great directors, he maintained, make great movies. It took him a while to figure this out. Even if a role is good, he won\u2019t do a movie now unless he believes in the director, because \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be a cool character in a bad movie.\u201dNobody has bulletproof judgment, though, and Hill\u2019s character in this summer\u2019s \u201cWar Dogs\u201d could be seen as a terrific character in an otherwise O.K. movie. It\u2019s not that \u201cWar Dogs\u201d isn\u2019t funny; and it\u2019s not as if Todd Phillips has made a buddy-cop comedy about Ferguson, but it is an Iraq War movie made by the director of \u201cThe Hangover.\u201d There are strippers and an underwritten supportive-girlfriend role and Bradley Cooper.Phillips originally approached Hill with the movie a few years ago, offering him either of the two lead roles, but Hill declined, thinking it was somehow too similar to \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street.\u201d Phillips kept trying. Hill appreciated the persistence and eventually said yes. He was driving out of the \u201cyes\u201d meeting in his car when he spotted Phillips leaving separately on his Vespa. Unaware that Hill was watching, Phillips pulled over to the side of the road and did a victory fist pump, by himself, in a moment of unguarded personal joy. Hill found this immensely endearing. (Philips said he does not recall this event but that he believes it happened: \u201cI\u2019ve been known to tool around on my Vespa and I\u2019ve been known to get excited.\u201d) \u201cIt\u2019s funny,\u201d Phillips said of Hill, \u201cbecause in actual life he\u2019s \u2014 \u2018quiet\u2019 is the wrong word, but reserved. If you sit down to lunch with him you\u2019ll laugh, but he\u2019s reserved. When he steps on set, this natural swagger comes out.\u201dIn the movie, Hill plays Efraim Diveroli, an arms-dealing bro from Miami Beach with Scarface-caliber ambitions and a buttery spray tan. The movie is based on a true story, which originally appeared in Rolling Stone and which Hill himself tried to option before finding out that Phillips had already bought the rights. The real Efraim Diveroli does not approve of the movie, has not spent time with Hill and has filed a lawsuit against Warner Bros. The buttery spray tan was applied nightly in Hill\u2019s hotel room by a woman named Felicia, who stood aiming a hose while he pulled his boxers into a thong and revolved. Throughout filming he smelled faintly tropical.To prepare for all his movies, Hill compiles mood-appropriate playlists and then listens to them until they seep into his consciousness. For \u201cWar Dogs,\u201d the playlist involved \u201ca lot of cheesy, baller-y Miami booty bass,\u201d which gives you a sense of his character\u2019s personality: loud, libidinous and whatever the opposite of introspective is. \u201cI imagined him listening to music that revved him up to lie to someone,\u201d Hill said. \u201cA lot of the people with confidence that you play, you try to find their deep insecurity. I don\u2019t think Efraim is a deeply, deeply insecure person.\u201d Instead of making the character a cartoon villain, Hill\u2019s Efraim is gleeful and coercive and menacing, with a helmet of gelled hair and a high-pitched giggle that sounds like the creepiest ringtone on earth. Miles Teller co-stars in the film but disappears in the role; next to Hill, he has the charisma of a corn dog.Hill\u2019s appeal, whatever the genre, is in his instinct to punctuate long stretches of smoothness with florid bloopers. He\u2019s either fully in control of himself or totally at the mercy of his emotions. He has the fallibility of an Everyman with the magnetism of someone millions of young men and women would halt a Ping-Pong game to take a selfie with. A decade ago we idolized celebrities whom we could never, in a million years, imagine being or dating. Lately we have adjusted our expectations downward to prefer figures, like Hill, who could be described as \u201creasonably aspirational.\u201d In person he\u2019s both smooth and blooper-prone, not with cinematic extremity but in a way that makes you think his friends definitely have a lot of Jonah Hill anecdotes in their back pockets. He is a generator of incidents.One morning in June we went for a southbound walk on the High Line. Hill ambled along at a stop-and-smell-the-roses pace, pausing to buy a $1 amulet reading WORK SMOOTHLY LIFETIME PEACE from a (possibly phony) monk and lingering to form a one-man audience for a street performer singing Rick Astley\u2019s \u201cNever Gonna Give You Up.\u201d \u201cI love this song,\u201d Hill said, grooving mildly and retrieving a bill from his pocket. There was no visible donation receptacle, so he put the money on the performer\u2019s side table, where it started blowing away in the wind. To prevent this, Hill slid the man\u2019s nearby iPhone onto the bill to act as a paperweight, but his finger tapped \u201cpause\u201d in the process and the Rick Astley instrumental abruptly ceased. \u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d Hill wailed. \u201cI completely [expletive] that up.\u201d The performer made a \u201cno prob\u201d gesture and resumed singing, then did a back flip, as if to assure Hill that everything was cool between them.As we walked away Hill spoke directly into my tape recorder, as if to guarantee that the corny Rick Astley joke he was about to make would be reflected accurately for future generations: \u201cI want it on the record that he just looked me in the eye and promised me never to hurt me. It\u2019s documented. If that man ever, ever breaks my heart or deserts me, there will be legal repercussions.\u201dAdvertisement"}

You can make it through 11 more weeks.That\u2019s all that remains before the United States presidential election on Nov. 8. It\u2019s a drop in the bucket, really, considering how long the country has been at this.To weary Americans beat down by this divisive, chaotic campaign, 11 weeks may sound like nothing, but Canadians disagree. Last year, that country\u2019s official election season was extended to 11 weeks from its typical five or six \u2014 still light-speed by American standards, but many Canadians saw the extension as an excruciating marathon.\u201cIt was frustrating as a Canadian to watch time being wasted, essentially,\u201d Victoria James, 28, a university administrator in Toronto, said this week.\u201cI have a clear sense of when the Canadian election campaign started, because I know it was a long weekend in August last year,\u201d said Lisa Buchanan, 32, who works in fund-raising for the United Way in Halifax.\u201cAnd I know it ended in October, and it didn\u2019t feel like it was \u2018campaign mode\u2019 prior to that to any great degree,\u201d she said.But the sense is much different as she observes what\u2019s happening in the United States.\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been watching this election coverage for two years \u2014 or at least a year and a half,\u201d Ms. Buchanan said.There\u2019s plenty of United States election coverage in the Canadian news media, leading America\u2019s northern neighbors to look south with a mix of amusement and bewilderment.\u201cMost Canadians think that the length of the presidential election cycle is truly, truly absurd,\u201d said Renan Levine, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Toronto Scarborough.Fair. Many Americans think the length of the presidential election cycle is absurd, too. But when compared to Canadian traditions, the potential absurdity becomes clearer.C. E. S. Franks, a prominent parliamentary scholar and professor emeritus at Queen\u2019s University in Kingston, Ontario, said at the time that the move would be \u201cabout as welcome as a root canal\u201d to Canadians who were more intent on enjoying their summers than thinking about politics.That one occurred five years after Canada was founded, and the lack of a railway to the Pacific slowed down the process.The Canadian aversion to long election cycles comes partly from emotions that a lot of Americans could relate to, he said.\u201cCanadians are like Americans: They hate politics,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a thing Canadians just want to get over with.\u201dNaturally, there is positioning and posturing before the campaign officially begins. In recent years, \u201cmore and more of what looks like a campaign, even if it\u2019s not officially a campaign, does seem to be happening early on,\u201d Mr. Levine, at the University of Toronto Scarborough, said.But the creep of a perpetual campaign in Canada still pales in comparison to what they observe in the United States. Ms. Buchanan, of the United Way, described the American election cycle as \u201cmaybe an inefficient use of people\u2019s time.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know how helpful it is in terms of fleshing out the issues and having constructive debates and conversations about the country and the future,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the length necessarily has helped clarify anything for anybody.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Edward Lampert and His White Whale, Sears", "Date": "2016-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsA tragic figure in American literature has an analog in modern finance. Once upon a time, the billionaire investor Edward S. Lampert was hailed as the next Warren E. Buffett. These days, his decade-plus obsession with the struggling retailer Sears resembles Captain Ahab\u2019s with Moby-Dick.Mr. Lampert was a hedge fund star when he took the discount store Kmart out of bankruptcy in 2003 and merged it with Sears two years later. A devotee of Ayn Rand and Mr. Buffett, Mr. Lampert had parlayed $28 million of seed corn into a spot on the Forbes rich list by making savvy bets on undervalued companies.In 2003, his growing fame attracted unwanted attention when he spent a harrowing day held captive in a roadside Days Inn after being kidnapped him from his Connecticut office garage. The following year, he became the first hedge fund manager to pocket $1 billion in a single year.What Mr. Lampert once called an \u201cenormous undertaking\u201d to revive Sears, once America\u2019s biggest retailer, has become an increasingly forlorn pursuit, however. Sears shares have lost nearly 90 percent of their value since 2007 as the company failed to keep pace with retailers like Walmart Stores, Target and Amazon.com.Mr. Lampert, who became chief executive in 2013 to try to right the ship, has been breaking off pieces of the business \u2014 including its Lands\u2019 End clothing line and some of its real estate \u2014 using exit dividends and other financial tricks to bolster cash. Sears, the original obsession, is no longer his top holding, mainly because it has fallen so much.Turning around a retailer that was once a symbol of American commerce may have been a nobler pursuit than, say, simply collecting fees of 2-and-20 percent from investors in a hedge fund. But extending another $300 million loan last week to Sears is the latest sign that Mr. Lampert does not seem able to let go of the harpoon.As Sears\u2019s controlling shareholder, and its captain, Mr. Lampert may have few other options but to hang on. The new loan from what remains of his investment franchise, ESL Investments, followed similar extensions of credit in April and in 2014. The extra cash should help tide the $1.5 billion retailer through the upcoming holiday season, but the medium-term prospect looks bleak.Like the doomed Captain Ahab, Mr. Lampert should have cut loose a long time ago.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Owes $14.5 Billion in Back Taxes to Ireland, E.U. Says", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe European Union on Tuesday ordered Ireland to collect $14.5 billion in unpaid taxes from Apple, a record penalty that worsened tensions with the United States over the bloc\u2019s crackdown on sweetheart deals with global multinationals.Europe\u2019s competition enforcer said that Apple\u2019s illegal deals with the Irish government allowed the technology giant to pay virtually nothing on its European business in some years. The arrangements enabled Apple to funnel profit from two Irish subsidiaries to a \u201chead office\u201d with \u201cno employees, no premises, no real activities,\u201d the commission said.By doing so, Apple paid only 50 euros in taxes for every million euros in profit during 2014. As part of its ruling, Europe demanded that Ireland recoup 10 years\u2019 worth of back taxes, some 13 billion euros, or about $14.5 billion, plus interest.The amount is a drop in the bucket for Apple, which has a total cash pile of more than $230 billion. Even so, the company described the order as a \u201cdevastating blow\u201d to the rule of law. The United States Treasury Department said it jeopardized \u201cthe important spirit of economic partnership between the U.S. and the E.U.\u201dThe United States government is an unlikely advocate. Politicians have berated Apple for paying too little by setting up complex and opaque tax structures. Officials have hit back against corporate mergers that allowed companies to move their headquarters to places like Ireland to take advantage of lower tax rates.But the positioning in the Apple case reflects a political tug of war over big profitable companies, their potential tax bounty and the rights to regulate them.\u201cU.S. companies are the grandmasters of tax avoidance,\u201d said Edward D. Kleinbard, professor at the Gould School of Law at the University of Southern California and a former chief of staff to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation.\u201cNevertheless, because of the nature of U.S. politics,\u201d he said, the Apple case \u201cwill be framed by the U.S. as Europe overreaching and discriminating against \u2018our team.\u2019\u201dSince early this year, Ms. Vestager and Jacob J. Lew, the United States Treasury secretary, and their teams have met regularly to discuss Europe\u2019s state-aid tax investigations. Mr. Lew visited Brussels in July to put forward the American perspective.Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, called it a \u201ccheap money grab\u201d by the European Commission, \u201ctargeting U.S. businesses and the U.S. tax base.\u201d The Senate Finance Committee chairman, Orrin G. Hatch, said that the decision \u201cencroaches on U.S. tax jurisdiction.\u201dApple and Ireland had similar defenses.Timothy D. Cook, the chief executive of the technology company, said that Europe\u2019s ruling had \u201cno basis in fact or in law,\u201d and called it an effort to \u201crewrite Apple\u2019s history in Europe, ignore Ireland\u2019s tax laws and upend the international tax system in the process.\u201d The company called the effective tax rate \u201ca completely made-up number.\u201dThe Finance Ministry of Ireland said that the commission\u2019s decision would undermine a continuing global tax overhaul and create business uncertainty. The ministry said that taxes were a \u201cfundamental matter of sovereignty.\u201dIreland and Apple both said they intended to fight Europe\u2019s decision, even though any appeals process could take years.The commission said the amount due in Ireland could be reduced if the American authorities decided that Apple should have paid more tax in the United States. Other countries in the European Union could also potentially take a share.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.\u201cThe ultimate goal should of course be that all companies, big or small, pay tax where they generate their profits,\u201d the competition commissioner, Ms. Vestager, said at a news conference in Brussels on Tuesday. \u201cWe need a change in corporate philosophies and the right legislation to address loopholes and ensure transparency.\u201dAlthough the United States appears to side with Apple and Ireland in this specific fight, the overall view is a bit more complicated.Apple and other companies have also faced criticism for keeping large reserves of cash overseas. The money is not taxed at home until it is brought back to the parent company in the United States.Nonfinancial American companies hold a combined $1.7 trillion in cash overseas, according to the credit rating agency Moody\u2019s. Just the international piece of Apple\u2019s stash amounts to nearly $215 billion.Ireland has faced broad scrutiny for its tax appeal.In a matter separate from the Apple case, the United States Treasury has taken aggressive steps to curtail so-called inversions, a tax move that has significantly benefited Ireland. Under those merger deals, an American company would buy an overseas counterpart and shift its headquarters overseas to lower its taxes.Ireland\u2019s corporate tax rate, at 12.5 percent, is one of the lowest in the developed world. Other incentives and breaks allow companies to cut their bills even further. While it is phasing out some of the more contested loopholes, Ireland has just introduced a new break for profit on intellectual property, a potentially huge benefit to large technology companies with troves of patents.\u201cMany member states are not unhappy about the European Commission\u2019s investigations,\u201d said Philipp Werner, a competition lawyer at Jones Day in Brussels. \u201cThey may help to close down tax havens.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Till, visiting from Chicago, was taken from the room that night by two white intruders and, in the next few terrible hours, became the victim of one of the most infamous racial crimes in American history, when he was tortured and murdered for supposedly whistling at a white woman.More than six decades later, the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement and the string of controversial killings of black men by the police have given new impetus to efforts to film the story of Till, with at least three screen adaptations in the works.Mr. Beauchamp said the country\u2019s tense racial climate following shootings of blacks by the police, and retaliatory killings of the police, was the \u201ctipping point\u201d giving renewed impetus to Ms. Goldberg\u2019s participation. \u201cThat\u2019s what made us do this,\u201d he said.Ms. Goldberg\u2019s representatives did not respond to requests for comment on the project.Film history is filled with multiple titles on a single subject, and Ms. Ebert said she did not feel there was a rivalry among the Till projects: \u201cThe history of this nation and of the civil rights movement is much too important to be claimed exclusively by any one person or project.\u201dMr. Anderson said the HBO series and Ms. Goldberg\u2019s film were \u201csuch different projects\u201d that they were hard to compare.A friendly rival with Mr. Beauchamp, Mr. Anderson said he hoped that documentarian wouldn\u2019t put himself in \u201cTill,\u201d the Goldberg feature film, to advance his theories about the case.Mr. Beauchamp\u2019s 2003 documentary, \u201cThe Untold Story of Emmett Till,\u201d drew criticism for its speculation on the number of possible co-conspirators in the killing. (Mr. Beauchamp said he would not be a character in the feature film.)Filming of his script for \u201cTill\u201d is scheduled to begin next year in Mississippi, though Mr. Beauchamp declined to give details of the movie\u2019s financing. Among the producers is Fred Zollo, whose credits include the civil rights dramas \u201cMississippi Burning\u201d (1988) and \u201cGhosts of Mississippi\u201d (1996).In addition to Mr. Wright\u2019s book, the foundation of \u201cTill\u201d will be Mr. Beauchamp\u2019s own research into the case, including previously unreleased F.B.I. files.\u201cI have stuff that\u2019s not in Devery\u2019s book,\u201d Mr. Beauchamp said, adding that he respected the other filmmakers, but that it was \u201c a battle\u201d to be the first to release a work.Advertisement"}

Rural Voters Don\u2019t Forget.", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKAZAMABIKA, Gabon \u2014 For months, Jacqueline Gnagne carefully tended the cassava, corn and peanuts she planted inside a national park. Rangers helped her string barbed wire to protect her crops. Just before harvest time, she even moved into a small cabin at the edge of the field so she could keep a 24-hour watch.Every night she waited. At the first sound of breaking branches, she beat on a metal drum that echoed through the forest of Lop\u00e9 National Park. It was no use. The elephants came anyway. A baby managed to squeeze in between the fence wires. Its mother followed, barreling through. They ate everything.Furious, Ms. Gnagne, the chief of the village down the road, phoned government parks officials who protect the endangered elephants.\u201cLook at what your children have done,\u201d Ms. Gnagne fumed.Mr. Bongo, whose family has held Gabon\u2019s presidency since the Lyndon B. Johnson era, has earned international praise for his commitment to conservation.But as he faces re-election on Saturday, his efforts have earned him something else as well: resentment from many residents who complain that he worries too much about wild animals and not enough about them.Some potential voters said they planned to sit out the vote in protest, repeating a common refrain that can be heard in the forests and on city streets alike: Let the elephants vote for him instead.\u201cElephants can live everywhere; that\u2019s not our problem here,\u201d said Claude Somand-Mayila, who lives in a poor neighborhood in the capital, Libreville. \u201cThere are no jobs in this country. Zero, zero, zero. I\u2019m looking for a change, but there is no change.\u201dTrying to step out from the shadow of his father\u2019s nearly 42-year rule, Mr. Bongo says he wants to win over the population on the basis of his own accomplishments. And in many areas of the heavily forested nation, elephants are standing in the way.So this month, Mr. Bongo brought in electric fencing experts from Kenya to string wires to protect the crops of Ms. Gnagne\u2019s tiny village, a pilot project that he says could be deployed in other villages inside the forest.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to leave anyone by the side of the road,\u201d said Mr. Bongo in an interview at his seaside presidential palace in Libreville.Many people already feel like he has.Mr. Bongo\u2019s conservation efforts are well known abroad. He banned commercial fishing off coastal waters to establish an enormous marine protected area. He expanded the number of rangers and other employees in the national parks, to 750 from 60, to fight illegal logging and poaching in some of the most pristine forests in the world. He is a regular at international climate and conservation conferences.But the president\u2019s passion for trees and animals has also flummoxed many residents in a nation that suffers from tremendous inequality.In a neighborhood of the capital called C\u00e9i, abandoned, rusting cars seem to melt into dirt streets lined by apartment buildings with broken windows and crumbling balconies. A river of trash and sewage winds through the neighborhood. Not far away, government ministers cruise down a coastal highway in Mercedes SUVs.A 2013 McKinsey report commissioned by the government of Gabon classified 30 percent of the Gabonese population as vulnerable, living on about $140 a month.Mr. Bongo said he took the report to heart. In 2014, he said his government created $500 million in new health and education programs, including 40,000 scholarships, aimed at improving quality of life.Mr. Bongo has tried to distance himself from the lavishness that was a hallmark of his father, whose tenure was best known for enriching himself and the loyal elite.Mr. Bongo promised to build a university with money from the real estate sale. He said construction on it and three other universities would start next year. A new mining school opened this summer.Many of Mr. Bongo\u2019s efforts have yet to trickle down to residents, particularly in Libreville, where dense treetops give way to flat tin roofs of ramshackle shacks that stretch across the horizon. Mr. Bongo is urging patience.\u201cThe cities are where the poverty really mostly is,\u201d Mr. Bongo said. \u201cWe have started programs to fight that.\u201dMr. Bongo\u2019s elephant fence project is a small piece of a sweeping plan he said he created to shift Gabon from its heavy reliance on oil revenues. Low prices have caused Gabon to fall behind in payments on government contracts. But even more worrisome, the country\u2019s oil reserves are dwindling.Mr. Bongo has banned the export of timber to encourage local processing, and, for the first time, the country has begun processing its own manganese. The export of all raw natural resources will be banned by 2020.Oil now accounts for about 27 percent of gross domestic product, down from 40 to 50 percent in years past.\u201cOur economic model was too simplistic; it was based on exporting,\u201d said R\u00e9gis Immongault Tatagani, Gabon\u2019s minister of the economy. \u201cOur new model is based on transforming the resources in our country.\u201dExpanding agriculture is one central element. Most of Gabon\u2019s tiny population of 1.7 million lives in a handful of crowded cities. Mr. Bongo wants to lure them back to the land.A new cooperative program offers training, financing and several acres to anyone who will uproot themselves to work the land in rural areas. At least 13,000 people have enrolled, said Gagan Gupta, country director for Olam International, an agriculture company partnering with the government on the program.But no one can farm successfully if the nation\u2019s 40,000 forest elephants eat the harvest.In Ms. Gnagne\u2019s village, which was settled in the forest long before it became a national park, signs of elephant invasion on a recent morning were everywhere. Bushes were trampled. Heaps of dung were visible.Nearby, workers were installing the 125-acre, solar-powered wire perimeter that packs enough voltage to scare off a two-and-a-half ton elephant.\u201cWe could avoid importing $800 million dollars\u2019 worth of food if we can get agriculture going,\u201d said Lee White, Gabon\u2019s director of national parks.With the new fence, Mr. Bongo said he was trying to balance the needs of the population with his passion for conservation.It is the same philosophy Mr. Bongo said he applied when creating a palm oil plantation, though those kinds of projects are often criticized by conservationists because the operations swallow trees and animal habitats.Officials used new satellite technology to identify a site for the 250,000-acre operation that they said would do the least damage to biodiversity. The government said it expected the project to create 12,000 jobs.Mr. Bongo is also hoping to lure investors to his new economic zone, where they can operate tax-free for 10 years. So far it has 91 companies, which employ about 1,000 Gabonese workers, said Jasveer Singh, chief executive of the zone.On a recent afternoon, workers punched in at Gabon Wood Industries, a company with Malaysian investors that processes timber. All but 11 of 82 employees of the company are Gabonese.\u201cI\u2019m voting for the president,\u201d said Kombe Gustave, who was one of them. \u201cHe\u2019s for all the people, for the Gabonese.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He saw an urban dystopia of poverty, crime and blight, \u201cthe living, breathing example of my opponent\u2019s failed economic agenda.\u201d Hillary Clinton arrived Thursday. Speaking in suburban Warren, she saw an upbeat comeback story of grit and innovation. \u201cI just wish my opponent in this election saw the same Michigan I do,\u201d she said.Detroit used to be a pretty clear story. It was a symbol of American economic might and then it was a symbol of American urban ruin. But in a place not given to deep philosophizing \u2014 where the literary canon is defined by the razor-edged crime novels of Elmore Leonard \u2014 almost no one here seems entirely sure what to make of this moment\u2019s Detroit.But what that means for the rest of the city and who is benefiting have set in motion a layered conversation about development, equity, race and class. It is playing out with particular force here in what was once the nation\u2019s fourth-largest city and is now a place at once grappling with poverty, crime and failing schools, but also still animated by the bones of its former glory.\u201cThat encapsulates where Detroit is now,\u201d said David Blaszkiewicz, president of Invest Detroit, a nonprofit that has invested $251 million in financing for the Metropolitan and other real estate and business projects over the past 20 years. \u201cWe can make things happen today that we couldn\u2019t make happen for the past three or four decades.\u201dThe lack of progress is just as noticeable in the sprawl of often dilapidated neighborhoods, baking in the summer heat.At Maison\u2019s Fine Food Diner on Detroit\u2019s East Side, the city\u2019s resurgence seems as distant as the Alps. Yellowing sports memorabilia dating to the boxer Thomas \u201cHitman\u201d Hearns decorates the wall, along with a faded sign reading: \u201cOut of a job yet?

It\u2019s just as dead as dead can be.\u201dTonya Banks, one of the waitresses, added: \u201cIn Detroit, everyone\u2019s on defense. There\u2019s not enough to go around, so everyone\u2019s against each other.\u201dMayor Mike Duggan, who became Detroit\u2019s first white mayor in 40 years when he was elected in 2013 and presided over the city\u2019s emergence from 17 months in bankruptcy, ran on the platform of \u201cEvery neighborhood has a future.\u201d He says he is delivering on the promise.\u201cPeople in this city understand where we are and where we are going,\u201d he said. \u201cThis city went from 1.8 million people in the 1950s to less than 700,000 now. There\u2019s been a 60-year decline, where we lost more than a million people, and those people who left didn\u2019t take their houses with them. So, the magnitude of what we\u2019re recovering from is enormous, but the recovery has started.\u201dThere is ample evidence that he is right. No one doubts how serious the problems are from the disastrous state of the schools to the threadbare transit system to the challenges of adding enough jobs to fuel a sustainable recovery. But more than 10,000 blighted properties have been demolished, removing dangerous eyesores and usually allowing neighbors to buy the vacant lots for $100. An additional 2,000 homes are being rehabilitated and reoccupied.There are about 5,000 new housing units either planned for construction or being built. Housing prices have ticked up, and the city\u2019s toxic foreclosure problem shows signs of improving.In a city notorious for not even being able to even light its streets, more than 62,000 new LED street lamps have been installed. Officials say the whole city will be relit by the end of the year. And the most recent Census Bureau estimate showed the smallest population decline in decades. Officials predict that next year\u2019s figures will show a population gain.Many people are buying in. Seven years ago, Dave Kwiatkowski opened the Sugar House craft cocktails bar in the Corktown neighborhood. Now, he runs four other bars or restaurants, with another, The Bad Luck Bar, expected to open in the revitalized Capitol Park area downtown this fall. He said 35 restaurants were set to open in Detroit within the next 18 months.Mr. Kwiatkowski, who is white and grew up in suburban Detroit, said he wanted to be a part of the city\u2019s rebirth. \u201cIt was time to put my money where my mouth is,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, Detroit\u2019s cool. There are easier cities to live in, with more conveniences or whatever, but people who live in Detroit choose to live in Detroit and are excited to. It makes for a very cool vibe.\u201d\u201cTo say you love 5% of Detroit is like ordering a hamburger, eating the sesame seeds on the bun, and claiming you love hamburgers,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNo sir, you like sesame seeds. You love the Tigers. You love 4 miles of Woodward. But Detroit is not what you love.\u201dHe is impatient with all the narratives about Detroit that do not begin and end with the thought that Detroit and all its far-flung tendrils really matter. It was once a great city that fostered an enormous black middle class, most of whom have stuck around through the bad times and expect to be part of Detroit\u2019s next act.\u201cWe\u2019re a bit spoiled in Detroit, because we have been an African-American community that has prospered, has had safe neighborhoods, that has expected success,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not thinking about some imaginary utopia. I want my childhood for my child in my city, and I\u2019m not willing to be limited by talk about how things are in the rest of America. I don\u2019t want Detroit to be like the rest of America.

I believe that fewer debt-financed purchases will lead to lower prices rather than the rising costs precipitated, in part, by easy access to credit.That, and the two-income household, did much to contribute to inflation. Prices outpaced the purchasing power of average wage earners, which contributed to burgeoning debt with all the consequences seen in the 2008 financial crisis.JOHN A. VITERITTILaurel, N.Y.To the Editor:I was struck by the apparent and unquestioned assumption among those you interviewed that credit card use essentially leads to irresponsible spending and debt.It\u2019s troubling that the founder of a financial literacy site featured in your article appears to be promoting this assumption by her own unapologetic reluctance to demonstrate responsible credit card use. The implication seems to be that credit cards are intrinsically negative instruments that compel irresponsible financial choices.This is not a particularly helpful lesson in the financial education of members of any generation.I applaud those who avoid credit cards because they have demonstrated an inability to use them responsibly. But suggesting that credit card avoidance constitutes a responsible financial management strategy is ultimately a disservice to responsible consumers, who are left with no mechanism to demonstrate personal fiscal responsibility to potential lenders.Better to focus on addressing the behavioral issues contributing to financial irresponsibility rather than reinforcing a negative perception of a valuable financial instrument.PATRICK N.

{"Headline": "Luck Unites a Couple for a Lifetime of Great Collaborations", "Date": "2016-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt Home With8 PhotosAIKEN, S.C. \u2014 Two years ago last April, Gregory White Smith turned to Steven Naifeh, his partner in business and life, and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d It was a good question, though those were Mr. Smith\u2019s last words.They had spent the last 25 years restoring a profoundly decrepit 60-room former Whitney estate in this tiny Southern town, a sometimes hapless and quixotic endeavor they chronicled when they were seven years into the project, in a 1996 memoir that has been republished this year as \u201cA Restoration Comedy: On a Street Called Easy, in a Cottage Called Joye.\u201dAnd they had done all these things while Mr. Smith battled the brain tumor that he was told he had in 1974, the year the two men met at law school, through 13 brain surgeries, kidney and facial surgeries, radiation, chemotherapy, nuclear treatments and constant pain.The cancer, a hemangiopericytoma, was so rare and so deadly, the diagnosis earned Mr. Smith the cover of the New England Journal of Medicine. Yet he lived decades beyond his terrible medical odds until that Thursday in April 2014 when Mr. Smith came home to die.\u201cI don\u2019t know that he was asking me the ultimate question,\u201d Mr. Naifeh said. \u201cI think basically he was telling me, \u2018I know I\u2019m dying, I\u2019m trying to imagine what comes next, but also I don\u2019t want you to worry too much.\u2019\u201dJoye Cottage, built in 1835, was at first a farmhouse and then a boardinghouse, before it was worked over by Stanford White, and then Carr\u00e8re & Hastings, into a rambling family estate \u2014 a sampler of Gilded Age styles \u2014 for William Collins Whitney, a voracious house collector, power broker and rake, and his second wife, Edith Randolph, who broke her neck riding and died soon after they had moved in.Whitney had extended the house\u2019s footprint into a sort of splayed H shape, a confounding floor plan for a visitor, who got lost (twice!) on her way to a bathroom, but one that humanizes its square footage. Rooms aren\u2019t gigantic, there are just a lot of them.Joye Cottage took its name from its first owner, Sarah Joye, and its address really is Easy Street, which seemed like a benediction when Mr. Smith and Mr. Naifeh bought the disintegrating collection of rotting plaster, timber and brick from a would-be developer for $495,000 in 1989.In 1980, the last Whitney owner had been forced to sell the place during a divorce, at which point the elements took over as the new owner\u2019s plans for the property never materialized. In their book, Mr. Naifeh and Mr. Smith described the real estate agent\u2019s tour as a \u201cperverse, reverse sales pitch,\u201d a laundry list of fatal flaws and dire warnings about its leaking roofs and fetid contents.And yet they were entranced, though even today Mr. Naifeh can\u2019t quite fathom why two workaholics not given much to entertaining would want to live in a 60-room house with 12 bedrooms, and spend 25 years restoring it.They even added 10 more rooms, excavating a subterranean space that now houses an art gallery, a library, a screening room and a pool that\u2019s a homage to the Barcelona Pavilion, a modernist underbelly designed by Mr. Smith (and completed just before his death) for a 19th century pastiche.Ranging through these rooms, alone for the first time in his adult life, Mr. Naifeh said he feels as if Mr. Smith has just walked out the door. It certainly looks as if he has. In Mr. Smith\u2019s office, his desks are still stacked with papers, photos, note cards, letters, architectural renderings, window catalogs, children\u2019s paintings, a clutch of highlighters in various colors and the notebooks into which he entered his blood pressure and meds, every single hour of every single day.Mr. Smith, a soft-spoken Midwesterner, and Mr. Naifeh, the child of diplomats who grew up in the Middle East, met their first week of law school, in a coup de foudre that Mr. Naifeh still marvels over. \u201cGreg was the first really close friend I ever had and the smartest person I ever met,\u201d Mr. Naifeh said. \u201cFor someone who\u2019d been a good student and not very socialized to have that kind of friend was really powerful.\u201dBut it took them both some time, he added, to come to terms with being in a relationship: \u201cWe had big egos and neither one of us was even out of the closet. Being gay 40 years ago was not like it is today.\u201d(Mr. Naifeh said he was the only boy in his prep school who voted against relaxing the haircut rules. \u201cI was the best little boy in the world and if the teachers wanted haircuts at a certain length, then I did, too,\u201d he said. \u201cI also voted for Richard Nixon.\u201d)They started writing books together almost immediately, to pay their law school tuitions. One was a primer on men\u2019s style, even though neither cared about clothes and had realized pretty quickly the law profession was not for them because they were allergic to its uniform of suits and ties. Still, they earned $10,000, \u201cvery fast,\u201d Mr. Naifeh said, \u201cwhich was a lot of money for us.\u201dMr. Naifeh was the researcher and Mr. Smith the writer, a symbiosis so complete they would forget they were two different people. Shopping for artwork for their house (\u201cson of, student of,\u201d is how Mr. Naifeh described their purchasing plan for affordable work that Vincent Van Gogh, the subject of their 2011 best-selling biography, might have seen or admired), they could look at the same 400 paintings in a catalog and know exactly which ones the other would choose.When Mr. Owens visited Joye Cottage in 1996, he said: \u201cOne would start a sentence and the other would finish. I know it sounds like a clich\u00e9, but it really happened. I remember going through my interview notes later and trying to figure out which man had said what. There was no way to split the sentences that made sense.\u201dThe $250,000 they earned for \u201cHow to Make Love to a Woman\u201d financed both the purchase of an apartment in New York City, the sale of which paid for Joye Cottage, as well as their Pollock biography, which took 10 years to complete. The advance for that book was $22,500, Mr. Naifeh said, adding that the typing bill alone was $100,000. When they won the Pulitzer in 1991, they bought a tractor with the $3,000 award.\u201cWhat was sort of amazing is that we came out to three of our four parents in the magazine,\u201d Mr. Naifeh said. \u201cThe writer was interested in the fact that two gay men were living in a small southern town and were accepted there. Greg said: \u2018You know what? Maybe there will be some kid with his mother in some barber shop in Arkansas and he\u2019ll read this and think, There are two guys who seem pretty successful and pretty happy and maybe life won\u2019t be so terrible.\u2019\u201dSo, Mr. Naifeh recalled, Mr. Smith called his parents and said, \u201c\u2018Mom and Dad, there\u2019s going to be an article in People magazine about things you might not want to read in a publication,\u2019 and Greg\u2019s dad said, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, we know everything about you and we love you.\u2019 But it turned out he didn\u2019t, and was more than a little surprised. We were left to wonder, what deep, dark secret did he think we were hiding?\u201dMr. Naifeh added: \u201cI think our parents just thought of us as two crazy guys who worked all the time. The fact that we had written \u2018How to Make Love to a Woman\u2019 confused everyone.\u2019\u201dIn 2001, with their house partly restored, they began another artist\u2019s biography. Like Pollock, \u201cVan Gogh: The Life\u201d was a 10-year project. And like Pollock, there were some bombshells in their research: Van Gogh didn\u2019t commit suicide, they averred. He was murdered by two teenage thugs.Meanwhile, they kept at their work in Joye Cottage. Halfway through \u201cVan Gogh,\u201d the men turned to the ballroom, which they had filled with cubicles for the employees of their publishing company.The room had been created by George Macculloch Miller, also known as Cully, who was an artist who was married to Flora Whitney, a grandchild of William C. Whitney\u2019s, out of an existing bedroom wing. When the publishing company team outgrew the space, they moved them to a building in town, and Mr. Smith began puzzling out how to add detailing and flourishes to the gutted space.When Mr. Smith once more asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d the couple decided to dig down, excavating under their house for a library, pool, screening room and a gallery for Mr. Naifeh\u2019s artwork \u2014 these are large scale, precisely rendered geometric abstractions based on Middle Eastern motifs.They broke in the ballroom with a hunt ball in February 2014, though neither man could ride, or even dance, for that matter. Still, Aiken is hunt and polo country, and they were nothing if not good neighbors. (When they won their Pulitzer Prize, and word of the award reached Aiken, a woman at their local grocery store exclaimed, \u201cAren\u2019t y\u2019all the two famous riders?\u201d When they corrected her \u2014 \u201cThat\u2019s writers, not riders,\u201d Mr. Naifeh said \u2014 her face fell.)Their ball was on the 100th anniversary of a party first given by William Whitney. But Mr. Smith was too sick to attend.A month later, at the First Baptist Church here, Joye in Aiken held a performance of Bach\u2019s \u201cSaint Matthew Passion.\u201d Mr. Smith wasn\u2019t able to attend that, either, but Mr. Naifeh brought him a recording from the evening. It was the last music he heard.Mr. Naifeh said that Mr. Smith\u2019s eagerness to take on ever more elaborate projects was his way of challenging his medical diagnosis. With no guarantee that he could finish any project, Mr. Naifeh said, he delighted in every one.\u201cAll I had to do was be that one sunny day out of 10,\u201d Mr. Smith wrote in \u201cMaking Miracles Happen,\u201d he and Mr. Naifeh\u2019s 1997 book about patients, like Mr. Smith, who had survived despite their terrible diagnoses. \u201cAll I had to do was beat the odds.\u201d Despite those odds, Mr. Smith always felt lucky. \u201cThe trick, of course, is to make the most of that luck,\u201d he wrote.Mr. Naifeh\u2019s tour ended in the Modernist space beneath their house. Past the Miesian pool, which Mr. Smith didn\u2019t get the chance to swim in, to the library, where shelves were lined with editions of \u201cVan Gogh,\u201d now in eight languages, among many other Smith-Naifeh collaborations, and down another few steps to the gallery.Among other work, there\u2019s a gleaming chrome-plated blossom of a piece by Mr. Naifeh and a large-print photograph of Mr. Smith and his brother as children.\u201cWe were so lucky,\u201d Mr. Naifeh said. \u201cStarting with the coincidence of how we managed to meet. It changed our lives forever.\u201dAn article last Thursday about the former Whitney estate Joye Cottage, in one instance, omitted part of the title of a book by the mansion\u2019s restorers, Gregory White Smith and Steven Naifeh. As the article correctly notes elsewhere, it is \u201cHow to Make Love to a Woman,\u201d not \u201cHow to Make Love to Woman.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nobel Laureate Joseph Stiglitz Says the Euro Needs Big Reform", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.The nasty headlines from across the Atlantic \u2014 Brexit, terrorism, debt crises \u2014 almost make us forget that these were supposed to be Europe\u2019s salad days. With a common currency and increasing integration, Europe was, finally, bidding adieu to cross-border conflict and economic crisis. Turmoil and strife were so very 20th century; the future was to be only digital apps and polyglot cafes.Well, they still have Chartres, and they still have Goethe. They also have millions of migrants, rising nationalism, recurrent recessions and plummeting birthrates. What went wrong?Stiglitz is not speaking about the obvious fact that 19 independent states use a common currency, but about their failure so far to create the quilt of institutions and shared regulations to make it work. This sounds wonky, and though Stiglitz spews plenty of populist rhetoric, \u201cThe Euro\u201d is thick with dense paragraphs (imagine an economics text written by Michael Moore). Still, the underlying idea is \u00adsimple.American states like Alabama and Vermont certainly differ from one another, but they benefit from a shared political fabric far more than, say, Belgium and Greece. Stiglitz\u2019s main point is that for the euro to work \u2014 and for \u201cEurope\u201d to work \u2014 its nation-states will have to function more like American states.If Americans think of the euro at all, it\u2019s typically to marvel at its convenience for tourists, though those of a certain age may harbor nostalgia for the francs, lire and pesetas with which we trekked from hostel to chateau. But all those quaint notes were a planner\u2019s nightmare. Depending on the rate of exchange, a German could afford to buy wine from Burgundy or olive oil from Tuscany one month but not the next. The euro fixed all that.The problem is that currency fluctuations were a useful escape valve. What if France entered into a severe recession while the German economy remained robust? Thanks to the laws of Adam Smith, the franc would drop relative to the mark, and voil\u00e0, Germans would buy more Perrier and Peugeots, and the imbalance would start to correct. Now, France has no currency to depreciate.Ah, the careful reader will say, then why do the individual American states (which are similarly locked into a single currency) function better? What\u2019s the safety valve for Rhode Island or Mississippi?Actually, there are several. If the price of oil is slumping, Texas oilmen will contribute less to the federal budget; some of the tab will be picked up by citizens in states that are doing better. And since more people in Texas will be eligible for federal welfare programs, like unemployment insurance, federal outlays will increase. These programs act as automatic stabilizers.Europe lacks such stabilizers. The common budget is only 1 percent of Europe\u2019s economy, a stark contrast to America, where the federal budget is roughly 20 percent. Thus, countries like Greece that are suffering hard times have nowhere to turn. Stiglitz argues for \u201cmore Europe,\u201d meaning an expanded budget and common welfare programs, and a mutualized system of deposit insurance (so that failing Greek banks are not dependent merely on other failing Greek banks, but on healthy German ones as well).This part of Stiglitz\u2019s argument is conventional. So is his diagnosis \u2014 that the European leaders who implemented the euro in the 1990s did so largely for political reasons (getting rid of the mark was France\u2019s price for accepting a reunified Germany). And Stiglitz\u2019s moral \u2014 \u201cBe careful not to let economic integration outpace political integration\u201d \u2014 is well stated.However, that textbook argument against the euro is only part of Stiglitz\u2019s brief. He also takes aim at the \u201ctroika\u201d of policy institutions (the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission) for obsessing over inflation rather than job creation. He is right to indict the drones in Brussels and the bankers in Berlin for imposing budget austerity and unrealistic debt repayment schedules (he likens them to \u201cmedieval bloodletters\u201d). Herbert Hoover didn\u2019t lick the Depression, and austerity hasn\u2019t worked in Greece. Stiglitz is also right to fault the European project, in general, for its nondemocratic character.But his attacks on the troika devolve into a sort of rant against neoliberal capitalism. Markets ain\u2019t perfect; they need to be regulated, and the losers in a market system need to be protected.Yet the market remains the best social construct for pricing goods and rationing demand. Stiglitz accuses the troika of being motivated by its supposed enmity for government. He, on the other hand, shows his mistrust for the market on practically every page. He wants bank credit decisions screened according to his own political criteria. He berates industry for investing in \u201ccapital-intensive techniques of production, contributing, over the long run, to unemployment.\u201d (That was also said about the tractor.) He faults the troika for following a political agenda instead of a neutral policy, yet repeatedly urges European leaders to tilt the scales in favor of small and medium-size businesses as opposed to \u201cbig corporations.\u201d If these are not political criteria, what are?Many of his charges have a vague, rhetorical air. He throws around words like \u201cmonopolist\u201d without specifics. He writes that unnamed \u201cGreek oligarchs\u201d had \u201ca controlling interest in banks and the media and were exploiting the linkages between the two.\u201d Which banks?And when he says, repeatedly, that the troika was wrong about government spending being a major cause of the crisis, because Spain and Ireland saw their economies implode over free-market errors, he runs into a problem. The problem is that Greece, which suffered the worst crisis, and is the example on which Stiglitz spills the most ink, was largely caused by its bloated public sector. Stiglitz admits this.Far from the measured analysis that one might expect from a renowned economist, \u201cThe Euro\u201d has the strident tone of a political pamphlet. Italics are everywhere, as if the reader were being screamed at. There is a numbing incantation of faults attributed to the troika (did they do anything right?). And Stiglitz uses the unfortunate tactic of impugning his adversaries\u2019 motives; the troika is not merely wrong, it is guilty of \u201chypocrisy,\u201d of \u201cdishonesty\u201d and of \u201csheer hypocrisy\u201d \u2014 and that\u2019s all within two pages.Stiglitz even descends to slurs evoking the Nazi era. Taking issue with Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Germany\u2019s finance minister, for emphasizing economic rules, Stiglitz says, \u201cOf course, many of the most heinous crimes have been committed by those who simply said they were just obeying rules.\u201d His bias against wealthy European states, Germany in particular, subtly infects the book. Stiglitz generally presents Greece as Germany\u2019s victim, rather than as an actor in its own depression; he says Germany\u2019s trade surplus forces Greece, and others, to run deficits (if one country is a net seller, someone else must be a net buyer). It would be equally true to say that Greece\u2019s deficit imposes on Germany the burden of running a surplus. The fact is, German industry is more productive.None of this undermines Stiglitz\u2019s argument that Europe needs a redivision of currencies to rebalance trade. Although Stiglitz would like to see \u201cmore Europe\u201d \u2014 that is, common rules and institutions and even a common tax framework so the euro can work \u2014 he doubts that the political will exists. In its absence, he would splinter the euro into, say, two or three currencies, perhaps trading freely, perhaps (a less draconian break) trading only within limited bounds, until the day when the continent is ready to attempt a single currency again. Either way, Europe is having its Articles of Confederation moment. Its leaders should grasp that superimposing one financial system on 19 political fiefs cannot work.Roger Lowenstein is the author, most recently, of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Bank: The Epic Struggle to Create the Federal Reserve.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "On the Bauhaus Trail in Germany", "Date": "2016-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Bauhaus Building rises over Dessau, a small, postindustrial city in eastern Germany, like a futuristic message from the past. With its suspended glass facades, exposed steel gridding and asymmetrical layout, the three-wing complex feels both modern and familiar. But when it was finished in 1926, it was downright alien.Like a transparent cube levitating over the town, the building was the crystalline culmination of Bauhaus\u2019s global vision, one so wildly influential that it\u2019s difficult today to find some corner of design, architecture or the arts that doesn\u2019t bear its traces. The tubular chair, the glass-and-steel office tower, the clean uniformity of contemporary graphic design \u2014 so much of what we associate with the word \u201cmodernism\u201d \u2014 has roots in a small German art school that existed for only 14 years.Founded in 1919 in Weimar by the up-and-coming German architect Walter Gropius, the Staatliches Bauhaus combined the fine arts, crafts and design under one roof with the aim of creating a Gesamtkunstwerk, or total work of art. It existed in three German cities \u2014 Weimar, Dessau and Berlin \u2014 and under three architect-directors: Gropius, Hannes Meyer and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe.Its development paralleled that of the Weimar Republic, rising from the rubble of the First World War, flourishing in the political, economic and cultural chaos of the interwar years, and ending in 1933 with the rise of the Third Reich. Bauhaus teachers included some of the most important artists of the modern era \u2014 Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, Josef Albers and Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, to name a few \u2014 many of whom fled Germany after the school\u2019s closure under pressure from the Nazis, leading them to pollinate Bauhaus ideas throughout the world, primarily in the United States.The number of visitors to major Bauhaus institutions has been climbing, yet most of them, Ms. Jaeggi said, come from outside Germany. Indeed, on my trip, I encountered a historical oddity: Despite its global import, Bauhaus is not widely revered in its country of origin.This has something to do with the conflation here of Bauhaus and modernism, as well as with the fact that Bauhaus is also the name of Germany\u2019s largest home improvement chain. But there\u2019s a bigger reason, which can be glimpsed through the window of a Deutsche Bahn train hurtling through the outskirts of nearly any German city. The proliferation of cheap, boxlike concrete-slab high-rises that spread like bacteria throughout Germany\u2019s bombed-out cities after World War II is a Bauhaus legacy, for better or worse.\u201cFor many people,\u201d said Dr. Jaeggi, \u201cBauhaus has more of a negative aspect than a positive one.\u201dYet a closer look at Bauhaus and the German modernist architectural movement known as Neues Bauen, or New Objectivity, makes clear how little these movements had to do with the prefab obscenities of postwar modernism. Today, many Bauhaus devotees hope the centenary program will sow domestic interest and pride in the movement at a time when Germany is bitterly divided over its reception of refugees and reckoning with its cultural identity.Though small, Weimar, a leafy, picture-book tourist town about 50 miles southwest of Leipzig, has an outsized cultural significance in the country. Yet as pretty as the hometown of Goethe and Schiller is, there\u2019s something stifling about Weimar\u2019s cobblestone Old Town, with its faux-medieval terrace restaurants full of retirees contentedly eating fruitcake.Only recently has Bauhaus joined in earnest Weimar\u2019s pantheon of cultural accolades. It was here that Gropius, a handsome 36-year-old architect decorated for valor in World War I, was asked to head a new school formed from the merger of the Weimar state schools of applied and fine arts. When he opened the Bauhaus in 1919, he recruited master teachers and called for artists and craftsmen to create the \u201cbuilding of the future.\u201dOccupying a suite of Art Nouveau school buildings, the early Bauhaus was \u201cmore than a school,\u201d as Tom Wolfe wrote in his 1981 book \u201cFrom Bauhaus to Our House.\u201d \u201cIt was a commune, a spiritual movement, a radical approach to art in all its forms, a philosophical center comparable to the Garden of Epicurus.\u201dWith their long hair and androgynous clothing, Bauhaus students lived together, worked together and held wild, legendary parties, built around themes (Lantern Festival, Kite Festival) that in later years became increasingly high-concept (Metal Festival, Beard, Nose and Heart Party).The school\u2019s early Expressionist direction was shaped by the eccentric Swiss painter Johannes Itten, who taught Bauhaus\u2019s famous required course on the fundamentals of color, form and material. A self-styled mystic who shaved his head and dressed in robes, Itten was the school\u2019s resident mad priest. He was a strict vegetarian and a follower of Mazdaznan, a Zoroastrian fire cult that originated in the United States.Itten\u2019s studio was in the Tempelherrenhaus, a mock-Gothic tower designed by Goethe that was damaged in World War II. Its ruins today look out on the spot where Itten required his first-year students to do yoga, chanting and breathing exercises before class.Visitors can also see reconstructions of fantastic wall murals (the originals were destroyed by a Nazi-appointed administration): Oskar Schlemmer\u2019s stylized human figures, a clear influence on Fritz Lang\u2019s 1927 film \u201cMetropolis,\u201d and geometric abstract compositions by Herbert Bayer, a member of Kandinsky\u2019s workshop after the Russian painter joined the faculty in 1922. That year also saw the temporary appointment of Theo van Doesburg, the founder of the Dutch De Stijl movement, who influenced Bauhaus\u2019s aesthetic shift toward constructivism.Only on a tour can visitors enter Gropius\u2019s faithfully reconstructed office, which was a showpiece for the first official Bauhaus exhibition in 1923. Like an antigravity Rubik\u2019s Cube, the entire room is defined by a square-within-a-square concept based partly on Renaissance ideas of proportion, from the seemingly floating arms of the rectangular wood-and-canvas armchair to a lighting system made of tubular bulbs affixed to aluminum rods by wooden linking cubes.The exhibition also included the nearby Haus am Horn, the school\u2019s first test house. Designed by Georg Muche, then the \u201cform master,\u201d or artistic director, of the Bauhaus weaving workshop, the house, with its flat roof and white facade, reflected the latest technical standards and industrial materials: cinder block walls, notoriously faulty Torfoleum insulation and opaque glass skirting boards. All were part of a shift from craft to industry. In his introduction to the 1923 exhibition, Gropius announced the school\u2019s revised motto: \u201cArt and technology \u2014 a new unity.\u201dThough the 1923 exhibition was an art world sensation, it failed to pacify the increasingly conservative government of Thuringia, which had been funding the Bauhaus. Germany was buckling under economic hardship, which, together with the ideological aftershocks of World War I, had made it a breeding ground for nationalist ideas. With its avant-gardism and leftist leanings, Bauhaus had never been popular in Weimar, but when the Nazis joined the Thuringian parliament in 1924, the Bauhaus knew it was time to ship out.In 1925, the Bauhaus moved to the rising factory town of Dessau, and work began on its new, radically modern headquarters, which would house everything from workshops to student accommodations.Daily guided tours explore the Bauhaus Building; the nearby Masters\u2019 Houses, a suite of partly reconstructed residences where Gropius, Klee, Moholy-Nagy, Albers and the other Bauhaus masters lived; and a workers\u2019 housing project on the edge of town. Designed by Gropius, these structures were constructed by his private firm.It\u2019s impossible to experience the prismatic, cinematic effect of the Bauhaus Building without moving through and around it. The building looks out at itself, glass-and-steel grids that layer into lattice, creating ever-new angles and futuristic vistas.Glass curtain walls extend to transparent corners. Large panels of steel-framed glass windows open with the pull of a chain. The Gropius-designed metal door handles became the prototype that Germany essentially adopted en masse (Gropius tried, unsuccessfully, to sue for copyright infringement).For visitors who want an immersive experience, the Bauhaus Dessau Foundation offers overnight stays in the Studio Building, which once housed junior masters and promising students. For 35 to 60 euros per night (about $40 to $67), you can rent a room featuring a vertiginous railed balcony. There is no Wi-Fi, and historical authenticity extends to the communal bathroom on each hall, but for the Bauhaus pilgrim, there\u2019s no better way to spend the night.Lying in a studio room, looking out huge paneled windows over the pitched red roofs of Dessau, I wondered what it must have been like for students inside this futuristic laboratory while, outside, a poverty-stricken Germany churned with reactionary chaos. What seems spartan today felt to many Bauhaus students, according to their written recollections, like paradise: a room and three meals a day, served in the Studio Building\u2019s first-floor canteen, which today offers hearty, no-frills German fare.The canteen connects to the auditorium, which features an expanded version of the geometrical tubular ceiling lighting system that debuted in Gropius\u2019s Weimar office, and an extraordinary linked system of tubular steel chairs, designed in 1926 by a 24-year-old Hungarian named Marcel Breuer. Many of the furniture pieces made famous later by Le Corbusier and Mies owe much to the bicycle-handlebar-inspired creations of Breuer.Weissenhof became a kind of world\u2019s fair for the architectural aesthetic championed at the Bauhaus: flat roofs, sheer walls, industrial materials, stripped-down ornamentation. The Weissenhof Estate, a museum since 2007, is one of many German sites that attest to the fact that color \u2014 particularly primary colors \u2014 was an essential aspect of early modernist architecture.Under the motto \u201cLicht, Luft und Sonne\u201d (light, air and sun), designing the living space of the future became the highest purpose of Bauhaus and Neues Bauen.The construction of low-cost prefab housing became increasingly important to Gropius, who resigned from the Bauhaus in 1928 to devote himself to it. Moholy-Nagy left the same year, lamenting in his farewell speech the decline of the artist within the school and saying Klee and Kandinsky were there only \u201cto create atmosphere.\u201d Gropius\u2019s successor, Hannes Meyer, a radical functionalist, reorganized the school, yet his staunch Communist affiliations led to the rise of a large Communist cell within the school.The press attacked, and Meyer resigned in 1930, heading to Moscow with a \u201cred Bauhaus brigade.\u201d His pragmatic replacement, Mies, transformed Bauhaus in its latter years into a full-fledged school of architecture.When the Nazis took control of the Dessau City Council, the Bauhaus was forced to move yet again. In 1932, Mies set up the school in an abandoned factory in Berlin, financing it with his own money. But in 10 months the Gestapo shut the Bauhaus down for good as Hitler rose to national power.After Bauhaus\u2019s closure, the Nazis continued to persecute its former members, accusing them of \u201ccultural Bolshevism.\u201d Some died in the camps, but many escaped to western Europe and the United States.Gropius and Breuer were hired by the Harvard Graduate School of Design, where they reshaped the curriculum. Moholy-Nagy founded Chicago\u2019s New Bauhaus, which evolved into the Chicago Institute of Design. Mies also settled in Chicago, where he became a celebrated architect. And Josef and Anni Albers set up an art school in the hills of North Carolina called Black Mountain College, a tremendous incubator of the American avant-garde that helped launch the careers of John Cage, Merce Cunningham, Buckminster Fuller, Robert Rauschenberg and Cy Twombly, among others. In 1938, the Museum of Modern Art cemented the influence of the Bauhaus with a major exhibition.The great irony of Nazi persecution of the Bauhaus is that driving it out of Germany only served to spread its ideas.\u201cToday remembering the Bauhaus is more important than ever,\u201d said Ms. Huskamp of the Dessau Foundation, referring to the refugee crisis and Germany\u2019s internal conflict about how to respond. \u201cIn these times \u2014 especially in Germany, where a lot of people want our society to close itself off more and more,\u201d she added, \u201cit\u2019s important to be aware of what it means to be open-minded, what it means to be international as a matter of course, of what it means to be modern.\u201dCharly Wilder is a writer based in Berlin and a frequent contributor to The New York Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Think Tanks Amplify Corporate America\u2019s Influence", "Date": "2016-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThis can become a productive, mutually beneficial relationship,\u201d Bruce Katz, a Brookings vice president, wrote to Lennar in July 2010. The ultimate benefit for Brookings: $400,000 in donations from Lennar\u2019s different divisions.\u201cHe would be a trusted adviser,\u201d an internal Brookings memo said in 2014 as the think tank sought one $100,000 donation from Lennar.Think tanks, which position themselves as \u201cuniversities without students,\u201d have power in government policy debates because they are seen as researchers independent of moneyed interests. But in the chase for funds, think tanks are pushing agendas important to corporate donors, at times blurring the line between researchers and lobbyists. And they are doing so while reaping the benefits of their tax-exempt status, sometimes without disclosing their connections to corporate interests.Similar arrangements exist at many think tanks. On issues as varied as military sales to foreign countries, international trade, highway management systems and real estate development, think tanks have frequently become vehicles for corporate influence and branding campaigns.The shift has occurred as nonprofits in general have been under increasing pressure from their donors to meet specific goals. But for think tanks, that pressure can threaten their standing as independent arbiters in policy debates in Congress, the White House and the news media.\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice to go back to the greatest generation, in the post-World War II era of philanthropy, where they said, gosh, \u2018Here is $1 million; spend it how you wish,\u2019\u201d Kimberly Churches, the managing director at Brookings, said in an interview.Think tank executives reject any suggestion that they are tools of corporate influence campaigns and say they are simply teaming up with donors that have similar goals, like helping cities with economic development.But he acknowledged that the arrangement to appoint the Lennar executive as a senior fellow had created the \u201cappearance of a conflict of interest.\u201d And he said that Brookings, in the interest of transparency, had recently decided to prohibit corporations or corporate-backed foundations from making anonymous contributions.Still, the benefits afforded to corporations looking to cloak themselves with the authority of think tanks are strikingly evident, according to a review of documents from more than a dozen institutions.The likely conclusions of some think tank reports, documents show, are discussed with donors \u2014 or even potential ones \u2014 before the research is complete. Drafts of the studies have been shared with donors whose opinions have then helped shape final reports. Donors have outlined how the resulting scholarship will be used as part of broader lobbying efforts. The think tanks also help donors promote their corporate brands, as Brookings does with JPMorgan Chase, whose $15.5 million contribution is the largest by a private corporation in the institution\u2019s history.Despite these benefits, corporations can write off the donations as charitable contributions. Some tax experts say these arrangements may amount to improper subsidies by taxpayers if think tanks are providing specific services.The Brookings Institution \u2014 long recognized as one of the most prestigious think tanks in the world \u2014 has aggressively courted corporate donors over the last decade, particularly for its Metropolitan Policy Program, which formed partnerships with JPMorgan Chase, Lennar Corporation, K.K.R., Hitachi and others. Here is an examination of the deals with these donors, based in part on thousands of pages of internal Brookings documents.Executives at Brookings, the Center for Strategic and International Studies and other think tanks say they have systems in place to ensure that their reports are based on scholars\u2019 independent conclusions.\u201c\u2018Are you going to say drones are bad?\u2019\u201d she recalled one potential financial backer asking. \u201c\u2018We are not interested in funding something that says drones are bad.\u2019\u201dThe confidential Brookings spreadsheet had an unassuming title: Corporate Overviews Tracking. It listed nearly 90 corporations, from Alcoa to Wells Fargo, providing a glimpse of the vast electronic file that Brookings maintained on donors and prospects, and the benefits it might offer.The database, along with thousands of pages of emails, solicitations for money and memos on meetings with corporate officials, highlighted Brookings\u2019s practice of assuring that donors would see results from their contributions.The files included company priorities and a tally of donations. General Electric wanted to fund work on rail networks and clean energy programs \u2014 both critical parts of its business \u2014 and Brookings then featured G.E. executives, joined by officials from the White House and Congress, at events that focused on these industries.From the start, the program blended a variety of insights on urban matters, including from corporate, nonprofit and government sources. And Mr. Indyk noted that any reports issued were made public.Donations to the program exploded, from $4.3 million in 2005 to $12.5 million in 2013, nearly 20 percent of Brookings\u2019s overall program spending that year.In advance of a 2014 event Brookings officials attended with corporate executives including Henry R. Kravis, a co-chairman of K.K.R., one memo marked as confidential noted: \u201cK.K.R. has given a total of $350K to Brookings. Last gift came in on 3/27/2014 for $150K to Metro; Henry has donated $75K to Brookings, most going to the individual unrestricted fund.\u201dThe tally demonstrates the important distinction that Brookings makes between \u201cunrestricted\u201d donations, which the think tank can spend on any research, and project-based funding restricted to specific topics that the donor has a particular interest in.The San Francisco project generated controversy from the beginning, with critics concerned about toxic waste left by the former Navy shipyard.A spokesman for Lennar, Glenn Bunting, disputed claims that the company had donated to Brookings out of self-interest \u2014 and said the alliance was not related to the protests.\u201cThere was nothing needed in the way of assistance for Lennar to \u2018buy\u2019 from Brookings,\u201d Mr. Bunting said in an email. Brookings, though, continued to promote the project.The think tank soon delivered.But Mr. Indyk acknowledged that naming Mr. Bonner, who declined to be interviewed, a Brookings nonresident scholar had \u201ccreated the impression that because Lennar was giving money, he was getting the title.\u201d His post, which was unpaid, was not renewed.Officials at Brookings said they had not lobbied for Hitachi, and they provided examples of reports that they said included conclusions challenging the company\u2019s position. \u201cHelping a corporation\u2019s for-profit agenda is not in any way our agenda,\u201d Ms. Churches, the managing director, said.Yet Ms. Churches also said the contract language with donors like Lennar and Hitachi was \u201cinelegant,\u201d although not improper.When asked if the documents read like a fee-for-service agreement, she said, \u201cIt could be misconstrued.\u201dMr. Indyk said Brookings had recently changed its policies so that \u201ctoday, there is no way in which those words would be used in our documents.\u201dThe project was premised on a common interest between the bank and the think tank. Brookings wanted to promote economic growth in cities by encouraging international trade, and JPMorgan wanted to gain new business by offering loans to companies in the same markets.Mr. Indyk and executives from JPMorgan said the company and the think tank simply agreed on a worthy agenda.\u201cThis was about growing the economy, and we are incredibly proud of the results of this initiative,\u201d said Peter Scher, the head of the corporate responsibility program at JPMorgan. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s had a huge impact in more than 30 cities that are involved.\u201dAt the same time, hundreds of pages of memos \u2014 status reports to JPMorgan, internal reports by Brookings staff to prepare for meetings with top bank executives, and formal documents soliciting more money \u2014 make clear that Brookings saw the Global Cities Initiative as a branding effort that could help JPMorgan bolster its standing in cities.And Brookings was ready to do its part.At times, Brookings officials seemed worried they were not doing enough for the bank.\u201cNo one wants to create overt marketing opportunities for JPMC, but we need to carve out roles and thought leadership opportunity for market presidents,\u201d said a 2013 Brookings memo, referring to a dinner with the bank\u2019s executives. \u201cWe need to do a better job tying it back to JPMC.\u201dIt remains difficult to assess whether the relationship helped the bank\u2019s business, but Mr. Scher said that was not the goal.\u201cIf the Global Cities Initiative strengthens the economic competitiveness of cities, it\u2019s a win for small businesses, job creation and everyone involved in these communities, including us,\u201d Mr. Scher said in a statement.Donations from the corporations to Brookings are tax exempt based on the premise that the think tank\u2019s work benefits the public good, not a company\u2019s bottom line.\u201cTax deductions are subsidies that are paid for by all taxpayers,\u201d Ms. Fleischer said. \u201cAnd the reason the subsidy is provided is that the charitable organization is supposed to be doing something for the public good, not that specifically benefits the private individual or corporation in the form of providing them goods or services.\u201dMr. Indyk said that opinion was \u201ctotally unfounded,\u201d noting that Brookings had retained its own lawyers to review the documents and found no problems.Other think tanks have been even more closely aligned with corporate agendas.The Atlantic Council, which has seen its annual revenue grow to $21 million from $2 million in the last decade, offers access to United States and foreign government officials in exchange for contributions. Individual donors, like FedEx, have also helped fund specific reports that align with their agendas.Six months before the Atlantic Council report was issued, FedEx and the think tank worked on plans to use the report as a lobbying tool.FedEx and the Atlantic Council, working with the European American Chamber of Commerce, also told companies being asked to participate in the study that the goal was to \u201cemphasize the positive impact that a comprehensive agreement would have on American and European small businesses.\u201dAn executive vice president at FedEx, Rajesh Subramaniam, attended an event at Atlantic Council headquarters in Washington to celebrate the release of the final report. So did a key supporter, Representative Erik Paulsen, Republican of Minnesota.Frederick Kempe, the Atlantic Council president, said that FedEx had donated just $20,000 to help fund the effort and that the staff at the Atlantic Council had handled the research.\u201cThere is no doubt the work of think tanks has more credibility than the work of lobbyists, but the only way we preserve it is through intellectual independence,\u201d Mr. Kempe said.General Atomics, the California-based manufacturer of Predator drones, had a clear problem. Prospects for sales were falling as the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq wound down. The company wanted the Obama administration to change its policy to allow for sales to other countries, a lucrative proposition.At about that time, the industry turned to the Center for Strategic and International Studies for help, providing money that the think tank used to conduct a study on drone policy, including exports.While defense contracting giants like Lockheed Martin and Boeing have cumulatively donated at least $77 million since 2010 to two dozen think tanks, disclosure records show, General Atomics\u2019s contribution to the Center for Strategic and International Studies was quite small \u2014 in the tens of thousands of dollars.As General Atomics was lobbying for a change in export rules governing its unmanned aerial vehicles, it helped fund a report at the Center for Strategic and International Studies that also pushed for the change.As a think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies did not file a lobbying report, but the goals of the effort were clear.Boeing and Lockheed Martin, drone makers that were major C.S.I.S. contributors, were also invited to attend the sessions, the emails show. The meetings and research culminated with a report released in February 2014 that reflected the industry\u2019s priorities.\u201cI came out strongly in support of export,\u201d Mr. Brannen, the lead author of the study, wrote in an email to Kenneth B. Handelman, the deputy assistant secretary of state for defense trade controls.But the effort did not stop there.Mr. Brannen, who has since left C.S.I.S., declined to comment. The think tank insisted that its efforts to influence administration policy were not lobbying.\u201cC.S.I.S. will not represent any donor before any government office or entity, including congressional lawmakers and executive branch officials,\u201d Mr. Hamre, the chief executive, said in his statement to The Times. \u201cWe do not lobby.\u201dOne thing is clear: The result was a victory for General Atomics.A State Department spokesman said that while the government officials involved in the review had received opinions from think tanks and industry officials, \u201cat the end of the day, this is a considered U.S. government policy.\u201dLater, after he had joined the Hudson Institute and helped create the Center for American Seapower, he approached Huntington officials again, and they were interested.\u201cA think tank has more prestige,\u201d Mr. McGrath said.Huntington Ingalls paid $100,000 to fund the work, a critical commitment for Mr. McGrath, who said he was paid by Hudson only if he could successfully solicit donations to support his research.Mr. McGrath said he had always been a strong proponent of aircraft carriers, so the company was not buying his opinion.\u201cThe Hudson Center makes no secret about being very pro-sea power,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a company came that wanted us to write a piece that advocated for something other than that, the answer would be no.\u201dIn exchange for Huntington Ingalls\u2019s support, company officials were given regular briefings on the research and the opportunity to suggest revisions to early drafts, Mr. McGrath said.Huntington Ingalls, the sole builder of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers in the United States, and other players in the shipbuilding industry were looking for ways to increase or maintain funding for the construction of these giant ships. They turned to think tanks for help. Here is a look at the strategy, which involved the Hudson Institute and others.\u201cWe have an iterative process already laid out in which we will sit down with them and go through drafts and discuss where we are going,\u201d Mr. McGrath said. He added that he had not accepted all of the company\u2019s suggestions.The strategy \u2014 lining up think tank reports as lobbying tools that echoed each other \u2014 was backed up with a series of letters to the editor, dozens of posts on Twitter and Facebook, and op-ed pieces.Mr. McGrath said he, too, wondered if this storm of industry-funded work might be threatening the integrity of the process.\u201cI see a lot of stuff that comes out in Washington,\u201d Mr. McGrath said, \u201cand I got to scratch my head and say, \u2018That guy must be on the payroll.\u2019\u201dBrooke Williams is a reporter at the New England Center for Investigative Reporting, which collaborated with The New York Times on this series.

{"Headline": "Why Monthly Auto Sales Numbers May Not Be What They Seem", "Date": "2016-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDETROIT \u2014 The steady growth in the American automobile market has been an economic success story: Carmakers set a record last year by selling more than 17.4 million new vehicles.But with consumer demand leveling off after six consecutive years of rising sales since the industry\u2019s near collapse during the financial crisis, car companies are under increasing pressure to show strong monthly numbers, however they can.After all, carmakers\u2019 monthly vehicle sales figures \u2014 the latest batch are expected on Tuesday \u2014 are the industry\u2019s scoreboard. Pride and investor confidence are at stake, even if strong sales numbers are not always a reliable indicator of a carmaker\u2019s financial strength.The tactics for stoking the monthly figures include deep discounts, low-profit sales to rental-car fleets and programs to prod dealers to buy excess inventory.But even if the government finds that Fiat Chrysler crossed a legal line in inflating its numbers, virtually every carmaker is doing whatever it takes to make sure no car it makes goes unsold.Companies regularly pay dealers to buy cars for loaner programs or as demonstration models. And throughout the industry, automakers are relying on big sales to rental fleets to bolster overall results \u2014 although those sales are far less profitable than one-by-one retail sales to consumers.So far this year, industry sales are running slightly ahead of last year\u2019s record pace. But analysts are projecting minimal gains, if any, when automakers report their July results.\u201cWe\u2019ve had six straight years of unprecedented growth, and there\u2019s no way that can be sustained forever,\u201d said Michelle Krebs, an analyst with the firm Autotrader. \u201cA dip is inevitable.\u201dFor automakers, it is far easier to put incentives on slow-selling vehicles or sell them to rental-car companies than it is to cut production in the factories. That would require shifting or idling workers, and modifying parts deliveries.So far this year, about 14 percent of all sales made by automakers have been to rental-car fleets, according to the auto research website Edmunds.com. Another 5 percent go to large commercial customers or government agencies.\u201cThere\u2019s an advantage for some automakers to use daily rentals to introduce your brand to new customers,\u201d said Jessica Caldwell, an analyst for Edmunds. \u201cBut as growth slows, it can also be used to keep sales up and inventories lower.\u201dEdmunds predicts that 1.52 million new vehicles were sold in July, which would represent an increase of less than 1 percent from the same month last year.Ms. Caldwell says she expects automakers to roll out new incentives, particularly cut-rate financing deals, to stimulate demand for the remainder of the year.The revelation that Fiat Chrysler is under federal investigation has prompted more scrutiny of the company\u2019s particularly strong sales record in recent years. While it has been successful selling trucks and sport utility vehicles, its cars have languished behind competing models from Toyota and Honda, for example.As a result, Fiat Chrysler is selling more cars to rental fleets. An analysis by the research firm Kelley Blue Book found that about 35 percent of cars sold under the company\u2019s Chrysler and Dodge brands end up in rental lots.\u201cCompanies are loath to stop production of poor-selling models,\u201d Ms. Krebs said. \u201cThe alternative is to dump them into rental.\u201dBesides Fiat Chrysler, the companies with the highest level of fleet sales are Ford Motor, Hyundai Motor, Kia Motors and Nissan Motor, according to Kelley Blue Book. The lowest include Honda Motor, BMW and Mercedes-Benz.General Motors, the largest American automaker, has been strategically reducing its fleet sales since last year. Each month, the company highlights its increase in retail sales \u2014 and decline in rentals \u2014 as a measure of its profitable growth.Last week, G.M. surprised analysts by reporting that profit grew more than 150 percent in its second quarter, to $2.9 billion. The strong results reflect a greater emphasis on retail sales than on fleet business.\u201cDaily rental continues to decline as a percentage of our total sales,\u201d Alan Batey, G.M.\u2019s head of North American sales, told reporters at a briefing last week.And G.M.\u2019s profit margins are growing because of it. The company said it recorded pretax margins of about 12 percent in North America during the quarter, compared with 10.5 percent a year ago.By comparison, Ford\u2019s margin for the quarter, on a profit of $2 billion, was about 11 percent. Fiat Chrysler\u2019s second-quarter profit of 321 million euros, or about $355 million, had a margin of just under 8 percent.Fiat Chrysler\u2019s chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, praised G.M.\u2019s margins as exceptional in a conference call with analysts last week. And he said that closing the profitability gap \u201cremains a permanent fixation\u201d for his company.That could be a difficult objective if the overall market remains flat.Ford\u2019s net income for the quarter was 9 percent lower than a year earlier and below Wall Street\u2019s expectations. Ford officials warned that the current sales boom may have peaked.\u201cWe see the second half being softer than the first half of this year,\u201d said Bob Shanks, Ford\u2019s chief financial officer. \u201cLooking into 2017, we will see further softness.\u201dMs. Krebs, of Autotrader, said automakers naturally wanted to extend the good times as long as possible, leading to more incentives and questionable practices like pushing dealers to buy cars as demonstration models.\u201cThese are things we see when we\u2019ve passed the peak of the cycle and are heading downward,\u201d she said.Besides Fiat Chrysler, though, no other car companies are known to be under investigation over their sales numbers. Its competitors so far have resisted commenting publicly on Fiat Chrysler\u2019s problems, but they are seeking to distance themselves from what could become the industry\u2019s latest scandal.\u201cI only know what I have read about them,\u201d Mr. Batey said. \u201cBut I will say that our system of reporting sales is top-notch, and we have no issues.\u201dBill Vlasic reported from Detroit, and Neal E. Boudette from Ann Arbor, Mich.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Trump Doesn\u2019t Know About Detroit", "Date": "2016-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis year\u2019s Republican nominees have echoed Mr. Romney.Just as Mr. Romney was wrong eight years ago, so, too, have Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence been wrong more recently. I know, because as lead auto adviser in the Obama administration, I was there.In late 2008 and early 2009, when General Motors and Chrysler exhausted their cash reserves, traditional sources of private capital that typically provide liquidity to companies during a bankruptcy reorganization fled to the sidelines.Without government assistance (provided first by President George W. Bush and then by President Obama), the giant automakers would have been forced to stop production, lay off their workers and close their doors. The ripples would have cascaded through the auto industry, causing already strapped suppliers to shut down as well. With the flow of parts interrupted, other manufacturers, including Ford, would have been compelled to halt assembly, at least for a time.Instead, temporary infusions of government capital helped shepherd G.M. and Chrysler through managed bankruptcies that installed new management and fundamentally restructured unsustainable liabilities and cost structures.Fast forward to 2015, when a record number of new vehicles were sold in the United States by companies that were hiring new workers, paying existing workers more and earning the highest profits in their history. Meanwhile, of the $80 billion invested by Washington in the auto sector, all but about $9 billion was returned to taxpayers \u2014 money well spent to save a cornerstone industry and perhaps more than a million jobs.Since 2009, double-digit unemployment rates in key auto states have dropped precipitously; the jobless rate in Michigan is currently 4.6 percent, below the national average, down from 14.9 percent in June 2009. In Mike Pence\u2019s own Indiana \u2014 the No. 3 state for auto manufacturing \u2014 the unemployment rate is 4.8 percent, down from a peak of 10.9 percent in early 2010.Mr. Trump\u2019s confusion about the automobile industry extends well beyond bankruptcy questions.In 2013, he tweeted, \u201cAfter Obama bailed out G.M. for $80 billion, 7 of 10 G.M. cars made in China!\u201d Wrong on multiple counts. It wasn\u2019t $80 billion; it was $49.5 billion for G.M., of which $13.4 billion was provided by the Bush administration. (Another $30 billion was allocated to Chrysler and the automobile finance companies.) Nor are most G.M. cars made in China; in fact, hardly any General Motors cars made in China are brought to the United States.In 2012, Mr. Trump tweeted that Chrysler was going to move its Jeep production to China. Wrong again. Jeep is making vehicles in China only for Asian markets.What\u2019s particularly notable about the auto rescue is the difference between how the auto industry was restructured and how bankruptcy has worked, Donald Trump style.In many of Mr. Trump\u2019s multiple insolvencies, he scratched, clawed and bullied creditors into leaving him with a substantial share in the reorganized company, allowing him to profit from any future success. He also sometimes kept a management role \u2014 or at least a title \u2014 along with hefty fees for licensing his name or providing other \u201cservices.\u201dBy contrast, when General Motors and Chrysler entered bankruptcy, we insisted that the existing shareholders be wiped out as a condition of receiving government money. And we replaced failed management.In fairness, Mr. Trump\u2019s musings about the auto bailout have not always been uniformly negative. Back in 2008, he said of the auto companies, \u201cI think the government should stand behind them 100 percent.\u201d And a nugget of truth lies nestled in his rantings about the state of trade between Mexico and the United States. As Mexican workers have become more productive (while remaining relatively low paid), major automakers have shifted assembly to plants south of the border.That\u2019s an unfortunate \u2014 although not unusual \u2014 byproduct of economic development. The solution is not to slap on huge tariffs and start a disastrous trade war, as Mr. Trump suggests, but to develop new jobs requiring the higher skill levels of American workers.Had Mr. Trump\u2019s vision of a free-fall bankruptcy been implemented, a result would have been a dramatically shrunken American auto industry and even more of those job-killing imports that he claims to detest.Steven Rattner, who served as lead auto adviser in the Obama administration, is a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The E.U. Is in Crisis. Two Economists Disagree on Why.", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionAmericans tend to struggle to grasp the ways of the European Union, which admittedly are complex and often arcane. It\u2019s unhelpful that much of the writing on the continent\u2019s seminal postwar project lapses into the same euro-jargon that the union\u2019s technocrats and think tanks employ. Many Europeans can\u2019t make sense of it either, which is one explanation for the triumphant Brexit vote and the historically low trust in the E.U. that Europeans everywhere express today. The community is indisputably mired in its most acute crisis since its founding in the 1950s.Yet contemporary Europe is incomprehensible without it, so thoroughly does the E.U.\u2019s existence suffuse the everyday lives of its 508 million citizens, the governance of the 28 member states and a $15\u202ftrillion economy. This is why the short\u00adish, lucid books of the Brussels-based journal editor Giles Merritt and the American economist James K. Galbraith deserve particular attention. In accessible prose flush with strong argument, they diagnose the E.U.\u2019s problems \u2014 and offer prescriptions on how to deal with them. Though the community is currently preoccupied with Britain\u2019s vote to leave, the influx of migrants, an economy still reeling from the financial crisis, the ascent of far-right parties and a declining global market share, both authors believe deeply in the E.U.In order to get at the community\u2019s core deficiencies, Merritt first punctures some of the myths that unfairly damage its credibility. A favorite of euroskeptics is that the E.U. is a gigantic, autonomous \u201csuperstate\u201d that runs Europe from Brussels. In fact, the E.U.\u2019s largest body and its executive arm, the European Commission, has a staff of just 23,000, smaller than many national government ministries.Moreover, most E.U. legislation is not in the form of written law, but rather \u201cdirectives\u201d to the states, whose legislatures then turn them into law. The heavy lifting is done by the member states. As for autonomy, it is the states that drive the E.U., whether through their national ministers in the Council of Ministers, one of the E.U.\u2019s legislative bodies, or the commission, where state appointees deal with everything from agriculture to consumer protection. The governments call the shots, and it is therefore at their feet that Merritt lays most of the blame for the E.U.\u2019s malaise.In the same vein, the E.U. has come under fire for its policies guaranteeing workers\u2019 freedom of movement within the union. In the Brexit campaign, anti-E.U. voices charged that its provisions enabled Central Europeans to swamp Britain. In fact, demographic analyses show that northern Europe needs many kinds of workers now and will increasingly require more in decades to come. Although European politicians know this too, many can\u2019t sell this argument to their electorates, just one example of the dichotomy that pits the interests of elected national officials against those of the greater good, embodied in the E.U.Merritt, despite his substantial respect for the E.U., argues that bold, sweeping reforms are imperative to meet the challenges of the 21st century. Global warming, terrorism, globalized markets, mass migration, militarized geopolitics and the digital revolution all require supranational attention. On their own, he argues, the individual nation states of Europe, Britain included, are doomed to irrelevance.Yet there\u2019s much more consensus on the union\u2019s shortcomings than on how to address them. The so-called democratic deficit, for instance, refers to the lack of transparency and accountability in the E.U.\u2019s decision-making process. The council, the \u201ctrue legislative body,\u201d meets behind closed doors. The European Parliament\u2019s elected M.P.s exercise some power, yet no one is held responsible for failure. And then there are the unelected civil servants. No democratic state worth its salt would permit such basic transgressions of democratic procedure. But the E.U., Merritt charges, gets away with it.Furthermore, the E.U.\u2019s rigidity undermines its ability to promote innovation. Europe lags woefully behind the United States and China in turning digital technology into commercial success. Meager investment in R&D has hurt Europe\u2019s productivity and thus global competitiveness, causing Europe\u2019s share of the international market to stagnate while its rivals post gains. In more ways than one, Merritt argues convincingly, the E.U. is stuck in the 20th century.Until the Brexit vote, the single greatest blow to the E.U. had been the post-2008 tribulations of the euro, called the eurocrisis, which manifested itself as a devastating debt problem that upended the economies of southern Europe and Ireland. The threat of insolvency forced the wealthier northern Europeans, above all Germany, to bail out the troubled nations at high cost, both financially and in terms of good will.James K. Galbraith, the son of the great Keynesian economist John Kenneth Galbraith, had, as an adviser to the left-wing Syriza government in Greece, a front-row seat at pivotal moments in the showdown between the E.U. (and the International Monetary Fund, too) and Greece, the hardest hit of the debtor nations. The E.U. erred egregiously, he writes, in making draconian austerity policies the price of Greece\u2019s rescue while letting the continent\u2019s banks off scot free. The wrongness of this prescription, he says, is borne out today, five years later, with Greece prostrate under the burden of the E.U.\u2019s highest external debt (in relation to its economy\u2019s size), the highest unemployment (29\u202fpercent) and grim social and psychological fallout. Deep budget cuts and higher taxes have cost Greece a quarter of its pre-crisis wealth, rendering a recovery impossible, according to Galbraith, perhaps forever. Greece\u2019s withdrawal from the eurozone, he suggests, would have been preferable.Galbraith understands the eurocrisis largely as a byproduct of the global banking and financial disaster triggered in the United States in 2007, which the \u00adcenter-right governments in Germany and France exploited to crush the left-wing government in Greece and its allies elsewhere in southern Europe. Leftist governments, Galbraith says, won\u2019t get relief from the punishment of austerity, slashed wages, reduced pensions and the fire sale of state assets until their politics return to the center. Until then, they will suffer and the wealth disparity between northern and southern Europe will widen.Greece, Galbraith writes, could become something like \u201ca Caribbean dependency of the United States. Its professional population will continue to leave, and its working classes will also either emigrate or sink into destitution. Or perhaps they will fight.\u201dFighting, however, didn\u2019t get Syriza or Galbraith\u2019s friend, the controversial \u00adJanuary-to-June-2015 Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, very far. Even a national referendum rejecting the terms of a bailout didn\u2019t manage to dilute the poison the Greeks had to swallow. The way out, argues Galbraith, ever the Keynesian, is a multipronged approach that includes a spending program like the postwar Marshall Plan.For his part, Merritt presents the recipes of several research institutions, all of which call for rejuvenating the E.U.\u2019s structures to make them more democratic, flexible and efficient. He, like Galbraith and other E.U. advocates, insists that deeper political and economic integration is the answer. Yet, he concedes, because Europe\u2019s political spectrum is fractured as never before, with national interests regularly trumping common cause, the lesser evil at the moment may be smaller, tactical interventions to complete the single market, invest in research, modernize infrastructure and strengthen foreign policy mechanisms.Doing nothing at all is the worst option, the authors agree, a conclusion dramatically reinforced by the Brexit vote. That would condemn the E.U. to muddle from crisis to crisis until finally one of those crises takes it down once and for all.Paul Hockenos is a Berlin-based writer.

{"Headline": "New York\u2019s Stalled Residential Construction", "Date": "2016-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt first blush, it seems as if times are good for the real estate industry in New York.The superhigh end \u2014 as in apartments for $10 million or more \u2014 has met with headwinds recently, but people continue to stream into New York, while developers benefit from cheap capital and a pro-growth mood. Apartments have been built and sales overall have been strong.Some projects have nonetheless struggled to take off.Less than ideal locations have sidetracked several, even if they are just a few blocks from a hot area. With others, developers and neighbors have locked horns. Some developers blame their old foe, high taxes, while bemoaning the loss of tax abatements. Then there are those that have foundered for reasons that aren\u2019t exactly clear, leaving their sites shrouded in mystery.Projects that were announced with hoopla are only partly finished, and some areas await services like a new school or park improvements that were promised years ago as part of plans for a development.Stalled projects can be found around the city, including a glassy tower designed by Foster & Partners off Sutton Place, a 65-story spire on East 37th Street in Midtown, and a 1,700-unit mixed-use complex on the East River in Queens.Developers say delays are normal and no cause for alarm, even though building permits have expiration dates and loans can have strict terms about construction start dates and other milestones.Some of the developers and developers\u2019 representatives who were contacted for this article refused to talk on the record about their projects; even then, most had little to say beyond asserting that the projects would eventually be built. Others failed to return multiple phone calls over the course of weeks.\u201cI think we are due for a reset in the residential condo market,\u201d said Jason Meister, a senior director and an investment sales broker at Ackman-Ziff Real Estate Group, a commercial brokerage. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see the beginning of a correction.\u201dMany developers thought they had a can\u2019t-lose formula for building condos: Find a site in the middle of Manhattan, hire a marquee architect and make sure the tower is among the city\u2019s tallest.From early 2014 until this past winter, the developer, the Bauhouse Group, appeared on track, purchasing three contiguous apartment buildings at 428, 430 and 432 East 58th Street, between Sutton Place and First Avenue, for about $32 million, buying out tenants and snapping up air rights, to the tune of $120 million.In some ways, the 113-unit project was at a disadvantage from the start. While the building is just a block from 57th Street, which has become known as Billionaires\u2019 Row for its seven- and eight-figure apartments, the area around the building is farther east, much quieter and lacking in showy shops.The alliance is urging the city to put a limit of 260 feet on building height in the area, which, if enacted, would require Bauhouse to lop many stories off the building\u2019s top. Mr. Kersh hopes any rezoning happens before construction resumes. \u201cWe are literally in a race with the developer,\u201d he said.In the meantime, the south side of the block, where the tower was supposed to rise, has a forlorn look. The windows of the emptied buildings at Nos. 428, 430 and 432 have holes or plywood where glass used to be.Mr. Beninati declined to comment on the project because of the pending litigation. N. Richard Kalikow, Gamma\u2019s chief executive officer, did not return several calls for comment.Of course, timing is crucial to a project\u2019s success.In 2015, Nef, a Turkish developer, announced plans to put up a 65-story condo at 12-14 East 37th Street, a site near Madison Avenue that now contains a pair of five-story buildings. The design for the building called for crisscrossing beams visible through a steel-and-glass facade and five gardens interspersed throughout its more than 700-foot height.But as it is, Nef, a six-year-old firm that partnered with B & F Management, the property\u2019s owner, never filed for building permits, according to city records. And this past spring, the property, which has a deli and fast-food restaurants at its base and 103,000 square feet of developable space, was listed for sale with Ackman-Ziff, before being taken off the market in July.Trying to bring condos to market in Midtown right now might be a risky play, since the area is saturated with inventory, brokers say. And unloading the land may no longer be smart, they add, because sites that were trading at $750 per foot a year ago have dropped to as low as $600 a foot today, giving owners little reason to sell.Mr. Meister, of Ackman-Ziff, declined to share the property\u2019s list price but said the site had received some offers. He declined further comment about the property.Hakan Kocer, Nef\u2019s chief strategy officer, said in an email that his firm had not abandoned the condo project and that discussions were continuing.Overall, the new construction market in New York still seems strong. In the second quarter of this year, the average sales price per foot of newly built apartments in Manhattan was $2,577, up from $2,011 in the year-ago quarter, according to Douglas Elliman Real Estate.But, many of those condos are taking longer to sell, the firm said, with an average time on the market of 196 days, up from 130 in the second quarter of 2015, or a 51 percent hike.But a plan from the Elad Group, a prominent luxury developer, to put condos above Amtrak tracks on West 43rd Street, between Tenth and 11th Avenues, has not gotten very far.The project was announced with great fanfare in summer 2014, when Elad bought the site for $43 million, and later given a boost when the city changed the zoning to residential from industrial. The City Council approved the plan in April 2015. But the project seems to have stalled. Trash-lined tracks were visible on a recent afternoon, with no platform in sight.Yoel Shargian, Elad\u2019s chief operating officer, says the project is alive, according to a message relayed through Lauren Hovey, a spokeswoman. Shalaiwah Alveranga, the marketing and sales manager for Elad, referred specific questions to Richard Cantor, a principal of Cantor-Pecorella, a marketing firm retained for the project.Mr. Cantor said there are no signs of activity at the project because of negotiations with Amtrak, whose trains would run under the complex. \u201cThe delay in commencing construction is not market-driven, but due only to delays in getting Amtrak\u2019s final approval,\u201d he said in an email.Mr. Cantor added that groundbreaking for the project, which will be financed by Bank Hapoalim of Israel, will likely take place this fall, with the building to open in 2018.Craig Schulz, an Amtrak spokesman, confirmed negotiations were ongoing. \u201cThere are often a number of issues that need to be worked out with these kinds of projects,\u201d he said in an interview, \u201cand some take longer than others.\u201dWhile concerned neighbors and conservative lenders may throw monkey wrenches into some projects, some sites simply seem jinxed.At 1800 Park Avenue, a blocklong site in Harlem at East 125th Street, for instance, various owners have come and gone without leaving much of a trace.Once parking lots for the New York College of Podiatric Medicine, the site was purchased in 2007 by a development team led by Vornado Realty Trust. An office building, Harlem Park, was planned; Major League Baseball was to be among its tenants. But the owners let the property sit fallow and ultimately sold it, in 2013, to a group led by the Continuum Company, for $66 million.Even with an industry veteran, Ian Bruce Eichner, at its head, Continuum didn\u2019t have much luck there either. Intent on building a residential tower designed by ODA New York that at one point was to stretch 32 stories, Continuum fell behind on payments to a financial backer, Garrison Investment Group, defaulting on its loan. The building never materialized.Now the Durst Organization is in contract to buy the property, which is covered with gravel, while an old rendering hangs from a fence. Because Durst is a major developer of rental complexes, brokers speculate that Durst will eventually build apartments on the site.Jordan Barowitz, a Durst spokesman, said he could not comment while the sale process played out. But Eric Yaverbaum, a Continuum spokesman, said, \u201cWe\u2019ve come to an acceptable resolution.\u201dThe intersection, one of Harlem\u2019s busiest, has struggled to reinvent itself. Even as the underside of the Metro-North tracks there sports a festive plaza, where arts events and exercise classes are held, shuttered stores wrap a corner across the street.\u201cBanks still look at this area as risky,\u201d said Holley Drakeford, an associate broker with the Harlem-based Giscombe Realty Group. \u201cThey say to developers: \u2018Why would somebody pay fair market value for an apartment there, and how would you pay me back?\u2019 \u201dBut Mr. Drakeford believes it\u2019s only a matter of time before the site succeeds. \u201cMillennials will be here soon,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re like nomads.\u201dIf private loans are now tougher to secure, especially for untested developers, policy decisions don\u2019t always break their way either, developers say.In January, after a political standoff between the real estate industry and labor unions, the state\u2019s 421a property tax abatement expired, depriving many developers of what they say is an essential financing tool.The end of the abatement, which exempts developers from some property taxes in exchange for building affordable rental housing, seems to have halted construction plans at Hallets Point, an industrial hub in the East River in Astoria, Queens. Only a couple of years ago, developers were predicting a complete transformation of the area.But Alma, which was offering 1,700 apartments, 459 of which, or a hefty 27 percent, were to be income-restricted, never broke ground, according to company officials. Today, the site, which was also supposed to include a public school, is a tangle of trees and old warehouses. Nor has a promised public bathroom been built at a nearby park.\u201cThe Astoria Cove project will bring to this community much needed infrastructure, housing, retail, jobs, economic development, along with a world-class waterfront esplanade and much discussed public ferry service to connect this previously isolated neighborhood to the rest of the city,\u201d said John Mavroudis, a principal of 2030 Astoria Developers, the limited liability company formed to develop the project, in an emailed statement.But \u201cprojects like this were conceived with the 421a in mind and we rely on its reauthorization in order to move ahead,\u201d he said.When asked if the development\u2019s unusually large number of affordable units was a drag on the project, since they could mean a reduction in the amount of rent collected, Mr. Mavroudis said no.Halletts Point was to contain 2,400 rental residences, 20 percent of which were to be affordable. Durst has broken ground on a small portion: a 400-unit building that will feature a supermarket, expected to open in early 2018. But soon after the 421a abatement vanished, the developer reined in the rest of its project, Mr. Barowitz, the Durst spokesman, said.The projects\u2019 adherents in the neighborhood, which is lined with public housing and in the shadow of the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge, hope the area will eventually receive a shot in the arm, but say policy makers need to do their part first.There is movement on that front. In May and June, real estate industry leaders, construction trade union officials and representatives of the governor\u2019s office launched talks to renew the 421a tax abatement.\u201cI think both sides need to roll up their sleeves and get serious about readdressing 421a or some similar model,\u201d said Florence Koulouris, the district manager of Queens Community Board 1, which represents the area. \u201cBut the longer we wait, the harder it\u2019s going to be.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Israel Joins Bikini Fray, Ordering Concert Singer to Cover Up", "Date": "2016-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTEL AVIV \u2014 Even as France has started an international debate about whether some women cover up too much on the beach, Israel has gone the other way, with fresh concerns about whether some cover up too little.But if the French local bans on the head-to-ankle burkinis illustrated an often libertine country\u2019s discomfort with conservative Muslim traditions, the decision by the Israeli authorities to weigh in on the side of more clothing reflected a different kind of cultural debate. With the influence of Orthodox Judaism having grown in the current government, Israel, a country whose culture was long dominated by secular elites, is struggling with its identity and values.\u201cThe ministry\u2019s policy, led by the minister of culture, states that festivals and events which are funded by public money will honor the general public that attends the events, which includes all the various sectors and communities,\u201d Sivan Carmon, a ministry spokeswoman, said in a statement.The ministry intervened after a concert in Ashdod, south of Tel Aviv, on Friday took a surprise turn. Onstage was Hanna Goor, a singer known for her appearance on \u201cA Star Is Born,\u201d a long-running Israeli reality television program featuring new vocalists.As she performed, Ms. Goor was wearing an unbuttoned shirt over a bikini top and shorts when, she said, a man from the production company contracted by the state approached her and told her to cover up. She said she had refused, only to have the man threaten to kick her off the stage. She sang another song anyway, then noticed the production company official return with a security officer, at which point she left the stage to avoid a confrontation.Ms. Carmon, the culture ministry spokeswoman, said by telephone on Sunday that Ms. Goor\u2019s attire was not appropriate for performing in front of the general public. Ms. Carmon denied that the singer had been forced offstage, but said that the program had been running late and that Ms. Goor\u2019s time had been cut short by maybe one song.In an interview on Sunday, Ms. Goor said she was only trying to stay cool in the late summer heat, and was dressed no different from many watching from the beach.\u201cIt\u2019s Friday noon,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything is so sunny, so hot, I was only thinking about how tolerable it would be onstage.\u201dShe said she was stunned by the objection to her clothing. \u201cThey made it such a big deal, and now there are new regulations they want to put on and force artists to be more modest,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not right. I\u2019m against it, and I will speak my mind about it as much as I can. It\u2019s very important for me to sing the way I want to sing and get up on stage dressed how I want to dress.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Aug. 29 about a crackdown by Israel\u2019s culture ministry on immodest dress at government-sponsored musical events misidentified the strain of Judaism that is holding more influence in the current Israeli government.

{"Headline": "N.I.H. May Fund Human-Animal Stem Cell Research", "Date": "2016-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe National Institutes of Health announced on Thursday that it was planning to lift its ban on funding some research that injects human stem cells into animal embryos.The purpose is to try to grow human tissues or organs in animals to better understand human diseases and develop therapies to treat them.Researchers have long been putting human cells into animals \u2014 like pieces of human tumors in mice to test drugs that might destroy the tumors \u2014 but stem cell research is fundamentally different. The stem cells are put into developing embryos where they can become any cells, like those in organs, blood and bone.If the funding ban is lifted, it could help patients by, for example, encouraging research in which a pig grows a human kidney for a transplant.But the very idea of a human-animal mix can be chilling, and will not meet with universal acceptance.In particular, when human cells injected into an animal embryo develop in part of that animal\u2019s brain, difficult questions arise, said Paul Knoepfler, a stem cell researcher at the University of California, Davis.\u201cThere\u2019s no clear dividing line because we lack an understanding of at what point humanization of an animal brain could lead to more humanlike thought or consciousness,\u201d he said.The N.I.H., which would be a major source of federal funds for this type of work, imposed the moratorium in September to consider concerns about the research. The studies were just beginning, and the N.I.H. did not have any projects underway involving human-animal chimeras, a term derived from mythological creatures that were part goat, lion and snake. But Renate Myles, a spokeswoman, said, \u201cWe watch the state of the science and knew that this was where the science was heading.\u201dFor scientists, the moratorium was \u201ca little jarring,\u201d said Dr. George Q. Daley, a Harvard professor and the director of the stem cell transplantation program at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital. Two months later, the N.I.H. convened a workshop to hear from researchers and experts in animal welfare.Two types of experiments that are being considered for funding would still have to undergo a review by an N.I.H. advisory committee. The first involves the addition of human stem cells to the embryos of animals before the embryos reach a stage when organs are starting to develop. Because nonhuman primates like monkeys and chimpanzees are so genetically close to people, researchers working with such primates would have to wait until an embryo was further developed before adding human stem cells, according to the proposal.The second type of study introduces stem cells into embryos of animals other than rodents where the cells could get into and modify the animals\u2019 brains. Of particular concern is creating chimeras with human cells in the brain.The N.I.H. would continue its ban on funding any research that could result in an animal with human sperm or eggs that would then be bred.All of the N.I.H.\u2019s proposals, though, apply only to the work that is financed with taxpayer money. Research supported by private donors or companies would not be affected.Dr. Daley described some of the work researchers had been doing in this area.First, they wanted to know if they had isolated new types of stem cells \u2014 ones that could turn into any type of tissue or organ. Accomplishing that involves putting the new cells into an embryo and seeing if they turn into the placenta, as well as every cell type in the adult animal.Now, Dr. Daley said, the hope is to do the same sort of experiments with pigs missing genes for organs like a kidney or a liver and see if human stem cells can be used to grow human organs in the animals for transplants.\u201cIt\u2019s science fiction today, but there has been enough progress in rat to mouse and even in pigs that it is at least theoretically possible,\u201d Dr. Daley said.Another team studied the use of human stem cells in mice embryos in the hope of eventually understanding human psychiatric disorders.Dr. Wolinetz of the N.I.H. said during a teleconference that she expected \u201csome on-the-job learning\u201d about what would happen with chimeras that had human cells in their brains.\u201cThere is a lot we don\u2019t understand about the brain,\u201d she said, \u201cwhich is one reason the possibility of these animal models is really exciting.\u201dThe work is disturbing to many. But does the unease reflect the novelty of the ideas, like concerns that surfaced with the advent of heart transplants, which were first met with revulsion and then embraced by the public? Or is this work of a different ilk?Jeffrey P. Kahn, the director of the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics, points to two looming ethical issues.One is to decide if there is a fundamental difference between adding DNA from one species into another \u2014 the technology used to produce genetically modified foods \u2014 and putting human cells into an animal. Many people can accept genetically modified organisms, but would a human-animal chimera eventually become acceptable? After all, Dr. Kahn said, in both cases, you could say \u201cit\u2019s just DNA.\u201dWhere to draw the human boundary is another issue. If it is O.K. to put human cells into an animal, why does it seem clearly wrong to put animal cells into a human? As more and more human cells are added to an animal, at what point is the result different from adding more and more animal cells to a human embryo?\u201cWhat are we doing when we are mixing the traits of two species?\u201d Dr. Kahn asked. \u201cWhat makes us human? Is it having 51 percent human cells?\u201dThose questions, he added, \u201care part of what make people react to this issue.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Deliveroo, an On-Demand Food Delivery Service, Raises $275 Million", "Date": "2016-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow much money does it take to compete with Uber?Deliveroo, a food delivery start-up based in London, is about to find out after it raised $275 million on Friday to take the company\u2019s fund-raising to almost half a billion dollars since it was founded in 2012.The latest funding pushes Deliveroo into the so-called \u201cunicorn\u201d club of privately held companies around the world with valuations exceeding $1 billion, according to a person with knowledge of the company\u2019s fund-raising who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The company declined to provide precise details of its valuation.It also gives Deliveroo increased financial firepower to keep Uber at bay. Uber, an American ride-booking service, recently started offering UberEats, a food delivery operation, in a small number of European cities. That pits it directly against Deliveroo, whose operations now extend across 12 countries, mostly in Europe.When it comes to the online food delivery market, he added: \u201cWe\u2019re no longer in the first inning, but we\u2019re nowhere near the ninth inning, either.\u201dDeliveroo has focused on logistical and technical support for restaurants to help them take orders and deliver food with a few swipes on a smartphone. It relies on a stable of contract drivers, many of whom use scooters or bicycles, and it promises delivery times of about 30 minutes.But with Uber and rival European tech companies like DeliveryHero all battling to sign up restaurants and offering discounts to customers, Deliveroo now plans to use its financial war chest to intensify its efforts in existing markets. It also wants to expand its roster to add a few new countries with similar characteristics to those where it now operates.That includes offering its smartphone food delivery service to second- and third-tier cities across countries like Germany, France and Spain (Deliveroo already is available in 84 cities, compared to 24 cities for UberEats).For now, Mr. Shu is taking the potential competition in stride.\u201cI have a lot of respect for Uber, but focusing on a singular goal is what we do,\u201d he said. \u201cYou won\u2019t see us driving people around town.

{"Headline": "Daniel Z. Nelson, Who Put Classrooms in High-Rises, Dies at 86", "Date": "2016-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDaniel Z. Nelson, who as a New York City housing official presided over an innovative financing agency that created thousands of public school classrooms in partnership with private developers at relatively little cost to taxpayers, died last Tuesday in Manhattan. He was 86.The cause was complications of a fall, his son, Robert, said.In 1967, Mr. Nelson, a lawyer who served in the administrations of Mayors Robert F. Wagner and John V. Lindsay, was the first executive director of the New York City Educational Construction Fund, a public benefit corporation created by the New York State Legislature.During his six-year tenure, the agency helped finance, among other schools, Norman Thomas High School at Park Avenue and 34th Street in Manhattan, beneath an office tower; Public School 124 Yung Wing, which is topped by Confucius Plaza, a 762-apartment residential building in Chinatown; and Murry Bergtraum High School for Business Careers, connected to the Verizon Building on Pearl Street in Lower Manhattan.Since it began, the fund has helped finance 15 new schools and added more than 18,000 classroom seats while facilitating the construction of 4,500 apartments and 1.2 million square feet of office space. Its latest project is to replace the School of Cooperative Technical Education with a new school to be included at the base of a building with about 1,100 apartments at First Avenue and 96th Street in Manhattan.The fund issues tax-exempt bonds to pay for school construction on the lower floors of high-rise residential or commercial buildings being constructed by private builders. Instead of paying property taxes, the builder makes regular lease payments for the air rights, or development rights, over a school. The fund uses the payments to pay off the bonds.The arrangement allows the fund to borrow beyond the city\u2019s regular legal debt limit, and it provides more sites for housing. When the bonds are paid off, usually after several decades, the city takes title on the property, collects the remaining lease payments and begins collecting real estate taxes from the developer.The fund was created by the Legislature on the basis of recommendations made by the Taconic Foundation, a small philanthropy that focused on equal opportunity. Lloyd K. Garrison, a foundation board member and the former president of the city\u2019s Board of Education, shepherded the fund into being.Daniel Z. Nelson (he had no middle name but used the initial Z for his Hebrew name, Zuscha) was born in Brooklyn on Feb. 12, 1930. His father, Phillip, was a dressmaker. His mother was the former Gertrude Weiner.After graduating from James Madison High School, he earned a bachelor of arts degree from New York University and a law degree from Brooklyn Law School. He served in the office of the Army Judge Advocate General\u2019s Corps.His wife, the former Eleanor Mendelson, died in 2012. In addition to his son, he is survived by a daughter, Judi Camps; a sister, Barbara Albert; his companion, Zita Rosenthal; and four grandchildren.Before presiding over the fund, Mr. Nelson, as the city\u2019s deputy coordinator for Housing and Development, had overseen tens of thousands of apartments that the city helped private developers build for middle-income tenants.After he left government, Mr. Nelson became a developer, first as the president of Cauldwell-Wingate and then, beginning in 1982, as the president of Nelson Equities, which owned and managed more than 3,000 apartments in the city. He later practiced at the trial law firm Akerman.As a philanthropist, Mr. Nelson also oversaw and contributed to the restoration of Central Synagogue in Midtown Manhattan after a fire there in 1998, and to the modernization of Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Une Vie\u2019 Brings a Guy de Maupassant Novel to the Screen, at Last", "Date": "2016-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVenice Film Festival\u201cLa loi du march\u00e9\u201d is set in the present, with its central figure a badly paid security guard trying to make ends meet. \u201cUne Vie\u201d begins in rural Normandy of 1819, with an innocent young girl, Jeanne, who has just returned from a convent education to live with her sweet, gentle parents. She soon marries a local nobleman, Julien de Lamare, and the film, like the novel, charts a slow and painful process of disillusionment over three decades. Jeanne learns that her husband is both miserly and chronically unfaithful, and her only son proves to be a spendthrift wastrel who depletes the family fortune, leaving her in near-poverty toward the end.In a telephone conversation from his home in Paris, Mr. Briz\u00e9 said that he had planned to make a film of \u201cUne Vie\u201d well before shooting \u201cLa loi du march\u00e9.\u201d\u201cIn fact, the genesis of this film goes back 20 years,\u201d he said. \u201cI read the novel in 1996 and fell in love with it. I identified completely with Jeanne; I entered into adult life with the same innocence, and was incredibly hurt by many things that came as a surprise to me. I immediately thought I would make a film of the story, but it took many years to become a concrete project.\u201dMr. Briz\u00e9 began to work on a screenplay with his co-writer, Florence Vignon, in 2012, but the film proved difficult to finance and during that lengthy process he wrote and filmed \u201cLa loi du march\u00e9.\u201dIts success helped him complete the financing of \u201cUne Vie,\u201d Mr. Briz\u00e9 said, and he began shooting in mid-2015, taking more than a year to record the changing seasons that illuminate the story\u2019s passage of time, and its heroine\u2019s close relationship to nature.But before beginning to film, he had to find that heroine. \u201cI always look for the principal character first,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I cast everyone else according to who that person is.\u201dEarly on, his casting director suggested he meet the French actress Judith Chemla; he knew immediately, he said, that he had found his Jeanne.\u201cI needed an actress who had a particular rapport with the world,\u201d he said. \u201cJeanne has an openness, a childlike innocence, a vertiginous capacity to suffer because she anticipates nothing. I saw immediately that Judith had something similar, an extremely rare capacity to be totally available and open at all times.\u201d\u201cOnce you have chosen the right actor, you have done most of the directing,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m not someone who asks actors to think about the psychology of their characters, or why they have done this or that action. There are only the actions; no explanation.\u201dMs. Chemla\u2019s performance \u2014 alongside Swann Arlaud as Julien and Yolande Moreau and Jean-Pierre Darroussin as her parents \u2014 anchors the film, which interweaves scenes of the young, beautiful Jeanne against her aged older self. Here, Ms. Chemla\u2019s body language and facial expressions suggest more than makeup and costume could do; as in Mr. Briz\u00e9\u2019s 2009 film \u201cMademoiselle Chambon,\u201d another literary adaptation, unarticulated emotion seethes beneath painfully stilted public appearance.Unlike the novel, the film of \u201cUne Vie\u201d shows everything from Jeanne\u2019s point of view. This decision, made early on, Mr. Briz\u00e9 said, led him to change one crucial element of Maupassant\u2019s narrative, to which he and Ms. Vignon otherwise remained faithful.The film\u2019s real difference from the book is structural: while de Maupassant\u2019s novel follows a linear timeline, the movie jumps between eras, amplified by Mr. Briz\u00e9\u2019s exclusive use of a hand-held camera throughout the film. \u201cI like the fact that it always moves a little,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me, that represents the interior life of Jeanne.\u201dThe ability to jump forward and back in time \u201cis what is crazy with cinema,\u201d Mr. Briz\u00e9 said. \u201cOf course you can do that in a novel too, but there is a different kind of time involved in reading and watching. With a film, everything is faster; you are immediately in that different reality.\u201cIn this case Jeanne moves from 17 to 47,\u201d he continued, \u201cand you have to show that even though the film only lasts two hours. I felt that these evocations of past, present, flashback, flash-forward would create a kind of multilayered density that gives us the notion of a long time passing.\u201dThe jumps between eras are also close to the way we think and remember, Mr. Briz\u00e9 added. \u201cOur present is constantly inflected by the past, or anticipation of the future,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t think in a linear way at all.\u201dAlthough the subjects of \u201cLa Loi du march\u00e9\u201d and \u201cUne Vie\u201d appear very different, Mr. Briz\u00e9 said that the principal characters shared an idealism and a belief in the worth of human life.\u201cJeanne\u2019s singularity and beauty of spirit is also her tragedy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole film is constructed to arrive at the last phrase: that life is never as good or bad as one believes. That is a nuance that I think she finally grasps at the end.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Family Grieves After Sophomore Is Killed in Ithaca, a College Town Thought to Be Safe", "Date": "2016-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Anthony Nazaire was deciding where to go to after graduating from high school, he fell in love with Ithaca College \u2014 its small, quiet campus, its professors and its programs in business.To his family, the college, in Ithaca, N.Y., appeared to be a safe place, seemingly more secure than his native Brooklyn. It was where Mr. Nazaire, a driven, aspiring entrepreneur, could focus on his studies.But it was in the peaceful, idyllic college town of Ithaca where Mr. Nazaire, 19, would lose his life. During a brawl early on Sunday outside a party on the Cornell University campus, just north of Ithaca College, Mr. Nazaire was fatally stabbed in his upper torso.\u201cHe was striving to be the greatest person,\u201d his sister Kiara Nazaire, 24, said on Monday outside the family\u2019s brick apartment complex in Flatbush, Brooklyn. \u201cThey took that away from him.\u201dJust a few days into his sophomore year, Mr. Nazaire told his family that Saturday night would be his last party of the summer before \u201ccrunchtime,\u201d when he planned to concentrate on his classes, Ms. Nazaire said. He decided to visit the Cornell campus with his friends, as he had done on several other occasions, his sister said.That night, the Omega Psi Phi fraternity\u2019s Cornell chapter was sponsoring a party at Willard Straight Hall, an event the group has hosted during the first week of classes for several years, according to a statement from Cornell\u2019s interim president, Hunter R. Rawlings III.Several hundred college-age people attended the event, said Jamie Williamson, public information officer for the Ithaca Police Department. After it ended, shortly before 2 a.m., the police responded to a call about fights taking place outside. When they arrived, they saw that two men \u2014 Mr. Nazaire and another person, whose name has not been released \u2014 had been stabbed.Emergency workers took Mr. Nazaire to Cayuga Medical Center, where he was later pronounced dead. The other man, who was stabbed three times, was treated and released, Officer Williamson said.The police have not yet made any arrests or identified any suspects or motives, Officer Williamson said, but they do not believe gang activity was involved. Witnesses recorded the fight with their cellphones, and investigators hoped to use the footage to find out what happened.The fatal stabbing was Ithaca\u2019s first homicide since December 2011, and only its second in about a decade, Officer Williamson said. The death has shaken residents of Ithaca, which in previous years has been ranked as one of the safest small towns in the country, a place that Officer Williamson described as a \u201cbeautiful, blissful community where nothing bad ever happens.\u201dPeople in Ithaca gathered at 4 p.m. on Monday for a memorial for Mr. Nazaire in a chapel at Ithaca College. In Flatbush, Mr. Nazaire\u2019s mother and other relatives hugged and cried outside their home as they left to begin making preparations for his funeral. In front of the complex, rows of candles were lined up on the ground with the words \u201cRest in peace, Anthony.\u201dMr. Nazaire grew up in this home on Newkirk Avenue with his sister and their mother. Their parents divorced when Mr. Nazaire was a young child, but he and his sister remained very close with their father, Reginald Nazaire, and their younger half siblings, Joshua, Marvins and Taylor.\u201cAnthony is what every father dreams of having as a son,\u201d said his father, who now lives in Texas. \u201cThe things I didn\u2019t have a chance to finish up, he wanted to go ahead and complete for himself.\u201dReginald Nazaire said that he was taking college classes in Texas and that his former wife had not finished college. He said his son, a business administration major, set ambitious goals of graduating from college, pursuing a Ph.D. and working toward a career in international finance.Mr. Nazaire was a loyal son and a protective friend, his father said. He never got into trouble, and he served as a role model for his siblings, Kiara Nazaire said.\u201cEveryone was looking up to him to make it,\u201d Ms. Nazaire said.In the coming days, the family hopes to seek justice for his death, Ms. Nazaire said.\u201cMy heart is not only broken,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was ripped out of my chest.\u201dSusan C.

{"Headline": "Apple Becomes a Green Energy Supplier, With Itself as Customer", "Date": "2016-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPALO ALTO, Calif. \u2014 The words are stenciled on the front of the Apple Store, a glass box sandwiched between a nondescript Thai restaurant and a CVS pharmacy in downtown Palo Alto: \u201cThis store runs on 100 percent renewable energy.\u201dIf Apple\u2019s plans play out, it will be able to make that claim not only for its operations throughout California but also beyond, as the company aims to meet its growing needs for electricity with green sources like solar, wind and hydroelectric power.Like other big companies before it, including Walmart and Google, Apple recently received a federal designation for its energy subsidiary that allows it to become a wholesale seller of electricity from coast to coast. In effect, Apple is creating its own green utility company, although the main customer is itself.The motives may be economic as much as they are environmental. As a wholesaler, Apple could reduce the cost of its electricity load, which reached 831 million kilowatt-hours in the last fiscal year \u2014 enough to power about 76,000 homes for a year. But like a growing number of corporations, Apple is intent on reducing carbon dioxide emissions from electricity production \u2014 one of the biggest sources of greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming.In one ambitious venture, Apple has contracted with First Solar to begin buying a little less than half of the power later this year from California Flats, a solar energy farm now under construction. Under the terms of the deal, Apple will pay $848 million for the electricity over 25 years and receive the farm\u2019s total output by the end of the agreement. It is one of largest commercial clean energy contracts yet.Lisa Jackson, the former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency who is now the Apple executive overseeing environmental policy, social initiatives and worldwide government affairs, said she hoped Apple could serve as a model for the many other big corporate power users that are now embracing clean energy.\u201cThis is just another sort of innovative way to get that power onto the grid so we don\u2019t have to take the California grid-mix default, which still includes fossil fuel,\u201d Ms. Jackson said.Although much of Apple\u2019s manufacturing is done offshore, it still has extensive needs for electric power in the United States \u2014 and not only for the sprawling new corporate campus it is building at its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., and its 270 retail stores around the country.One of Apple\u2019s biggest demands for electricity comes from operating the computing cloud through which it sells apps, music and videos to users of its iPhones, iPads and Mac computers.Apple\u2019s move comes as prices for renewable energy continue to plummet. And signing long-term contracts allows businesses to shield themselves from potentially higher, more volatile charges from a power company. Apple would not say how much it was paying for California Flats\u2019s energy, but Ms. Jackson said last year at a Wall Street Journal conference that it was less than what it paid for commercial power. She said she expected the company to save hundreds of millions of dollars over the life of the contract.Google, which received its federal energy wholesale designation from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in 2010, is a big proponent of the approach Apple is now taking.\u201cRunning any kind of business, having predictability in terms of your operating costs can be very important,\u201d said Gary Demasi, director of operations for data center energy and location strategy at Google, which has been a leading investor in and user of clean energy. \u201cRenewable energy, from a cost perspective, is now competitive with other forms of energy, much more so than it was a few years ago.\u201dExecutives face greater pressure from shareholders and customers to show that they are doing their part to fight climate change. At the same time, corporate energy use has exploded, driven in many cases by the ravenous demands of the data cloud.\u201cWe are all becoming very large energy players, and this is a shift,\u201d said Brian Janous, director of energy strategy at Microsoft. \u201cEnergy is not something that Microsoft or Amazon or Google really ever had to think much about prior to the advent of the cloud.\u201dElectric utilities have begun to respond by creating products and services to meet the corporate demand for clean energy, said Letha Tawney, the World Resources Institute\u2019s director of utility innovation.One such product is a green tariff. It was pioneered in North Carolina by Duke Energy and is now under consideration in about a dozen states. It allows companies to designate that they are paying for a renewable energy supply.Another is a synthetic or virtual power purchase agreement, under which companies contract to buy the output of a clean power plant, as Apple is doing with California Flats.Although the companies say these arrangements mean they are running their businesses on renewable energy, in reality the clean power often does not flow directly to their facilities. They typically buy the renewable energy in amounts to match what they draw from the grid \u2014 a system of swaps that Ms. Jackson of Apple likened to using an A.T.M.\u201cThe dollar you deposit in the bank might not be the exact same bill that you get out,\u201d she said.Robert F. Shapiro, a partner at the law firm Chadbourne & Parke who focuses on project finance and energy, describes it as meaningful symbolism.\u201cThey\u2019re actually getting power from their local utility, which may be coal,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. \u201cBut they\u2019re deemed to have put into the world carbon-neutral energy, which they are deemed to have used for their load.\u201dTo keep track of the clean energy credits, power generators work with registries to issue numbered certificates.\u201cThe power flows into the grid. The electrons go where they go,\u201d Ms. Tawney said. \u201cBut because there\u2019s a renewable-energy certificate, no one else can claim the same zero-carbon benefit.\u201dSuch complexities are necessary, executives and clean energy advocates say, because it is not often feasible to install enough renewable-power generators at corporate sites to meet companies\u2019 full energy needs.Walmart, despite having installed solar panels, wind turbines and fuel cells at stores and distribution centers, can nonetheless meet only about a third of those operations\u2019 energy needs. So it also buys renewable energy from generators and utilities, said David Ozment, director of energy at Walmart stores.Procter & Gamble, another member of the energy buyers\u2019 alliance, has arranged to purchase all of the steam from a biomass generator under construction at a plant in Georgia where it makes Charmin toilet paper and Bounty paper towels, said Jack McAneny, the company\u2019s director of sustainability.But that was possible, he said, only because of the plant\u2019s location near a source of waste wood and pulp for fuel and the cooperation of P&G\u2019s partners. Among those partners are the local utility, Georgia Power, which will buy the electricity from the generator for its customers from Constellation, the company that developed and will own and operate the generator.At Apple, where the purchase or production of renewable energy has more than tripled since 2012, the company would prefer to not have to go to great lengths to ensure a clean energy supply, Ms. Jackson said. But the public energy grid is simply still too dependent on carbon-based fuels to make that possible.\u201cIf we had our preference, we\u2019d just be able to say, \u2018We want 100 percent green power everywhere we use power,\u2019\u201d Ms. Jackson said. \u201cThe best would be if we could run every one of our stores, every one of our data centers, every office complex, every building we have, on 100 percent renewable \u2014 and if we didn\u2019t have to spend a whole bunch of our time and energy figuring out how to get that done.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Powerful Russian Weapon: The Spread of False Stories", "Date": "2016-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySTOCKHOLM \u2014 With a vigorous national debate underway on whether Sweden should enter a military partnership with NATO, officials in Stockholm suddenly encountered an unsettling problem: a flood of distorted and outright false information on social media, confusing public perceptions of the issue.The claims were alarming: If Sweden, a non-NATO member, signed the deal, the alliance would stockpile secret nuclear weapons on Swedish soil; NATO could attack Russia from Sweden without government approval; NATO soldiers, immune from prosecution, could rape Swedish women without fear of criminal charges.They were all false, but the disinformation had begun spilling into the traditional news media, and as the defense minister, Peter Hultqvist, traveled the country to promote the pact in speeches and town hall meetings, he was repeatedly grilled about the bogus stories.\u201cPeople were not used to it, and they got scared, asking what can be believed, what should be believed?\u201d said Marinette Nyh Radebo, Mr. Hultqvist\u2019s spokeswoman.As often happens in such cases, Swedish officials were never able to pin down the source of the false reports. But they, numerous analysts and experts in American and European intelligence point to Russia as the prime suspect, noting that preventing NATO expansion is a centerpiece of the foreign policy of President Vladimir V. Putin, who invaded Georgia in 2008 largely to forestall that possibility.In Crimea, eastern Ukraine and now Syria, Mr. Putin has flaunted a modernized and more muscular military. But he lacks the economic strength and overall might to openly confront NATO, the European Union or the United States. Instead, he has invested heavily in a program of \u201cweaponized\u201d information, using a variety of means to sow doubt and division. The goal is to weaken cohesion among member states, stir discord in their domestic politics and blunt opposition to Russia.\u201cMoscow views world affairs as a system of special operations, and very sincerely believes that it itself is an object of Western special operations,\u201d said Gleb Pavlovsky, who helped establish the Kremlin\u2019s information machine before 2008. \u201cI am sure that there are a lot of centers, some linked to the state, that are involved in inventing these kinds of fake stories.\u201dThe planting of false stories is nothing new; the Soviet Union devoted considerable resources to that during the ideological battles of the Cold War. Now, though, disinformation is regarded as an important aspect of Russian military doctrine, and it is being directed at political debates in target countries with far greater sophistication and volume than in the past.The Kremlin uses both conventional media \u2014 Sputnik, a news agency, and RT, a television outlet \u2014 and covert channels, as in Sweden, that are almost always untraceable.Russia exploits both approaches in a comprehensive assault, Wilhelm Unge, a spokesman for the Swedish Security Service, said this year when presenting the agency\u2019s annual report. \u201cWe mean everything from internet trolls to propaganda and misinformation spread by media companies like RT and Sputnik,\u201d he said.The fundamental purpose of dezinformatsiya, or Russian disinformation, experts said, is to undermine the official version of events \u2014 even the very idea that there is a true version of events \u2014 and foster a kind of policy paralysis.The cloud of stories helped veil the simple truth that poorly trained insurgents had accidentally downed the plane with a missile supplied by Russia.Moscow adamantly denies using disinformation to influence Western public opinion and tends to label accusations of either overt or covert threats as \u201cRussophobia.\u201d\u201cThere is an impression that, like in a good orchestra, many Western countries every day accuse Russia of threatening someone,\u201d Maria Zakharova, the Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, said at a recent ministry briefing.Tracing individual strands of disinformation is difficult, but in Sweden and elsewhere, experts have detected a characteristic pattern that they tie to Kremlin-generated disinformation campaigns.\u201cThe dynamic is always the same: It originates somewhere in Russia, on Russia state media sites, or different websites or somewhere in that kind of context,\u201d said Anders Lindberg, a Swedish journalist and lawyer.Although the topics may vary, the goal is the same, Mr. Lindberg and others suggested. \u201cWhat the Russians are doing is building narratives; they are not building facts,\u201d he said. \u201cThe underlying narrative is, \u2018Don\u2019t trust anyone.\u2019\u201dThe weaponization of information is not some project devised by a Kremlin policy expert but is an integral part of Russian military doctrine \u2014 what some senior military figures call a \u201cdecisive\u201d battlefront.\u201cThe Russians are very good at courting everyone who has a grudge with liberal democracy, and that goes from extreme right to extreme left,\u201d said Patrik Oksanen, an editorial writer for the Swedish newspaper group MittMedia. The central idea, he said, is that \u201cliberal democracy is corrupt, inefficient, chaotic and, ultimately, not democratic.\u201dAnother message, largely unstated, is that European governments lack the competence to deal with the crises they face, particularly immigration and terrorism, and that their officials are all American puppets.During NATO military exercises in early June, articles on the websites suggested that Washington controlled Europe through the alliance, with Germany as its local sheriff. Echoing the disinformation that appeared in Sweden, the reports said NATO planned to store nuclear weapons in Eastern Europe and would attack Russia from there without seeking approval from local capitals.\u201cThe data show how public opinion is changing thanks to the disinformation on those outlets,\u201d said Jakub Janda, the think tank\u2019s deputy director for public and political affairs. \u201cThey try to look like a regular media outlet even if they have a hidden agenda.\u201dNot all Russian disinformation efforts succeed. Sputnik news websites in various Scandinavian languages failed to attract enough readers and were closed after less than a year.Both RT and Sputnik portray themselves as independent, alternative voices. Sputnik claims that it \u201ctells the untold,\u201d even if its daily report relies heavily on articles abridged from other sources. RT trumpets the slogan \u201cQuestion More.\u201dBoth depict the West as grim, divided, brutal, decadent, overrun with violent immigrants and unstable. \u201cThey want to give a picture of Europe as some sort of continent that is collapsing,\u201d Mr. Hultqvist, the Swedish defense minister, said in an interview.Margarita Simonyan, RT\u2019s editor in chief, said the channel was being singled out as a threat because it offered a different narrative from \u201cthe Anglo-American media-political establishment.\u201d RT, she said, wants to provide \u201ca perspective otherwise missing from the mainstream media echo chamber.\u201dMoscow\u2019s targeting of the West with disinformation dates to a Cold War program the Soviets called \u201cactive measures.\u201d The effort involved leaking or even writing stories for sympathetic newspapers in India and hoping that they would be picked up in the West, said Professor Mark N. Kramer, a Cold War expert at Harvard.The story that AIDS was a C.I.A. project run amok spread that way, and it poisons the discussion of the disease decades later. At the time, before the Soviet Union\u2019s 1991 collapse, the Kremlin was selling communism as an ideological alternative. Now, experts said, the ideological component has evaporated, but the goal of weakening adversaries remains.In Sweden recently, that has meant a series of bizarre forged letters and news articles about NATO and linked to Russia.One forgery, on Defense Ministry letterhead over Mr. Hultqvist\u2019s signature, encouraged a major Swedish firm to sell artillery to Ukraine, a move that would be illegal in Sweden. Ms. Nyh Radebo, his spokeswoman, put an end to that story in Sweden, but at international conferences, Mr. Hultqvist still faced questions about the nonexistent sales.Russia also made at least one overt attempt to influence the debate. During a seminar in the spring, Vladimir Kozin, a senior adviser to the Russian Institute for Strategic Studies, a think tank linked to the Kremlin and Russian foreign intelligence, argued against any change in Sweden\u2019s neutral status.\u201cDo they really need to lose their neutral status?\u201d he said of the Swedes. \u201cTo permit fielding new U.S. military bases on their territory and to send their national troops to take part in dubious regional conflicts?\u201dWhatever the method or message, Russia clearly wants to win any information war, as Dmitry Kiselyev, Russia\u2019s most famous television anchor and the director of the organization that runs Sputnik, made clear recently.Speaking this summer on the 75th anniversary of the Soviet Information Bureau, Mr. Kiselyev said the age of neutral journalism was over. \u201cIf we do propaganda, then you do propaganda, too,\u201d he said, directing his message to Western journalists.An earlier version of this article misstated the surname of a spokesman for the Swedish Security Service. He is Wilhelm Unge, not Urme.Because of an editing error, an article on Aug. 29 about the Kremlin\u2019s reliance on disinformation to sow doubt, fear and discord in Europe and the United States referred incorrectly to coverage of the Democratic National Convention by a Russian television outfit, RT. It devoted little time to the speeches, focusing instead on scattered demonstrations, on the day President Obama spoke \u2014 not throughout the entire convention.Eva Sohlman contributed reporting from Stockholm, and Lincoln Pigman from Moscow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Poughkeepsie, a Convergence of Jazz Greats", "Date": "2016-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMusic | WestchesterWaryas Park is a scenic if slightly scruffy patch of green on the Hudson River in Poughkeepsie, a city that has had problems with a struggling economy over the years.But on Aug. 21, some of the world\u2019s leading jazz musicians will gather in the park for the annual Jazz in the Valley festival, which is expected to attract crowds from around the region and help burnish the city\u2019s image.\u201cThere\u2019s no question we have a bad perception problem to a lot of outsiders,\u201d Christopher Petsas, a councilman, said. \u201cBut I think slowly we\u2019re changing that. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important that we support this kind of event.\u201dThis year, the event\u2019s main stage will feature two other National Endowment masters: the pianist Randy Weston and the drummer Jimmy Cobb. Mr. Weston will lead his African Rhythms Trio, including Alex Blake on bass and Neil Clarke on drums. Mr. Cobb will play with Jazz By 5, an all-star group made up of Randy Brecker on trumpet, Javon Jackson on saxophone, George Cables on piano and Eddie Gomez on bass.These musicians do not plan to simply ad-lib a few choruses over the chord changes of popular standards. They will perform landmarks of the jazz idiom they helped originate.\u201cIt depends on the vibrations of the audience, my spirit and what kind of message I want to give through the music,\u201d he said.\u201cHe loves John Coltrane,\u201d Mr. Cobb said. \u201cHe says John is the only guy he ever dreamt about. Since he knows that I played with John Coltrane, we do a lot of those tunes.\u201dMr. Jackson, the festival\u2019s artistic director, said he works to strike a balance as he interprets music associated with venerated artists like Coltrane. \u201cThe spirit is strong in those recordings,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be coming through me. Hopefully, I can find a way of being me but still distilling the influence of my heroes.\u201dRounding out the program on the main stage will be the trombonist Craig Harris and the singers Chico Alvarez, with the Palomonte Afro-Cuban Big Band, and Charen\u00e9e Wade. A nearby pavilion will host lesser-known acts, among them the guitarist Slam Allen and the singer Stephanie Hancock, as well as the Dutchess County Community College Jazz Ensemble.\u201cWe encourage these things,\u201d he said.Ms. Smith pointed to the social and psychological benefits to the community, including the residents of the Rip Van Winkle housing project, which is perched on a hill above Waryas Park. While many of the housing project\u2019s young residents had little awareness of jazz history before visiting the festival, she said, they discovered a shared cultural heritage, as part of the African diaspora, with distinguished artists onstage.\u201cThat\u2019s the whole point,\u201d said Ms. Smith, the president of Transart and Cultural Services, a Kingston nonprofit that promotes art of African descent and is presenting the festival.But she said that keeping the festival afloat was a struggle. After foundation money dried up in the recession of 2008, she said, she curtailed forays of the musicians into local schools. With Poughkeepsie providing a small amount of money, grants from federal and state agencies supplied the bulk of the festival\u2019s financing while she tried to get a hearing from the local business elite.Supporters of the event like Mr. Petsas, a Poughkeepsie native, were investing their own time and money. In recent weeks, he has been pounding the pavement, soliciting help from small businesses. Along with the Exempt Firemen\u2019s Association, a social group, he had paid for a series of small jazz concerts in Donegan Park, in the city\u2019s Little Italy section, held on Saturdays leading up to the festival.Those concerts are a first, he said, adding that ultimately he would like the festival, which is scheduled for a Sunday, to expand to a full weekend. That, he said, could be a real engine for the economy, though the one-day event had already made a difference.\u201cIt has had a profound impact on the city of Poughkeepsie,\u201d he said, \u201con our image and on me personally.\u201dJazz in the Valley will take place on Aug. 21 at Waryas Park on the Poughkeepsie waterfront. Tickets: $60 on day of festival, less on advance sale; some events are free. Information: 845-384-6350 or jazzinthevalleyny.org.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Turkish Gold Trader Builds a Dream Team of Defense Lawyers", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Reza Zarrab, a wealthy gold trader from Turkey, was in need of a top-flight lawyer after his arrest in March, he hired Benjamin Brafman, one of New York\u2019s most prominent defense lawyers.Mr. Zarrab did not stop there.In just four months, he has hired five white-collar law firms to defend him, with 15 lawyers \u2014 many of them among the most accomplished in their field \u2014 having entered the case on his behalf. A 16th lawyer, from a sixth firm, is joining soon, court papers show.The team includes Paul D. Clement, the former solicitor general of the United States, and his partner, Viet D. Dinh, a former assistant attorney general, who are both appellate specialists.Mr. Zarrab\u2019s legal fees are not known, but if his case goes to trial, they could run in the tens of millions of dollars, based on published accounts of defense costs in other notable white-collar trials, in which the defense teams were smaller.In some ways, Mr. Zarrab\u2019s approach is no great departure from that of any criminal defendant: Get the best legal defense you can afford. But hiring an all-star cast featuring multiple lawyers from different law firms is a strategy rarely seen \u2014 and when employed, lawyers have seldom stayed for the duration.And in a two-month trial in Manhattan in 2014, Gigi Jordan, a multimillionaire convicted of manslaughter but acquitted of the murder of her disabled 8-year-old son, went through around a dozen lawyers, including some prominent ones, with five or six at any given time in the courtroom.But could retaining so many lawyers backfire?Alan M. Dershowitz, the Harvard Law professor and a former member of Mr. Simpson\u2019s dream team, recalled that the intense publicity surrounding Mr. Simpson\u2019s case led to ego clashes and conflict, with everyone wanting \u201cto be the No. 1 person on the team.\u201d\u201cThe O. J. case was dysfunctional because there were just too many cooks,\u201d Professor Dershowitz said. With Mr. Zarrab\u2019s lower profile and Mr. Brafman\u2019s leadership outside the courtroom, he added, \u201cI think the likelihood of the team working well together is good.\u201d\u201cThe worst thing is just to collect names and put them on a brief,\u201d he said.As Mr. Zarrab\u2019s lead trial lawyer, Mr. Brafman will be assisted by lawyers at his firm, including Marc A. Agnifilo, a former federal prosecutor in New Jersey, and Joshua Kirshner.The team\u2019s appellate specialists \u2014 Mr. Clement, Mr. Dinh, Ms. Chung and other lawyers from their firms \u2014 will try to win the case on legal grounds even before a trial begins. The defense team filed motions recently before Judge Richard M. Berman of Federal District Court in Manhattan seeking dismissal of charges and suppression of statements Mr. Zarrab made after his arrest.If the case is tried, the appellate lawyers would presumably advise Mr. Brafman, and should Mr. Zarrab be convicted, they would work on his appeal.Because Mr. Zarrab faces a complicated prosecution \u2014 federal charges stemming from international banking transactions that accuse him of violating the Iran sanctions and engaging in money laundering \u2014 he has also retained specialists in sanctions and money laundering, lawyers who formerly worked in the Treasury and Justice Departments and JPMorgan Chase.Mr. Brafman, responding to questions on behalf of Mr. Zarrab\u2019s defense, said, \u201cPerhaps most satisfying is that there are no ego issues on the team.\u201dMr. Dinh has called Mr. Bharara \u201cmy best friend\u201d since their first day at Harvard College. But that friendship will have no bearing, said Stephen Gillers, a legal ethics expert at New York University.\u201cDinh\u2019s motivation is to get the best possible result for Zarrab,\u201d Professor Gillers said. \u201cIt enhances his reputation. That\u2019s also his professional duty.\u201d Mr. Bharara\u2019s duty is to seek a resolution, he said, that serves the public interest. \u201cHe feels no obligation based in friendship to give Zarrab a better deal,\u201d he added. Mr. Bharara\u2019s office had no comment.In March, Mr. Zarrab was arrested as he arrived in Florida on a trip to Disney World with his wife and young daughter.The government has said Mr. Zarrab and co-conspirators facilitated millions of dollars in transactions on behalf of Iran that were designed to evade the sanctions, orchestrating the scheme through a global network of companies in Turkey and elsewhere.Mr. Brafman, in response, said his client had used non-United States banks to handle certain financial transactions, and \u201cthe fact that one of the foreign banks caused several transactions to flow through the Federal Reserve was not Reza\u2019s fault, as he never intended for that to happen.\u201dHe said his client\u2019s prosecution was \u201can unprecedented and deeply flawed attempt by our government to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction that cannot be permitted to stand.\u201d\u201cAssembling a team of highly skilled and experienced defense lawyers,\u201d Mr. Brafman added, \u201cis the only way to combat the vast resources available to the government in prosecuting this case.\u201dMr. Zarrab is certainly a man of means to do so. In opposing bail, prosecutors said he had amassed a \u201cconsiderable fortune,\u201d including ownership in about 20 properties, 17 luxury automobiles, a private airplane and more than $10 million in artwork.That wealth should help pay for the lawyers, investigators and experts Mr. Zarrab will rely on. Mr. Clement, for example, said in a 2014 court filing in a different case that he billed at $1,350 an hour.Mr. Brafman declined to comment on Mr. Zarrab\u2019s fees, but said it was imperative that his client, who maintains his innocence, use every resource available to help extricate himself \u201cfrom this horrific nightmare.\u201d\u201cHe is a smart man who is fighting for his life,\u201d Mr. Brafman said.William G. Ross, a law professor at Samford University in Birmingham, Ala., who has written extensively about legal fees, said wealthy defendants should not be faulted for spending money to hire the best lawyers they can afford. \u201cThe sad part,\u201d he said, is \u201cthat those resources so often are not available in our society to people of modest means or the poor.\u201dMeanwhile, the court is prepared to accommodate any size defense team; a trial can be moved to a larger courtroom with a larger well and narrower counsel tables and smaller chairs can be used, said Edward Friedland, a spokesman. \u201cWe\u2019ve always made it fit,\u201d he said.Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ukraine Releases More Details on Payments for Trump Aide, Paul Manafort", "Date": "2016-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 The Ukrainian authorities, under pressure to bolster their assertion that once-secret accounting documents show cash payments from a pro-Russian political party earmarked for Donald J. Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, on Thursday released line-item entries, some for millions of dollars.The revelations also point to an outsize role for a former senior member of the pro-Russian political party, the Party of Regions, in directing money to both Republican and Democratic advisers and lobbyists from the United States as the party tried to burnish its image in Washington.The former party member, Vitaly A. Kalyuzhny, for a time chairman of the Ukraine Parliament\u2019s International Relations Committee, had signed nine times for receipt of payments designated for the Trump campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, according to Serhiy A. Leshchenko, a member of Parliament who has studied the documents. The ledger covered payments from 2007 to 2012, when Mr. Manafort worked for the party and its leader, Viktor F. Yanukovych, Ukraine\u2019s former president who was deposed.Mr. Kalyuzhny was also a founding board member of a Brussels-based nongovernmental organization, the European Center for a Modern Ukraine, that hired the Podesta Group, a Washington lobbying firm that received $1.02 million to promote an agenda generally aligned with the Party of Regions.Because the payment was made through a nongovernmental organization, the Podesta Group did not register as a lobbyist for a foreign entity. A co-founder of the Podesta Group, John D. Podesta, is chairman of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, and his brother, Tony Podesta, runs the firm now.The role of Mr. Kalyuzhny, a onetime computer programmer from the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk, in directing funds to the companies of the chairmen of both presidential campaigns, had not previously been reported. Mr. Kalyuzhny was one of three Party of Regions members of Parliament who founded the nonprofit.The Associated Press, citing emails it had obtained, also reported Thursday that Mr. Manafort\u2019s work for Ukraine included a secret lobbying effort in Washington that he operated with an associate, Rick Gates, and that was aimed at influencing American news organizations and government officials.Mr. Gates noted in the emails that he conducted the work through two lobbying firms, including the Podesta Group, because Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister did not want the country\u2019s embassy involved. The A.P. said one of Mr. Gates\u2019s campaigns sought to turn public opinion in the West against Yulia Tymoshenko, a former Ukrainian prime minister who was imprisoned during Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s administration.The Podesta Group, in a statement, said its in-house counsel determined the company had no obligation to register as a representative of a foreign entity in part because the nonprofit offered assurances it was not \u201cdirectly or indirectly supervised, directed, controlled, financed or subsidized in whole or in part by a government of a foreign country or a foreign political party.\u201dReached by phone on Thursday, a former aide to Mr. Kalyuzhny said he had lost contact with the politician and was unsure whether he remained in Kiev or had returned to Donetsk, now the capital of a Russian-backed separatist enclave.Ukrainian officials emphasized that they did not know as yet if the cash payments reflected in the ledgers were actually made. In all 22 instances, people other than Mr. Manafort appear to have signed for the money. But the ledger entries are highly specific with funds earmarked for services such as exit polling, equipment and other services.On Monday, Mr. Manafort issued a heated statement in response to an article in The New York Times that first disclosed that the ledgers \u2014 a document described by Ukrainian investigators as an under-the-table payment system for the Party of Regions \u2014 referenced a total of $12.7 million in cash payments to him over a five-year period.In that statement, Mr. Manafort, who was removed from day-to-day management of the Trump campaign on Wednesday though he retained his title, denied that he had personally received any off-the-books cash payments. \u201cThe suggestion that I accepted cash payments is unfounded, silly and nonsensical,\u201d he said.Mr. Manafort\u2019s statement, however, left open the possibility that cash payments had been made to his firm or associates. And details from the ledgers released Thursday by anticorruption investigators suggest that may have occurred. Three separate payments, for example, totaling nearly $5.7 million are earmarked for Mr. Manafort\u2019s \u201ccontract.\u201dAnother, from October 2012, suggests a payment to Mr. Manafort of $400,000 for exit polling, a legitimate campaign outlay.Two smaller entries, for $4,632 and $854, show payments for seven personal computers and a computer server.The payments do not appear to have been reported by the Party of Regions in campaign finance disclosures in Ukraine. The party\u2019s 2012 filing indicates outlays for expenses other than advertising of just under $2 million, at the exchange rate at the time. This is less than a single payment in the black ledger designated for \u201cPaul Manafort contract\u201d in June of that year for $3.4 million.Ukrainian investigators say they consider any under-the-table payments illegal, and that the ledger also describes disbursements to members of the central election committee, the group that counts votes.Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about the political activities in Ukraine of Donald J. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, misidentified the office once held by Yulia V. Tymoshenko, a rival of Mr. Manafort\u2019s client, the former president Viktor F. Yanukovych. Ms. Tymoshenko served as prime minister of Ukraine, not its president.Advertisement"}

Legg Mason, which is based in Baltimore, said Thursday that Mr. Miller had agreed to purchase the entirety of the firm\u2019s interests in LMM, giving him full ownership of the entity.In the 1990s and the early part of the 2000s, Mr. Miller was the Joe DiMaggio of mutual fund investors, achieving fame for beating the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index for 15 consecutive years, from 1991 to 2005.But with the advent of exchange-traded funds and the investing public\u2019s embrace of passive, low-cost investing as opposed to active stock picking, Mr. Miller\u2019s style has fallen out of favor.A deep-value investor who made big, concentrated bets on a select number of companies and then stuck with them through their worst days, Mr. Miller embodied the active style of mutual fund investing that prevailed in the earlier era.And even though stocks of technology companies are not typically what value investors buy, he was an early booster of AOL and Dell and was among the first mutual fund managers that bet big on Amazon.In its heyday, Legg Mason Value Trust was one of the biggest, most popular mutual funds around, and Mr. Miller regularly graced the covers of the many personal finance magazines that flourished during this period.But Mr. Miller\u2019s stubborn style of investing hurt him during the 2008 financial crisis, when he accumulated big positions in Bear Stearns, Freddie Mac, the American International Group and other struggling financial stocks.Although he recovered from these depths, the assets he managed at Legg Mason were of a considerably smaller size.In recent years, Legg Mason has branched out aggressively into E.T.F.\u2019s, investment vehicles that track an index or mimic a style of investing and that have attracted billions of dollars in investor money \u2014 much of which has come from underperforming, actively managed mutual funds.\u201cBill has been an important part of the growth and success of Legg Mason over the years and we appreciate his many contributions,\u201d Joseph A.

{"Headline": "Fueled by Small Donations, Donald Trump Makes Up Major Financial Ground", "Date": "2016-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDonald J. Trump all but erased his enormous fund-raising disadvantage against Hillary Clinton in the span of just two months, according to figures released by his campaign on Wednesday, converting the passion of his core followers into a flood of small donations on a scale rarely seen in national politics.\u201cShe\u2019s been doing this for 20 years,\u201d said Steven Mnuchin, a New York investor who is Mr. Trump\u2019s finance chairman. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing it for two months.\u201d More than two-thirds of the $64 million had come online, Mr. Mnuchin said.The numbers released by the Trump campaign Wednesday are preliminary; official figures \u2014 including money spent on direct mail, which is typically expensive, and a precise breakdown of total cash raised in small increments \u2014 will become available when Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton file formal reports with the Federal Election Commission this month.Moreover, Mr. Trump\u2019s surge is coming very late in the campaign, at a point where advertising rates climb and the chance to invest in a long-term digital and campaign infrastructure is long past.At the end of May, Mr. Trump reported barely more than $1.3 million in cash, alarming Republicans, who feared a financial rout by Mrs. Clinton.Mitt Romney, the party\u2019s 2012 nominee and a wealthy man in his own right, was never able to stoke intense enthusiasm among small donors and relied disproportionately on big ones. During July of that year, for example, Mr. Romney and the Republican National Committee reported raising a total of just $19 million from contributions of less than $200.Mr. Trump was able to ramp up quickly in part through a digital operation set up by the R.N.C. since that campaign. Even before Mr. Trump was the nominee, the party built out its email list and tested ways of targeting small donors.With that in place, party officials unleashed a pent-up desire by rank-and-file Republicans to donate to a candidate who has bluntly attacked lobbyists and big donors. While Mr. Trump accepted online donations during the primary season, he did not send out an email solicitation until late June \u2014 which brought in $3 million alone, an indication of the well of money available to him.The campaign has also raised money by promising to match small donations out of Mr. Trump\u2019s pocket, a tactic available only to wealthy candidates.\u201cThere was always that potential, but you didn\u2019t have candidates who were as uniquely positioned in the same way that Trump is,\u201d said Patrick Ruffini, a Republican strategist who ran digital fund-raising at the Republican National Committee under President George W. Bush.But Mr. Trump\u2019s surge also emphasizes the complication for Republicans in having him at the head of their party. He is relying more on small-donor fund-raising in part because he has faced opposition from some of the party\u2019s biggest patrons, such as Meg Whitman, a California business executive, who said Monday that she was so disgusted with Mr. Trump that she would vote for Mrs. Clinton.To bolster his low-dollar fund-raising, Mr. Trump and his team are now working to assuage the broader pool of affluent Republican donors and fund-raisers. In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has laid off his criticisms of the party\u2019s donor class and scheduled an array of formal fund-raising events for Republican donors in money centers like Florida and New York.Moreover, even as his name and followers are helping fund Republican get-out-the-vote efforts around the country, Mr. Trump is feuding with the party\u2019s senior leadership, pointedly refusing to endorse prominent Republicans facing Trump-inspired primary opponents, such as the one challenging Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the House speaker.And it is the Republican National Committee that is providing much of the technical expertise that has allowed Mr. Trump to quickly increase his low-dollar fund-raising, some Republican officials said.Even as relations fray between Mr. Trump and some fellow Republicans, the party and Mr. Trump each needs the other. And Mr. Trump, as the nominee and the fund-raising tent pole for the party, may have the upper hand.\u201cUnder normal circumstances, the party would have money as leverage,\u201d Mr. Ruffini said. \u201cThey could cut off fund-raising to a candidate who misbehaves. And that leverage has been taken completely away.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Hunting in ... Lima", "Date": "2016-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInternational Real Estate23 PhotosA TRADITIONAL FIVE-BEDROOM HOUSE IN CENTRAL LIMA$4.5 MILLIONThis two-story, five-bedroom four-bath Mediterranean-style home is on a hill in Casuarinas, a gated neighborhood in the central Lima district of Santiago de Surco. The house was built in 1970, with broad arches, rustic doors, stone floors and other distinctive style elements.The house sits on 0.7 acre and faces northwest, offering wide city views. The main entrance features a tall antique wooden door, which leads to a two-story reception hall. The walls are made with brick and mortar and coated with a mixture of lime and carpenter\u2019s glue as part of the Mediterranean look, the owner said.The living room and the main dining room have bleached, rustic wood floors. One of the home\u2019s special features is an iron chimney in the living room designed by the Peruvian artist V\u00edctor Delf\u00edn, which radiates heat throughout the house. Glass doors in the dining room and living room lead to the garden.The dining room was renovated in 1980 and features a chandelier and room for a piano. The furniture is not included in the sales price, but some pieces are negotiable, including the 12-foot-long dining table, the owner said.There are three bedrooms on the ground floor, including one with an en-suite bathroom. The other two bedrooms share a bathroom. The kitchen is off the entrance hall, and there is a separate laundry room next to the garage.The master bedroom is on the second floor, reached by a slim staircase off the entrance hall. There is an antique bathtub in the master bedroom\u2019s bathroom, which is surrounded by a circular wall and a glass roof. There is a covered terrace off the master bedroom with city views.There is also a guest room on the second floor with a bathroom and its own terrace, which can be reached by a staircase outside of the house. The garden is about 1,075 square feet and contains vines and trees that have been allowed to grow naturally on the hillside to attract birds, the owner said. There is also a vegetable garden.Santiago de Surco, also known simply as \u201cSurco,\u201d is one of the few areas in Lima with more single-family homes than apartment buildings, said Miguel Barragan, the owner of RE/MAX Royal, the Lima real estate company listing the property. \u201cIt\u2019s a great place for jogging, walking and cycling,\u201d he said. Several large shopping centers and neighborhoods with restaurants and night life are within a short drive of the house.The Jorge Ch\u00e1vez International Airport is about a 45-minute drive from the house.MARKET OVERVIEWSales in Lima have been slow for the last year, agents say. There is no official government data tracking real estate, but prices dropped as much as 30 percent in some neighborhoods after hitting a peak in 2014, said Nella Pinto, general manager and an owner of Peru Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.The higher end of the market has been particularly slow, after years of new construction, she said.Peru was one of the fastest-growing economies in Latin America from 2003 to 2013, according to the World Bank. Real estate prices almost doubled from 2009 to 2013, agents said.But political uncertainty, rising crime and a sluggish economy have weighed on the market. Economic growth fell to only 2.4 percent in 2014, with only a slight rebound to 3.3 percent in 2015, primarily because of a slowdown in the mining industry, according to the World Bank.Sales have already picked up in recent months, agents said. \u201cAlso, the prices are increasing and there will be no reduction on them this year,\u201d Mr. Barragan said.The waterfront neighborhood of Miraflores and the financial district of San Isidro are the most popular with buyers these days, according to agents. Prices in Miraflores average about $2,500 a square meter ($233 a square foot), compared with $2,900 a square meter ($270 a square foot) in San Isidro and $1,900 a square meter ($177 a square foot) in the much larger and more diverse Sucro, Mr. Barragan said.WHO BUYS IN LIMAPeru\u2019s fast-growing middle class was the main force behind the latest housing boom, agents said. The strongest demand is for homes under $100,000, according to Mr. Brace. There has been a drop in foreign buyers in the last two years, but Peru still attracts a wide variety of international companies, with employees looking to settle in Lima, particularly from China, Chile and Spain, Ms. Pinto said.Mr. Brace\u2019s clientele also includes retirees from the United States, Britain and Australia.BUYING BASICSSome of the mechanics of sales in Peru will be familiar to international buyers, agents said. There are no restrictions on foreign ownership of property, except near borders and military bases. And home prices are routinely listed in United States dollars.But many aspects of a purchase are different. A notary handles most of the mechanics of a sale, though agents encourage buyers to hire a lawyer to represent their interests. There is no traditional title process, making it difficult to track the legitimate owners, Mr. Brace said. Arranging financing is also very difficult for noncitizens, agents said.Sellers are usually represented by an agent, but exclusive listings are rare, making it difficult to determine the best contact for a given property. \u201cVery often 10 or more agents will have a listing,\u201d Mr. Brace said. \u201cWith some properties it can be very much a crapshoot who will end up selling it in the end.\u201d (This property is an exclusive listing, Mr. Barragan said.)With no official sales data available, prices can be all over the map, and final sales prices are often well below listing prices, agents said.WEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCIESSpanish; nuevo sol (1 nuevo sol = $0.30)TAXES AND FEESBuyers must pay a transfer tax, known as alcabala, which is 3 percent of the final sales price. Notary fees, also paid by the buyer, usually total about $500 to $1,000, Mr. Brace said. Agent fees are usually 3 percent of the sales price and split between the buyer\u2019s and seller\u2019s agents, he said.The annual local property tax on this home is about $1,000, Mr. Barragan said. The capital gains tax on the sale of property for nonresidents can be as high as 30 percent, but there are exceptions that can lower it to 5 percent or less, agents said.CONTACTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018No One Is Safe\u2019: Zimbabwe Threatens to Seize Farms of Party Defectors", "Date": "2016-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBINDURA, Zimbabwe \u2014 Dozens of angry young men jumped off a truck in front of Agrippah Mutambara\u2019s gate, shouting obscenities and threatening to seize his 530-acre farm in the name of Zimbabwe\u2019s president. They tried to scale the fence, scattering only when he raised and cocked his gun.Zimbabwe made international headlines when it started seizing white-owned farms in 2000. But Mr. Mutambara is not a white farmer. Far from it, he is a hero of this country\u2019s war of liberation who served as Zimbabwe\u2019s ambassador to three nations over two decades.\u201cWhen it was happening to the whites, we thought we were redressing colonial wrongs,\u201d said Mr. Mutambara, 64, who got his farm after it had been seized from a white farmer. \u201cBut now we realize it\u2019s also coming back to us. It\u2019s also haunting us.\u201d\u201cNo one is safe,\u201d said Temba Mliswa, 44, who was the chairman of the party\u2019s chapter in Mashonaland West Province before his expulsion from the party in 2014.Mr. Mliswa got a 2,000-acre farm belonging to a white Zimbabwean in 2005. When he took possession, Mr. Mliswa said, police officers beat the white farmer and his workers.But last year, Mr. Mliswa said, hundreds of youths sent by the party invaded the farm again, destroying property and beating his workers. They eventually left, but one of Mr. Mugabe\u2019s ministers recently held a rally in which he threatened to take Mr. Mliswa\u2019s farm unless he stopped criticizing the president\u2019s party.\u201cThey use the land to control you,\u201d Mr. Mliswa said.Zimbabwe\u2019s political uncertainty has weakened the economy, already hit hard by a severe drought and a fall in global commodity prices. People have been hoarding cash \u2014 Zimbabwe adopted the American dollar in 2009 \u2014 and taking it out of the country, leaving bank A.T.M.s empty.Mr. Mugabe\u2019s \u201cLook East\u201d campaign, which focused on attracting China as a counterweight to Western influence, has suffered from China\u2019s economic slowdown and recent disagreements over economic policy, though billboards still laud China as Zimbabwe\u2019s \u201call-weather friend.\u201dWith few other options left, Mr. Mugabe\u2019s government has turned to the International Monetary Fund, an organization he vilified in the past as an instrument of colonial domination.In talks with the fund, the government has agreed to reforms in the hope that it will qualify for loans for the first time since 1999. The fund has sent positive signals about government steps in areas like curbing the size of the public work force and cleaning up the banking sector.\u201cThe reforms are in our interest, and not in order to please anybody,\u201d said Patrick Chinamasa, the finance minister. \u201cWhether the I.M.F. is there or not, we have to do reforms in order to restore confidence in our economy.\u201dBut significant hurdles remain. The Zimbabwean government must clear $1.8 billion it owes to the I.M.F., the World Bank and the African Development Bank. It must also persuade the I.M.F., where a skeptical United States holds the most votes, that it is committed to change.And of all the potential reforms, perhaps none is as sensitive as land.Resolving the issue is central to reviving the country\u2019s economy and re-establishing ties, virtually frozen for nearly a generation, with Western governments.Zimbabwe has proposed establishing 99-year land leases. Currently, even black Zimbabweans who received land seized from white farmers lack land titles, leaving them at the mercy of the authorities.Under a program financed by the European Union and the United Nations, the government has begun mapping the more than 6,000 commercial farms that have been seized. For the first time, the government also recently held a workshop on the compensation of white farmers.\u201cA year and a half or two years ago, nobody really talked about it,\u201d Christian Beddies, the I.M.F. representative in Zimbabwe, said about land reform. \u201cSo if you look at it from that angle, what we are seeing is progress \u2014 really a general desire to address the issue.\u201dOthers are skeptical. Nginya Mungai Lenneiye, a former World Bank representative in Zimbabwe who has served in the government, said Zimbabwe might set up a \u201ccredible framework\u201d for eventual compensation that would satisfy the I.M.F.But actual compensation, he said, is another matter.\u201cIt cannot happen while Mugabe is alive,\u201d Mr. Lenneiye said. \u201cIt will be too much a slap in his face.\u201dBeyond pride, settling land ownership could strip Mr. Mugabe of an important tool he has wielded over the political class.Dozens are believed to be facing threats of losing their farms, according to former governing party members and the local news media.And for all the talk of compensating white farmers, politically connected Zimbabweans are continuing to grab white-owned farms.This year, a white Zimbabwean couple were expelled by police officers from their 2,000-acre tobacco farm. The new owner was a Zimbabwean doctor living in England; the news media uncovered photographs showing the doctor and his wife with Mrs. Mugabe.In 2000, two decades after Zimbabwe\u2019s independence, the country\u2019s best farmland remained in the hands of descendants of white settlers. Mr. Mugabe\u2019s government forcibly removed white Zimbabweans from their farms, which were supposed to be distributed equitably to black Zimbabweans.But high-ranking officials in the governing party received the best farms. Or, like Mr. Mutambara, the former ambassador, they were given the best tracts of a large farm, usually with the main farmhouse and farming equipment.\u201cContrary to what we had expected, some people because of their position in government have gone on to acquire multiple farms, huge farms,\u201d Mr. Mutambara said.Mr. Chinamasa, the finance minister, denied that some members of the political elite were violating the government\u2019s policy by owning more than a single farm.

{"Headline": "Private Equity Pursues Profits in Keeping the Elderly at Home", "Date": "2016-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDENVER \u2014 Inside a senior center here, nestled along a bustling commercial strip, Vivian Malveaux scans her bingo card for a winning number. Her 81-year-old eyes are warm, lively and occasionally set adrift by the dementia plundering her mind.Dozens of elderly men and women \u2014 some in wheelchairs, others whose hands tremble involuntarily \u2014 gather excitedly around the game tables. After bingo, there is more entertainment and activities: Yahtzee, tile-painting, beading.Until recently, only nonprofits were allowed to run programs like these. But a year ago, the government flipped the switch, opening the program to for-profit companies as well, ending one of the last remaining holdouts to commercialism in health care. The hope is that the profit motive will expand the services faster.Hanging over all the promise, though, is the question of whether for-profit companies are well-suited to this line of work, long the province of nonprofit do-gooders. Critics point out that the business of caring for poor and frail people is marred with abuse. Already, new ideas for lowering the cost of the program have started circulating. In Silicon Valley, for example, some eager entrepreneurs are pushing plans that call for a higher reliance on video calls instead of in-face doctor visits.The business appeal is simple: A baby boom-propelled surge in government health care spending is coming. Medicare enrollment is expected to grow by 30 million people in the next two decades, and many of those people are potential future clients. Adding to the allure are hefty profit margins for programs like these \u2014 as high as 15 percent, compared with an average of 2 percent among nursing homes \u2014 and geographic monopolies that are all but guaranteed by state Medicaid agencies to ensure the solvency of providers.For decades, though, the program has failed to catch on, with only 40,000 people enrolled as of January of this year.\u201cPACE is still a secret in the minds of the public,\u201d Andy Slavitt, Medicare\u2019s acting administrator, said at the National PACE Association meeting in April. The challenge, he said, was to make PACE \u201ca clear part of the solution.\u201dSeveral private equity firms, venture capitalists and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs have jumped into the niche. F-Prime Capital Partners, a former Fidelity Biosciences group, provided seed funding for a PACE-related start-up, as have well-regarded angel investors like Amir Dan Rubin, the former Stanford Health Care president, and Michael Zubkoff, a Dartmouth health care economist.And no company has moved with more tenacity than InnovAge. Last year, the company overcame protests from watchdog groups to convert from a nonprofit organization to a for-profit business in Colorado. And in May, InnovAge received $196 million in backing \u2014 the largest investment in a PACE business since the rule change was made \u2014 from Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, a private equity firm with $10 billion in assets under management.\u201cFor years we were pariahs, and no one wanted anything to do with us,\u201d said Julie Reiskin, executive director of the Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition, a nonprofit group that advocates for people with disabilities, many of whom are eligible for PACE.\u201cNow that there\u2019s money involved,\u201d Ms. Reiskin said, \u201ceveryone is all interested.\u201dEven the program\u2019s supporters acknowledge that the movement needs fresh momentum. But they worry that commercial operators will tarnish their image in the same way many for-profits eroded trust in hospice care and nursing homes.Three decades ago, after Congress authorized Medicare to pay for hospice care, commercial operators displaced the religious and community groups that had championed the movement. As recently as 2014, government inspectors found that for-profit hospice companies cherry-picked patients and stinted on care.In addition, elderly patients with dementia and chronic ailments have frequently been targets of abuse and neglect at nursing homes, something advocates for the elderly say is correlated with the increased commercialization of that industry.\u201cI\u2019m not wild about every knucklehead running around trying to do PACE,\u201d said Thomas Scully, former Medicare administrator under President George W. Bush. \u201cI would rather keep it below the radar.\u201dEarly last year, Ms. Malveaux was drowning. She lived alone in a tidy red-brick home in a leafy Denver neighborhood that she paid for by working shifts at a Samsonite luggage factory, now closed.Laundry piled up. Bills went unpaid. Doors were left unlocked. Pans sometimes burned on the stove as her memory failed.\u201cI had lost my mind,\u201d she recalled, sitting on her couch in a pink velour robe. \u201cI couldn\u2019t keep up my house.\u201dFor Americans who find themselves in this situation, the next stop is often a traditional nursing home. Ms. Malveaux\u2019s son took her instead to visit an InnovAge day center.The $9 million building south of downtown Denver is designed to calm people with dementia. It has subdued lighting and winding hallways that encircle the first floor like a running track and discourage \u201cexit-seeking behaviors,\u201d where patients search for ways out of a building.For the frightened Ms. Malveaux, it seemed like paradise: a flower garden, a beauty salon and day trips to casinos and candy factories. And, most importantly, it had a team of doctors, nurses, psychiatrists, dentists, physical therapists, nutritionists, home health aides and social workers whose purpose was to help her live safely in her beloved brick home.After joining the center last June 2015, Ms. Malveaux began seeing a psychiatrist and went on medication for depression. A social worker coached her grandson, Jermaine Malveaux, on how to care for someone with dementia. Three days a week, an InnovAge van picks up Ms. Malveaux at home and takes her to the center to share lunch with other older adults and try her luck at bingo and ceramics.\u201cI make friends easily,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cAnd the guys flirt with me.\u201dIn exchange for a capped monthly payment from Medicare and Medicaid, PACE staff members arrange and pay for all of a patient\u2019s doctors\u2019 visits, medications, rehabilitation and hospitalizations. At the same time, they are supposed to pay attention to the patient\u2019s daily needs \u2014 meals, bathing, housekeeping and transportation to day centers, where older people can ward off isolation and cognitive decline by socializing. (Studies have found that the intensive caretaking reduces costly hospital stays.)Comparing the cost effectiveness of PACE against nursing homes is difficult, partly because state Medicaid agencies pay a variety of rates. But all the states are required to keep their rates below what they would pay for nursing home care. In Colorado, for example, that amounts to 7 percent less per patient.On average, Medicare and Medicaid pay PACE providers $76,728 a person a year, about $5,500 less than the average cost of a nursing home. And the money going to PACE covers all of the person\u2019s health and social needs, unlike nursing home care, which doesn\u2019t include hospitalizations and other expensive medical care.The flat government payment pushes the organizations to invest in maintaining a patient\u2019s health and safety to avoid big hospital bills. Dentistry \u2014 excluded from traditional Medicare coverage \u2014 is a crucial focus: Programs invest heavily to fix broken teeth and dentures to avoid costly infections or poor nutrition that can cause cascading health problems.Providers are also generous with rehabilitation, setting few limits on training sessions that strengthen injured muscles and sturdy patients against falls.\u201cIf you\u2019re neglecting these patients, the odds they\u2019ll call an ambulance and go to the hospital and spend a week there because they\u2019re really sick is pretty high, and that all comes out of the payment,\u201d said Bob Kocher, a former senior health care adviser to President Obama.Profits are in no way guaranteed, though. The centers still face major financial risk \u2014 it just takes a few patients with serious medical conditions to upend the books.Dan Gray, a PACE financing consultant at Continuum Development Services, said too many trips to the emergency room or an expensive hospital stay can flip fortunes. One organization he advises had $300,000 in hospital medical claims in a month that he refers to as \u201cBlack August.\u201d\u201cI had a nervous twitch,\u201d he said.In January, at the health care industry\u2019s leading matchmaking event, the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, word quickly spread that PACE programs could save states and the federal government up to 20 percent a patient. And suddenly, the program became one of the hottest topics of discussion.\u201cEvery other conversation was, \u2018What do you think we should do with PACE?\u2019\u201d said Bill Pomeranz, a managing director at Cain Brothers, who helped finance the nation\u2019s first PACE program in the 1970s.The message appeared to travel down Highway 101 as well, to the heart of the technology industry. At least eight start-ups have circulated PACE-related pitches to Silicon Valley venture capital firms, hoping to tap into new capital and create technology-enabled versions of the program.The interest of the tech industry is so far only nascent. But the possibility that Silicon Valley, notoriously aggressive and extremely deep-pocketed, could play a significant role in PACE underscores the changes that may lie ahead.Building a center requires medical offices, rehabilitation equipment, food service and fleets of handicapped-accessible vans. On average, it takes up to $12 million just to get it off the ground. That is a lot of money for most nonprofits but relatively little in the technology world. Opening new centers may become less of a hurdle.The tech industry and nonprofit world are driven by different impulses. The early centers were closely tied to local cultures, making them difficult to replicate. An aversion to aggressive marketing among the center\u2019s leaders didn\u2019t help, either. Tech likes to move as fast as possible.\u201cPACE reminds me of religious orthodoxy,\u201d said Mr. Pomeranz, who said he had affection for the program. The movement\u2019s leaders come from the world of public health and have a \u201csocial work mentality,\u201d he added.The pitches circulating among investors envision technology-enabled programs that would rely, in part, on video visits and sensors. Some studies have found that telemedicine can help patients better control certain chronic conditions and reduce health care spending. But those technologies are largely untested in geriatric care.\u201cThe entrepreneurs coming into this space all believe there are much lower-cost ways to check on patients every day than driving them all to one building,\u201d said Mr. Kocher, who is now a partner at the venture capital firm Venrock, which invests in health care companies.These sorts of pitches, while promising, have not been universally welcomed. They have even been used as evidence that opening PACE up to for-profit companies might lead to unwanted consequences.Veteran PACE providers, for example, are skeptical of virtual medicine\u2019s benefits to seniors, especially those with dementia.\u201cSocialization goes a long way to improve the health of the participants we serve,\u201d said Kelly Hopkins, president of Trinity Health PACE, a nonprofit health system that operates PACE centers in eight states. \u201cIt\u2019s na\u00efve to think you can do it virtually.\u201dSupporters of the change say the necessary safeguards are in place. The for-profit centers were approved, to little fanfare, after the Department of Health and Human Services submitted the results of a pilot study to Congress in June 2015. The demonstration project, in Pennsylvania, showed no difference in quality of care and costs between nonprofit PACE providers and a for-profit allowed to operate there.Maureen Hewitt, InnovAge\u2019s chief executive, said, \u201cAt the end of the day, we\u2019re held to the same quality and care standards.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a way to get rich or generate outsize returns,\u201d said Dr. France, the former chief executive of GoHealth, a chain of urgent care centers acquired by TPG Capital, a private equity firm. \u201cWe think this is an arena for missionaries, not mercenaries.\u201dFamilies enrolled in InnovAge\u2019s PACE program in Denver appeared to be unaware of its conversion into a for-profit enterprise. The company did not announce the change directly to its participants, but notified a patient advisory group.Kathy Baron, 68, who lives in subsidized senior housing, was left disabled by breast cancer and debilitating nerve pain. Her daughter, Leah van Zelm, struggled to take care of her. So Ms. Baron, fearful she would be deemed unfit to stay in her apartment, signed up for InnovAge\u2019s program.\u201cI would rather be dead than go into a nursing home,\u201d Ms. Baron said.She says InnovAge has been generous with services, echoing interviews with other patients. Each week, an InnovAge housekeeper changes the sheets on her bed, launders her clothes and cleans her apartment, a service provided to those unable to tidy their own homes. The few times her requests for special equipment or services were denied, Ms. Baron appealed and won.But she worries new investors will skimp on what outsiders might view as unwarranted services. The company\u2019s commercials, promising \u201cLife on Your Terms\u201d and voiced by the actress Susan Sarandon, have reinforced those concerns.It\u2019s a concern echoed by Ms. Malveaux\u2019s family. \u201cAnytime you involve money,\u201d said Jermaine Malveaux, Ms. Malveaux\u2019s grandson, \u201cthere\u2019s always the concern for greed, especially with the elderly.\u201dAt least in the near future, the number of companies getting into PACE programs will be limited. Most states cap enrollment in PACE centers. And each state \u2014 as Colorado did, opening the window for InnovAge \u2014 likely needs to amend its law to allow the for-profit companies. So far, it appears only California has done so.Yet there is a growing realization among longtime PACE providers that new competition looms.In a newsletter to the generally placid PACE community, one adviser warned that providers who failed to become bigger would face new entrants who \u201cwill find a way to meet the needs of persons in your community.\u201dThose needs will only grow as the adult children of baby boomers face difficult decisions about how to care for their parents.In the meantime, for people like Ms. Van Zelm, the anxiety that once pervaded her daily life has diminished.\u201cWhen she\u2019s stable,\u201d Ms. Van Zelm said of her mother, \u201cmy daily life stress is reduced.\u201dThis article was produced in collaboration with Kaiser Health News, an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Back to School With Budgets Still Tight", "Date": "2016-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe children entering kindergarten and first grade this school year were not yet born when the Great Recession ended in mid-2009. Incoming high school seniors were not yet in middle school.Some states, however, don\u2019t seem particularly interested in addressing the shortfalls, while others, notably California and Minnesota, have moved decisively to do so.The difference has at least as much to do with political priorities as financial challenges. In part, persistent shortfalls in school budgets reflect the depth of the recession and the fitful recovery. To a lesser extent, they also reflect stagnation in federal help, which accounts for nearly 10 percent of school budgets.In contrast, California voters in 2012 approved increases in sales taxes and income taxes on wealthy residents. Earmarked for education, the new revenue was enough to restore much of the state\u2019s school budget, which had been cut deeply in the face of the recession. At the same time, reforms to the state\u2019s school-spending formula have directed more money to low-income schools. Minnesota raised income taxes on wealthy residents in 2013 and is using some of the revenue to bring full-day kindergarten to all school districts and help more low-income families afford preschool.Investment in education is crucial to improving long-term productivity; conversely, failure to invest in education portends the decline of living standards over time. Some states are doing their best, and yet the challenges seem bigger than their best efforts, while others are clearly failing to rise to the challenge. The federal government could play a more constructive role in supporting the leaders and coaxing the laggards. It could offer aid to states, contingent on improvements to their school budgets. It could also earmark a portion of infrastructure spending for school building, repair and renovation, helping to make up for a devastating decline since the recession in school capital spending by states and localities.Every child deserves a good education, but, as a new wave of kindergartners anticipate their first day of school, it is important to acknowledge that not every child is getting one.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Much Does Donald Trump Pay in Taxes? It Could Be Zero", "Date": "2016-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseMitt Romney was excoriated during the 2012 presidential campaign for paying $4.9 million in federal income tax, or an average of just 14 percent of his adjusted gross income, in the two years for which he released returns.No one should be surprised, though, if Donald J. Trump has paid far less \u2014 perhaps even zero federal income tax in some years. Indeed, that\u2019s the expectation of numerous real estate and tax professionals I\u2019ve interviewed in recent weeks.Even with hundreds of millions in gross revenue from his vast real estate empire, \u201cit\u2019s both possible and legal that Donald Trump would pay little or no income tax,\u201d said Len Green, an accountant and chairman of the Green Group, a tax and accounting advisory firm. Mr. Green is also a real estate investor, teaches at Babson College and is the author of the forthcoming \u201cThe Entrepreneur\u2019s Playbook.\u201d\u201cI would expect he\u2019s paying little or no tax,\u201d agreed Steven M. Rosenthal, a veteran tax lawyer and senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy center.That\u2019s because Mr. Trump, as a prominent and active developer, can take advantage of some of the most generous tax breaks in the federal tax code to reduce his reported income to near zero, or even report a loss.Few tax advisers to major real estate developers would speak for attribution, because their clients benefit from the same tax breaks available to Mr. Trump. But all told me they knew developers in Mr. Trump\u2019s league who pay little or no income tax despite hundreds of millions in cash flow.\u201cReal estate is notorious for throwing off huge deductions,\u201d Mr. Rosenthal said. \u201cThat coupled with wide latitude in the timing and recognition of income make real estate development extremely attractive from a tax standpoint.\u201dThe Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment, nor did William F. Nelson, a former general counsel to the Internal Revenue Service and partner at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s tax lawyers.Mr. Trump has said in the past that highly paid corporate executives \u201cget away with murder\u201d on their taxes while boasting that he pays as little as the law allows. At the same time, he has insisted that his federal income tax payments are \u201csubstantial.\u201dNo one I spoke to has seen Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns, because he has not released them. One obvious potential reason is that he reports little or no taxable income, and thus pays very little to support the government he wants to run. He is not obligated by law to make his returns public, but every candidate since Richard Nixon refused to has done so. (Gerald Ford released summaries.) Mr. Romney was harshly criticized for releasing just two years\u2019 worth, and it became a major campaign issue four years ago.Even though his recent returns are confidential, the notion that Mr. Trump has paid little or no tax is not entirely speculative. It\u2019s consistent with Mr. Trump\u2019s returns from the late 1970s, which he filed with the New Jersey Casino Control Commission when applying for a casino license in 1981. Mr. Trump reported losses and paid no federal income tax in 1978 and 1979 and paid only modest sums \u2014 a total of less than $75,000 \u2014 for the prior three years.Their conclusions are reinforced by Mr. Trump\u2019s extensive financial disclosures required of presidential candidates. His latest filing in May lists 564 entities in which he holds a position, usually president, director or \u201cmember.\u201d Most are corporations, usually owned in turn by a limited liability company and associated with a specific Trump-owned property, such as the office tower at 40 Wall Street (the subject of four such L.L.C.s, each of which owns a major interest in the other). That does not count entities in which Mr. Trump does not hold any position.He lists 188 entries under \u201cemployment assets and income.\u201d Candidates are only required to list assets from which they earn more than $200; reporting money-losing ventures is optional.L.L.C.s pass on income tax-free (and, equally important, losses) to their owners. Real estate L.L.C.s can generate enormous losses, even with millions in revenue, because of depreciation, interest payments, real estate taxes and operating costs. Mr. Trump can use paper losses to offset taxable income, such as interest, dividends, royalties and employment income.That\u2019s a loophole that was eliminated for most investors in the landmark tax reform legislation in 1986. But because of aggressive lobbying by the powerful real estate industry, so-called active developers like Mr. Trump were exempted from restrictions on using such paper losses to offset ordinary income.The tax value of Mr. Trump\u2019s paper losses may well exceed his investment in the underlying properties, because he and other developers typically make minimal down payments and use as much debt as possible to finance a purchase. To take just one example, Mr. Trump bought what is now the Trump National Doral Miami resort and golf club for $150 million while it was in bankruptcy proceedings and financed the purchase with $125 million in loans from Deutsche Bank.Interest payments on mortgages and loans are deductible. How much total debt Mr. Trump\u2019s properties have incurred is not known, but based on his latest financial disclosure (which shows only ranges), it\u2019s at least $250 million and probably far more than that, with some estimates close to $1 billion. At an average interest rate of 4 percent, that deduction alone is worth at least $10 million a year and perhaps $40 million or more.At least interest is a cash payment. Depreciation is a noncash charge, and is largely an accounting conceit that benefits real estate investors. The theory is that real estate loses value over time and is eventually worthless. As everyone surely knows, most real estate has historically appreciated in value.How much Mr. Trump\u2019s property investments might throw off in depreciation depends on what he paid for them, how much he\u2019s spent on capital improvements and how the assets are categorized (some assets qualify for accelerated depreciation). But the 39-year depreciation schedule for commercial property, and purchases and capital investments of $2 billion (a modest estimate, given that Mr. Trump values his assets at $10 billion), would generate depreciation deductions of $50 million a year.Depreciation is ordinarily recaptured and taxed when an asset is sold. But Mr. Trump and other developers can benefit from provisions that make that unlikely. If they sell appreciated properties at a large profit but use the proceeds to buy other real estate, the transactions may be considered a \u201clike-kind\u201d exchange. If so, there\u2019s no tax on the gain.Critics have called like-kind exchanges an outrageous tax loophole that benefits wealthy real estate developers and other investors to the tune of $33 billion in lost tax revenue a year. The Obama administration has called for repealing it, and several bipartisan measures to do so have been introduced in Congress, all to no avail given the gridlock over tax reform.\u201cIt\u2019s a big loophole,\u201d Mr. Rosenthal said of the like-kind exchange provisions. \u201cIt allows well-to-do and well-advised taxpayers to defer their tax liability potentially until death.\u201dAlmost all presidential nominees since 1976 have made their tax returns public, most around Tax Day in April  \u2014 about 200 days before the election.Mr. Trump\u2019s business entities also deduct real estate taxes and all their operating costs and expenses, which might well include most of Mr. Trump\u2019s living and travel expenses, because his personal and business lives are so intertwined. (Even his suits are presumably a business cost, because he has a men\u2019s wear line.)\u201cThe difference between business and personal costs can be a very fine line,\u201d Mr. Green said, \u201cespecially for someone like Trump.\u201dThis may also explain why Mr. Trump has not disclosed many large charitable contributions, because the charitable deduction would be of scant value if he has little or no taxable income.The enormous tax benefits available to real estate developers like Mr. Trump make yet another a compelling case for overhauling the tax system. But that\u2019s not to say he\u2019s done anything wrong.\u201cPeople aren\u2019t obligated to pay taxes they don\u2019t owe,\u201d Mr. Green said. \u201cIt\u2019s the job of tax professionals to use every legal means to minimize taxes, and I\u2019m sure Trump has some of the best working for him. Many wealthy people pay no tax.\u201dBut they\u2019re not running for president.\u201cIt is disqualifying for a modern-day presidential nominee to refuse to release tax returns to the voters,\u201d Mitt Romney recently said on Facebook.He, of all people, should know.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of some business structures in which Mr. Trump holds a position. They are limited liability companies, not corporations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple, Congress and the Missing Taxes", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialApple and the United States are crying foul over the ruling in Europe that Apple received illegal tax breaks from Ireland and must hand over 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion), a record tax penalty in Europe.But Apple and the United States have only themselves to blame for the situation.Initially, deferral was a convenience for multinationals, as they sought investment opportunities abroad. Today, it is the taproot of global tax avoidance. Financial engineering has let American companies shift profits into foreign accounts, while they lobby Congress for tax-rate cuts in exchange for repatriating the money. Currently, there is some $2 trillion in corporate profits in offshore tax-deferred accounts; besides Apple, Microsoft, Google, Cisco and Oracle also have large stashes. Apple is one of nearly two dozen major corporations pushing Congress for a \u201ctax holiday,\u201d which would let companies bring back foreign-held money over the course of a year at a discounted tax rate, rather than the current rate, 35 percent.Before the European ruling on Tuesday, the debate over a tax holiday had pitted Republicans, who have generally favored the idea, against Democrats, who have viewed it as an unjustified reward for tax avoidance. The Democrats have history on their side. A tax holiday in 2005 lowered the corporate rate to 5.25 percent, enticing corporations to repatriate some $300 billion. It was billed as a way to create jobs and increase investment, but the money was used mostly for dividend payments, share buybacks (which tend to raise executive pay) and severance for laid-off employees. Worse, the tax holiday inspired multinationals to stash as much money abroad as they possibly could in anticipation of another holiday.The European ruling, however, could sharply alter the terms of the congressional debate. Republicans and Democrats alike have always assumed that foreign-held profits would one day be repatriated. The big question was the rate at which they would ultimately be taxed. Similarly, the Treasury assumes that deferred foreign profits will one day be taxed when it projects future revenues \u2014 an important measure of the nation\u2019s fiscal health.But the money won\u2019t be repatriated and taxed under American law if Europeans, in the course of enforcing their own laws against tax havens, get their hands on it first. And that, in a nutshell, is why members of Congress and Treasury officials are so upset about the Apple ruling. They understand, correctly, that tax-law enforcement in Europe could reduce the sums they expect to collect taxes on someday. What they don\u2019t understand, or aren\u2019t saying, is that they brought the problem on themselves.The way forward is not to declare a tax war with Europe. It is for Congress to agree on a way to tax foreign-held corporate profits. President Obama put forth a reasonable approach in 2015, when he proposed a mandatory 14 percent tax on multinationals\u2019 current offshore profits \u2014 whether they are repatriated or not \u2014 and, thereafter, a new minimum tax rate of 19 percent on profits moved offshore. An even better approach would be to simply end indefinite corporate tax deferral, imposing American taxes on profits when they are made.Republicans rejected Mr. Obama\u2019s proposal in 2015, and there is no chance that lawmakers will engage in such a debate so close to the election. But the next president and Congress will need to act to ensure that at long last, American corporations pay their fair share in taxes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Condemnation of Charter Schools Exposes a Rift Over Black Students", "Date": "2016-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith charter schools educating as many as half the students in some American cities, they have been championed as a lifeline for poor black children stuck in failing traditional public schools.But now the nation\u2019s oldest and newest black civil rights organizations are calling for a moratorium on charter schools.Their demands, and the outcry that has ensued, expose a divide among blacks that goes well beyond the now-familiar complaints about charters\u2019 diverting money and attention from traditional public schools.They portray charters as the pet project of foundations financed by white billionaires, and argue that the closing of traditional schools as students migrate to charters has disproportionately disrupted black communities.Black leaders of groups that support charter schools have denounced the resolutions, saying they contradict both the N.A.A.C.P.\u2019s mission of expanding opportunity and polls showing support for charters among black parents. The desire for integration, the charter school proponents say, cannot outweigh the urgent need to give some of the country\u2019s poorest students a way out of underperforming schools.The debate about race and charters is long simmering. Black residents of cities like New Orleans, which has converted nearly all of its public schools to charters in the decade since Hurricane Katrina, have complained that the people who come in presenting themselves as education reformers tend to be white outsiders. Charter school leaders themselves have begun to acknowledge that they do not have enough blacks in their ranks or in front of their classrooms.But to some black parents, those concerns seem academic.Chris Stewart recalled feeling \u201clike a complete loser\u201d when his son was entering middle school in Minneapolis. A specialty public school had no room; other parents were warning him away from two nearby traditional public schools; and he could not afford a reduced tuition of $12,000 \u2014 what he called \u201cthe poor people\u2019s discount\u201d \u2014 for a private school.He found a charter school where black students were thriving and classrooms seemed orderly. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t perfect, it wasn\u2019t horrible, it just was better,\u201d he said. \u201cIt set my mind at ease and let me go to work every day with a sense that I had done the best that I could.\u201dBut Cornell William Brooks, the president of the N.A.A.C.P., noted that not all charter schools are high performers. \u201cThis is very much a mixed bag,\u201d he said, noting that he had given a commencement address at North Star Academy, a well-regarded charter in Newark. \u201cThis whole notion that charter schools are uniformly excellent, and therefore that people don\u2019t even get to raise the question, is simply not the case.\u201dAlthough charters are supposed to admit students by lottery, some effectively skim the best students from the pool, with enrollment procedures that discourage all but the most motivated parents to apply. Some charters have been known to nudge out their most troubled students.That, the groups supporting a moratorium say, concentrates the poorest students in public schools that are struggling for resources.Charter schools \u201care allowed to get away with a lot more,\u201d said Hiram Rivera, an author of the Black Lives platform and the executive director of the Philadelphia Student Union.Another platform author, Jonathan Stith, the national coordinator for the Alliance for Educational Justice, chose a charter school in Washington for one of his children because it promised an Afrocentric curriculum. But he began to see the school driving out students. It was difficult, he said, for parents to push back against the private boards that run the schools.\u201cWhere you see the charters providing an avenue of escape for some, it hasn\u2019t been for the majority,\u201d he said.Mr. Stith came to think the money would be better spent on fixing the traditional public school system.But Mr. Stewart said a moratorium on charters would effectively make black parents \u201cwards of the state.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s just stupid,\u201d he said. \u201cCan you imagine us saying that with police forces? \u2018They\u2019re good institutions. All we need to do is double down on supporting them.\u2019\u201dDr. Fuller, who is also a professor of education at Marquette University, argues that the criticism of charters ignores the patterns of racism in the United States and the many ways traditional school districts have perpetuated it.\u201cYou look at traditional districts, housing policies, all the things that have created this problem, and a charter school comes into these environments and tries to create a great school,\u201d he said. \u201cFor you to criticize based on segregation is beyond the pale. I don\u2019t understand it. I literally don\u2019t understand it.\u201dCharter supporters say the debate reflects class more than race.\u201cIt\u2019s a divide between families who are served by charters and see the tangible effects that high-quality charters are having, and some who don\u2019t live in the inner-city communities, where it becomes more of an ideological question versus an urgent life-and-death issue for their kids,\u201d said Shavar Jeffries, the president of Democrats for Education Reform and a former president of the advisory school board in Newark, where his children attend a charter school.\u201cAny advocate for black and brown people in cities knows that for generations, traditional public schools have failed these students,\u201d Mr. Jeffries said. \u201cThat\u2019s not even in question.\u201dSupporters of charters also say that the civil rights groups are allied with teachers\u2019 unions that see charters, which generally are not unionized, as a threat to their existence.Mr. Brooks disputed that, saying that the N.A.A.C.P. resolution had been approved by 2,000 delegates and that \u201cwe don\u2019t have 2,000 teachers\u2019 union lobbyists among our delegates.\u201dThe resolution would not become official until the national board votes on it in October. In the meantime, Mr. Brooks urged less \u201chyperventilating\u201d and more focus on addressing problems that critics of the charter schools have cited.\u201cIf the point of some is for parents and citizens to be grateful and silent, that\u2019s not a particularly democratic response,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople can be grateful for good schools but also critical in terms of what can be done better.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Would he like to become one of the 25 bachelors who vie for the heart of a bachelorette, episode after episode, as she gradually and sometimes ruthlessly winnows them down?The timing of the call was good. \u201cI had no love life,\u201d said Mr. Brown, a graduate of Yale who also has two master\u2019s degrees from Columbia, one in business and one in strategic communications. Although Mr. Brown is so classically handsome he could be a model for a Ken doll, he did not excel at dating or flirting.\u201cShall we say, it\u2019s not his style to be a playboy,\u201d said Avik Roy, a friend from Yale. \u201cHe\u2019s a bit shy and traditional and gentlemanly.\u201dFriends were shocked when he agreed to be on the show. \u201cPeople think, \u2018Wow, reality television is just one train wreck after another,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Brown, now 36 and the chief investment officer at Capital Counsel, an asset management firm in Manhattan. \u201cI decided it was a risk worth taking and a great way to grow as a person.\u201d\u201cPeople would come up to me on the subway and say: \u2018I can\u2019t believe you wore red pants. No wonder she got rid of you,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cOr, \u2018You know, you really shouldn\u2019t cut your hair so short because that would hide your big forehead.\u2019\u201dAs an escape, he signed up for a three-week National Outdoor Leadership School sailing expedition in Mexico in October 2012. \u201cYou just hold your head high and go sailing and hope the ocean has the answer,\u201d he said.Allison Palm, now 26, also signed up for the trip. She had just graduated from Brown and wanted to do something out of the ordinary and out of her comfort zone. \u201cI was a supernerd in high school,\u201d she said. \u201cI was this very strict engineer in college. I knew I was going to be an engineer in my career. I thought, \u2018I\u2019m so one-dimensional.\u2019\u201dWhen Ms. Palm met Mr. Brown, she thought he seemed overly formal, with his unwrinkled clothes and impeccable manners. \u201cHe was so perfect,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought, \u2018Come on, we\u2019re just sailing!\u2019\u201dShe soon changed her mind about him. \u201cHe was so enthusiastic about all the hard things we were doing, like getting in the cold water to do safety drills,\u201d she said. At one point, a tropical storm forced the group to camp out for days on a cactus-covered island. \u201cHe was telling stories and laughing,\u201d Ms. Palm said. \u201cHe is such a blast, so much fun.\u201dThe group traveled in a flotilla, four people to each sailboat, and he always maneuvered to be on her boat. \u201cWe were definitely the two most nerdy people on the trip,\u201d he said. \u201cShe may even take the cake in this regard. When she was the navigator, my God, copious documentation of all aspects of the trip.\u201dEach sensed they may become a couple one day, yet neither was in a rush. \u201cWe absolutely loved spending time together and wanted to see how this would unfold,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was no need to apply pressure or cadence.\u201dAfter the trip ended, she returned to her hometown, Fayetteville, N.Y., and he went to his apartment in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, where a river raft hung from the ceiling and the bookshelves were filled with Lonely Planet travel guides. Mr. Brown somehow manages to sustain a career in finance and regularly take off on long, meticulously planned, off-the-grid adventures.Over the next few years, he and Ms. Palm went on many together. Weeks after the sailing trip ended, they climbed Mount Miyanoura in Japan. Back in New York, they explored the East River by raft (\u201cAmes paddling, me terrified,\u201d Ms. Palm said); discovered they both love to spend whole days coding on the computer; and had their first kiss in Washington Square Park.Months later, they went snow camping in the Dolomites in Italy. They rarely discussed their relationship (and still don\u2019t talk about it much). \u201cIt wasn\u2019t something we had to say,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just had a feeling: \u2018This is working. This is great.\u2019\u201dFriends say her particular amalgam of qualities match his. \u201cShe\u2019s supersmart, hyperanalytical, diligent and highly adventurous at the same time,\u201d Mr. Roy said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find those qualities simultaneously.\u201dIn 2013, still yearning for a more creative path, Ms. Palm enrolled in Alma, a culinary school in Italy. \u201cI wondered if Ames and I would climb mountains together again or if living an ocean apart would end a beautiful story,\u201d she said. They left their relationship open-ended. Maybe they would be a couple when she got back, maybe not.As part of the program, she worked in the kitchen at Il Marin restaurant in Genoa. One day, while peeling shrimp there, she was shocked to spot Mr. Brown sitting alone in the dining room. \u201cThe flood of adrenaline was so intense,\u201d she said. She was so nervous that she ran into the walk-in refrigerator to calm down. \u201cAmes really understands the art of surprise,\u201d she said.He said: \u201cI didn\u2019t like the idea of Skyping or texting, and she felt the same way, so we didn\u2019t do any of that. We wrote some letters, but I thought the most romantic message would be myself.\u201dBack in New York in the fall of 2014, she began a graduate program in operations research at Columbia and moved into Mr. Brown\u2019s apartment. Living together was far easier than their other adventures; it didn\u2019t feel like an adjustment at all. \u201cThe only difference was we had to share a closet,\u201d she said.On Christmas morning 2015, he surprised her once again, this time while she was visiting her family in Fayetteville. Tipped off by Ms. Palm\u2019s father, Bram Palm, Mr. Brown learned she would be picking up a prescription at the Rite Aid in nearby Syracuse. He stood by the prescription counter, waiting for her.\u201cThe first thing I said was, \u2018What are you doing here?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cHe said, \u201cI\u2019m here to propose to you.\u2019\u201dHis proposal reflected their philosophy about traveling, and life in general. \u201cOne part of our relationship is this idea that there is beauty in unexpected places,\u201d she said. \u201cReally special things don\u2019t have to happen on top of mountains. They can happen in a pharmacy.\u201dAlso, really special things don\u2019t have to cost a lot. \u201cI didn\u2019t want the expensive proposal on a faraway island,\u201d he said.On July 30, they were married at the Church of the Heavenly Rest on the Upper East Side, in a 10 a.m. ceremony officiated by the Rev. Matthew Heyd, an Episcopal priest. \u201cWe loved the idea of an old-fashioned morning wedding,\u201d Ms. Palm said.Mr. Brown wore gray slacks and a double-breasted navy blazer, while Ms. Palm chose a Dolce & Gabbana three-quarter-length flowery dress. If she had stood in a lineup with her bridesmaids, a stranger may not have been able to pick her out as the bride. \u201cShe was pretty dead set on not getting a typical wedding dress,\u201d said Katie Leaird, a bridesmaid. \u201cIt\u2019s not her, it\u2019s not fun.\u201dHalfway through the reception at the James Burden Mansion nearby, the couple disappeared to change into their going-away outfits, another old-fashioned tradition. They reappeared wearing hiking clothes, boots, backpacks and scarves that were voluminous enough to double as towels or blankets if necessary. After waving goodbye to their 211 guests, they headed out to the airport and took off for their honeymoon: a month of trekking in Nepal.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Greek Crisis, the Book. Or Actually Several of Them.", "Date": "2016-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn May last year, James K. Galbraith, a left-leaning American economist, sent an email to Greece\u2019s finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, in which he argued that an exit from the eurozone would benefit Greece.Mr. Galbraith, who was advising Mr. Varoufakis at the time, made the case that a new currency would wash away the country\u2019s debts, solve Greece\u2019s competitiveness problem and ultimately create what he called a \u201cgood society.\u201d Though the step was opposed by most Greeks, he had drawn up a contingency plan for Greece under Mr. Varoufakis\u2019s direction, in the event the country was forced to leave the currency zone by its creditors.In the end, there was not a so-called Grexit. One year ago this month, after the polarizing finance minister left his post, Greece agreed to its third bailout with Europe, accepting yet another round of brutal austerity measures as the price for a new round of loans.A starry-eyed embrace of all that Mr. Varoufakis said and did, the book also highlights the extent to which unorthodox, if not unrealistic, economic thinking reached the highest levels of the Greek government as it battled with its creditors last summer.As the anniversary of Greece\u2019s bailout deal approaches, there have been several memoirs, essays, a blistering critique of the International Monetary Fund\u2019s policies in Europe and even a book of poetry that, from various perspectives, examine Greece\u2019s torturous struggle to avoid bankruptcy.And as the negotiations between Greece and its creditors slowly press on, these works serve as a reminder that an agreement allowing Greece to pay off its debts without strangling its economy is unlikely to be reached any time soon.\u201cThere is a fog-of-war atmosphere here that inhibits good policy making,\u201d said Paul Blustein, a former Washington Post reporter and the author of \u201cLaid Low: Inside the Crisis that Overwhelmed Europe and the I.M.F.,\u201d which will be out in October. \u201cBut there are no villains \u2014 just people fighting their corner and kicking the can down the road.\u201dBesides Mr. Galbraith\u2019s work, Mr. Varoufakis and George Papaconstantinou, the finance minister during the saga\u2019s early days, have come out with books. Nick Papandreou, the brother of former prime minister George Papandreou, has written a searing personal essay about the Greek press attacking his family. And a collection of poems, \u201cAusterity Measures,\u201d examines the crisis.The report reveals how I.M.F. staff members operated outside official channels, kept sensitive papers in personal files, withheld crucial documents from the watchdog agency and did not keep the fund\u2019s board fully informed during the crisis.The secrecy was such, I.M.F. board members said, that at times they learned more of what was going on in Greece from media reports than their own staff.The I.M.F. has a mandate to serve as an objective lender of last resort to troubled economies. The report by the watchdog agency, which also examines the crises in Ireland and Portugal, highlights just how difficult it was for the fund to fulfill its mission in developed Europe as opposed to the emerging world where it usually operates.I.M.F. economists did not foresee the crisis in Europe \u2014 from bank blowups in Spain and Ireland to sovereign bankruptcy in Greece \u2014 because of \u201cgroupthink and intellectual capture,\u201d the report said.The I.M.F., after all, has always been run by a European, and many of its top executives, hailing from Italy, Spain, France and Portugal, had complete trust in the sanctity and strength of the euro.It was not until mid-2010, the watchdog points out, when the Greek crisis was in full swing, that I.M.F. economists first accepted that excessive borrowing by smaller countries using the euro \u2014 Greece and Ireland \u2014 could have a destabilizing effect on the currency zone.Time and again, the review highlights this unwillingness of the fund to challenge European officials as a persistent flaw in its policies, leading to its highly controversial decision to lend money to Greece in 2010, even though economists at the fund believed that the near-bankrupt country had little chance of paying the money back.In blunt language, Susan Schadler, a former top official at the I.M.F., writes that the I.M.F. was too easily swayed by European officials who argued that not lending to Greece, or requiring it to restructure its debt, would create a systemic panic in the markets.In a response to the watchdog agency\u2019s report, Christine Lagarde, the managing director of I.M.F., called the fund\u2019s involvement in Europe a qualified success. She said Greece\u2019s problems were unique and that the bottom line was that the country had remained in the euro.European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.But Ms. Schadler has a different view, seeing the decision and the secretive way it was handled as damaging to the fund\u2019s reputation.\u201cBy not following an open, transparent process, the fund created the perception that a decision made in Europe had been imposed on it,\u201d she wrote in her paper.A self-published memoir by George Papaconstantinou, the Greek finance minister at the time, looks at why the I.M.F. had to lend to Greece in the first place in 2010.One tends to forget just how absurd Greek finances were when he took over.One example: The Greek Finance Ministry spent 35,000 euros a month on buying newspapers alone.And there are some juicy vignettes, such as a warning from Jean-Claude Trichet, then the head of the European Central Bank, that a restructuring of Greek debt would have the same effect on global markets as allowing Lehman Brothers to fail.Mr. Papandreou\u2019s essay, \u201cTaming the Dogs of War,\u201d which he presented in April at a conference on media pressures from business and government, covers some similar ground.He recounts how the newspapers in Greece, which are controlled by powerful businessmen, attacked him as well as his brother, the former prime minister, accusing him of hoarding money overseas and driving him to the brink of suicide.For the many who are waiting for his promised tell-all about his experiences battling with European and I.M.F. officials over Greece\u2019s debt, this is not that book.Fans of Mr. Varoufakis will lap up his fiery criticisms of European and American economic policy making, but other readers will prefer to wait until next summer when his blow-by-blow account is scheduled to be published.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fox News Names 2 Insiders to Top Posts", "Date": "2016-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn assuming the leadership of Fox News last month, Rupert Murdoch pledged a fresh start at a network reeling from accusations that its longtime chairman, Roger Ailes, had overseen a culture of harassment and intimidation.But on Friday, Mr. Murdoch made clear that \u2014 for now at least \u2014 Fox\u2019s new era will be led by its old guard.Two veteran executives with deep ties to Mr. Ailes were named co-presidents of Fox News, the network announced, a nod toward corporate stability that was also taken as a sign that Mr. Murdoch was not yet prepared to fully overhaul management at one of his most profitable franchises.Bill Shine, an affable Ailes loyalist who is well liked by some of the network\u2019s longest-serving anchors, like Sean Hannity, will oversee programming at Fox News and Fox Business Network. Jack Abernethy, a trusted Murdoch hand who runs Fox\u2019s television station group, was placed in charge of business operations, including finance and advertising sales.The appointments are Mr. Murdoch\u2019s first major personnel moves at the network since the ouster of Mr. Ailes, whose 20-year tenure was upturned by sexual harassment allegations by a former anchor, Gretchen Carlson. And it suggested that Mr. Murdoch and his sons, James and Lachlan, are now focused on calming an unsettled newsroom, even as more women come forward with troubling stories about the network\u2019s culture under Mr. Ailes.\u201cAnybody who expected seismic changes was wrong,\u201d said Andrew Heyward, a former president of CBS News. \u201cThis sends a strong signal to a jittery, shaken staff that Fox News plans to stay the course.\u201dMr. Murdoch, 85, who named himself executive chairman of Fox News on Friday, is expected to take a hands-on role there at least through the presidential election in November. Since becoming acting chief executive in July, Mr. Murdoch has been a constant presence in the Manhattan newsroom, piping up at news meetings and greeting employees in the hall. He recently moved into Mr. Ailes\u2019s corner office on the second floor.On Friday, Fox also announced that its longtime chief financial officer, Mark Kranz, would retire. His departure was linked to his oversight of the network\u2019s finances during a period when financial settlements were made with women who had complained of harassment, according to two people who requested anonymity to describe internal matters.Fox News is a significant source of profit for its parent company, 21st Century Fox, and the Murdochs would prefer smooth operations at the cable channel during a tumultuous election season that has resulted in record ratings. The elder Mr. Murdoch has said he is committed to maintaining Fox\u2019s \u201cdistinctive, powerful\u201d voice, curbing the predictions of those who thought that the right-leaning views of Fox\u2019s opinion anchors might soften in the absence of Mr. Ailes.Mr. Shine, 53, has been with Fox since shortly after the channel debuted in 1996. He is a favored figure among some veteran anchors, including Mr. Hannity, who first recommended him to Mr. Ailes for a job. A Long Island native, Mr. Shine cut his teeth at the network producing Mr. Hannity\u2019s program and working closely with personalities like Bill O\u2019Reilly.His appointment was widely viewed as a sign of stability at a chaotic time, particularly with newsroom gossip focused on whether top-tier anchors could leave in the wake of Mr. Ailes\u2019s departure.Since Ms. Carlson went public with her allegations on July 6, a schism has developed within Fox News between Fox News loyalists \u2014 some of whom owe their careers to Mr. Ailes \u2014 upset at his ouster and others who either did not come forward or were dismayed by those who were defending Mr. Ailes before the investigation was complete.Still, Mr. Shine was considered one of Mr. Ailes\u2019s most loyal lieutenants. And his name, along with those of other executives, surfaced in recent accounts by two women who came forward to describe difficult experiences at Fox News.Andrea Tantaros, a daytime host, told The New York Times that when she complained to Mr. Shine about being harassed by Mr. Ailes, he told her, \u201cDon\u2019t fight this.\u201d Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Shine said that Ms. Tantaros never complained to him about Mr. Ailes harassing her.In a statement on Friday, Mr. Murdoch wrote: \u201cBill Shine has developed and produced a signature prime time that has dominated the cable news landscape for 14 of his 20 years with Fox News. His leadership and keen eye for programming has played a fundamental role in the success of both Fox News and Fox Business Network.\u201dOf Mr. Abernethy, who is 60, Mr. Murdoch wrote that his appointment \u201cwill ensure continued growth of Fox News and Fox Business Network for generations to come.\u201dFox News also announced that Suzanne Scott had been named executive vice president of programming and would oversee the network\u2019s daytime and prime-time opinion shows. Jay Wallace will remain in charge of the news division. Ms. Scott and Mr. Wallace will report to Mr. Shine. Dianne Brandi, the general counsel, is expected to stay on as well.An article on Saturday about leadership changes at Fox News misstated what Bill Shine, who has been promoted to co-president of Fox News, said he knew about a relationship between Roger Ailes, the former chief executive and chairman of Fox News, and Laurie Luhn, a former Fox booker. Mr. Shine had told associates that he did not know that Mr. Ailes was in a relationship with Ms. Luhn; he did not say that he knew about it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Some Good News for Investors: The Bull May Still Have Spring in Its Step", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThe bull market in stocks has been supported by two fundamental pillars: high corporate earnings and low interest rates. Both of these mainstays appeared wobbly early this year. Fortunately for investors, there is now some good news for both of them.Corporate earnings and cash flow, which had flagged, are stabilizing and perhaps rising, according to a stream of corporate reports released during the quarterly earnings season, which is nearing its end.Taken together, this information is hardly a guarantee that stocks will continue to rise or that current market levels will seem sensible years from now. But for investors, the interest rate and earnings environment has become friendly again, and without these buttresses, the outlook for stocks would be much gloomier.As he acknowledged, it\u2019s not entirely a rosy picture, and the numbers are complicated enough to make your head swim. On a year-to-year basis, for example, earnings in the second quarter are expected to have declined more than 2.2 percent for companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, according to a tally by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. That\u2019s hardly cause for rejoicing.Exclude energy companies, however, and year-to-year earnings improved to a positive 2.3 percent growth rate. Moreover, Mr. Yardeni noted that compared with the level of the previous quarter, overall earnings for companies in the S.&P. 500 increased in the second quarter. And while the consensus of Wall Street analysts is that the current quarter\u2019s earnings will post another year-over-year decline, Mr. Yardeni expects that earnings will at least be no worse than they were in the previous quarter and will perhaps grow modestly.\u201cThe point is that earnings are much better than you might have expected, given the dollar, given what happened to energy and commodity prices, and given the slow growth of the global economy,\u201d he said.What\u2019s more, the cash generated by corporate America has allowed companies not only to pay reasonably handsome dividends but also to buy back large quantities of their own shares. These buybacks have strengthened the market: By reducing the number of shares, they have been making earnings per share look much better, and that should continue.But the simplest way of looking at it, he says, and the most important for an investor, is to consider how interest rates affect the value of a stock and a bond. \u201cLow rates have had a big effect on the stock market,\u201d he said. \u201cStock is much, much cheaper than bonds at today\u2019s interest rates.\u201dThis comparison may seem odd, if you\u2019re not accustomed to thinking this way. It works like this: For the S.&P. 500, the price-to-earnings ratio is about 20, which means that for every $100 worth of stock, you receive $5 in earnings. By comparison, a 10-year Treasury note, with a yield of 1.6 percent, pays out only $1.60 for a $100 investment. The bond has a price-to-earnings ratio of more than 60, meaning that it\u2019s more than three times as expensive as stock. If interest rates rose to, say, 10 percent, their rough level in 1979, he said, the price-to-earnings ratio of bonds would drop to 10: Current stock prices would look unreasonably high in that environment, he said.\u201cIn the world we live in right now,\u201d he said, \u201clow interest rates make stocks look very good, at least in comparison to bonds.\u201dThat\u2019s why the latest signals from the bond market, and the latest statements from the Federal Reserve, are so important for stock investors. They indicate that while rates are likely to rise moderately in the United States in the next year, they probably won\u2019t rise very much, and low rates will be with us for some time. Inflation is very low, growth is meager, and the economy is vulnerable to shocks.In her speech on Friday in Jackson Hole, Ms. Yellen acknowledged as much. If the economy continues to improve, she said, the Fed will raise its benchmark federal funds rate, as it has stated for many months. That rate is now between 0.25 and 0.5 percent. But she also emphasized that the central bank wasn\u2019t likely to raise rates very much.This raises complex problems for central bankers. For stock investors, though, it provides straightforward confirmation of a central assumption of the bull market: While there may be some short-term increases, low interest rates are likely to be here for some time to come.That\u2019s not entirely positive. If economic growth were stronger, inflation would probably be higher and interest rates would rise. Without strong growth, churning out robust corporate earnings will be a challenge. For now, though, the twin pillars of the stock market remain intact. That could keep the bull market in stocks, now in its eighth year, cavorting for a while longer.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

What is surprising is that it has taken so long for the issue to gain prominence. After all, affordable high-quality child care is one remedy to the long stagnation in wages afflicting most of the work force. It is also an antidote to the waning productivity that threatens future living standards.High-quality child care is a win-win, helping to raise earnings now and increase productivity over the long term while enriching the lives of children. Only Mrs. Clinton, who has long focused on the needs of children, has a realistic plan to make this long overdue investment in families.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Billion-Dollar Jackpot: Engineered to Drain Your Wallet", "Date": "2016-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesIf you\u2019ve noticed that colossal lottery winnings are becoming almost common this year, it\u2019s no accident. Four of the 10 biggest jackpots in United States history have already occurred in 2016, an engineered outcome intended to generate mind-bogglingly big winners.That\u2019s thrilling if you are the rare winner of hundreds of millions of dollars. But whether it\u2019s a good thing for scores of millions of other people who play government-sponsored lottery games is highly questionable, as a close look at the numbers reveals.What is immediately evident, though, is that the high frequency of enormous jackpots results from skillful planning, says Salil Mehta, an independent statistician. \u201cThis was deliberate,\u201d Mr. Mehta says. \u201cThe jackpots are growing very rapidly, and at a certain point when the jackpot rises into the hundreds of millions of dollars, there is a buzz, and people start betting much more.\u201dThose gigantic jackpots set people dreaming. I\u2019m not immune to lottery fever. I hadn\u2019t bought a lottery ticket of any kind for years, until last January, when the Powerball jackpot amounted to nearly $1.6 billion. That was one awesome number. We began talking about it at work. Two colleagues and I split a few tickets. We understood that we had almost no chance of winning, and didn\u2019t care: It was fun.Behavior like ours seems to account for the rapid surge in lottery sales, bringing jackpots to a higher and higher level, Mr. Mehta suggests. Once the jackpot reaches a certain threshold \u2014 somewhere in the hundreds of millions, these days \u2014 people begin talking and rushing to buy tickets, including people who don\u2019t typically buy lottery tickets, and the jackpot soars even higher.I have no problem with that on a personal level. In fact, if the lottery exceeds $1 billion again, I\u2019ll probably buy a ticket again. I have dreams, too.But Mr. Mehta persuaded me to crunch the numbers to see what effects the government-sponsored lotteries are having on people who buy tickets regularly. The results are troubling.For the July 30 Powerball drawing, for example, the lottery sold roughly 74 million tickets across the country, the data indicates. In addition to the $487 million jackpot winner, lottery statistics show that one ticket won a tidy $2 million. Other people won money too, but they didn\u2019t win much: Just under 4 percent of tickets \u2014 fewer than one in 25 \u2014 produced any winnings at all. And for 78 percent of those winning tickets, the prize was only $4. If you won one of those little prizes and had bought two tickets, you broke even for the day. For more than 96 percent of tickets, though, you simply kissed your money goodbye.In short, if your goal was actually to win money, your chances would be much better at the blackjack table in a casino.How much are people losing at state-run lottery games?For some of us, it\u2019s a paltry sum, $10 or $20 a year. And a handful of people win multimillion-dollar pots. But for the millions of regular lottery players, it\u2019s a different story. It takes a while to figure this out. But using publicly available lottery and census data, I estimate, very roughly, that millions of adults, perhaps as many as 50 million, are swallowing net losses that average $1,000 a year. (I used lottery estimates suggesting that roughly 20 percent of all players account for about three-quarters of all sales, and proceeded from there. Mr. Mehta does an elaborate version of this on his blog.)That\u2019s a lot of money for a lot of people, and over a lifetime it could make the difference between a comfortable retirement and utter penury. In fact, if you were to invest that money in a diversified mutual fund every year from the age of 20 until 65, and it returned 5 percent annually, you would have a nest egg of about $150,000.These numbers don\u2019t take into account the impact on poorer people, who truly cannot afford to forgo such sums of money. And they don\u2019t include the effects of taxes, which subtract from winnings. Money spent to play the lottery has already been taxed, while winnings, which are still subject to tax, are worth less than their face value.At a minimum, the government ought to be doing no harm to its citizens, yet it appears to be promoting and benefiting from activities that are surely harming the life prospects of many people.It\u2019s true, lottery revenue may help the government finance education and other programs, many of them quite worthwhile. Yet policy levers could be used in other ways. Local and state governments could instead engage in aggressive and creative marketing schemes that would actually improve our odds of attaining a decent financial future.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Deal Aims to Keep a Former Welfare Hotel in Manhattan Affordable", "Date": "2016-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGrace NotesTwo chapters in two lives are being lived out in the tidy room on East 28th Street that Andrew Byrnes now calls home \u2014 two chapters that are different but entwined. One is the latest chapter in Mr. Byrnes\u2019s life. His previous chapter was troubled, and troubling.The other latest chapter is about the building itself, now well polished and carefully tended. Its previous chapter was so troubled that the building, a former hotel called the Prince George, was described as a 13-story eyesore and \u201chell\u2019s embassy in Manhattan.\u201dThe Prince George\u2019s own spiffiness masks that earlier time, which included a descent into notoriousness as the city\u2019s largest welfare hotel and its largest homeless shelter. By some accounts, it was even the nation\u2019s largest. By 1986, 600 homeless families with 1,500 children had been squeezed into the Prince George and two nearby hotels, where more homeless people lived than in the city\u2019s four other boroughs combined.Some blamed the Prince George for the neighborhood\u2019s decline. Neighbors complained that the families were jammed into shoebox-size hotel rooms. They complained residential services like laundromats and grocery stores, not to mention playgrounds, were overwhelmed by the influx of residents. They complained that children with little to do pitched garbage from windows or played in the streets at all hours.The city began shutting down many welfare hotels after a 1987 court decision; in 1990, the Prince George was emptied out \u2014 the beginning of a quieter chapter. It was vacant for almost the rest of the decade.Another chapter began in 1996, when the Prince George was taken over by a nonprofit group then known as Common Ground. It spent about $40 million from city and state agencies and private sources, turning the Prince George into a residence for people who used to be homeless and for lower-income working single adults.But financial concerns remained as low-income federal tax credits expired in 2014. With Midtown Manhattan booming, the Prince George is a desirable address.She and Mr. Beer began discussions with city housing officials about selling the building\u2019s air rights. Usually, it is developers who seek permission to shift air rights from older buildings to new ones. But this time, it was the owner of an older building \u2014 the Prince George was built in 1904.And so they worked out the latest chapter for the Prince George, a deal with the city that will let Breaking Ground sell the building\u2019s air rights. Mr. Beer expects the total \u2014 some 372,000 square feet \u2014 to be divided among different developers and different projects.\u201cWe retooled the preservation program,\u201d said Louise Carroll, associate commissioner for housing incentives of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development. \u201cThe key here for the Prince George is the location. They could easily sell that building. We said, \u2018We will give you air rights that you can sell within your area.\u2019 Basically, this endows the Prince George for long-term affordability.\u201dCity officials see the Prince George as another chapter in the ambitious affordable housing plan under Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat. They are counting its 416 apartments toward the mayor\u2019s goal of creating or preserving 200,000 units of affordable housing over 10 years.Ms. Rosen sees a way to keep the Prince George\u2019s commitment to affordability, while financing $11 million in maintenance on the building. The facade needs work, as facades always do; the elevators need to be updated, as elevators always do; the roof needs to be replaced, as roofs always do; and a new emergency generator needs to be squeezed in. She expects to have money left over from air rights for a reserve fund to pay for capital repairs for generations, because the rent will not cover them. The reserve could also help if government rent subsidies are cut.And Mr. Byrnes?He has lived at the Prince George for four and a half years. He worked at the Metropolitan Museum of Art for 27 years, first as a guard, then as a maintenance specialist. For most of that time, he lived in an apartment in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. Then, as the nation\u2019s financial crisis was receding, the building was sold, and his rent jumped to $1,795 a month, from $950.\u201cThere\u2019s no way I could come up with that kind of money,\u201d he said.\u201cAir rights,\u201d he said the other day. He had not heard about the deal.\u201cAir rights,\u201d he repeated. \u201cIt sounds like something from a network.\u201d And before you could say \u201crabbit ears\u201d or \u201cstation break,\u201d he was talking about his favorite shows, \u201c48 Hours\u201d and \u201cThe Big Bang Theory.\u201dMs. Rosen explained the concept of air rights, saying the sale would keep the building affordable.\u201cIt\u2019s a very good thing,\u201d Mr. Byrnes said. \u201cThe last thing I could imagine is being homeless. I don\u2019t know if you remember \u2018The Twilight Zone.\u2019 It was a show where the worst things that could happen to people were always happening. I can\u2019t imagine being homeless again.

{"Headline": "Visiting Beijing, Myanmar\u2019s Aung San Suu Kyi Seeks to Mend Relations", "Date": "2016-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Hillary Clinton considers her a friend. President Obama has invited her to the White House next month. But on her first visit to a major capital since becoming leader of Myanmar, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi chose a different destination: Beijing.With her arrival here late Wednesday, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel Peace Prize winner credited with pushing Myanmar from a military dictatorship toward democracy, offered a potent signal that her foreign policy would be more friendly toward China, which is eager to strengthen its foothold in the country.\u201cDaw Aung San Suu Kyi has long expressed her desire for friendly relations with China, and it\u2019s not insignificant that she has chosen to travel to Beijing before any other major capital,\u201d said Thant Myint-U, the author of \u201cWhere China Meets India: Burma and the New Crossroads of Asia.\u201dHe added: \u201cThe Chinese, whatever wariness they may have had, definitely sense the possibility of improved relations and will go all-out to make this visit a success. This will be a historic visit that could well shape Sino-Myanmar relations for many years to come.\u201dChina\u2019s red-carpet welcome contrasts with how Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi was treated when she was Myanmar\u2019s opposition leader. Last year, she was 20 minutes late for a meeting with President Xi Jinping, who reportedly told her that she was the first person ever to have kept him waiting so long.Now, China is making amends for that reprimand as it pushes to install itself as the foremost power in Myanmar. It is tailoring investment projects to suit the impoverished country and assuming an influential position as mediator in peace talks between rival ethnic groups and the government this month.It is also hoping to restart the $3.6 billion Myitsone Dam project, which was suspended in 2011 and is a major source of friction between the two countries.China views Myanmar as a strategic asset, so much so that some policy makers see Myanmar\u2019s long shoreline as China\u2019s west coast. Its position close to the Indian Ocean offers a shortcut for oil and gas imports from the Middle East, and its rich mineral deposits and proximity make it a logical part of China\u2019s sphere of influence on the mainland of Southeast Asia.Even though China recently built oil and gas pipelines from Myanmar\u2019s coast into southern China and has access to the Kyaukpyu port on the Bay of Bengal, trade between the two nations dropped in 2015, and relations cooled during the five-year transition from a military junta, which China backed, to elections last year.The two sides are seeking to repair the friendship, though Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, who has praised the old tradition of a neutral foreign policy, is likely to be vigilant that China is not too overbearing.In the days before her visit, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi sought to ease tensions over the suspension of the Chinese-financed Myitsone Dam. After appointing a 20-member commission to review the suspension decision and look at other hydro projects, she can tell China that Myanmar no longer has a closed mind on the project, analysts said.\u201cShe needs good relations with China, but were she to approve the dam, she would lose massive internal support among many groups,\u201d said David I. Steinberg, distinguished professor emeritus at Georgetown University. The new panel was a smart way to deflect pressure on her from China as well as her domestic constituency, he said.The commission could decide that the dam \u2014 which Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi resisted as opposition leader because of the environmental impact it would have on the nation\u2019s main artery, the Irrawaddy River \u2014 should not be built. But it would most likely consider other projects that would be to China\u2019s liking, Mr. Steinberg said.For its part, Beijing has become more flexible on the dam, opening the way for the easing of tensions, analysts said.Negotiations are underway for Myanmar to pay China if the dam is not built, or to use the money for other projects, officials close to Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi said. Numbers have already been put on the table, they said, including $800 million in compensation to China if the dam is not built, they said.In exchange, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi has told the Chinese that she wants a series of smaller hydro projects that are less of a threat to the environment and enjoy popular support, her spokesman, U Zaw Htay, said.\u201cIn the end, the dam construction could be halted, resumed, adjusted, replaced by another project, or maybe there are other ideas,\u201d said Fan Hongwei, a specialist on Myanmar at Xiamen University.As part of its ambition to secure more access to the Indian Ocean, China has proposed a new trading route \u2014 a waterway from the town of Bhamo in northern Myanmar to the Irrawaddy Delta \u2014 and this is likely to come up in the talks in Beijing, Myanmar officials said.Derek J. Mitchell, the former American ambassador to Myanmar, said that Washington recognized the country\u2019s urgent need for hard infrastructure and that it had never opposed China\u2019s delivering major infrastructure projects to Myanmar as long as they are transparent, acceptable to the people and environmentally sound, as the new government has indicated.It would also be preferable if infrastructure that crossed borders connected Myanmar to the wider region and not just to China, Mr. Mitchell said.One of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s major objectives is to seek China\u2019s help as she starts peace talks on conflicts in northern Myanmar between the ethnic groups and the military.The roiling small wars there have long been a barrier to economic development in the region, and Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi has scheduled a peacemaking gathering, called the Panglong Conference, for Aug. 31. She has offered China a role as mediator, Myanmar officials involved in the talks said.Two groups in northern Myanmar near the Chinese border \u2014 the Kachin and the Wa, who are ethnic Chinese \u2014 receive arms from across the border.The Kachin Independence Army and the United Wa State Army, the largest ethnic army in Myanmar, refused to sign a cease-fire agreement last year. At the time, a Burmese government negotiator said China had pressured the two groups along its border not to sign the deal in order to wield more influence over them.By offering China a key role at the talks, to be held in the capital, Naypyidaw, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi is asking China to halt its arms supplies, a Myanmar official involved in the process said.Recent talks with a flurry of top Chinese officials who have visited Myanmar \u2014 including the minister of state security, Geng Huichang; the head of the International Department of the Chinese Communist Party, Song Tao; and the foreign minister, Wang Yi \u2014 have concentrated on China\u2019s role in the peacemaking, the official said.\u201cChina holds many of the keys to ending decades of armed conflict,\u201d Mr. Thant Myint-U said. \u201cThe question is what the price of increasing dependence on China will be.\u201dJane Perlez reported from Beijing, and Wai Moe from Yangon, Myanmar.

For instance, wearable devices have been popular with millennials for monitoring and tracking health, but they are not necessarily going to be a hit with older users.\u201cPeople lose interest in wearables very quickly,\u201d said Jody Holtzman, senior vice president for market innovation at AARP. \u201cThey can see the potential, but design is problematic.\u201d According to AARP studies, he added, users had difficulty with syncing wearable products with their computers or even finding directions that explain how to use them.\u201cThere are no clear market leaders,\u201d said Lori Bitter, who heads The Business of Aging, a consulting firm based in Napa, Calif. \u201cAnd how do we get the technology into people\u2019s homes?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s quite a lot of funding available, too,\u201d Mr. Holtzman said. \u201cA few years ago, when we showed up at a V.C. event, people wondered what we were doing there.\u201d That doesn\u2019t happen anymore, he added.\u201cPeople are looking at how to finance longevity,\u201d Ms. Furlong said. \u201cAnd their first concern is the cost of health care.\u201dEnvoy sets itself apart by hiring stay-at-home mothers with flexible schedules. They do light chores, like walking a dog, washing dishes or grocery shopping. The service is now in 22 metropolitan areas with significant aging populations like Phoenix, Miami and Las Vegas. Justin Lin, who founded Envoy, eventually wants to expand to 100 areas.\u201cMy own mom passed away from cancer,\u201d said Mr. Lin, who has started three other businesses. \u201cMy dad would need help soon. But there weren\u2019t a lot of caregiving options.\u201d That realization, he said, led to his starting Envoy.After testing Envoy with friends and family for a few years, he discovered that caregiving was a much-needed service. \u201cI was building a service that\u2019s potentially powerful,\u201d said Mr. Lin. The company is not yet profitable.Many start-ups are trying new ways to reach their target audiences. Evelo, the bicycle company, uses a network of about 300 so-called brand ambassadors to market to potential customers. They have bought a bike, registered on the site to be ambassadors and can opt to take prospective buyers on test rides. After a bike purchase, the ambassador gets a $200 check.Even businesses with decidedly mundane products are finding ways to capture the longevity niche. Foot care, for example, is a huge market, and \u201cfinding shoes that are attractive and feel good is a huge deal,\u201d Ms. Bitter said.\u201cAs people get older, walking is one of the most important exercises,\u201d said Mr. Katz, a third-generation shoemaker. \u201cAnd there\u2019s more problems with the feet.\u201d To add the cool factor, a limited edition collection is available in sky blue, plum and lime green.The company, which sells its footwear online and through retailers, now offers 18 styles of men\u2019s shoes and will soon begin offering women\u2019s shoes. It logged $2 million in revenue last year selling primarily to baby boomers. Mr. Katz expects sales to reach $12 million this year and estimates that the company will be profitable next year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Florida Company Gets Approval to Put Robotic Lander on Moon", "Date": "2016-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA small start-up has received the green light from the federal government to do something that NASA has not done for more than four decades: land on the moon.Moon Express has a ways to go before it can reach the lunar surface, which it hopes to do next year. It still has to assemble the lander. The rocket that it plans to launch on has yet to fly even once.And one of its competitors could beat it to the moon, and the $20 million.The approval reflects an effort to encourage 21st-century commercial space endeavors while staying within an international space treaty written 49 years ago when outer space was a rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, and the idea of a start-up going to the moon an unlikely fantasy.The Juno spacecraft has reached Jupiter. Here are some other spacecraft exploring our solar system, launched by NASA and the world\u2019s other space agencies.In the bubbly optimism that followed, the X Prize Foundation enlisted Google to finance reaching the loftier target of the moon. The Google Lunar X Prize, announced in 2007, called for putting a spacecraft on the moon that would be able to send back video and images and also move more than 500 meters. The first team to achieve that would claim $20 million; second place would be rewarded with $5 million.For John Noble Wilford, the reporter who covered the moon landing for The New York Times from mission control in Houston, the memory is invigorating.As Moon Express worked on its MX-1 lander, company officials realized that they had other hurdles: paperwork and international treaties.The United States fought to include that clause, rejecting the Soviet view that space exploration should be limited to governments, said Matthew Schaefer, the director of the space, cyber and telecommunications law program at the University of Nebraska.While the American negotiators did not necessarily foresee a company like Moon Express, \u201cthe U.S. government wanted to keep that option open,\u201d Professor Schaefer said.Nonetheless, that would have been a roadblock, said Dr. Richards, Moon Express\u2019s chief executive, because the United States did not have any procedures for authorizing and supervising what companies like Moon Express want to do.\u201cAny application to the U.S. government would have been vetoed by the State Department, due to the lack of regulatory frameworks that would allow the U.S. government to remain in compliance with the Outer Space Treaty,\u201d he said.Moon Express has now employed this payload review process for its lunar trip. The F.A.A. sent its approval on July 20, the 47th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing on the moon.Mr. Jain said that low-cost missions to the moon \u2014 under $10 million \u2014 would transform space exploration. But the company has revealed little about its customers and much of the hoped-for business like the mining of platinum and helium-3 is speculative. (The helium-3 would be for fusion power plants that do not yet exist.)At present, there is little worry that the moonscape is about to be scarred by a commercial onslaught. The MX-1 is about the size of a coffee table, and NASA has left far more litter on the moon, most recently crashing its Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer into the far side of the moon in 2014.Of more concern is the preservation of earlier artifacts like the Apollo landing sites, especially as the Lunar X Prize offers a $4 million bonus for broadcasting video from one of those sites.Moon Express said that it had not yet decided on a landing site, but that it would defer to NASA\u2019s wishes and stay away from the Apollo sites.Mr. Jain said the greatest opportunities were the ones not yet imagined, just as Apple, when it created the iPhone, did not foresee the explosion of apps that would run on the device.\u201cMore importantly,\u201d Mr. Jain said, \u201cwe don\u2019t know what the Pok\u00e9mon Go of the moon is going to be.\u201dAn earlier version of this article gave an outdated location for the headquarters of Moon Express. The company is now based in Cape Canaveral, Fla., not Mountain View, Calif. The error was repeated in the headline.Advertisement"}

He was 62.Justin Long, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Prisons, said Mr. Pearlman died of cardiac arrest at a hospital. At his death he was an inmate at the Federal Correctional Institution in Miami.Mr. Pearlman began his career in blimp rentals before turning to the music business. All his interests, from aviation to boy bands and to the Ponzi scheme that lead to his conviction in 2008, were housed under the Trans Continental companies, whose financial centerpiece was an airline that existed only on paper.Before his scheme ran aground, however, Mr. Pearlman built some of the most successful music groups of the 1990s, one of which started the career of Justin Timberlake, managed from Mr. Pearlman\u2019s lavish home in Orlando, Fla.But he ended up locked in legal battles with almost all the musicians he managed, who accused him of lining his pockets at their expense.The group settled out of court. Other musical acts under his management, like \u2019NSync and LFO, either reached their own settlements or disbanded.Almost all the musicians Mr. Pearlman worked with were young men, and some accused him of sexual impropriety.Rich Cronin, a singer in LFO, told Vanity Fair that Mr. Pearlman was \u201calways grabbing\u201d the young men he worked with. He said he thought Mr. Pearlman had entered the music business to meet men and had become a hitmaker by accident.\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t think Lou ever thought we would become stars,\u201d Mr. Cronin said. \u201cI just think he wanted cute guys around him; this was all an excuse. And then lightning crazily struck, and an empire was created. It was all dumb luck.\u201d\u201cThe accusations that came out in that article, none of it was substantiated,\u201d he said.His empire collapsed under a cascade of lawsuits filed by investors and creditors who had helped finance his endeavors. Mr. Pearlman fled the United States in 2007 after the federal authorities began an investigation. He was found in a hotel in Indonesia later that year using the alias A. Incognito Johnson.In his 2014 interview with Billboard, Mr. Pearlman insisted that he could have paid back the people he defrauded if the federal authorities had only allowed him to start auditioning singers, even from behind bars. \u201cIf I was given a chance to put another band together, that would have paid everybody back.\u201d he said.Information on survivors was not immediately available.On social media, two former members of \u2018NSync, Lance Bass and Mr. Timberlake, expressed sorrow but also alluded to Mr. Pearlman\u2019s checkered past.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Leftover Meal Plan Swipes: No Waste Here", "Date": "2016-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRoom and BoardTo Asia Suarez, a computer science major, the math hit like an error message: With less than three weeks left in the spring term, she would need to eat seven meals a day to use up the remaining 131 swipes on her food plan at New York University. A soccer player who works out furiously and eats \u201ca lot,\u201d Ms. Suarez still found that 300 meals a semester (for $2,541) were too many.So she shared. One evening, Ms. Suarez swiped in four guests at Hayden, a dining hall famous for its homemade cookies. The hungry guests came via Share Meals, a campus website matching students needing food with those who have food. The 80-meal plan in Adam El-Sayigh\u2019s financial aid package had run out weeks before. He didn\u2019t have money for more. Happily, he hit the hot food stations first, filling a to-go container with two cheese sandwiches on toasted wheat and a tray with roast beef, chicken cacciatore and bow-tie pasta with vodka sauce. He then ordered a burger.Students have always offered one another casual swipes, and even sold them. (Advertised on Facebook: 50 swipes at Western Carolina University for $50; \u201cwilling to swipe in for $5\u201d at the University of California, Davis.) But frugality born of college debt and growing attention to food insecurity \u2014 a U.S.D.A. term for limited access to food \u2014 are spurring new thinking about how to spread the bounty. Activists in the food justice movement and college officials are creating tools and programs to help students donate meal swipes, while free food pantries are proliferating even on wealthy campuses.Some of the disparity is driven by dining policies. Many colleges require dorm residents to buy meal plans. But it\u2019s hard to predict at the start of the term what you\u2019ll use. Busy schedules and the desire to eat out mean missed dining hall meals. And the rules smart: Swipes may expire at the end of the term, or even each week. You might have to pull out cash for certain items, like a side of fries. But perhaps the biggest frustration is the wasted money that unused swipes represent.Anagha Uppal, an activist at the University of Tennessee, describes the meal plan rule as \u201can exercise in tyranny.\u201d Ms. Uppal has not used her plan \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t purchase from Aramark,\u201d she said between bites of chicken salad in pita (cost: $5.74) at the Golden Roast Coffeehouse. On her laptop: a Food Recovery Network sticker; she\u2019s a campus coordinator for the network, a national student group that fights food waste. It was Ms. Uppal who prodded officials to start the Big Orange Meal Share to let students donate swipes.Ms. Uppal sees student hunger, mandatory meal plans and higher prices as interconnected points in the food justice movement. Across the spectrum, dining hall spending is getting a hard look. Over the past decade, average board (20 meals a week) at four-year colleges has risen 46 percent, to $4,602 for 2014-15, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. To some, meal plans, at $7 to $13 a swipe, look like luxury spending that is driving up the cost of a degree.New Jersey legislators are proposing a bill to bar colleges from requiring students to buy meal plans. \u201cIf you thought about financing your food on a credit card or 8 percent loan, that is a significant cost,\u201d said Assemblywoman Nancy J. Pinkin, a bill sponsor.One reason for pricey meals is more and better choices, said Becky Schilling, editor in chief of Food Management, which covers the institutional dining industry. Students want global cuisine, breakfast at midnight and organic food from sustainable sources. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018Where are you getting these products? How were these animals raised? Was it cage-free?\u2019\u2009\u201d Swipes may buy all-you-can-eat buffets, sandwiches and drinks at a food court, or \u201cmeal equivalency\u201d at a restaurant. \u201cDining dollars\u201d can work at Starbucks, campus stores, even food trucks. N.Y.U. has 11 meal plan options.At the same time, Ms. Schilling said, \u201cthis issue of hunger has percolated, and students are being vocal: \u2018We are paying a lot for the college experience and we are having trouble paying for this.\u2019\u201dThe scope of food insecurity is tricky to judge because research is scant, definitions are imprecise and campuses vary so much. A 2010 City University of New York survey found that 40 percent of students struggled to find food. On California State campuses, 24 percent faced food insecurity, according to a 2015 study, while just 13 percent went hungry at the University of California, San Francisco.Students on tight budgets are known to skip meals or reduce or quit dining plans to save money. Some on full financial aid get meals covered, then take smaller plans to pocket the difference in cash.One of the challenges is grasping the true contours of the problem. \u201cHow can we better understand which are the students who are making sacrifices versus the ones who are choosing ramen because they would rather save money for Thursday night?\u201d Ms. Sumekh asked.To prevent abuse, some campuses limit how many meals can be donated or claimed by the student body. At N.Y.U., Ann Marie Powell, director of Contract Dining Services, takes a more permissive stance and even lets Mr. Chin set up booths at dining halls. \u201cStudents\u2019 meal plans are theirs to use or share,\u201d she said. This fall, N.Y.U. will allow up to six emergency food vouchers a semester.Mr. Chin started Share Meals to tackle \u201chunger and loneliness.\u201d He encourages donors and recipients to sit down and talk. Ms. Suarez ate several times with a couple receiving her swipes, and she has ordered takeout so often for Mr. El-Sayigh that she has nicknamed him Curly Fries. \u201cHe messages me whenever,\u201d she said. She places the order; he picks it up.Alexa Osterhoudt, a biology major, is grateful for Share Meals. Since her mother lost her job, she moved off campus, eliminated her meal plan and doesn\u2019t buy textbooks or class supplies. Her food budget is $7.50 a week. She said she\u2019s \u201cmade friends with a lot of people who work at groceries and restaurants,\u201d spending time and emotional energy searching for food. One student started swiping her in every Thursday. Her dining hall preference? \u201cAnything with a buffet.\u201dLaura Pappano is writer-in-residence at Wellesley Centers for Women.Advertisement"}

Hughey Jr., an energy lawyer who formerly backed Jeb Bush and is now helping lead Mr. Trump\u2019s fund-raising in Texas. \u201cI think the traditional donor base was somewhat shocked by Trump\u2019s nomination. They\u2019re learning more about him, but they\u2019re also focused on what the alternative is, and what the implications of the alternative are.\u201dIt is a dizzying turnaround for everyone involved, several donors said in interviews. Aides and fund-raisers for Mr. Trump, a self-described billionaire who has spent months proclaiming his independence from the party\u2019s traditional financial interests, now concede that they need mainline Republican donors to swing behind Mr. Trump so that he will have enough financial firepower to compete with Mrs. Clinton in the air and on the ground.\u201cAs he unfolds more details of his various policies, I believe the level of comfort will grow,\u201d Wilbur L. Ross Jr., a New York investor and donor who held a fund-raiser for Mr. Trump in July, said in an email. \u201cMore and more people are realizing that they shouldn\u2019t be distracted by the sideshows that result from clever Democratic baiting of Trump,\u201d he added.Some Trump backers argue that despite his criticisms of Washington, Mr. Trump is likely to lean heavily on conservative think tanks and Republican-leaning trade associations to stock his administration. Others are urging their fellow donors to face the hard truth that Mr. Trump thumped the donor class\u2019s preferred candidates and earned the favor of Republican voters. Now, they say, it is time for the donors to respect the voters\u2019 wishes.On Wednesday, Mr. Klarman said that Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cwords and actions over the last several days are so shockingly unacceptable in our diverse and democratic society that it is simply unthinkable that Donald Trump could become our president.\u201dMr. Ryan, who clashed with Mr. Trump last week before finally getting his endorsement Friday for re-election, was invited to speak at the event.

But the once mysterious craft is increasingly turning into a high-end reality show \u2014 long-running spectacles that appeal to donors who lavish money on makeovers, but trouble some conservators accustomed to quiet and absolute concentration.\u201cPeople were really enjoying it, but it\u2019s not something I would do again, Ms. Urry said. \u201cConservation is not performance art.\u201dShe was startled sometimes by loud voices across a simple wood barrier; one day, her pashmina scarf mysteriously vanished.In the slow-moving drama of restoration, fishbone cracks vanish, figures that were muddy sepia become radiantly blush, and yellow clouds, thick with old varnish, transform into white gauze tinged with rose. The results are a publicity bonanza for museums; they tell a before-and-after narrative that attracts media attention and appeals to crowdfunding campaigns and companies that have never donated to art projects before.One of the earliest attempts to offer the public a window on restoration dates to 1994, when Vermeer\u2019s \u201cGirl With a Pearl Earring\u201d was restored in a temporary studio at the Mauritshuis in The Hague, according to Ian McClure, director of Yale University\u2019s Center for Conservation and Preservation. In 2006, the Smithsonian also added a window so the public could view restorers at work in their lab.\u201cViewing painting conservators at work does counteract charges that conservators are ruining objects by careless over cleaning,\u201d Mr. McClure said. But he added that it could also make restorers self-conscious \u2014 \u201cthinking of your appearance, the impression you make to onlookers. This will affect your work.\u201dBut the work itself is changing. Many art conservators are evolving into museum ambassadors \u2014 the subject of in-house blogs, videos and special lectures. And that even includes the taxidermists.The Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, meanwhile, is carrying out a series of public restoration projects, with 150,000 euros (more than $180,000) raised in a crowdfunding appeal, to rejuvenate the Courbet masterpiece \u201cThe Artist\u2019s Studio.\u201d Bank of America Merrill Lynch is also helping to finance the project, which is expected to cost almost a million euros and take more than a year.The Courbet restoration has proved so successful with donors that the museum is exploring its reserves for other works in need of repair, according to Olivier Simmat, director of sponsorship. But potential donors prefer famous names to salvage.\u201cThey tell us they adore the idea and want to give money to restore a van Gogh,\u201d he said. \u201cForget that. Those are fine.\u201dBut the museum did have a number of deteriorating 19th-century paintings in the French Academy style that do not have the same cachet of Post Impressionist art. Since 1982, \u201cThe Women of Gaul\u201d had languished in the museum\u2019s reserves \u2014 too damaged to display. It was such a large painting that it was rolled up and stored for years in a city museum in Autun, France, where cracks and flaking developed.Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, a French bank that had never contributed to art restoration before, donated 450,000 euros (more than $500,000) to repair three Academy style works. Nathalie Mourlon, who leads business development at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole d\u2019Ile-de-France, said the makeover had a particular appeal.\u201cWhat we liked about it enormously is that the process is visible,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes the works more accessible to the public.\u201dFor the conservators \u2014 a profession dominated by women \u2014 the attention to such a solitary m\u00e9tier is gratifying. But they were trained to use swabs and tools to thin and swipe away old varnish. Many found it difficult to cope with waves of noise, abrupt public announcements and, sometimes, rapping against the protective glass cube. Not to mention the limits on their use of chemical solvents because of their proximity to the public.Laurence Didier, who leads the independent team of 13 conservators restoring \u201cThe Women of Gaul,\u201d had never worked in public before. She said that it took time to become accustomed to an audience, even though conservators faced the canvas with their backs to visitors.\u201cEveryone is different and has their own style,\u201d she said. \u201cI need absolute calm, and so I have my headphones playing Baroque music or Vivaldi.\u201dC\u00e9cile Bringuier, who leads the second team on the Courbet restoration, also said she is not a fan of conservators on display. \u201cWould you like to be watched while you work?\u201dOther museums are considering the same public approach, but with reservations.\u201cIs that price justified by the public show?\u201d he said.Instead, the museum settled on an unglamorous alternative: repaint the white walls of the gallery an oatmeal color to reduce contrast and install new lighting.An article on Tuesday about public displays of restorations of paintings at the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay in Paris misidentified a source of financing for the restoration of \u201cThe Artist\u2019s Studio\u201d by Gustave Courbet.

It probably starts with a commitment to sticking to your budget, and you do for a few days. Then, despite your resolve, you break down, pull out the credit card and do something that you promised you wouldn\u2019t. You wake up in the morning ashamed and resolve never to do it again.Then you repeat.Been there? Done that?Frustrated, you wonder what\u2019s wrong. You\u2019re smart, you\u2019re successful, and when you set your mind to something, you\u2019re able to do it.I think we can all relate. If not money, insert food. So what can we do about this problem of knowing we should act one way but repeatedly doing something different?The answer lies in understanding the relationship between the stimulus to do something, how we respond and a little secret I\u2019ll share in a minute.But first, here\u2019s the problem as I see it: Almost all personal finance advice focuses on controlling the stimulus or your response to it. Gurus tell you to stop looking at Instagram, stay off Facebook, fire all your nonfrugal friends and disown your spendthrift family members. That is an effort to control the stimulus.Then, you\u2019re told to control your response. Most of this advice centers on making it painful to spend. Cut up your credit cards. Use only cash. Track, review and feel bad about your spending.It works until it doesn\u2019t anymore. You can\u2019t ignore all the voices screaming at you to spend, and making spending painful increases the feelings of shame when we do something wrong. It only leads to more spending as a form of self-medicating.Whoa! There is a third element to this little dance with stimulus and response. To break this frustrating spending cycle, we can focus on creating space between the two of them.It starts by acknowledging that the space exists. Most of us don\u2019t even know it\u2019s there. We see a Twitter post about a book someone likes, the post has a link to Amazon, we click the \u201cone click buy\u201d button, and then we own a book with little to no thought.So we need to practice pausing once we\u2019re in that space between. The advice to use cash or to lock up the credit cards can be useful here if it creates space between our desire to buy and our actual buying. It can also be as simple as training ourselves to notice the desire. How does it feel to want something?I didn\u2019t need to bar myself from reading book reviews or allow myself to buy books only with cash. By adding a little space, I gave myself the opportunity to change my response. How you add space is up to you, but once you get good at creating it, then some of the other things matter less.This is just one simple trick to create space. I think you\u2019ll find that by focusing on the space between, you can let go of your anxious grasp on the stimulus and response. If you get the space right, the other two take care of themselves.I\u2019d love to hear from you. What have you done to create space? How has it helped you?Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of an Austrian psychiatrist on second reference. As was correctly noted in the first reference, he is Viktor Frankl, not Frank.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Obama Readies One Last Push for Trans-Pacific Partnership", "Date": "2016-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 His successor, whether Democrat or Republican, opposes it, as does most of his party. Delegates at the Democratic National Convention waved signs saying \u201cT.P.P.\u201d slashed by a bold line, while the Republican Party platform opposed any vote on it in Congress this year.\u201cBoth parties have candidates who have very strong rhetoric against trade,\u201d said Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which is responsible for trade. \u201cNonetheless, we can\u2019t grow America\u2019s economy unless we\u2019re not merely buying American but selling American all throughout the globe.\u201dStill, he added, timing a vote \u201cis absolutely dependent on support for the agreement.\u201dAlthough the administration\u2019s push will begin in September, no vote on the accord will occur before the election. Just as the White House and congressional Republican leaders mostly agree on the economic benefits of trade, they have parallel political interests in delaying debate.Yet the administration does not plan to be silent or forfeit hopes for a postelection vote.While administration officials and bipartisan surrogates will counter opponents\u2019 economic arguments, a big focus will be on national security. Mr. Obama has emphasized that the pact would expand American influence in the Asia-Pacific region as a counterweight to China, which is not part of the pact.Among those who will hit the road will be Secretary of State John F. Kerry; Secretary of Defense Ashton B. Carter; retired Admiral Michael G. Mullen, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Presidents George W. Bush and Obama; Admiral Harry B. Harris Jr., commander of the United States Pacific Command; and William Cohen, a former Republican senator and defense secretary under President Bill Clinton.\u201cEven the most ardent supporters of the bill, which would include us, would say, \u2018Please don\u2019t put a bill on the floor if you don\u2019t have the votes,\u2019\u201d said Bill Miller, a vice president at the Business Roundtable. \u201cThe parties have been working pretty well to get resolution, but they\u2019re not there yet.\u201dMr. Brady and others cite progress in addressing lawmakers\u2019 concerns about Japanese pork, labor rights in Mexico and financial companies\u2019 data protections. But other issues remain.Mr. Hatch, in a statement, also said he wanted to see written plans from the T.P.P. nations on how they would \u201cabide by their commitments.\u201dOn his first full workday in office, President Trump delivered on a campaign promise by abandoning the enormous trade deal that had became a flashpoint in American politics.\u201cThose issues have to be addressed in a positive way before we can move forward,\u201d Mr. Brady said, echoing the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. \u201cBut the White House really needs to pick up the pace if we\u2019re going to consider it this year.\u201dYet satisfying Republicans, who not only run Congress but also provide the bulk of pro-trade votes, risks costing critical Democratic votes.Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said in a statement, \u201cRepublicans have made clear they want to gut the public health, pharmaceutical, labor and environmental provisions, which President Obama has said he will not do, and which I strongly oppose.\u201dIn the House, all 28 Democratic supporters remain on board, both sides say. While House Republicans have not counted yet whether they still have at least 190 votes for T.P.P., Mr. Brady said, pro-trade Republicans \u201care in a good place\u201d if the outstanding issues get resolved.Last week, Senator Patrick Toomey, a Republican fighting for re-election in Pennsylvania, announced he had switched against T.P.P., following Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, who did so after becoming Mrs. Clinton\u2019s running mate.Of the 60 senators who supported the fast-track bill last year, at least five have now come out against T.P.P. It will need at least 50 votes, assuming Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is the tiebreaker.\u201cThere is a big gap between the rhetoric of the campaign and even in what you see in the polls,\u201d Mr. Froman said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard. But the votes will be there.\u201dAdvertisement"}

She plans to speak on Monday before the Senate in the capital, Bras\u00edlia, making her case that she is innocent of the charges of budgetary manipulation, which involved shifting huge amounts of money between state-controlled banks.Mr. Temer has said that putting Brazil\u2019s economy on stronger footing was one of his top priorities.

ANDREWS$1.54 MILLION (1,997,000 CANADIAN DOLLARS)This three-level, four-bedroom house, built in 2008, is set on 4.74 acres at the edge of St. Andrews, New Brunswick, a historic seaside resort town on a peninsula in the Bay of Fundy. With extensive ocean views and rolling lawns, the property, in the unincorporated Chamcook local service district, is a five-minute drive from downtown St. Andrews.A deep porch wraps around two sides of the home. A pair of large arched doors opens into the front entry hall, which leads to the great room. This room is convenient for entertaining because it has ready access to a full kitchen in the attached two-car garage, as well as a full bath, according to Leona Golding, a broker and the owner of the Fundy Bay Real Estate Group, which has the listing.The main floor, one level up, has a living room, a kitchen, a dining area, an office alcove, a powder room and a master suite. Most of the flooring is tiger maple, which is known for its distinctive grain. The living room has a fireplace with an automatic \u201cwood waiter\u201d that carries logs up from the garage. A built-in window seat runs the length of one wall. French doors lead to a patio overlooking Chamcook Harbor and Ministers Island, a protected historic site.The eat-in kitchen has mahogany countertops and custom-designed cabinetry topped by lighted display cases. Windows lining the breakfast nook provide harbor views.Also on this floor, the master suite has a fireplace and a marble bathroom with an air-jet tub, a sauna and a walk-in shower.The third floor has three bedrooms and two full baths. A spacious cupola above is walled with windows providing panoramic views of the ocean and Chamcook Mountain.The year-round population of St. Andrews (sometimes marketed as St. Andrews by-the-Sea) is roughly 1,800, but it swells to nearly 3,000 during the summer months, Ms. Golding said. Downtown, \u201cyou won\u2019t see any neon lights,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s mainly quaint little shops\u201d and a single grocery store. Part of the town is designated a National Historic District, with many well-preserved buildings from the 1800s. Fishing charters and whale watch tours begin at St. Andrews Harbor.The closest airport with scheduled service is in St. John, New Brunswick, about an hour and 20 minutes away; some charter flights use the airport in St. Stephen, New Brunswick, about 20 minutes away. The airport in Bangor, Me., is about a two-and-a-half-hour drive.MARKET OVERVIEWWhile the financial crisis gave buyers in the area the upper hand after 2008, that has started to change in the last year and a half, according to Karl Deering, a salesman with Exit Realty Specialists, in St. Andrews. While it\u2019s still not a seller\u2019s market, he said, sellers \u201ccertainly have a lot more strength than they would have had a year ago.\u201dPrices tend to be more stable within St. Andrews than in surrounding towns. \u201cIt\u2019s a little more affluent,\u201d Mr. Deering said. \u201cIt\u2019s a market that holds its own.\u201dMs. Golding agreed that the last two selling seasons have been stronger, a shift she attributed to the weak Canadian dollar as well as \u201cbaby boomers looking at retiring.\u201dThe average home in the area \u2014 a three- or four-bedroom residence on an 80-by-160-foot lot \u2014 sells for around 250,000 to 300,000 Canadian dollars, or $192,500 to $231,000, Mr. Deering said. But the range is wide, as smaller homes can be had for less than 100,000 Canadian dollars, or $77,000, while some large waterfront properties go for over a million Canadian dollars, or $770,000.WHO BUYS IN AND AROUND ST. ANDREWS Buyers from outside the area are mainly from western Canada, the United States, England and Germany. \u201cThey are coming largely for the more relaxed lifestyle that we enjoy,\u201d Mr. Deering said.This year in particular has brought more buyers from the west coasts of the United States and Canada, according to Ms. Golding. \u201cI think they\u2019re taking advantage of the high market on the West Coast,\u201d she said, by selling their homes there and buying more for their money in the St. Andrews area.She noted that the buyer pool also often includes people who spent time in their youth working at the Algonquin. \u201cThe Algonquin hires close to 200 students every summer,\u201d Ms. Golding said, \u201cand they tend to come back as they get older because of their fond memories.\u201dBUYING BASICSThere are no restrictions on foreign buyers in New Brunswick.All buyers pay a land transfer tax to the provincial government. The tax is 1 percent of the purchase price or assessed value, whichever is higher, according to David A. Bartlett, a real estate lawyer in St. Andrews.Legal fees typically range from 700 to 1,500 Canadian dollars, or about $539 to $1,155, Ms. Golding said. The broker\u2019s fee is usually paid by the seller, she said.Second-home buyers in New Brunswick should be aware of some tax implications. Residents are entitled to an owner-occupied credit on provincial taxes, but nonresidents and second-home owners pay a higher rate. Within the town of St. Andrews owner-occupants pay about 1.20 Canadian dollars per 100 Canadian dollars of assessment, Mr. Bartlett said, while nonresidents pay slightly more than double that.

{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Draft Deferments: Four for College, One for Bad Feet", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBack in 1968, at the age of 22, Donald J. Trump seemed the picture of health.He stood 6 feet 2 inches with an athletic build; had played football, tennis and squash; and was taking up golf. His medical history was unblemished, aside from a routine appendectomy when he was 10.But after he graduated from college in the spring of 1968, making him eligible to be drafted and sent to Vietnam, he received a diagnosis that would change his path: bone spurs in his heels.The diagnosis resulted in a coveted 1-Y medical deferment that fall, exempting him from military service as the United States was undertaking huge troop deployments to Southeast Asia, inducting about 300,000 men into the military that year.The deferment was one of five Mr. Trump received during Vietnam. The others were for education.Mr. Trump\u2019s public statements about his draft experience sometimes conflict with his Selective Service records, and he is often hazy in recalling details.In an interview with The New York Times last month, Mr. Trump said the bone spurs had been \u201ctemporary\u201d \u2014 a \u201cminor\u201d malady that had not had a meaningful impact on him. He said he had visited a doctor who provided him a letter for draft officials, who granted him the medical exemption. He could not remember the doctor\u2019s name.\u201cI had a doctor that gave me a letter \u2014 a very strong letter on the heels,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the interview.Asked to provide The Times with a copy of the letter, which he had obtained after his fourth student deferment, Mr. Trump said he would have to look for it. A spokeswoman later did not respond to repeated requests for copies of it.Mr. Trump said that he could not recall exactly when he was no longer bothered by the spurs, but that he had not had an operation for the problem.\u201cOver a period of time, it healed up,\u201d he said.In the 2015 biography \u201cThe Truth About Trump,\u201d the author, Michael D\u2019Antonio, described interviewing Mr. Trump, who at one point slipped off a loafer to display a tiny bulge on his heel. And during a news conference last year, Mr. Trump could not recall which heel had been involved, prompting his campaign to release a statement saying it was both.Mr. Trump, who has hailed his health as \u201cperfection,\u201d said the heel spurs were \u201cnot a big problem, but it was enough of a problem.\u201d\u201cThey were spurs,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, it was difficult from the long-term walking standpoint.\u201dThe medical deferment meant that Mr. Trump, who had just completed the undergraduate real estate program at the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce at the University of Pennsylvania, could follow his father into the development business, which he was eager to do.For many years, Donald J. Trump, asserted that it was \u201cultimately\u201d a high draft lottery number that kept him out of the Vietnam War, rather than a medical condition. But his Selective Service records, obtained from the National Archives, suggest otherwise.For many years, Mr. Trump, 70, has also asserted that it was \u201cultimately\u201d the luck of a high draft lottery number \u2014 rather than the medical deferment \u2014 that kept him out of the war.But his Selective Service records, obtained from the National Archives, suggest otherwise. Mr. Trump had been medically exempted for more than a year when the draft lottery began in December 1969, well before he received what he has described as his \u201cphenomenal\u201d draft number.Because of his medical exemption, his lottery number would have been irrelevant, said Richard Flahavan, a spokesman for the Selective Service System, who has worked for the agency for three decades.\u201cHe was already classified and determined not to be subject to the draft under the conditions in place at the time,\u201d Mr. Flahavan said.In a 2011 television interview, Mr. Trump described watching the draft lottery as a college student and learning then that he would not be drafted.But Mr. Trump had graduated from Wharton 18 months before the lottery \u2014 the first in the United States in 27 years \u2014 was held.After his 18th birthday in June 1964, Donald J. Trump registered with the Selective Service, as did all men his age. It was the summer after his graduation from New York Military Academy and Mr. Trump recalled filling out his papers with his father, Fred Trump, at the local draft office on Jamaica Avenue in Queens.\u201cI thought it was ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought it was another deal where politicians got us into a war where we shouldn\u2019t have been in. And I felt that very strongly from Day 1.\u201dAfter his 18th birthday, in June 1964, Mr. Trump registered with the Selective Service System, as all men his age did. It was the summer after his graduation from the New York Military Academy, and Mr. Trump recalled filling out his papers with his father, Fred Trump, at the local draft office on Jamaica Avenue in Queens.The next month, Mr. Trump received the first of four education deferments as he worked his way through his undergraduate studies, first at Fordham, in the Bronx, and then as a transfer student in the real estate program at the Wharton School, in Philadelphia.He received subsequent student deferments during his sophomore, junior and senior years.At Fordham, Mr. Trump commuted from his parents\u2019 home in Queens and played squash, football and tennis. He remembered Fordham for its \u201cgood sports.\u201dAt Wharton, Mr. Trump began preparing in earnest for his career in real estate by buying and selling fixer-upper townhouses in Pennsylvania and driving home to New York on weekends to work for his father.During the Wharton years, he said, he had less time for sports but stayed physically active, playing pickup golf at public courses near campus.At Penn and other universities, Vietnam dominated discussions. Mr. Trump said Wharton, with its business focus, had been somewhat different. Although he \u201chated the concept of the war,\u201d he said, he did not speak out against it.\u201cI was never a fan of the Vietnam War,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I was never at the protest level, either, because I had other things to do.\u201dAs Mr. Trump\u2019s graduation neared, the fighting in Vietnam was intensifying. The Tet offensive in January 1968 had left thousands of American troops dead or wounded, with battles continuing into the spring.On the day of Mr. Trump\u2019s graduation, 40 Americans were killed in Vietnam. The Pentagon was preparing to call up more troops.With his schooling behind him, there would have been little to prevent someone in Mr. Trump\u2019s situation from being drafted, if not for the diagnosis of his bone spurs.\u201cIf you didn\u2019t have a basis to be exempt or postponed, you would have been ordered for induction,\u201d said Mr. Flahavan of the Selective Service.Many men of Mr. Trump\u2019s age were looking for ways to avoid the war, said Charles Freehof, a draft counselor at Brooklyn College at the time, noting that getting a letter from a physician was a particularly effective option.\u201cWe had very little trouble with people coming back saying, \u2018They wouldn\u2019t accept my doctor\u2019s note,\u2019\u201d Mr. Freehof said.Mr. Trump had a 1-Y classification, which was considered a temporary exemption. But in practice, only a national emergency or an official declaration of war, which the United States avoided during the fighting in Vietnam, would have resulted in his being considered for service.Neither occurred, and Mr. Trump remained 1-Y until 1972, when his status changed to 4-F, permanently disqualifying him.\u201cFor all practical purposes, once you got the 1-Y, you were free and clear of vulnerability for the draft, even in the case of the lottery,\u201d Mr. Flahavan said.Still, Mr. Trump, in the interviews, said he believed he could have been subject to another physical exam to check on his bone spurs, had his draft number been called. \u201cI would have had to go eventually because that was a minor medical \u2014 it was called \u2018minor medical,\u2019\u201d he said.But the publicly available draft records of Mr. Trump include the letters \u201cDISQ\u201d next to his exam date, with no notation indicating that he would be re-examined.Since Mr. Khan publicly addressed him in the Democratic convention speech last week, Mr. Trump has been pressed about his sacrifice, including by George Stephanopoulos on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday.\u201cI think I\u2019ve made a lot of sacrifices,\u201d Mr. Trump said to Mr. Stephanopoulos. \u201cI work very, very hard. I\u2019ve created thousands and thousands of jobs, tens of thousands of jobs, built great structures. I\u2019ve had tremendous success. I think I\u2019ve done a lot.\u201dKitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Downtown St. Paul Makes Room for New Settlers", "Date": "2016-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetST. PAUL \u2014 On a bluff overlooking the Mississippi River, where pioneers disembarked from steamships in the 1800s to settle the Northwest Territory, developers are transforming another piece of history.A 17-story landmark federal building there is becoming a mixed-use project at a time of surging housing and entertainment development downtown. Renters began moving this spring into units at the 82-year-old Art Deco edifice, which housed only a small postal crew when the Exeter Group, a St. Paul developer, bought it in 2013 for $5.25 million.\u201cA lot of people had looked at this building but couldn\u2019t figure out what to do with it because it was such a huge, looming structure,\u201d said James A. Stolpestad, chairman of the Exeter Group. \u201cBut we bought it right, for $7 a square foot. It\u2019s pretty hard to go wrong with something that cheap.\u201dSome 1,430 downtown apartments are under construction in the Lowertown Historic District or in the planning stage, and the number of residential units in the district will climb to 8,100 over the next few years, compared with 5,500 units in 2010, according to the St. Paul Planning and Economic Development Department.\u201cSt. Paul gets a bad rap because it\u2019s smaller in size to Minneapolis, but it\u2019s not any less of an interesting place to be,\u201d Ms. Bujold said. \u201cPeople want to spend more time down there and live in an urban district.\u201d\u201cPeople are moving downtown because they like the vibe of the art space and Art Crawl, the brew pubs and quirky restaurants,\u201d Mr. Reynen said. \u201cBut if the artists aren\u2019t here, it will become just another neighborhood.\u201d\u201cWhen there was a lot of inexpensive and vacant space, artists were the only ones who wanted to be in Lowertown,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re seeing a continuing evolution as Lowertown develops and attracts more people.\u201d\u201cThere are a number of investments that have come together at the right time in downtown St. Paul,\u201d said Mr. Sherman, principal of Sherman Associates, which owns about 1,500 units in downtown St. Paul.Arguably, the best return on investment has been the two-year-old light rail line that connects the St. Paul and Minneapolis downtowns, Mr. Sherman and others say. It has generated renewed interest in downtown and has fostered investment along the route. What\u2019s more, the Exeter Group would not have redeveloped Custom House without the train, which stops at the restored 102-year-old Union Depot building next door, Mr. Stolpestad said.Many people point to the $62 million Penfield apartment project on the north end of downtown as a pivotal investment. A private developer proposed condos at the site in 2005. But when the recession foiled a scaled-down plan, St. Paul took control and built 254 market-rate apartments and a grocery store.When the project opened in 2014, demand for the units emboldened more multifamily developers to pursue market-rate projects downtown. Until then, many were skeptical that the area would support market-rate rentals.\u201cEverybody wondered if it would work,\u201d Mr. Stolpestad said, \u201cand when it did work, it gave us confidence.\u201dThe project\u2019s initial phase is expected to incorporate Custom House, possibly by extending a bridge from the building to the promenade, and Mr. Stolpestad said he had identified space to accommodate it. How to finance the River Balcony remains a question, although it is expected to be a mix of public and private money.\u201cThe River Balcony is down the road, and whether it happens, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cBut anything that knits together the various uses along the bluff would be advantageous and promote the city\u2019s objective to bring St. Paul back to the river.\u201dAn article on the Square Feet page on Wednesday about development in a historic district of St. Paul misstated the century in which the Rayette building was built. It was the early 20th century, not the early 19th century.Advertisement"}

Mailey), who has been trying to open an inn but has botched her finances. Their father (Treat Williams) is there, primarily so Abby, who is divorced with two young daughters, can be forced to acknowledge the thuddingly obvious parallels between his child-rearing habits and hers: They both put business before family.Of course, there must be romance, too, and there is, in the form of Trace (Jesse Metcalfe), who was headed for marriage with Abby, he thought, before she bailed on him in favor of Manhattan.

Still, it is hard to be sure, because police announcements on matters involving Mr. Netanyahu have been consistently vague.The police issued a cryptic statement on May 31 suggesting that they had recommended criminal charges in the case.

{"Headline": "Mexico\u2019s Richest Man Confronts a New Foe: The State That Helped Make Him Rich", "Date": "2016-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 All is not well in the kingdom of Carlos Slim.For more than 25 years, he has dictated the terms of Mexico\u2019s telecommunications industry and built an empire, making him one of the world\u2019s richest men.But at home in Mexico, the game is changing. And there is not much he can do about it, analysts say.Determined to bring his dominance to an end, leaders from Mexico\u2019s three biggest political parties have put aside their own animosities in recent years, meeting in secret sessions to chip away at Mr. Slim\u2019s domain.Profits for Mr. Slim\u2019s flagship company, Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil, are in steep decline, falling 24 percent in 2015 and almost 44 percent in the first six months of this year, compared with the year-earlier periods. A closely watched metric of profitability on Wall Street has also fallen, and the company\u2019s stock has dropped by 39 percent in the past year.\u201cWhat has changed the most and is most relevant here is the authorities, and their attitude toward this empire,\u201d said Ernesto Piedras, the director general of the Competitive Intelligence Unit, a consulting and research firm. \u201cThis is the first time Slim does not have a copy of all the keys.\u201dRegulators in Mexico, sometimes against their government\u2019s wishes, had tried for decades to rein in Mr. Slim\u2019s dominance, finding themselves thwarted at every turn.But when the Institutional Revolutionary Party took back the presidency in 2012, it looked to reassert its power in a country where the state \u2014 not big businesses \u2014 has traditionally been king. And Mr. Slim offered a way to score political points at the same time: Mexicans were already openly scornful of what they called his expensive and often unreliable service.For Mexico, the telecom law offers a stark contrast to the state\u2019s many failed promises \u2014 to end corruption, enact the rule of law and bridge inequality. That the government has managed to take on Mr. Slim, arguably the country\u2019s most powerful citizen, is proof that where there is political will in Mexico, there is a way.\u201cThis administration invested in the economic reforms, but they ignored the reforms in the judicial system and in the field of corruption,\u201d said Enrique Krauze, a prominent Mexican historian who knows Mr. Slim.Still, the changes have done little to dent Mr. Slim\u2019s market share. He retains nearly 70 percent of the cellphone market and about 65 percent of fixed lines.In an interview, Mr. Slim said the new law established a certainty that all businessmen appreciate. But he bristled at the notion that his company required special regulation, or that it had stalled or impeded regulation in the past.\u201cLook at all the regulation they have imposed on us. Look at them!\u201d he said. \u201cEvery time they complain about something, they lobby to impose a regulation.\u201d\u201cThey thought they would come and bulldoze us, just because they are called AT&T,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the one hand, they say \u2018the biggest network in North America,\u2019 and on the other, they say that because they are small here we should subsidize them.\u201dThis year, Mexican regulators will determine if the new measures are enough to curb Mr. Slim\u2019s dominance. Regulators can crack down further if they decide Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil is not opening up to competition \u2014 by imposing large fines or even ordering its breakup.Overall, Mr. Slim appeared sanguine about his prospects.\u201cI have said it various times: Telecommunications are the nervous system of the new civilization,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to have a medium and long-term vision. You can\u2019t have quarterly visions.\u201dNot all analysts share his view.\u201cThe worst is not yet over,\u201d said Andre Baggio, an analyst at J.P.Morgan.Even before he became a household name in Mexico, Carlos Slim was a wealthy man. During the turmoil of the 1980s, a time of severe debt crises often called Mexico\u2019s lost decade, he had grown rich by snapping up bankrupt firms.As the country slid further into economic depression, Mr. Slim was the rare businessman with deep pockets. So President Carlos Salinas, under pressure in 1990 to sell off state-owned companies, dispatched a top official to gauge Mr. Slim\u2019s interest in buying the national phone company, Tel\u00e9fonos de M\u00e9xico.The pitch was straightforward: Whoever bought the company would receive a temporary monopoly. In exchange, the winner would have to invest billions in a company so decrepit that Mexicans never knew whether they would get a dial tone.Mr. Slim seemed skeptical. Still, he smelled opportunity.\u201cIf I enter and win, it\u2019s going to change my life,\u201d Jacques Rogozinski, the Mexican official in charge of the sale, recalled Mr. Slim saying.And so it did.There are many stories of Carlos Slim\u2019s rise: the son of Lebanese immigrants who inherited a family retail business and built an empire, piece by piece, down the long Latin American stretch of the Western Hemisphere. Those vast holdings include a significant number of shares in The New York Times.But there is another side, officials say \u2014 of tying up regulation in countless legal knots, of befriending the rich and powerful who identified his success with their own.This assertion enrages Mr. Slim, who denies stymying regulation. Ultimately, it comes down to customer choice, he said, in Mexico or anywhere else.\u201cYou can\u2019t, in a market of 110 million consumers, hold on unless people prefer to stay with you,\u201d he said.Shortly after winning the bid for Telmex, as the national phone company is called, Mr. Slim got to work improving service with his original partners, Southwestern Bell and France T\u00e9l\u00e9com, both of which later sold their stakes in the partnership. They installed millions of phone lines, and curtailed the common practice of repairmen asking for bribes.For years, the government left Mr. Slim to tend to the monopoly without interference. He was building something bigger than a company. As one of the first major emerging market stocks, Telmex was seen as a bellwether for an entire asset class on Wall Street. Hurt Telmex, the logic went, and you could hurt the market\u2019s perception of Mexico.But eventually, there was dissension in the ranks. Officials entrusted with policing competition in Mexico tried to rein him in. In 1997, the Mexican Federal Competition Commission ruled that Telmex was too powerful.Shortly before the ruling, the head of the commission, Fernando S\u00e1nchez Ugarte, got a call from a nervous senior official.\u201cThis will destroy the stock market,\u201d he recalled the official telling him.Mr. Slim\u2019s appeals of the ruling lasted a decade, until a judge decided in his favor. The regulators \u2014 outnumbered, outspent and trying to enforce weak laws \u2014 never stood much of a chance, former officials said.Regulators recall how Mr. Slim\u2019s lawyers would file into a conference room, wheeling large boxes of documents for routine meetings. At least once, the phalanx of lawyers was told to wait outside because the room was too small.\u201cThe story is not about Slim,\u201d said Robert K. Lacy, who was in charge of regulatory issues for Avantel, an early competitor to Telmex. \u201cThe government just buckled.\u201dMr. Slim said he never meant to tie up the system or compete unfairly. Rather, he said, when faced with an unjust fine or restriction, he simply fought back.Mr. Slim is often likened to Warren Buffett for his relatively low-key, avuncular style. He still lives in the modest home where he raised his children and drives himself around town, unlike many in Mexico\u2019s minted class.Years ago, on a visit to one of his ubiquitous Sanborns department stores, Mr. Slim spotted one of Mexico\u2019s most renowned poets, Homero Aridjis, reading a newspaper for sale in the store.Mr. Slim insisted he buy it.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t believe anything should be for free,\u201d said Mr. Aridjis, adding that Mr. Slim eventually backed down.Rather than hosting lavish spreads for meetings, Mr. Slim sometimes just orders in from Sanborns, whose aesthetic is reminiscent of an older generation of American diners.His reach extends far beyond Mexico, gained with an ability to time investments well and then exploit every opportunity to bolster them.He swept into Brazil in 2000, buying up cellphone companies to create a national one. He then fought a nearly decade-long lawsuit by the investment arm of Brazil\u2019s state-owned development bank, and waited patiently for lawmakers to let foreigners increase their control over pay television.It was classic Slim. Today, Brazil is Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil\u2019s largest subscriber market \u2014 larger even than Mexico.His strategy included building a close relationship with the president at the time, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who now faces obstruction charges in an enormous corruption probe. Mr. Slim has not been accused of any wrongdoing.It was not the first time Mr. Slim befriended a president. In Panama, he made fast friends with Mart\u00edn Torrijos, flying down for meetings, sharing dinners and even lending him a jet to attend the funeral of Pope John Paul II.Panama represented an opening, and Mr. Slim wanted in. After years of stagnation under the dictatorship of Manuel Noriega, Panama pinned its hopes on investment. Mr. Slim, in turn, saw a chance to expand his cellphone empire and win contracts for the expansion of the Panama Canal.He managed both, but Mr. Slim wanted more: a concession to build and operate a hydroelectric power station. There was one problem. The rights belonged to someone else, an entrepreneur named Julio C\u00e9sar Lisac, who had acquired 50-year concessions for two dams in 2005.Then, one day, a Mexican engineer paid Mr. Lisac a visit.The engineer worked for the Mexican state electric utility, whose chief executive was the brother of Mr. Slim\u2019s son-in-law. It was an odd visit. The Mexican state utility cannot build or finance projects outside Mexico. Mr. Lisac said it became clear that the real suitor was Mr. Slim.Eventually, representatives of an infrastructure company Mr. Slim controls made an offer. Mr. Lisac refused.\u201cSlim\u2019s no fool,\u201d he said. \u201cHe knew we had good dams in a good location.\u201dMr. Slim wound up with the project anyway. After missing a deadline, Mr. Lisac had the concession stripped from him in 2006. Less than two years later, it was awarded to Mr. Slim\u2019s company.Mr. Lisac fought in Panama\u2019s Supreme Court \u2014 and won \u2014 but regulators refused to enforce the order. By that time, 2010, Mr. Slim had already built the power station and was operating it.Mr. Lisac suspected that Mr. Slim\u2019s growing relationship with President Ricardo Martinelli, a supermarket magnate elected in 2009, could be at play. Mr. Slim and Mr. Martinelli maintained friendly relations, including attending the final New York Yankees game of the great Panamanian pitcher Mariano Rivera together.Refusing to give up, Mr. Lisac went before a World Bank court in 2013, but it rebuffed his challenge this June, calling it a domestic Panamanian dispute.Mr. Slim denied foul play, noting that he and his company had won the concession in a government auction.\u201cThe government of Panama has won this lawsuit; it\u2019s closed,\u201d Mr. Slim said.Mr. Slim has not always prevailed. In 2011, he paid a visit to regulators who had just won a decision in Mexico\u2019s Supreme Court that was about to cost him a lot of money.The ruling cut into an important income stream for Mr. Slim, forcing him to accept vastly reduced fees from other cellphone carriers for calls into his networks. He had fought the cuts for years, and told regulators they were making a mistake.But public opinion was turning against him.Mexico also lagged its Latin American peers in expanding mobile broadband service to all its citizens, falling behind Brazil, Argentina, Colombia and even Venezuela, according to 2014 figures from the Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development, a United Nations initiative.Mr. Slim is one of the commission\u2019s co-chairmen. Asked why rural stretches of his country have no cellphone reception, he cited regulators.\u201cThey began to insist that we have a lot of market share and that it was a reason to regulate us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe suspended investment in places where we would have 100 percent of the market\u201d because it would invite more regulation.Many Mexicans felt they were paying more for less, creating an opening for the new government. As Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto took office in 2012, a plan was hatched.The government and Mexico\u2019s three major parties met secretly, choosing different locations around Mexico City, often late at night, to avoid word leaking out until the legislation was almost ready.They also took aim at Mexico\u2019s two dominant television companies, which had been equally aggressive in protecting their market shares.Once a deal was reached, lawmakers enshrined the law in the Constitution to head off Mr. Slim\u2019s legal challenges, and set up special courts to rule on them.Those who know Mr. Slim say he has long anticipated the day when his control of Mexican telecom would diminish.\u201cHe knew this was coming,\u201d said James R. Jones, a former American ambassador to Mexico during the 1990s. \u201cAnd I suspect he was planning three moves ahead.\u201dWhile Mr. Slim\u2019s dominance \u2014 and profits \u2014 may be under threat in Mexico, his wealth no longer depends on it.\u201cHe began to invest in other things,\u201d said Juan Molinar, a former communications minister, in an interview before he died last year. \u201cFollow the money.\u201dAnd for years, the money has flowed elsewhere.In the United States, the results have been mixed. An investment in the retailer CompUSA was a failure, while a repaid $250 million loan to The New York Times made a handsome investment. He is now the company\u2019s largest shareholder (Mr. Slim holds Class A shares, which have limited voting rights).His companies build and lease offshore rigs, drill wells, operate dams in Panama and build gas pipelines in Mexico and the United States. He is even doing business with Halliburton\u2019s most famous alumnus, Dick Cheney, investing alongside the former vice president in WellAware, a Texas oil services software start-up.Mexico\u2019s $13 billion airport project has his fingerprints on it, too, including a son-in-law in partnership with the chief architect and another relative by marriage who served on the design committee.Though the committee member recused himself, the local news media saw what it often sees: \u201cThe New Mexico City Airport Will Have the Stamp of Carlos Slim,\u201d as one headline put it.Alejandra Xanic von Bertrab contributed reporting from Mexico City, and Paula Ram\u00f3n from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "You Choose or You Lose", "Date": "2016-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cI truly don\u2019t know,\u201d said Senator Susan Collins unhelpfully.Collins made news this week when she penned an op-ed for The Washington Post, announcing that she couldn\u2019t support her party\u2019s nominee because \u201cMr. Trump\u2019s lack of self-restraint and his barrage of ill-informed comments would make an already perilous world even more so.\u201dIt\u2019s tough being a high-profile Republican these days. People are always demanding to know what you think about your candidate\u2019s latest horrific remark. But unless you come up with an alternative, disavowing a candidate is more like a sulk than a solution.There\u2019s been a lot of this going around. Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, an early evacuee from the Trump train, said he was going to wait until October to deal with the problem. Senator Lindsey Graham said he might \u201cjust pass \u2014 I may write somebody in.\u201d Mark Kirk, who\u2019s generally regarded as the Senator Most Likely to Be Defeated in November, gave Illinois voters an excellent example of his leadership capacity when he announced that he was going to write in David Petraeus or maybe Colin Powell.Obviously, all these people are trying to avoid taking responsibility for Donald Trump without being accused of betraying their party. But it\u2019s very strange to hear elected officials embracing various versions of a don\u2019t-vote strategy. Nobody knows better than they do that politics is a world of imperfect choices.Collins freely admits that she\u2019s worked well with Hillary Clinton in the past. But she ruled out voting for the Democrat, telling CNN that Clinton wanted to spend too much money. (\u201cPromises of free this and free that, that I believe would bankrupt our country.\u201d) Faced with a choice between a guy who could compromise national security and a woman who wants universal early childhood education, the former chairwoman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee claimed to be at a loss for an answer.Here\u2019s the bottom line: There are only three things you can do when it comes time to elect a president. You can stay home and punt; you can choose between the two major party candidates; or you can cop out by doing something that looks like voting but has no effect whatsoever on the outcome of the race.That includes strategies about writing in the name of a retired general, leaving the top line blank, or voting for a third-party candidate who has as much chance of winning as the YouTube Keyboard Cat.The only third party that might have a line on all state ballots is the Libertarian, whose platform includes eliminating Social Security, ending gun control and wiping out drug laws. This year\u2019s Libertarian candidate is Gary Johnson, the former governor of New Mexico. Johnson does not seem to agree with the platform on many points, but to be honest, he\u2019s not the world\u2019s greatest explainer. Libertarians like the idea of a charisma-free candidate, since he\u2019d be incapable of getting much done.But truly, this is a silly choice. Voting for Johnson is exactly the same as staying home, except that it involves going outdoors. Ditto for Green Party candidate Jill Stein, a doctor who appears to have a rather ambiguous attitude toward childhood vaccinations.Susan Collins said she could support the Libertarian ticket if only it had been reversed, with vice-presidential candidate William Weld on top. You can\u2019t totally dislike Weld, who once told me that being governor of Massachusetts was pretty much a walk in the park. (\u201cI used to go on vacation for a week at a time and I wouldn\u2019t even call in.\u201d) However, he\u2019s been out of office for nearly 20 years. He is not the presidential candidate. And the Libertarians are never, repeat, never going to be elected.Right now we live in a world that\u2019s been messed up by the bad decisions George W. Bush made about invading Iraq. He was elected president in 2000 thanks to a few hundred votes in Florida. A state where Green Party candidate Ralph Nader got 97,488 votes.Most of the Green voters undoubtedly thought they were showing their disdain for both Bush and the deeply imperfect candidacy of Al Gore. And Nader is a man of fine principles. But look where those 97,488 votes got us.Nader himself doesn\u2019t feel guilty. I talked to him on the phone the other day, and he argued, basically, that if Gore couldn\u2019t win his home state of Tennessee, it\u2019s not Nader\u2019s fault that he couldn\u2019t win Florida.And he\u2019s not voting for either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton in November. \u201cThey\u2019re not alike,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they\u2019re both terrible.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Cuban-American Generation Gap", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast Christmas, Michael and Gisel Davila, a Cuban-American couple who live in Queens, N.Y., were talking to her mother, Maria C. Castillo, while visiting her in Miami. It was a casual conversation, full of small talk about the holidays and work and the weather, until Ms. Davila, 30, mentioned that she and her husband were thinking about booking a trip over a long weekend to Cuba.\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d her mother said immediately. \u201cYou can\u2019t go.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t good,\u201d said Mr. Davila, 33. \u201cI seriously believe if I went to Cuba with my wife, my mother-in-law would never forgive us.\u201dFor most Cuban-Americans born here, the island of Cuba has existed as only a mythological ideal: a place whose culture, language and food could be recreated in exile but whose physical land could only be experienced through stories passed down from immigrant parents and grandparents.But now, thanks to the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba, the island is within easy reach and has emerged as a trendy destination, with companies like Google and Chanel holding high-profile events on the streets of Havana.While immigrant families have been legally allowed to visit Cuba since 2009, they are now thinking much harder about it since the subject is constantly in the news and their non-Cuban friends and colleagues are increasingly going.But within immigrant families, the question of whether to visit Cuba is not a simple one, and in some cases, it is creating dissension between members of different generations.Parents and grandparents who lived through the Communist revolution led by Fidel Castro are gripped by angst in considering their loved ones stepping foot on Cuban soil still ruled by Mr. Castro and his brother Ra\u00fal. Members of younger generations who were born in America long to see for themselves a country that has loomed so large in the back stories that shape their identities.\u201cImagine growing up hearing about it, and never being able to get there,\u201d Ms. Davila said. \u201cIt\u2019s like this fruit that is dangled in front of your face, but you can\u2019t actually touch it.\u201dShe and her husband are eager to go, and it irks Mr. Davila that so many travelers without an ethnic connection to Cuba have experienced his family\u2019s country before he has.But they also take seriously Ms. Castillo\u2019s opposition. Like many who escaped the rule of Fidel Castro in the 1960s and 1970s by leaving all their possessions behind, she recoils at the idea of her loved ones lending legitimacy and financial support to a country still under Mr. Castro\u2019s administration.\u201cI don\u2019t see why she has to go,\u201d Ms. Castillo said of her daughter. \u201cNothing has changed. The money doesn\u2019t go to the people. It all goes back to the regime.\u201d She feels so much anger toward Mr. Castro, she said, that she refuses to utter his name.On Mr. Davila\u2019s side, his aunts, uncles and cousins are opposed to relatives visiting the island. At a recent family dinner of roasted pig, fried plantains, rice and beans, some people were referring to Mr. Davila\u2019s brother George, a 37-year-old litigation lawyer in Miami, as \u201ca Communist\u201d for having visited Cuba three times. \u201cThere was like food being thrown,\u201d Mr. Davila said.\u201cWhen they first found out I was going, my father\u2019s sisters were like: \u2018Why are you going? You are going to get yourself arrested. You are going to contribute dollars to the government. You are going to get Communist-brainwashed,\u2019\u201d George said.George and Michael\u2019s mother, Maria Davila, was shamed by friends and relatives for allowing George\u2019s travel. \u201cThey told me and my husband that we were crazy Communists,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018No, we want them to experience what we had there and see another side of the world.\u2019\u201dMaria\u2019s encouragement of her sons\u2019 travels puts her in a minority of permissive parents. But not all adult children are heeding their parents\u2019 admonitions.Miranda Hernandez, a 20-year-old college student at the University of California, Berkeley, said that she was always nervous about how her family would react if she even considered a visit to Cuba. \u201cWhen they did speak about Cuba, they made it sound like North Korea with nice beaches,\u201d she said. \u201cI was raised being told I had no business there.\u201dMs. Hernandez went on CubaOne\u2019s inaugural trip this June. She saw the apartment in the Luyan\u00f3 neighborhood of Havana where her mother grew up and the hospital where she was born.She also met her great-uncle, second cousin and twin 16-year-old third cousins who, she was surprised to know, listen to the same music as American teenagers (Kanye West, Chance the Rapper and Chris Brown).Ms. Hernandez shared with her Cuban family stories and photographs of her Cuban-American family. \u201cWhen I met them, it was as if I knew them my entire life,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was surreal.\u201dWhen Ms. Hernandez first told her parents she would be going on the trip, the conversation turned to yelling. \u201cWhy would you want to go there?\u201d she said her parents said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to show you the nice tourist parts.\u201dAfter the trip, they were calmer and looked at the videos and photographs she took. \u201cThey were glad that some things have changed, and that I saw the real Cuba instead of just lying on a beach to sip mojitos like most tourists,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cOn the other hand, they were upset about the island\u2019s physical decay.\u201dSteven Andrew Garcia, a photographer and video director in Los Angeles, went on the CubaOne trip, too. His father was not thrilled. Like many Cuban exiles, Mr. Garcia\u2019s father is deeply distrustful of the Cuban government and feared for his son\u2019s safety.\u201cMy dad questioned who would be financing and coordinating this trip,\u201d said Mr. Garcia, 29. When he made it clear to his father that he had made his decision and intended to go, his father urged him to be careful, telling him, \u201cJust stay with the group and don\u2019t get lost.\u201dVanessa Garcia, now a 37-year-old writer (who is not related to Mr. Garcia), learned the hard way that her mother would take issue with her traveling to Cuba. Back in 2009, taking advantage of the new law that permitted Cuban-Americans with relatives living in Cuba to visit the island, Ms. Garcia bought a plane ticket to Havana with her sister, and then told her mother, Jackie Diaz-Sampol, about the trip they were going to take in a few weeks.\u201cShe got so, so, so red and had a vein popping out of her head,\u201d Ms. Garcia said of her mother, \u201cand she said: \u2018I am going to have a heart attack. You are going to kill your mother.\u2019 I tore my tickets, even though we paid $500 for each of them and they were nonrefundable, and threw them down the toilet. I couldn\u2019t do that to my mom.\u201dMs. Diaz-Sampol, now 60, said she fretted over the prospect of her daughter going because she worried about her physical safety. \u201cShe was na\u00efve, in my opinion, thinking you could go to Cuba like any other country,\u201d she said.They reached a d\u00e9tente of sorts in 2014, when the mother and daughter traveled back to Cuba together. (And when Ms. Garcia decided to travel to Cuba last May, she hatched a plan to avoid maternal interference: She waited until the night before she left to tell her mother and stepfather of her plans.)Not all younger Cuban-Americans are eager to visit. For Michelle Marie Arean, a 35-year-old associate editor at Recommend, a travel trade publication based in Miami, the stories she grew up hearing, about government raids of the family home and how her grandfather was exiled to a sugar cane farm where he was abused, were enough to turn her off. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to give money and support to a government that took so much away from my family,\u201d she said. She said she would go if the leader is ousted.It\u2019s a stance that baffles her non-Cuban friends and colleagues, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s opened my eyes to how many people who are not of Cuban descent simply do not understand what our families went through,\u201d she said.Many of those who are opposed to visiting Cuba say they would change their minds if there were a new, non-Communist government. But Aliza Wechsler, 31, has a different condition: She will travel there only if her mother, who left Cuba when she was 7, goes, too.\u201cI would regret it for the rest of my life if I didn\u2019t go with her and see it through her eyes,\u201d said Ms. Wechsler, who lives in New York. At least a few times a month, she said, she calls or emails her mother to ask her if they can start to plan a trip.Ms. Wechsler\u2019s mother, Lily Wechsler, a 63-year-old banker in Miami, said she would like to visit Cuba with her daughter, in a few years when prices become more reasonable.But just as Aliza wishes to travel there with her, Lily wishes to return to Cuba with her oldest sister, who escaped Cuba when she was 20, immediately after her honeymoon. But her sister, Lily said, refuses to go back.\u201cWe do disagree,\u201d she said. \u201cI do try to convince her. Ideally I would want to go with her because just like Aliza is waiting to go with me so I can make the experience meaningful, for me, I would have loved to go with her because she would have given it a lot more meaning.\u201dShe added, \u201cBut that\u2019s not going to happen unless both Castros die tomorrow and communism stops.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Oracle, Money\u2019s Not the Problem. It\u2019s Coping With the Cloud.", "Date": "2016-07-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe hard part is now in the hands of Thomas Kurian, a soft-spoken 49-year-old who has to figure out how the new purchase will work with what Oracle already has.While Lawrence J. Ellison, Oracle\u2019s brash executive chairman, is still an outsize personality at the company he co-founded, Mr. Kurian has been the key figure in Oracle\u2019s attempted reinvention, overseeing sweeping changes in its engineering. That includes the creation of a network of 21 data centers around the world, a project that has cost perhaps $15 billion. NetSuite is Oracle\u2019s first major acquisition intended to tie right into this new global system.\u201cMoney isn\u2019t the problem for us,\u201d said Mr. Kurian, who is Oracle\u2019s president of product development. He added that \u201cbetween 2004 and 2014 we spent some $40 billion to $45 billion on acquisitions.\u201dOracle became a giant by selling directly to businesses software packages that do things like manage the books and keep track of customers. Now most industry experts think the company needs to show that it is finally in a position to rein in competitors that have been stealing customers away with fresher technology delivered over the internet, a concept called cloud computing.And the trade-offs Oracle must now make \u2014 accepting lower profit margins because customers are less interested in the older, pricier technology \u2014 reflect the hard decisions many older tech companies must make to avoid getting left behind.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt Oracle moved late,\u201d said Al Hilwa, an analyst at IDC. \u201cThey had doubts about the business, and the profit margins, but the way companies are spending forced them to change.\u201dOracle\u2019s new data centers are intended to power a cloud-computing network to compete with the established services provided by the likes of Google, Amazon, Microsoft and IBM. And the NetSuite acquisition could help Oracle pull even with smaller, cloud-focused companies like Salesforce and Workday, which provide their own technology to manage business operations like sales and human resources.Mr. Kurian would seem an unlikely person to play such a key role in one of Silicon Valley\u2019s iconic companies. Born and raised in a middle-class family in Bangalore, India, Mr. Kurian ended his first day in the United States in his freshman dorm room at Princeton University, which he shared with his identical twin, George, who is now chief executive at NetApp, another Silicon Valley company.\u201cThe day we left India was the first day we saw a computer,\u201d said George Kurian, who after graduation worked at Oracle while Thomas Kurian was a consultant at McKinsey. The two also went to Stanford Business School together.Mark V. Hurd and Safra A. Catz, both chief executives at Oracle, manage the company\u2019s sales and finance. Mr. Ellison, who is 71 and shows no inclination to retire, counts on Mr. Kurian to run the core of any big tech company: thousands of engineers.The NetSuite deal is something of a coming-out party for Oracle\u2019s global cloud, possibly signaling the start of a new round of acquisitions, along with hefty spending to keep building out this network. But spending upward of $2 billion a year on building a cloud network, Mr. Kurian said, is table stakes for the biggest tech companies.In NetSuite, Oracle saw a cloud company whose sales of e-commerce and manufacturing software to smaller businesses were stalling as it tried to move into international markets. Oracle figured it could distribute that software efficiently over its cloud. It also hopes to reach smaller companies that can\u2019t afford Oracle\u2019s traditional high-cost, high-maintenance product.Mr. Ellison played no role in the acquisition of NetSuite, according to Oracle, since he owns about 40 percent of that company. Mr. Ellison, who is already worth $45 billion, according to Bloomberg, will reap another $3.7 billion on the NetSuite deal. He still attends regular corporate strategy sessions, along with Mr. Hurd, Ms. Catz and Mr. Kurian, grilling each on their respective portfolios.Oracle has hundreds of different types of software for businesses, but more than anything it is known for powerful databases. Many global airlines, banks and manufacturers wouldn\u2019t function without them.Customers treat the big, Oracle-strength software like sacred objects that should never be altered, while they\u2019re happy to experiment, for example, with a new offering from Amazon. That\u2019s one reason Oracle has a hard time moving toward new technology, said Steve Miranda, Oracle\u2019s vice president of applications development.\u201cNew companies have what is called \u2018a minimum viable product\u2019 they can sell,\u201d said Mr. Miranda, a 24-year veteran at Oracle. At his company, Mr. Miranda said, that minimum is in reality a fairly high-end product.Mr. Kurian, who has been at Oracle for 20 years, is known to move quickly in meetings, seeking slides ahead of a presentation and immediately zeroing in on the one slide where he spots a problem. If there are no problems, the meeting is canceled. Soft-spoken or not, he will let rip a profanity-laced tirade if he sees too many problems.\u201cI won\u2019t comment on the language, but we are very honest with each other, very hard on ourselves and very direct,\u201d said Mr. Miranda. \u201cIf you\u2019re striving to be the best of the best, it comes with the territory.\u201dMuch of that revenue comes from selling bare-bones computing that Oracle doesn\u2019t care about. But increasingly Amazon is offering its own databases, and customers are signing on. It targets Oracle directly at its promotional events, and offers something called \u201cserverless computing,\u201d which charges for applications per line of code rather than monthly fees or upfront licenses \u2014 another potential threat to Oracle\u2019s profit margins.Oracle has built a large operation in Seattle, paying big for cloud talent from Amazon and Microsoft. (Google also has operations there, making Seattle something of the nation\u2019s cloud town.) But local hands there say Oracle isn\u2019t yet a noticeable presence.\u201cRight now, I go to all-day meetings, and their name doesn\u2019t come up,\u201d said Matt McIlwain, a managing director of the Madrona Venture Group, a Seattle venture firm.The next big competition in cloud computing also involves artificial intelligence, fed by loads of data. Soon, Mr. Kurian said, Oracle will offer applications that draw from what it knows about the people whose actions are recorded in Oracle databases. The company has anonymized data from 1,500 companies, including three billion consumers and 400 million business profiles, representing $3 trillion in consumer purchases.\u201cMost of the world\u2019s data is already inside Oracle databases,\u201d said Mr. Kurian.That\u2019s the kind of hold on people\u2019s information that perhaps only Facebook can match. But Mark Zuckerberg doesn\u2019t sell business software. At least, not yet.Advertisement"}

Mr. Adelson was uneasy with Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior in the weeks after the Republican convention last month, his advisers said, a period in which the Republican nominee ridiculed the parents of a Muslim American soldier who had been killed in Iraq.Many of the Republican Party\u2019s most generous contributors have refused to give to Mr. Trump, increasing the importance of wealthy Republicans such as Mr. Adelson who can pour large sums into the campaign. And without Mr. Adelson\u2019s largess, the super PACs promoting Mr. Trump have raised far less money than their counterparts supporting Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy.Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign did not respond to a request for comment about the Adelson meeting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Peace Talks in Yemen Crumble, Civilians End Up in Cross Hairs Again", "Date": "2016-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySANA, Yemen \u2014 A pharmacist, Sadam al-Othari, had a firsthand look at the results of the collapse in peace talks in Yemen between the Saudi-led military coalition and Yemeni militias over the weekend when a bomb exploded outside his drugstore, killing a customer and his young son and wounding Mr. Othari.The customer and his son were among 18 Yemeni civilians killed when coalition warplanes bombed Al Madeed marketplace in the district of Nehm, about 35 miles northeast of Sana, the capital, on Sunday, said Tamim al-Shami, a spokesman for the Ministry of Health.\u201cThey targeted only civilians,\u201d Mr. Othari said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a single gunman or military vehicle around.\u201dBrig. Gen. Ahmed al-Asiri, a spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition, could not be reached for comment.\u201cA military operation to liberate Sana and other provinces is the only proper choice to make this insurgent group bow down to peace,\u201d Samer al-Haj, a spokesman for the Yemeni military, said by telephone from Riyadh, the Saudi capital. While he questioned whether civilians had been killed in the bombing, he said the episode would be investigated.United Nations-brokered peace talks between the Houthis and the government of the ousted president, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, collapsed on Saturday after more than three months. A cease-fire was in place for the talks, and despite many violations, it resulted in a significant decrease in coalition airstrikes, especially around major cities like Sana.Sunday\u2019s airstrikes seemed to signal an end to efforts to respect the cease-fire.Several witnesses, reached by telephone in Nehm, said that the marketplace hit Sunday night had no military or Houthi presence, and that all of the victims had been civilians.\u201cThe fighter jets kept hovering overhead, and people were so afraid to help,\u201d Mr. Othari said. Complicating rescue efforts, barrels of fuel and cylinders of gas ignited, burning for hours, and residents stayed away, fearing a second airstrike.A report on the situation in Yemen after the first six months of 2016, by a panel of experts appointed by the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, was critical of the Saudi-led coalition and of the Houthis for their disregard of civilian life in their indiscriminate attacks, which the report said violated international law.The experts\u2019 report, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, said that in at least one documented instance, coalition warplanes had twice deliberately attacked the same civilian home. Houthi fighters used rockets in fighting around the city of Taiz that were so inaccurate that their use was a violation of international law. They also fired rockets into Saudi Arabia, endangering civilians, the report said.The experts also said that the Houthis had hidden weapons and fighters in and around civilian areas. \u201cThe Houthis almost certainly deliberately endanger and expose the civilian population and civilian objects to the perils of conflict, which is a violation of I.H.L.,\u201d the report said, using an abbreviation for international humanitarian law.The United Nations report, which the experts said had been compiled without the possibility of the panel\u2019s visiting Yemen, also criticized the Houthis for having diverted $100 million a month from the central bank\u2019s reserves to finance their military operations. It said that two leading militant groups, Al Qaeda and the Islamic State, had taken advantage of the tumult in Yemen to build up their operations in some areas.In an unusual revelation, the panel noted that Mr. Hadi, the ousted president, had appointed as governor a man identified by the American government as a Qaeda financier. The man, Nayif Salih Salim al-Qaysi, was appointed governor of Baydha Province in December 2015, the panel said.Shuaib Almosawa reported from Sana, and Rod Nordland from Cairo.

{"Headline": "Is Trump Wrecking Both Parties?", "Date": "2016-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn case you weren\u2019t convinced Democrats are becoming the cosmopolitan elite party.The table showed support for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump by income and education. It leads to a clear conclusion.Trump is competitive among the less affluent and those without college degrees, among whom he is behind by 3 and 4 points respectively. But Clinton is crushing him among college graduates (57-34) and among those making $50,000 or more (55-37).The larger conclusion from the data is that the Trump campaign \u2014 both through the support Trump generates among working-class whites and the opposition he generates among better educated, more affluent voters \u2014 has accelerated the ongoing transformation of the Democratic Party. Once a class-based coalition, the party has become an alliance between upscale well-educated whites and, importantly, ethnic and racial minorities, many of them low income.\u201cThe voice of the left \u2014 especially the old social democratic left \u2014 has lost force in recent years,\u201d Ian Buruma, a professor of democracy, human rights, and journalism at Bard College, wrote me in an email.This is partly because leftwing parties since the 1960s began to switch their attention from working class struggle to identity politics.There is, Buruma went on,a common anxiety about the effects of globalism, multinational corporate power, immigration. More and more people feel unrepresented. When they complained about immigration or the bewildering changes effected by a global economy, such people were too easily dismissed as racists and bigots. Now they blame the \u201cliberal elites\u201d for all their anxieties.Rodrik does not let up:They abdicated too easily to market fundamentalism and bought in to its central tenets. Worse still, they led the hyper-globalization movement at crucial junctures. The enthroning of free capital mobility \u2013 especially of the short-term kind \u2013 as a policy norm by the European Union, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and the IMF was arguably the most fateful decision for the global economy in recent decades.Left policy makers and analysts, Rodrik writes, facethe paradox that earlier waves of reforms from the left \u2013 Keynesianism, social democracy, the welfare state \u2013 both saved capitalism from itself and effectively rendered themselves superfluous.If liberal public policy intellectuals are unable develop \u201ca clear program to refashion capitalism and globalization for the twenty-first century,\u201d Rodrik warns, \u201cthe field will be left wide open for populists and far-right groups who will lead the world \u2013 as they always have \u2013 to deeper division and more frequent conflict.\u201dincreasingly disconnected from working-class America. I mean that in a very specific sense. Our residences are increasingly segregated by class. Our schools are increasingly segregated by class. Our extended families are increasingly separated by class.Most culture-war conflicts involve sexuality, gender, or reproduction. Social issues spurred a partisan realignment by changing who considered themselves Democrats and Republicans. Over decades, socially conservative working-class whites migrated from the Democratic Party to join the Republican Party, especially in the South. Socially moderate Republicans, especially on the East Coast, shifted to the Democratic coalition.The result, in Lind\u2019s view, is an emerging Republican Party dominated byworking-class whites, based in the South and West and suburbs and exurbs everywhere. They will favor universal, contributory social insurance systems that benefit them and their families and reward work effort \u2014 programs like Social Security and Medicare. But they will tend to oppose means-tested programs for the poor whose benefits they and their families cannot enjoy.This shift, Lind points out, will powerfully alter the Democratic coalition, too. The Democrats will becomeeven more of an alliance of upscale, progressive whites with blacks and Latinos, based in large and diverse cities. They will think of the U.S. as a version of their multicultural coalition of distinct racial and ethnic identity groups writ large. Many younger progressives will take it for granted that moral people are citizens of the world, equating nationalism and patriotism with racism and fascism.From this vantage point, Trump and the pro-social insurance populist right that has emerged in much of Europe are as much the result of the vacuum created by traditional liberal political parties as they are a function of the neglect of working class interests by conservatives.You can look at the populist insurgency spearheaded by Donald Trump as either a corrective or a threat to mainstream Republican orthodoxy.On the threat side, Trump has exploited a racist and authoritarian vein in American politics.There are, however, major hurdles for anyone determined to capitalize on the Trump campaign in order to force an internal realignment of the Republican Party.Trump has already demonstrated the ability to leap over one of those hurdles: the social conservatism of the Christian Right.Trump\u2019s political base was among the party\u2019s white working- and middle-class voters \u2014 precisely the voters who had originally flocked to Wallace and then to Nixon, who had been attracted by Perot and Buchanan, but who now felt that they had found a champion in Trump. He had become the voice of Middle American radicalism and more broadly of the white Americans who felt left behind by globalization and the shift to a postindustrial economy.Inglehart and Norris view animosity to cosmopolitan cultural trends as a driving force. They see right populism asa loose political ideology emphasizing faith in the \u201cdecent,\u201d \u201cordinary\u201d or \u201clittle\u201d people over the corrupt political and corporate establishment; nationalist interests (Us) over cosmopolitanism cooperation across borders (Them); protectionist policies regulating the movement of trade, people and finance over global free trade; xenophobia over tolerance of multiculturalism; strong individual leadership over diplomatic bargaining and flexible negotiations; isolationism in foreign and defense policies over international engagement; traditional sex roles for women and men over more fluid gender identities and roles, and traditional over progressive values.I asked Judis and Norris whether the Trump campaign provides a model for a new Republican future. Both answered in the negative.Judis wrote back:In order to mimic the European parties, the G.O.P. would have to slough off its business wing, and that is inconceivable to me, especially with Citizens United. The European right does not have strong business support.Norris looks at another angle: the way in which the populist right is, at its core, a protest movement that is not well equipped for governing:In Europe, populist parties which enter government coalitions often do lose popular support by disappointing their followers. Moreover, their electoral fortunes are usually erratic, like flash parties which come and go with the leader.Despite these difficulties, there are some conservatives who intend to capitalize on currents unleashed by the Trump campaign to try to make the Republican Party more attractive to lower wage workers.These positions include the disavowal of \u201cmass deportations\u201d and the promotion of \u201cthe economic benefits of legalizing longtime workers who are in the country illegally,\u201d as well as arguing for \u201cthe benefits of global trade agreements,\u201d with help for displaced workers.Here\u2019s the problem with that agenda. As both Judis and Norris stress, the anti-immigrant message has been crucial to the growth of the European right and to the Trump campaign.In Europe, Judis writes in his book,as populist parties gained support for their stand against immigration, they widened their political base. The first populist parties, such as the National Front and the Freedom Party, had been petit-bourgeoisie parties. Their members were drawn primarily from small towns in the countryside, and were small business proprietors and small farmers. Thanks to the reaction to immigration and neoliberalism, what had been petit-bourgeois parties had become workers\u2019 parties.Judis defines neoliberalism this way:In the United States, neoliberalism meant the modification, but not wholesale abandonment, of New Deal liberalism \u2014 support for the New Deal safety net, but beyond that, priority to market imperatives \u2014 while in Europe, it meant the partial return to older free market liberalism.Theda Skocpol, a professor of government at Harvard, studies both the Tea Party movement and the rise of Trump. She is dubious about reformocon strategy:The \u201cintellectuals\u2019 \u201d idea that somehow the G.O.P. is going to start responding to the economic security worries of blue collar/lower middle class Republicans is largely a fantasy. And that is largely because the core of Trump\u2019s support is raw nativism.In the long run, then, the significance of the Trump campaign may well prove to be the changes he has wrought in the Democratic Party.As Trump flails in every self-destructive fashion conceivable, the odds increasingly point to a Clinton victory. But if she wins, how well will Clinton be able to govern with a base split between the well-to-do, many of whom seek to protect their enclaves against the interests, needs and classically American ambitions of the other half of the party \u2014 low-to-moderate income African-Americans and Hispanics and the truly poor?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Adopted Koreans, Stymied in Search of Birth Parents, Find Hope in a Cotton Swab", "Date": "2016-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Five years ago, Sun Mi Stapel, a claims handler at a Dutch insurance company, began searching for her South Korean birth family.Ms. Stapel first turned to the Dutch adoption agency that had placed her with her adoptive parents in Krommenie, the Netherlands, where she grew up. Then she tried Korea Social Service, which had handled the Korean side of her adoption. Last year, she finally obtained her adoption files, but they were missing vital information.She traveled to Seoul, appearing on a morning television show with her baby photos and asking viewers to call a hotline with any information. She registered for a national database for missing people. She distributed fliers in the neighborhood around her orphanage in Incheon, where she was born, and visited nursing homes and community centers there in hopes of finding someone who knew her parents.No one did.So on a recent Tuesday afternoon, Ms. Stapel, 46, went to a guesthouse for adoptees in Seoul, where a volunteer rubbed the inside of her cheek with a cotton swab, dropped the swab in a tube and shipped it to a lab in Texas, where her DNA will be analyzed and uploaded to a website that scans submitted samples for genetic matches.The result could link her to her birth family and fill in some of the blanks of her personal history.\u201cI want to know the simple things,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen is my real date of birth? Who is my father? Who is my mother? Do I have siblings? Do I look like somebody?\u201dMany South Korean adoptees who have the same questions are turning to DNA testing to circumvent what has long been a tortuous and often fruitless process.For years, South Korea was the world\u2019s leading baby exporter. Since the 1950s, it has sent about 200,000 children abroad for adoption, including about 150,000 to the United States.From 2012 to 2015, fewer than 15 percent of adoptees who asked to reunite with their birth parents were able to do so, according to Korean government figures.For many, DNA testing offers a way around the bureaucratic hurdles and flawed records.Monica Toudahl Knudsen, 33, who grew up in the Jutland peninsula, in Denmark, also took the test. She has been searching for her birth family since 2012.According to her adoption file, her parents were teenage sweethearts who could not afford to raise her. On a previous trip to Seoul, she had visited the site of the midwife clinic where she was born. It now houses a cafe and fried chicken restaurant.She feels grateful for her life in Denmark, where she is a chef. If she is ever able to meet her birth parents, she said, \u201cI just want to thank them for letting me go.\u201dThe DNA testing movement has been largely financed by Thomas Park Clement, a Korean adoptee who now lives in Manhattan and in Bloomington, Ind. A scientist who founded Mectra Labs, a medical manufacturing company, he has pledged to spend $1 million on DNA kits to give away.\u201cI have throughout the years experienced so many of my fellow Korean adoptees\u2019 frustrations with birth relative searches,\u201d he said in a recent interview. \u201cDNA is shortcutting the search process and bringing all parties in direct communication with each other.\u201dHe has donated 2,550 kits to Korean adoptees and Korean War veterans in the United States. Some of the veterans are the fathers of the first wave of South Korea\u2019s international adoptees. He has also given 450 to 325Kamra, a volunteer organization started last year, to distribute in South Korea.When testing works, it is remarkably efficient.This month, 325Kamra announced its first match between a Korean birth mother and an American adoptee. Within 48 hours, the adoptee, Kyung Eun Davidson, 33, of Everett, Wash., was speaking to her mother for the first time in 30 years.The biggest obstacles to finding more matches are the databases themselves: There is no single consolidated database widely available both to Korean birth parents and to overseas Korean adoptees. Databases used by Americans and Koreans are incompatible and cannot share information.The South Korean police collect DNA samples for their national database of missing people. Adoptees and birth parents are eligible to submit DNA for this database, and many do, but not nearly enough.The testing done by 325Kamra goes into the databases of Family Tree DNA, a Houston-based DNA testing company, and GEDMatch, a service that scans for genetic matches from three popular testing companies: Family Tree, 23andMe and AncestryDNA. Ms. Davidson used 23andMe, her birth mother took the test with 325Kamra in South Korea, and they were connected by GEDMatch.Another limitation is the parents. While an estimated 1,000 adoptees have submitted their DNA for matching on GEDMatch, only 100 birth parents have taken tests with 325Kamra. Many are afraid to come forward because of the shame associated with adoption in South Korea, where they risk being shunned by their families and communities.Stigma has always been a factor in South Korea\u2019s international adoptions, which began in the mid-1950s, when the children of Korean women and American servicemen were ostracized for their mixed racial heritage. Later, the shame of single parenthood fueled abandonments, and the poor local economy favored international adoption.But by 1988, the country\u2019s reputation as the leading baby exporter had become a national embarrassment, and the government introduced a quota system for international adoptions and began promoting domestic ones.Adoptees are not the only ones placing their hopes in DNA tests.Last month, Song Chang-sook, 89, traveled 200 miles from Pusan with his caregiver to take a DNA test in Seoul. Having heard about the testing on a morning television program, he was searching for the three sons he relinquished for adoption more than 40 years ago.When his wife died of typhoid fever in 1970, his mother-in-law decided that the children should be given up for adoption rather than raised by a single father. He gave up his three sons: Won Ho, born in 1965; Won Young, born in 1967; and Won Hee, born in 1968.Five years later, he returned to the adoption agency, Holt International, asking for their whereabouts. He inquired many more times after that. At one point, someone told him that his sons were living together in France. But Holt was prohibited from disclosing personal information about the three boys. The 2012 adoption law that gives adoptees the right to petition for their birth records offers no such benefit to the parents.Mr. Song thinks about the last time he saw his children, on Nov. 3, 1971. The year before, his oldest son, Won Ho, had been hospitalized for a month with a broken shoulder from a car accident.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Israel Charges Aid Group\u2019s Gaza Branch Manager With Funneling Funds to Hamas", "Date": "2016-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byASHKELON, Israel \u2014 The Palestinian manager of the Gaza branch of World Vision, a major Christian aid organization, was charged by Israeli prosecutors on Thursday with infiltrating the charity on behalf of Hamas and funneling about $43 million in the group\u2019s funds over the past six years to the military wing of the Islamist militant group.While neither the World Vision employee, Mohammad El Halabi, nor the aid group have had a chance to review the evidence and respond to specific charges, the allegations have cast a cloud over nongovernmental organizations in Gaza.By Thursday evening in Jerusalem, the Australian government announced the suspension of funding to World Vision\u2019s projects in the Palestinian territories. Describing the allegations as \u201cdeeply troubling,\u201d Dave Sharma, the Australian ambassador to Israel, announced the suspension in a statement on Twitter, pending the outcome of an investigation by Australia\u2019s foreign affairs department.Mr. Halabi was arrested on June 15 at the Erez crossing point between Israel and Gaza, the territory controlled by Hamas, which is considered a terrorist organization by Israel, the United States and the European Union.A senior official with Israel\u2019s internal security service, Shin Bet, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of his agency\u2019s rules, said that Mr. Halabi was recruited by the military wing of Hamas in 2004 and was instructed to infiltrate World Vision and to attempt to reach an influential position.Briefing reporters on Thursday in the Israeli city of Ashkelon, the official said that Mr. Halabi became the manager of the Gaza branch of World Vision in 2010, and had subsequently transferred about 60 percent of World Vision\u2019s annual budget for Gaza to Hamas.The official said that some of the money had been used by Hamas militants to dig cross-border tunnels for the purpose of carrying out attacks in Israeli territory. Donations were also used to build a Hamas military base, and 2,500 food packages meant for needy families in Gaza were transferred to Hamas battalions, the official added.In addition, Mr. Halabi is accused of initiating a greenhouse project designed to hide tunnel work. A project for the rehabilitation of fishermen was, in practice, used to provide motorboats and diving suits for Hamas\u2019s military marine unit, the Israeli authorities said. The allegations could not be independently verified.The Shin Bet official said that officers raided the organization\u2019s offices in East Jerusalem, and emphasized there was no evidence from the investigation and interrogation of Mr. Halabi that World Vision had been aware of the misuse of its funds in Gaza.World Vision said in a statement on Thursday that \u201cwe have no reason to believe the allegations are true\u201d based on the available information, and stressed that there was no suggestion the organization had been complicit in any diversion of funds.Tim Costello, the chief executive of World Vision Australia, which has been deeply involved in the Gaza project, said his organization was nevertheless \u201cvery worried\u201d about the impact the accusations would have on its ability to raise funds and work.\u201cWe are profoundly shocked by these allegations,\u201d Mr. Costello said. \u201cWe want to get to the bottom of this, we want the truth.\u201dMr. Costello said he did not think it was appropriate for the Israeli authorities to publicly accuse Mr. Halabi and World Vision of the diversion before they had a chance to review the evidence. He added that Mr. Halabi was prevented from consulting a lawyer for the first 25 days of his detention.\u201cWe just really want a fair process, where Mohammad, once charged, gets to present his side, because we want to know the truth about this,\u201d he said. \u201cThe truth comes out when you hear both sides.\u201dMaj. Gen. Yoav Poly Mordechai, an Israeli official responsible for liaising on civil affairs in the West Bank and Gaza, met in Jerusalem on Thursday with World Vision leaders and presented them with the results of Israel\u2019s investigation and a confession from Mr. Halabi, according to a statement released by General Mordechai\u2019s office.Hamas representatives were quick to dismiss the Israeli accusations, saying they had no faith in confessions obtained by Israeli intelligence officials, while maintaining that Palestinians were legitimately allowed to use all means to defend themselves.\u201cWe do not trust the occupation, nor the information coming from the occupation,\u201d said Yehia Mousa, a Hamas legislator in Gaza, referring to Israel. \u201cThe occupation employs false stories and spreads them.\u201dIsrael withdrew its forces and settlers from Gaza in 2005, but continues to strictly control movement in and out of the Palestinian enclave, with the help of Egypt.The Shin Bet official said that while the investigation did not implicate World Vision in the purported scheme to divert funds, it did reveal an abysmal lack of monitoring and supervision by the organization of its donations and projects.Israeli officials have, in the past, raised suspicions about the Palestinian employees of aid organizations, saying some sympathized with Hamas. Shin Bet said its investigation of Mr. Halabi had pointed to additional figures in the Gaza Strip who exploited their work in humanitarian aid organizations and United Nations institutions on behalf of the militant group. But the agency had previously found nothing on the level of the deception that Mr. Halabi is accused of, which the Shin Bet official described as an \u201cextraordinary episode.\u201dMr. Halabi appeared to command respect with officials in the humanitarian aid world, with some saying he dedicated his life to helping children after seeing the devastating impact of conflict.In a separate interview, he said that he had lost eight relatives to airstrikes during the 2014 Gaza summer war with Israel. One of those relatives was pregnant, he said, and doctors aborted her child in a failed effort to save her life.World Vision has said that its donors sponsored 4.1 million children around the world last year, providing about $1.2 billion in funds. The current recipients include about 40,000 Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.Isabel Kershner reported from Ashkelon, and Diaa Hadid from Jerusalem. Moushira Jammal contributed reporting from Gaza City.Advertisement"}

Inching along in stop-and-go traffic. Cramming into a commuter van alongside other passengers.These are the experiences of living in New York City when a subway line is out of reach.While the city is heralded for operating one of the world\u2019s most expansive networks of subway lines, there are many neighborhoods \u2014 and many New Yorkers \u2014 that do not benefit from this rapid mode of transportation.For those who live in the huge swaths of the city that the subway does not serve, getting around can be a time-consuming and stressful slog, involving long bus rides, multiple transfers and a large reserve of patience or a good playlist or book to endure an hour or more in transit. Beyond the inconvenience, a lack of easy access to a subway line has more serious social consequences, helping contribute to economic inequality.With neighborhoods in Brooklyn along the L line \u2014 among the city\u2019s busiest subway routes \u2014 in anguish over losing their train to Manhattan for 18 months, New Yorkers living in so-called subway deserts have a message: Welcome to the club.\u201cThe first thing that came to mind is, Suck it up,\u201d said Philippe Pierre, 26, who commutes more than an hour each way to Manhattan from Rosedale, Queens, a neighborhood east of Kennedy International Airport without a subway stop.In the morning, Mr. Pierre usually takes a dollar van, which actually costs $2, to the E train at Jamaica Center and transfers to the B or D line to get to his information technology job near Columbus Circle. At night, he sometimes splurges on a $10 Long Island Rail Road trip that drops him near his home.New Yorkers are resilient and resourceful, Mr. Pierre said, and those who live along the L line will find new ways to get around. \u201cI\u2019m not the only one who thinks the bus is too slow, so they created an industry where dollar vans, now $2 vans, were created,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe they could do something like that.\u201d\u201cIt is a perpetuating cycle because rents are closely correlated to transit access,\u201d said Sarah M. Kaufman, the assistant director for technology programming at the center, adding that people with long commutes often face hardships like higher child care costs because they get home later.Many New Yorkers who rely on buses have plenty of advice for L train commuters about what lies ahead.\u201cYou never know what\u2019s going to happen with the bus; I suggest leaving early,\u201d said Harvinder Singh, 19, a finance student at Queens College, who takes two buses to the Flushing campus from his home in South Ozone Park, Queens.Mr. Singh, whose commute is about an hour each way, did offer praise for the dedicated bus lanes that have been expanded as a way to improve service.\u201cThat\u2019s a great way to make them faster during rush hour,\u201d Mr. Singh said as he rode a campus shuttle on a recent weekday, pointing out the window at a Q44 bus lane.Queens College, which is east of Flushing Meadows-Corona Park near the Long Island Expressway, is so isolated from the subway that it started a free shuttle in 2014 to ferry students to the closest stops. City buses are often as packed as subway cars, but the crowds are more frustrating because the ride is longer, said Madanlal Jaikaran, 25, a graphic design student at Queens College.\u201cBe prepared to stand, because there are no seats,\u201d said Mr. Jaikaran, who lives in Queens and took a bus to classes before switching to driving.But Sheena Pierre, 20, a psychology student at the college, warned that buses become less reliable during the winter, especially during snow. Ms. Pierre, who lives near the border of Queens and Nassau County, sighed in frustration as she described \u201cseven years of buses\u201d \u2014 first to high school and now to college.She cannot afford a car and without a subway stop in her neighborhood, she does not have any other option than to take the bus about an hour each way.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to get up so early,\u201d Ms. Pierre said. \u201cI guess I\u2019m used to it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jo\u00e3o Havelange, Who Built and Ruled World Soccer With Firm Hand, Dies at 100", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJo\u00e3o Havelange, the Brazilian businessman who built soccer into a multibillion-dollar international enterprise over his 24 years as the autocratic head of the sport\u2019s world governing body but who was later implicated in a scandal involving millions of dollars in kickbacks, died on Tuesday in Rio de Janeiro. He was 100.When he was elected in 1974 as FIFA\u2019s first non-European president, the organization, based in Zurich, had existed for 70 years. It had a modest-size staff, however, and meager funds with which to preside over the World Cup, a prodigious undertaking held every four years.When Mr. Havelange completed his sixth and final term in 1998, he estimated that FIFA had $4 billion in its treasury and that international soccer had become a $250-billion-a-year international industry.Mr. Havelange was also the longest-serving member of the International Olympic Committee when he resigned in December 2011 after 48 years, citing health reasons. He departed shortly before the I.O.C.\u2019s executive board was scheduled to issue findings on reports by the BBC that Mr. Havelange had taken a large kickback from a World Cup marketing firm based in Switzerland when he was nearing the end of his final term as FIFA president.Mr. Havelange could have been suspended or expelled from the I.O.C. if it had substantiated the charges, but the case against him, investigated by the I.O.C.\u2019s ethics committee, was closed on his resignation.In July 2012, a report by a Swiss prosecutor that had been kept secret for two years was released. The prosecutor found that Mr. Havelange had received about $1 million in 1997 from the Swiss company ISL in connection with its being awarded World Cup marketing and broadcast rights. The firm had collapsed in 2001, leading to a criminal investigation.The prosecutor also found that Ricardo Teixeira, Mr. Havelange\u2019s son-in-law at the time, had received at least $13 million in kickbacks from ISL in the 1990s. Mr. Teixeira resigned in March 2012 as head of Brazil\u2019s soccer federation and of the organizing committee for the 2014 World Cup, which was held in Brazil, and gave up his FIFA executive committee position, citing health and personal considerations.FIFA, Mr. Havelange and Mr. Teixeira had reached a settlement in 2010 to end the Swiss criminal investigation by making partial restitution. The settlement stipulated that neither man would be identified in connection with the case, but the text of the report was released after Switzerland\u2019s Supreme Court ruled in favor of journalists challenging its suppression.\u201cHe loved what he did, was a fantastic administrator who raised FIFA up from nothing,\u201d she said.In what was virtually one-man rule over FIFA, Mr. Havelange garnered immense revenue for soccer from worldwide television rights and corporate sponsorships, turning the world\u2019s most popular sport into an economic powerhouse.Mr. Havelange doubled the number of nations participating in the World Cup, introduced a Women\u2019s World Cup and won a spot for women\u2019s soccer in the Olympics.At a party in 1998, when he was about to step down as FIFA\u2019s ruler, Mr. Havelange was asked whether he considered himself the world\u2019s most powerful man.\u201cI\u2019ve been to Russia twice, invited by President Yeltsin,\u201d Time magazine quoted him as saying, referring to Boris N. Yeltsin, the Russian leader at the time. \u201cIn Italy, I saw Pope John Paul II three times. When I go to Saudi Arabia, King Fahd welcomes me in splendid fashion. Do you think a head of state will spare that much time for just anyone? That\u2019s respect. They\u2019ve got their power, and I\u2019ve got mine: the power of football, which is the greatest power there is.\u201dJean-Marie Faustin Godefroid de Havelange was born on May 8, 1916, in Rio de Janeiro, the son of a Belgian-born businessman. He was a member of the Brazilian swim team at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, obtained a law degree and then grew wealthy with business interests that included senior positions with insurance, steel and transport companies. He returned to the Olympics at the 1952 Helsinki Games as a water polo player.Mr. Havelange joined the Brazilian Olympic Committee in 1955 and became the president of the Brazilian Sports Confederation, now known as the Brazilian Football Confederation, which governed the nation\u2019s soccer programs. He ran the confederation from 1958 until 1973, a period in which Brazil won three World Cups.He was elected to FIFA\u2019s presidency by defeating Sir Stanley Rous of Britain, by which time the demise of colonialism had vastly expanded the number of African and Asian countries in the organization. Mr. Havelange won major support from those regions and FIFA\u2019s many small countries in the one-country, one-vote election and rewarded them with FIFA financing for their national soccer organizations. At the same time, he began reshaping the World Cup field beyond its familiar European and South American domination, expanding it from 16 nations to 24 in 1982, and then to 32 in 1998.A crowning triumph for Mr. Havelange\u2019s commercial ambitions came when FIFA held the World Cup in the United States in 1994.\u201cThe only hole in his marketing and television plan was the United States, and he filled it by coming here,\u201d Harvey Schiller told The Washington Post in June 1994, when he was the executive director of the United States Olympic Committee.Mr. Havelange had flaunted his power the previous December when he took revenge on Pel\u00e9, soccer\u2019s most famous athlete and its most recognizable figure in the United States. He barred Pel\u00e9 from the 1994 Cup\u2019s draw ceremonies in Las Vegas after Pel\u00e9 had leveled corruption accusations against the Brazilian soccer governing body, run by Mr. Teixeira.Within FIFA\u2019s ranks, Mr. Havelange was paid homage over the years befitting a global presence.\u201cIn the fearsome battle between the Swiss and the French for the rights to host the 1998 World Cup, the Swiss football federation nominated Havelange for the Nobel Peace Prize,\u201d David Goldblatt wrote in his book \u201cThe Ball Is Round\u201d (2006). \u201cThe standing ovation which followed the announcement would have shamed Khrushchev.\u201d (The French nonetheless won the right to host the 1998 Cup.)Mr. Havelange resigned from his FIFA honorary presidency in April 2013 after a report issued by a FIFA ethics court judge said that Mr. Havelange\u2019s conduct had been \u201cmorally and ethically reproachable\u201d because of the ISL bribes.Mr. Blatter was cleared of criminal or ethical wrongdoing in the ISL matter, but he was accused of knowing about the bribes and of \u201cclumsy\u201d conduct.In addition to his wife, Mr. Havelange\u2019s survivors include a daughter, Lucia, who was married to Mr. Teixeira for many years before their divorce in 1997; two grandsons; and a granddaughter, according to The Guardian, a British newspaper.Mr. Havelange\u2019s reputation may have been in tatters in his later years, but the stadium in Rio for the track and field events at the 2016 Summer Olympics, built in 2007, was formally named Jo\u00e3o Havelange Olympic Stadium. Organizing officials for the Games decided, however, to refer to it simply as \u201cthe Olympic Stadium.\u201dMr. Havelange invariably had the last word within FIFA, even when it did not have to be uttered. That was the case in 1995 when he was criticized for visiting Nigeria at the same time that a prominent dissident there, Ken Saro-Wiwa, was about to be executed.\u201cI don\u2019t want to make any comparisons with the pope, but he is also criticized from time to time, and his reply is silence,\u201d Mr. Havelange was quoted as saying. \u201cI am, too, sometimes criticized, so explanations about such matters are superfluous.\u201dAn obituary on Wednesday about Jo\u00e3o Havelange, the longtime head of FIFA, world soccer\u2019s governing body, misstated the year he expanded the World Cup field to 32 nations from 24. It was 1998, not 1994.Advertisement"}

The number of sports events will not be affected, officials said.The wheelchair fencing competition, for example, will take place within the Olympic Park, rather than at a special destination location, so that the previously designated location can be \u201cclosed and dismantled,\u201d a statement from the committee said.The cuts came in addition to ones that had previously been made together by Paralympic and Olympic officials over the last year, Mr. Craven said, noting in the statement that they \u201care likely to impact nearly every stakeholder attending the Games.\u201dFriday\u2019s announcement followed days of growing tension between local organizers of the Games and Paralympic officials, who had warned that if certain past-due payments were not delivered, the participation of whole nations would be jeopardized.\u201cCurrently we have around 10 countries who, even if the grants are paid, may struggle to cover the cost of their travel to the Games,\u201d Mr. Craven said.He added: \u201cWe want full participation here. We want all eligible countries to send their athletes to the Games. It\u2019s what the athletes deserve, and it is what the athletes want after years of training and dedication.\u201d\u201cThe sales of tickets and the sponsorships have been below our expectations,\u201d Mario Andrada, a spokesman for the Rio organizing officials, said Thursday.9 PhotosAs of this week, 12 percent of tickets to the Paralympics had been sold, Mr. Andrada said.Months ago in Lausanne, Switzerland, officials had said that roughly 25 percent of tickets had been sold. Explaining why that figure had been halved, Mr. Andrada said Thursday that Rio\u2019s mayor had made a commitment to buy tickets that was later rescinded.\u201cThe tickets were returned to the pot,\u201d Mr. Andrada said, \u201cand the number has decreased.\u201dBob Foth, the Paralympic coach for U.S.A. Shooting, said he did not think the financial disruptions would affect the athletes\u2019 attitudes toward the Games.\u201cThere\u2019s a whole bunch of people who always have to find solutions to stuff, just in day-to-day living,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do you reach the top cabin when you\u2019re in a wheelchair? How do you navigate a failed curb cut? All these little things. And so it is very much part of the DNA that I\u2019ve seen for everybody in the Paralympic movement.\u201dBrazil has battled a profound economic crisis in preparing for the Games, facing a rising rate of unemployment.As of this week, 28 sponsors had signed on to the Paralympics, fewer than half the number secured for the Olympics.Mr. Andrada declined to answer questions about Paralympic funding for several days, after event organizers \u2014 who in the days leading up to the Games had emphasized their reliance on private financing \u2014 had requested hundreds of millions in Brazilian government money.A judge here, in turn, issued an injunction preventing such use of public funds.On Thursday, after that injunction had been lifted, Brazil\u2019s president, Michel Temer, promised organizing officials 250 million reais (about $77 million) in public money.Amid Brazil\u2019s crisis, Mr. Temer, who assumed power in May, visited the Olympic Park on Thursday and met with organizers of the Games. A principal focus of that meeting \u2014 which included Rio\u2019s mayor and governor and various federal ministers of sport, infrastructure and foreign relations \u2014 was the request for public money to help deliver the Paralympics.\u201cNot only did we hold productive talks, but he picked up the phone on a number of occasions to get things moving, which gave us huge confidence,\u201d Mr. Craven said of Mr. Temer.The International Paralympic Committee and the International Olympic Committee began cooperating in 2000 and came into full force in 2008 in Beijing. The two organizations have an agreement to remain partners until at least 2032.The I.O.C. has given $1.5 billion for the operation of the Olympics and the Paralympics.Mr. Craven said the usual approach had been to deal with the direct partners of the Paralympics \u2014 the organizing committee and the federal and city governments of the host nation.\u201cI\u2019ve had several questions, \u2018Why have the I.O.C. not stepped in with money\u2019\u201d to bail out the Paralympic financial troubles, Mr. Craven said Friday. \u201cLook, the Paralympic Games, we own them, not the I.O.C. If we\u2019ve got problems, then we deal with them. We don\u2019t go to the I.O.C.\u201dBen Shpigel contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trillions in Murky Investments Could Rock China\u2019s Economy", "Date": "2016-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 The deal could be hard to resist.There is just one catch: Investors know surprisingly little about what they are buying.The offering is just one of a spate of barely regulated, highly opaque investments that are posing a growing threat to the Chinese financial system. As the country\u2019s economy slows, experts increasingly worry that many of the investment funds could fail \u2014 and the government may not know how to handle the shock to its financial system.Over the last five years, Chinese investors have plowed at least $2.8 trillion into buying such funds from banks alone. After quintupling since 2011, these investments, known as wealth management products, now total an amount roughly equal to more than one-third of the country\u2019s annual economic output. Their growth has increased as China\u2019s economy has slowed.That is just the funds distributed by banks. Reliable data on wealth management products sold by other types of firms, like State Gold Treasure, is hard to come by.The problem for China is that a big chunk of the money is going into troubled industries like construction and real estate. Further slowdowns in those areas could result in major blowups.Banks also increasingly use the funds to raise money, instead of more stable deposits. The extra investment cash allows banks to make loans at a much faster clip than their deposits alone would allow. But if investors suddenly demanded their money back, banks could be in a financial bind.The Chinese government so far has stepped in to stop big meltdowns of wealth management products, to avert ripple effects and forestall investor anger. But not all investors have been spared.Li Wenyuan, a doctor in Beijing, says she invested almost $140,000 last year in a wealth management product linked to a steel company. After the company ran into difficulty, she was repaid less than $2,000. She had planned to use the entire original amount to send her son to a high school in Canada, where the air is cleaner and he would have a chance to improve his English.\u201cIt\u2019s quite a big loss for my family,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are still able to provide for ourselves. Still, it\u2019s a lot of money and I doubt I will ever get it back. I am worried.\u201dWealth management products are part of a huge but shadowy system of unregulated investments and underground banks that many Chinese people depend on for the loans that keep their businesses humming. Increasingly, the debate inside and outside China is focusing on what will happen if that system falls apart \u2014 and how quickly the government might be able to respond.China\u2019s wealth management products are neither stocks nor bonds nor mutual funds. A typical wealth management product offers a fixed rate of return over a set period. Many Chinese investors treat them like bank savings deposits because many are sold by state-controlled banks that give the funds the appearance of government backing.Among the biggest issuers of wealth management products are hundreds of banks and other financial institutions in poor, inland provinces. These banks are under intense pressure from provincial political bosses to keep lending and help sustain big employers like state-owned enterprises, at a time when the entire country\u2019s economy is slowing.To raise money for large-scale lending, banks have ramped up issuance. They sold 187,000 separate wealth management products by the end of last year, up 56 percent from a year earlier, according to official statistics.Technology has made it easier for firms other than banks, like State Gold Treasure, to sell the products online and through smartphone apps. \u201cIn the past, you\u2019d need to go to the bank to open an account or open an account at a certain fund company,\u201d said He Zhirui, a finance company worker in Beijing who also invests in wealth management products. \u201cNow, with the apps, you can simply upload your personal ID and purchase wealth management products right away online.\u201dChina\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.But the fund does not say who is guaranteeing the funds. The company declined interview requests and to make officials available for comment during a visit to its offices.The proliferation of wealth management products has drawn concern from regulators. In May, China\u2019s banking commission warned that the business was plagued with problems, including unauthorized products.Regulators are also considering new oversight rules. The goal, the commission said in response to questions, was to \u201cfacilitate a standards-based, healthy and sustainable development\u201d and to \u201cprevent risks.\u201dBut smaller banks combined are now almost as large as the four main banks combined. Wealth management products account for up to a third of money raised at many midsize and smaller banks.Mr. Li, the central bank adviser, and other officials and economists say the Chinese government has the resources to cover big losses if wealth management products fail. They also say China\u2019s increasingly tough enforcement of limits on sending money abroad will ensure that enough cash remains in the country in the event of a big failure.But some specialists in Chinese finance say that serious problems could appear faster than expected. They could also lurk in unexpected corners unnoticed by Chinese regulators, much less international investors.Owen Guo contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tesla\u2019s Big Loss Reflects Its Costly Ambitions", "Date": "2016-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTesla Motors said on Wednesday that its losses deepened in the second quarter, but the electric-car maker pledged to expand production and improve the profitability of its vehicles.The loss was only slightly more than in the first quarter, but it greatly exceeded analyst forecasts and raised the pressure on Tesla to improve its factory output.Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, said the automaker was on track to build 50,000 vehicles in the second half of the year \u2014 despite missing its production targets in the first six months.\u201cI think our core business is actually doing quite well,\u201d Mr. Musk said in a conference call with analysts.\u201cWe see demand being very strong for an average of 2,000 vehicles a week, and we are able to maintain production at that level,\u201d he said.But Tesla\u2019s chief financial officer, Jason Wheeler, admitted that production volumes in the first half of the year fell short of the company\u2019s stated targets. \u201cWe\u2019re deeply disappointed at our delivery numbers,\u201d Mr. Wheeler said.No one expects Tesla to turn a profit anytime soon, given the scope of its ambitious expansion plans in the production of electric cars as well as the batteries that power them. That may be why the company\u2019s stock barely ticked down in after-hours trading after the financial results were announced.What worries investors and shareholders is that Tesla so far has been unable to consistently keep pace with its growth plans.The company delivered about 14,000 vehicles in the second quarter, missing its target of 17,000.Concerns about production are pressing because next year Tesla must begin filling orders for its coming, less expensive Model 3 sedan, which will be priced around $35,000.The success of the company\u2019s first two vehicles, the Model S and X \u2014 vehicles that sell for $70,000 or more \u2014 remains the linchpin of Mr. Musk\u2019s grand vision for transforming Tesla into a sustainable-energy conglomerate.Steady growth in the car business has made it possible for Mr. Musk to broaden his reach into related industries.Earlier this week, Tesla said its independent board members had approved the idea of the company\u2019s acquiring SolarCity, in which Mr. Musk is a major investor. Tesla also is nearing completion of a new factory in Nevada that will produce batteries not only for its cars, but eventually for the storage of solar and wind energy for household use.In addition, Mr. Musk recently revealed plans to expand Tesla\u2019s product lineup in the future to include electric trucks and buses.But the expansion plans cannot mask the challenges Tesla faces on the assembly lines at its auto plant in California.\u201cWhile innovation and entrepreneurship are stronger than ever at Tesla,\u201d said Clement Thibault, an analyst with Investing.com, \u201cthe company\u2019s ability to smoothly and successfully translate these ambitions into mass produce \u2014 and more significantly serious revenues \u2014 remains unproven.\u201dIn May, Tesla raised about $1.7 billion in a public stock offering designed to finance its growth plans. How that money is spent is critical to Mr. Musk meeting his production targets, and satisfying the more than 300,000 preorders for the Model 3.The company is also facing a new level of scrutiny beyond its financial condition and long-term ambitions. In June, federal auto safety regulators opened an investigation into the safety of Tesla\u2019s Autopilot assisted-driving systems.The inquiry by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is focusing on a May 7 fatal accident in Florida of a Model S sedan with its Autopilot system engaged. Another agency, the National Transportation Safety Board, is also investigating the role of self-driving technology in the crash.The Securities and Exchange Commission is also looking into whether Tesla possibly violated securities laws by failing to disclose the fatal crash in documents related to its public stock offering on May 18.Mr. Musk and Tesla have said Autopilot is a lifesaving technology and have resisted calls by critics, including the magazine Consumer Reports, to disable the system.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Frank Ocean\u2019s \u2018Blonde\u2019 Amplifies Discord in the Music Business", "Date": "2016-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the release of the album last weekend, through an exclusive deal with Apple, has also roiled the industry, bringing to the surface long-simmering tensions that record companies have with streaming music services, and sometimes even with their own artists.At the same time, Universal\u2019s management decided to clamp down on the growing practice of releasing new music through exclusive deals with digital outlets like Apple Music and Tidal, a move that reasserted the label\u2019s control over the music its artists produce but also risked alienating top performers who benefit from such promotions.As the industry has struggled to interpret the fallout from \u201cBlonde,\u201d one thing is clear: In the streaming age, the complex series of relationships that the music business relies on to function have become anything but harmonious.\u201cThe unprecedented run of exclusives by digital music services has put a tremendous strain on the relationship between artists and their record companies,\u201d said Larry Miller, an associate professor of music business at New York University\u2019s Steinhardt School. \u201cWe are seeing that play out in public now.\u201dThe details of Mr. Ocean\u2019s exit from Def Jam are still unclear. But the story began to take shape when fans noticed that the label\u2019s name was nowhere to be found in the credits for \u201cBlonde.\u201d That album had come out just a day after the release of Mr. Ocean\u2019s \u201cEndless,\u201d a 46-minute \u201cvisual album,\u201d also an Apple Music exclusive.Despite its idiosyncratic format, \u201cEndless\u201d \u2014 one long streaming film, whose songs (different from those on \u201cBlonde\u201d) were not available separately \u2014 fulfilled Mr. Ocean\u2019s contractual obligations to Def Jam, enabling him to release \u201cBlonde\u201d through Apple without any involvement from the label, according to three people with knowledge of Mr. Ocean\u2019s deal who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly. The financial arrangement between Mr. Ocean and Apple is not known. Apple, Def Jam and a representative for Mr. Ocean\u2019s managers all declined to comment.It was still not known whether a CD version of \u201cBlonde\u201d would be made widely available, and if so, what company would handle its distribution now that Mr. Ocean is no longer on the Def Jam roster. (In another twist to the unusual release of \u201cBlonde,\u201d a relatively small number of CDs were included with copies of a printed publication called Boys Don\u2019t Cry that were given away for a limited time in pop-up stores in New York and three other cities.)It follows a year of deal-making by streaming music companies like Apple and Tidal focused on exclusive album releases. Used by the streaming outlets to attract attention and subscribers, these arrangements \u2014 in which an album is available on only one service for a limited period, usually a week or two \u2014 have also been viewed by artists as ways to finance new projects, since they often involve a significant financial commitment from the streaming service to pay for videos or other forms of promotion, according to music and talent executives who have negotiated the deals.Over the last year, major albums by Beyonc\u00e9, Drake, Kanye West, Dr. Dre, Rihanna, Future and DJ Khaled were released first through exclusive streaming deals of various kinds. Apple has carved out a particular role in paying for videos by stars like Drake, the Weeknd and Taylor Swift.But deals like these have also often irritated fans, since they sequester music on a particular subscription-based service \u2014 even if only for a limited time. Record labels also often dislike them because they limit sales and frequently lead to piracy.They are also seen as examples of digital services interfering in the labels\u2019 relationships with artists, a connection that in decades past was absolute but has already been chipped away by declining record sales and the rise of the concert business as a major source of revenue for artists.The tide may be turning against exclusives, at least from the perspective of the labels. After the release of Mr. Ocean\u2019s album, Lucian Grainge, the chairman of Universal Music Group, sent a private memo to top executives at the company\u2019s labels calling for an end to long-term exclusive deals with a single service, according to a person who has seen the memo but spoke on the condition of anonymity because it was an internal document. Yet that edict may still leave the company plenty of room to negotiate more limited deals with digital services. A spokesman for Universal declined to comment.Executives at two major record labels said that in recent weeks Spotify, which has resisted exclusives, had told them that it had instituted a policy that music that had benefited from such deals on other services would not receive the same level of promotion once it arrived on Spotify; such music may not be as prominently featured or included in as many playlists, said these executives, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss private negotiations. Spotify declined to comment.Others in the music world have called for a truce between labels and digital services when it comes to online distribution, particularly when it concerns young artists like Mr. Ocean, who at 28 has no experience with the record industry before its digital disruption.\u201cArtists want to be fully empowered to control their careers, and they don\u2019t want the old school to tell them what to do,\u201d said Doug Davis, a music industry lawyer. \u201cUltimately there has to be a resolution between the major labels and the artists that allows them to control their destinies and cash in on the financial opportunities that are out there.\u201dBecause of an editing error, a picture caption on Friday with an article about a rift in the music industry that was brought to light by the release of Frank Ocean\u2019s new album \u201cBlonde\u201d misidentified the source of one music video image in some copies. The image, of Frank Ocean sitting next to a car with a drink in his hand, is from the video \u201cNikes,\u201d not from the album \u201cEndless.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The One That Got Away: How an Elusive Fish Captured a New York Town", "Date": "2016-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySCHENECTADY, N.Y. \u2014 It began, as so many eyebrow-raising stories do, with a tale about a fish.\u201cIt looks like a dinosaur, a prehistoric predator,\u201d Mr. Canavan, 20, said. His hunch that it wasn\u2019t supposed to be in Iroquois Lake, in the center of the perhaps aspirationally named Central Park, clashed with his catch-and-release credo. He let the creature thrashing at the end of his line go. \u201cLet it swim another day,\u201d he said.But just as all fish stories bulge and warp over time, the tale of Mr. Canavan\u2019s strange catch has since morphed into an epic. Along the way, it has hooked the imaginations of this industrial, upstate city of slightly over 65,000.Before Mr. Canavan freed the gar on July 17, he took a photograph of the fish that was some 1,200 miles away from its natural habitat to post on social media. His mother, who works at Union College here, shared the image on Facebook. A professor at the college spotted it and contacted the United States Geological Survey, which notified the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, according to Mr. Canavan.Agents from the department happened to be in the area, and knew right away that the gar should not be in the lake, said Chris VanMaaren, the agency\u2019s fisheries manager for the region. Mr. VanMaaren believes it may have been an aquarium pet, dumped into the water after growing too large. But in liberating it, its owner introduced an invasive species, an apex predator with a taste for sunfish that could harm the local ecosystem. Parkgoers also worried that it could take off a toe, though this seems more urban lore than anything based on scientific fact.So on July 27, two environmental protection agents plied a johnboat through the lake\u2019s waters in search of the gar. The flat-bottomed vessel was equipped with a device that sends out an electrical pulse designed to stun, not kill, fish. But after hours of work \u2014 as seems to be the way with mysterious aquatic sightings the world over \u2014 the long, thin gar was nowhere to be found among the stunned sunfish the agents collected, all of which were briskly revived and released. \u201cThey don\u2019t receive the electricity as well as a shorter, fatter fish,\u201d Mr. VanMaaren said. \u201cThey are typically hard to corner, so to speak.\u201dWith just one gar on the loose, and unlikely to survive an upstate winter, the agency had no plans to try again, Mr. VanMaaren said. (If the gar was caught, it would most likely be preserved in ethanol and exhibited at the New York State Museum in Albany, according to state officials. Adoption would be considered, however, if there were appropriate offers.)Enter the mayor of Schenectady, Gary McCarthy. He decided to take things into his own hands and pockets, offering a $100 reward from his wallet to anyone who caught the gar. \u201cIt\u2019s been elusive,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said.Enter the townspeople. Since Mr. McCarthy\u2019s offer, the park, moribund even on an August day, according to residents, has been packed. Its shoreline bristles with anglers of all ages. At Goldstock\u2019s Sporting Goods, in nearby Scotia, weekly sales of rods have quintupled to 25 a week. \u201cI love it, are you kidding?\u201d an owner, Mike Kausch, 61, said, referring to the gar. \u201cI should put one out there every couple days!\u201dThe fishermen and women seem driven by their own dreams. Liam Berry, 9, said he would use his winnings to take his family on a trip. He was disappointed to learn that gars prefer raw chicken and bacon over the three dozen lures he brought. Nearby, his competition, David Bryk, also 9, was fishing to finance his dream pet \u2014 a frog. Its name? \u201cCarlos, of course.\u201dOther people sat on the benches around the lake and quietly rooted for the gar. \u201cIt\u2019s not given fair odds in a little rinky-dink hole like this,\u201d Lisa Monfils, 46, said as her son, Alex Rossler, 12, reeled in yet another sunny in his search for the gar.As the hot summer weeks have wound on, a strange new twist has emerged from the pond: How is it possible, with scores of fishers dangling gar favorites like chicken livers and crispy baitfish at all hours of the day, that sunfish keep falling for the lure, but the gar has eluded what seems to be an entire town?Sitting in his rocking chair at Wiggly Worm Bait and Fishing Supply, in Ballston Lake, a few miles away, William Ingles, the shop\u2019s 92-year-old founder, had a theory: \u201cYou say, \u2018Wait a minute. All of a sudden we got 30, 40, 50 ones out there trying to catch this fish, and all of a sudden nobody\u2019s catching it?\u2019\u201d Perhaps, he mused, the gar was already gone. \u201cWhat would you do if someone caught the fish, and ate the fish, and everyone\u2019s still out there fishing?\u201dNear him a foot-thick encyclopedia of fish sat open to the entry for alligator gar (lepisosteus spatula), prepared for the daily onslaught of customer questions. (\u201cThe alligator gar has been under siege for much of the 20th century,\u201d the entry reads, under the \u201cill advised notion of ridding the water of gamefish-killing monsters.\u201d)As another week of the alligator gar\u2019s continued evasion loomed, the fish tale came full circle. Mr. Canavan said on Friday night that he was at Iroquois Lake that afternoon when a man caught the fish. \u201cMy leader was hanging from its mouth,\u201d he said. That is how he knew it was the same fish.Efforts to reach the mayor about the reward late on Friday were unsuccessful.Christopher Mele contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

(The company added Mongolian to its first 10 languages; 14 more are coming.)Mongol Post has long labored to deliver the mail, even in the absence of snow, rain or gloom of night. Many Mongolians still lead nomadic lives, and some have to collect mail from post-office boxes dozens of miles from home.

{"Headline": "Robert Rosencrans, Who Helped Propel C-Span, Dies at 89", "Date": "2016-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRobert Rosencrans, a daring cable television industry pioneer who was instrumental in creating C-Span, the unfiltered public affairs network that faithfully covers government proceedings and civic events, died on Wednesday in Greenwich, Conn. He was 89.The cause was complications of a stroke, his son Richard said.\u201cThere probably wouldn\u2019t be a C-Span without him,\u201d Brian Lamb, the network\u2019s founder and executive chairman, said in an interview on Thursday.C-Span, a private, nonprofit, industry-financed service, began as the Cable-Satellite Public Affairs Network in 1979, at a time when fewer than one in five homes was wired for cable.Today it comprises several television and radio channels and a web presence, offering a variety of gavel-to-gavel coverage of Congress, presidential campaign events and other public affairs programming, including lectures and forums, book reviews, viewer call-in programs and interviews.After Mr. Lamb pitched the concept to cable operators, Mr. Rosencrans wrote a $25,000 check on the spot and persuaded other industry executives to pony up $450,000 in seed money to start the network. He became C-Span\u2019s founding chairman.Mr. Rosencrans, joined by equally audacious engineers, investors and programmers, perceived that cable\u2019s potential was in exclusive programming, not merely serving viewers in sparsely populated areas beyond the reach of broadcasters.In conjunction with Madison Square Garden, he drove the creation of a sports channel featuring Knicks and Rangers games. When general programming was added, it evolved into the USA Network. (The MSG Network still exists separately as part of Madison Square Garden.)Investing nearly $100,000, his Columbia Cable Systems was credited with being the first cable operator to install a satellite receiving station in 1975, to deliver the Muhammad Ali-Joe Frazier championship fight from Manila to its Florida subscribers.On Thursday, the National Cable Telecommunications Association said Mr. Rosencrans\u2019s early cable systems were \u201cprecursors to today\u2019s life-changing television and internet infrastructure.\u201dRobert Morris Rosencrans was born on March 26, 1927, in New York City. His father, Alvin, was an immigrant from Austria who imported ornaments for women\u2019s hats. His mother, the former Eva Greene, immigrated from Russia and became a dress designer. Some of her creations, including an inaugural gown worn by the first lady Mamie Eisenhower, were credited to her sister-in-law and partner, Nettie Rosenstein, under whose label the fashions were sold.Mr. Rosencrans was raised in Woodmere, on Long Island, and planned to enroll in Dartmouth but decided to stay closer to home after his older brother died in combat during the final months of World War II. After enlisting and serving stateside in the Army Air Forces, he majored in economics at Columbia University and graduated in 1949 with bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees. (A fan of the Giants baseball team, he attended the 1951 game at the Polo Grounds in which Bobby Thomson\u2019s \u201cshot heard \u2019round the world\u201d home run won the pennant.)He is survived by his wife, the former Marjorie Meyers; three sons, Richard, Ron and Robert; a daughter, Robbie Heidinger; and 11 grandchildren.After Mr. Rosencrans had brief, unsatisfying stints in retailing, a friend referred him to Box Office Television, which was hoping to help movie theaters compete with television by offering closed-circuit programming, like live theater, and Harlem Globetrotter basketball and Notre Dame football games. The company, whose investors included the comedian Sid Caesar, also produced programming for hotels.After Box Office Television bought TelePrompTer in 1956 to expand its closed-circuit programming, Mr. Rosencrans received a call from a cable system operator in Casper, Wyo., who wanted to feed a boxing match to his subscribers.\u201cCable system?\u201d he recalled asking. \u201cWhat\u2019s a cable system?\u201dA quick study, he recruited other investors and in 1961, began buying up small-town systems, brokered the 1975 fight broadcast (which was credited with persuading Time Inc. not to pull the plug on HBO); approached Madison Square Garden to start MSG; helped organize, with Kay Koplovitz, the USA Network, which was the first basic cable channel distributed by satellite; offered Robert L. Johnson a few hours of Friday-night satellite time, which became Black Entertainment Television, or BET; and then answered Mr. Lamb\u2019s invitation to start C-Span.Mr. Rosencrans, a political liberal, invested in C-Span with his Columbia Cable partner, Kenneth S. Gunter, a conservative. In 1977 he said that he saw the channel as a public service and a promotional opportunity.\u201cI was tired of knocking on congressmen\u2019s doors to explain what cable television was,\u201d he recalled. \u201cSo if nothing else, I thought it would put cable on the map in Washington.\u201dHe was also an early investor in PublicAffairs, a publisher of literary fiction and topical nonfiction founded in 1997 by Peter Osnos.His Columbia Cable evolved into UA-Columbia Cablevision. He was dismissed when the company was divided in 1984, but then started Columbia International, another operator, which he sold in 1995 for an estimated $600 million.Given his success, he recalled in 2005 in an interview with the alumni magazine Columbia College Today, he began somewhat inauspiciously. Among the programming produced by Box Office Television were corporate infomercials, including one in which Robert S. McNamara, then a Ford Motor Company executive, introduced the Edsel.\u201cMcNamara and the Edsel,\u201d Mr. Rosencrans mused. \u201cGood thing I don\u2019t believe in omens.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Japan, Seeking to Regain Manufacturing Might, Bets on Aerospace", "Date": "2016-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGIFU, Japan \u2014 Kato Manufacturing, based in the blue-collar enclave of Gifu Prefecture, in central Japan, is a microcosm of the country\u2019s industrial evolution.The family-run metal shop, which was started 128 years ago, originally made simple farming tools for what was then a largely agrarian society. When Japan morphed into a manufacturing giant, churning out automobiles and electronics for the world, Kato supplied the metallic equivalent of skeletons: sculpted frames and housings that gave products their shape.Now, as Japan aggressively tries to regain some of its manufacturing might in the face of competition from lower-cost countries like China, Kato is producing parts for airplanes. The company recently installed new metalworking machinery and hired a half-dozen workers to accommodate orders from domestic aircraft makers.\u201cAirplanes, rockets \u2014 they\u2019re a symbol for manufacturing,\u201d said Keiji Kato, the company\u2019s president and the fourth generation of the family\u2019s leadership at the firm.Kato Manufacturing is a small piece of Japan\u2019s vast bet on aerospace, a multibillion-dollar government effort to replace lost manufacturing jobs and to lift up the country\u2019s industrial heartland, centered in Gifu and neighboring prefectures. Sony and Panasonic have closed consumer electronics factories here in the last decade. While the car industry has been more resilient, officials worry that the region\u2019s industrial base is becoming dangerously narrow.Developing aerospace is more than just a bid for economic growth. The most public symbol of this effort, the Mitsubishi Regional Jet, is being billed as an instrument of national pride and industrial renewal, a chance for Japan Inc. to restore some of its former glory. At a short test flight of the aircraft from an airport in Nagoya, Japan\u2019s economy minister declared \u201cthe start of a new era for Japan\u2019s aviation industry.\u201dBut breaking into the aerospace sector will be difficult. The country last produced a passenger aircraft more than 40 years ago, at the end of the propeller era. And Japan has never produced a civilian jet plane, although it has assembled some military models.The industry, which requires huge start-up costs, is dominated by a handful of established behemoths. Embraer of Brazil and Bombardier of Canada have long operated as a virtual duopoly in the midsize passenger jet market that Mitsubishi is targeting. Chinese and Russian manufacturers also recently tried to grab a share of the business, with mixed results.Taxpayer funds are on the line. The Japanese government is underwriting about a third of the development costs for the Mitsubishi jet, which were initially projected at $1.5 billion but are likely to rise after repeated delays.\u201cIt\u2019s a miracle this project came about at all in this day and age,\u201d said Yasuo Unakami, an analyst at the Japan Finance Corporation, a government-backed research and investment group. \u201cIf Japan succeeds at this, it could be a huge new industry. But the short-term hurdles are high.\u201dFor a country proud of its manufacturing heritage, the fact that no modern passenger airplane is marked \u201cmade in Japan\u201d rankles.Japan was banned from making planes after its defeat in World War II. Although the prohibition ended decades ago, efforts to revive the industry stumbled. One project, a propeller plane called the YS-11, built by Mitsubishi and other big names in the 1960s and \u201970s, was a commercial flop.Even so, enthusiasts still celebrate the short-lived plane. When the last ones were retired from service by airlines a few years ago, newspapers and television news programs were full of nostalgic tributes.The Mitsubishi Regional Jet, for which Kato is making parts, is drawing on a similar sentiment. At the unveiling of a prototype in 2014, a film showed workers holding signs with messages like \u201cMade in Japan,\u201d \u201cThis is our M.R.J.\u201d and \u201cM.R.J. renovates Japan.\u201d\u201cThe world is full of products that are made in Japan, but unfortunately there hasn\u2019t been a domestically made passenger plane in about 40 years,\u201d Hideaki Omiya, the chairman of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the plane\u2019s developer, said at the time. \u201cThis is a long-held dream.\u201dThe Mitsubishi jet is the most prominent of several Japanese aircraft projects underway. Honda Aircraft Company, a subsidiary of Honda Motor, is developing a light jet for five or six passengers, but it is being built in North Carolina.Mitsubishi considers its new passenger jet the logical extension of a business that has grown to encompass satellite-carrying rockets and large-scale subcontracting work on Boeing jets. The company says it has an edge in technology, in particular lightweight composite materials. The materials, Mitsubishi says, will make the new jet more fuel efficient than those of its rivals.But making parts and subsystems to order is one thing. Organizing the hugely complex task of assembling a modern jet is another.The delays to the project have added to costs and undercut technological advantages by giving competitors like Embraer time to catch up. Mitsubishi\u2019s first test flight took place last year, three years behind schedule. The first delivery had originally been planned for early 2014, but is now expected in late 2018.Mitsubishi declined to disclose its latest cost estimates for the project, but it said it would cover any overruns without relying on additional support from public funds. \u201cWe will recover our investment costs in the long run,\u201d it said in a statement.Despite the challenges, Mitsubishi is a central piece of the government\u2019s plans to nurture a broader industry and to provide a lift to the sagging economy. Aircraft manufacturing now generates about 1.5 trillion yen, or about $15 billion, in revenue for Japanese businesses, according to the Society of Japanese Aerospace Companies, an industry lobby. That is up by half from five years ago, though it is still just a small fraction of the auto industry\u2019s sales.Japan\u2019s efforts extend along the supply chain. C-Astac, a government organization, helps small-business owners break into aerospace, holding seminars to explain the certification and grant process.Subcontractors like Kato Manufacturing are benefiting from start-up cash and relaxed regulations on things like factory floor space to accommodate new machinery. Mr. Kato said he received a government grant of \u00a515 million to buy new equipment.His new team is a mix of seasoned factory workers and novice recruits. Ryoji Soga, a young-looking 72, retired seven years ago but decided to come back when he heard the company needed experienced hands to produce new kinds of aircraft parts.Mr. Soga said he was glad to have a good-paying industrial job. \u201cIt\u2019s better than waving a flag at a road construction site or cleaning toilets at a supermarket,\u201d he said.A picture caption on Tuesday with an article about Japan\u2019s vast bet on aerospace misidentified the type of plane shown. It is a propeller plane, not a jet plane.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Legislators Take Aim at New Jersey Student Loan Program\u2019s Tough Tactics", "Date": "2016-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAlmost a dozen people with harrowing experiences with New Jersey\u2019s controversial student loan program testified on Monday before state lawmakers, detailing its aggressive collection tactics and onerous terms that some said had ruined them financially.\u201cHesaa destroyed my family,\u201d Tracey Timony, referring to the state\u2019s Higher Education Student Assistance Authority, said at a hearing before the Higher Education and Legislative Oversight Committees of the New Jersey State Senate.Ms. Timony had co-signed on her daughter\u2019s loans totaling $140,000. After her daughter defaulted, Ms. Timony was sued by one of the agency\u2019s collection firms and has since declared bankruptcy to get more manageable monthly payments.The agency charges higher interest rates than similar federal programs, the investigation found, and has strikingly broad collection powers. If borrowers fall behind on payments, the agency can garnish wages, seize tax refunds and revoke professional licenses, all without getting a court judgment.State legislators, who on Monday pushed forward two measures that would give a break to borrowers in the program, said they were troubled by the agency\u2019s tactics.\u201cWe need to end this program, start over from scratch and find ways of providing assistance for students so that they can get an education without it bankrupting them,\u201d said Senator Robert M. Gordon, a Democrat from northern New Jersey and the chairman of the Legislative Oversight Committee.\u201cWe\u2019re disappointed that the agency didn\u2019t show up,\u201d Stephen M. Sweeney, a Democrat and president of the State Senate, said before the hearing.As ProPublica and The Times have detailed, repayment of the state loans cannot be adjusted based on income, and borrowers \u2014 alongside their co-signers \u2014 are given few breaks, even when facing disability or death.A college graduate who defaulted on his loans after he learned he had cancer and lost his job was sued by the agency for more than $250,000. A mother who co-signed on her son\u2019s loans is continuing to pay off his debt, even after he was murdered.Several speakers at the hearing demanded the agency provide better assistance programs for struggling borrowers, specifically a rehabilitation program to help bring defaulted loans current.\u201cThe design of any responsible student loan program must address the needs of the most vulnerable borrowers,\u201d argued David McMillin, a lawyer with Legal Services of New Jersey, a nonprofit organization that provides free legal assistance to low-income state residents.Over the past five years, the agency has sued an increasing number of borrowers. In 2010, the agency filed fewer than 100 lawsuits against borrowers and their co-signers; last year, the number of suits rose to over 1,600.New Jersey\u2019s loan program is financed through tax-exempt bonds, which require the agency to keep losses to a minimum.\u201cWere Hesaa not to utilize the tools provided by the Legislature, we would not be fulfilling our statutory requirements or our fiduciary duties to our bondholders,\u201d Marcia Karrow, the agency\u2019s chief of staff, said in response to previous questions from ProPublica and The Times.After the hearing, the Higher Education Committee passed a measure that would forgive the loans of deceased borrowers, sending the bill to the Budget and Appropriations Committee for further consideration.Under the proposed law, parents or guardians who co-sign loans for their children would no longer be held responsible for the loans if their children die. After the death of a borrower, a parent or guardian would have 120 days to provide the agency with a death certificate to get the loan forgiven.\u201cIt will help the agency not just automatically destroy lives,\u201d said State Senator Sandra B. Cunningham, a Democrat from Jersey City, who is the chairwoman of the Higher Education Committee. \u201cIf it goes through the court system, there will have to be checks and balances with it that they don\u2019t have now.\u201dAnnie Waldman is a reporter for ProPublica, an independent, nonprofit newsroom that produces investigative journalism in the public interest.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "With Uzbekistan\u2019s Ruler Gravely Ill, Questions Arise on Succession", "Date": "2016-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLater on Monday, Ferghana, an Uzbek website banned at home since 2005, reported that Mr. Karimov had died in the afternoon, citing sources outside the government. The report was widely repeated by independent news outlets in Russia.There was no official confirmation, however, and Russian outlets, such as the state-run RIA Novosti agency, quoted unidentified government officials in Uzbekistan as saying that the president remained alive and in stable condition.The nightly news on the main Uzbekistan television channel did not refer to the story at all, mentioning the president as the active leader.Under the Constitution, upon Mr. Karimov\u2019s death, the head of Uzbekistan\u2019s Senate would run the country for three months to allow for new presidential elections. Presidential elections in Uzbekistan have always come with a known outcome.With no son or obvious successor, the announcement that Mr. Karimov, 78, was gravely ill, or perhaps dead, immediately focused attention on who might succeed him.\u201cThis is the question that worries everybody now,\u201d Mr. Kislov said. No successor is likely to replace the secret police as the central power in the country, he predicted.\u201cIslam Karimov has built a very stable system of power, which is based on the power of the special services,\u201d Mr. Kislov said in an interview. \u201cRegardless of who is the main person in the country, the real power will be with the special services.\u201dAmid the conflicting accounts on Monday, there was no indication of public unrest or even disquiet in Uzbekistan, the largest country in Central Asia by far, with more than 31 million people.The way the announcement was made, however, indicated that Mr. Karimov was in grave condition. For the first time ever, the government issued a statement about his health, reporting on Sunday that the president had been hospitalized without providing any details.Then on Monday, his younger daughter, Lola Karimova-Tillyaeva, 38, the Uzbek ambassador to Unesco in Paris, posted her announcement on Facebook in Uzbek, Russian and English.\u201cI would like to write here about the sad events that befell our family last weekend,\u201d she wrote. \u201cMy father was hospitalized after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage on Saturday morning, and is now receiving treatment in an intensive-care unit.\u201dMs. Karimova-Tillyaeva said that her father was in stable condition and that it was too early for a prognosis. She asked for privacy, prayers and for \u201ceveryone to refrain from any speculation.\u201dThe announcement prompted just that, however, given that Mr. Karimov has avoided appointing a successor.Under investigation in Europe and the United States on suspicion of accepting hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes in connection with telecom licenses in Uzbekistan, Ms. Karimova disappeared from public view.In 2014, it was revealed that she had been under house arrest for at least a year, with various associates arrested and jailed. She remains at home under guard.Mr. Karimov\u2019s wife, Tatyana Karimova, and Rustam Inoyatov, the head of the secret police, are expected to be hugely influential in the choice of a successor, but are unlikely to take such a public role themselves.Prime Minister Shavkat Mirziyoev, seen as a Kremlin ally, is a more likely consensus candidate within a small ruling circle, as is Rustam Azimov, a deputy prime minister and finance minister.Mr. Karimov, first appointed to run Uzbekistan in 1989 when it was still part of the Soviet Union, won an election to continue as president after it collapsed in 1991.The massacre prompted Europe and the United States to distance themselves from Mr. Karimov for a time, and the United States imposed military sanctions. But Uzbekistan was a crucial supplier for Western troops propping up the government in Afghanistan against the Taliban, so ties were restored within a few years and remain stable.\u201cKarimov is known for being one of the wiliest, most ruthless authoritarian rulers, not only in the post-Soviet space but in the entire world,\u201d said Steve Swerdlow, the director of Central Asia research at Human Rights Watch.The stability of Uzbekistan, the crossroads of Central Asia, is important to Russia, China and the United States. Some Uzbeks have turned up among the Islamic State fighters in the Middle East, but they are not considered a serious threat at home.In Moscow, Dmitry S. Peskov, the presidential spokesman, wished Mr. Karimov a speedy recovery. He said it was not appropriate to speculate about the future of the country should Mr. Karimov die, according to the Interfax news agency.Mr. Karimov has kept some distance from Moscow as well as from his neighbors, yet rules in a manner learned from his past as a Soviet official. Every year, for example, an estimated million Uzbeks are forced to leave their regular lives for a month to help with the public cotton harvest.In another annual rite, Mr. Karimov shows up at the public celebrations of independence day on Sept. 1 to glad-hand the crowd and perform a traditional national dance. It is, analysts noted, his way of showing the public that he is in good health.Advertisement"}

This is one of the most basic ways to do it.\u201dAdding that parks in poor neighborhoods have long decayed and struggled to get resources, the mayor said, \u201cThe people who needed it the most got the least.\u201dBesides St. Mary\u2019s Park, the other parks include Highbridge Park in Upper Manhattan; Betsy Head Park in Brownsville, Brooklyn; Astoria Park in Queens; and Freshkills Park on Staten Island. The money will be spent on improvements like new baseball and soccer fields, running tracks and hiking trails.Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, said about 750,000 people, or nearly one in 10 New Yorkers, lived within a short walk of the five parks.The parks commissioner, Mitchell J. Silver, said the money would be spent over the next four years. He said officials would consult with local communities to ask for their ideas on how to fix up the parks.\u201cThis is a good step, but there are probably a few dozen parks that need this level of investment,\u201d said Adrian Benepe, a senior vice president of the Trust for Public Land, a national advocacy group for parks and open spaces, who was the parks commissioner under Mayor Michael R.

{"Headline": "Rent-to-Own Homes: A Win-Win for Landlords, a Risk for Struggling Tenants", "Date": "2016-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCOLUMBIA, S.C. \u2014 Alex Szkaradek is a landlord who seems to have the best of both worlds.Mr. Szkaradek, 36, collects rent, but he never has to pay for repairs on any of the more than 5,500 homes \u2014 many of them rundown \u2014 that his firm manages across the country.The firm, Vision Property Management, blurs the line between what it means to be a renter and a homeowner. These companies do not offer regular leases or mortgages \u2014 they offer \u201crent to own\u201d contracts on homes that require tenants to make all repairs, no matter how big or small.Mr. Szkaradek says Vision, a leader in the fast-growing market, is bringing the dream of homeownership to Americans who lack good credit or are too poor to qualify for mortgages.In many communities, housing prices have recovered from the financial crisis. At the bottom end, however, banks have all but stopped making loans for homes worth less than $100,000, leaving millions of people with few options.But these rent-to-own agreements reside in a gray area of the law. An examination by The New York Times of contracts and court filings, as well as interviews with housing lawyers and more than a dozen of Vision\u2019s customers across the country, found that these deals are risky, lack consumer protections and may not be enforceable in some states.Most tenants walk away with nothing, having sunk money for rent and repairs into homes they had once hoped to own. Others faced surprise evictions, having signed a contract that did not disclose what repairs were needed, yet set a deadline for making sure the home was up to local housing code. As different tenants move in and out of the same property over the course of years, many homes fall further into disrepair.When Donna Thomas signed a lease for a Cincinnati home with Vision, she said she was not told that it had unresolved building code violations and a standing order from the city to remain vacant.Samuel Rankin thought he was starting fresh when he and his two daughters moved out of a 1970s trailer home into a three-bedroom Vision rental home in Alexander, Ark. But he soon discovered that the house, located just outside Little Rock, had no heat, no water and major problems with its sewage system that led to nearly $10,000 in repairs.Ms. Thomas\u2019s and Mr. Rankin\u2019s cases are not isolated, The Times found. It is difficult to measure the size of the rent-to-own housing market. Nobody tracks activity, and few rent-to-own agreements end in actual purchases, so they tend not to be recorded.Across the country, however, dozens of smaller firms offer to lease cheap homes with options to buy, such as Vision does. Entrepreneurs conduct how-to seminars at conferences for small landlords hoping to strike it rich. And housing lawyers in cities including Detroit, Philadelphia and Columbus, Ohio, say they are seeing an uptick in disputes involving rent-to-own transactions.Several big Wall Street companies like the Blackstone Group and Home Partners of America offer programs through which people can buy the homes they are renting. But those homes are often relatively new or recently renovated, and worth well over $100,000. The deals at the lower end of the market are the ones that worry housing advocates.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing an influx in these contracts,\u201d said Katarina Karac, a city lawyer for Columbus, who is involved in one case the city has against Vision. \u201cIt looks like a landlord-tenant relationship, except instead of having the landlord take care of the property, they are putting that obligation on the tenant,\u201d she added.Every home rented by Vision comes \u201cas is\u201d and has strict contractual terms that require a tenant to pay for any repairs, no matter how big. Renters are given a few months to deal with any outstanding building code violations and to make the homes habitable.In interviews, as well as in court documents, customers said they were confused by the contracts\u2019 terms and requirements, and were not sure whether they were owners or renters.They signed their leases and put down an initial payment to reserve the right to buy the house. Unlike most typical home purchases, rent-to-own contracts have no requirement to obtain an independent home inspection. The customers contend they were not informed of outstanding issues with Vision homes, many of which the company had bought for $10,000 or less.Tenants who are evicted during the tenure of these seven-year contracts walk away empty-handed, receiving no credit for money spent on repairs or renovations.Rent-to-own leases are similar in many ways to contracts for deeds: long-term, high-interest installment contracts that call for the resident to make monthly payments to the seller. Unlike a contract for deed \u2014 which typically lasts 30 years, at the end of a Vision contract, tenants still need to find financing to complete the deal. The buyer does not receive legal title to the home until the last payment is made.Still, contract for deeds are at least subject to basic consumer-lending regulations like the Federal Truth in Lending Act, which requires firms to detail how much interest they are charging and how many payments prospective buyers must make before they own the house.In most states, landlords are required to keep the homes and apartments that they rent in habitable condition. Some legal experts said contracts like the ones used by Vision could violate that requirement.A new breed of landlord is blurring the line between renter and homeowner, but these firms claim they\u2019re bringing homeownership to those who can\u2019t get mortgages.Judith Fox, a professor of law at the University of Notre Dame, said that in most states landlord obligations cannot be waived. \u201cIf it\u2019s a lease and they are claiming that none of the landlord-tenant obligations apply, then I would argue they have to adhere to federal truth in lending rules.\u201dShe added, \u201cYou can\u2019t have it both ways.\u201dVision, based here, buys homes spread across 24 states through nearly two dozen limited liability companies, all with different names like MI Seven, OH Seven and Kaja Holdings.The firm advertises its properties on its website, through Craigslist and in handwritten signs posted on the lawns of properties promoting low monthly rents. Negotiations are done via phone or email, and prospective tenants are given a code to a lockbox on the door to inspect properties.In-depth inspections can be difficult with the power turned off in a home before it is bought, however. Last September, Ms. Thomas signed a lease for a home on McHenry Avenue in Cincinnati that required her to bring the property into a habitable condition within three months. Vision\u2019s contract offered to sell her the home for $27,000.It was only after signing the contract that Ms. Thomas, 38, learned of at least three unaddressed property-code violations and about $5,000 in unpaid fines. She then sought a lawyer to get out of her contract and recover her $600 initial payment.\u201cIt was like pulling teeth to get them to give me $600 of my money back,\u201d Ms. Thomas said.Within days, Vision found another tenant, a couple who moved into the same house. None of the building code violations had been addressed.Edward Cunningham, a Cincinnati building department official, said the city had issued more than 20 notices to Vision on the property. \u201cCommunications have been very poor in this case,\u201d he said.There are $13,250 in unpaid citations on the McHenry home and the city has referred the matter to a collection agency. Vision bought the house from Fannie Mae for $9,300 in 2014.Mr. Szkaradek, of Vision, said the firm had a small team that worked with municipal officials to address outstanding code violations. In subsequent emails, he said that Vision offered \u201ca full and unconditional refund\u201d to tenants within the first 30 days of a contract and that the firm had consulted with regulatory counsel in drafting its contract.\u201cOur goal is to put people into houses and turn renters into homeowners,\u201d Mr. Szkaradek said during an interview at Vision\u2019s offices in a two-story building on the outskirts of Columbia, S.C. He declined to comment on specific cases.Mr. Szkaradek refers to Vision\u2019s seven-year contract as a \u201chybrid lease\u201d that enables renters to build up \u201cimplied equity\u201d with each monthly rent payment. Vision works with clients to help them through the process of managing payments, he said.Vision, which does not provide financing for tenants to buy homes, pointed to Mr. Rankin as one client it has worked with to help make a home livable.In October, Mr. Rankin moved into his home after signing a contract that valued the three-bedroom house at $38,000. There was no carpeting and no linoleum on the floors, and the walls were covered with what Mr. Rankin described as a tar-like substance. These issues seemed easily fixable, though, Mr. Rankin said, because he runs his own flooring company.But not even a craftsman like Mr. Rankin was prepared for the biggest problem with the house: a condemned septic tank that the local water department said needed to be upgraded.The cost to install a new sewerage system was more than $8,000, Mr. Rankin said. Vision helped him find a contractor to make the repairs, but it rolled the cost into a new contract that revalued the purchase price of the home to $60,000 and increased his monthly costs by $65, to $470 a month.\u201cFinancially, they kind of stuck it to me,\u201d Mr. Rankin said. But, he added, \u201cwhen you don\u2019t have any options and someone is willing to work with you, it\u2019s really a blessing.\u201dVision paid $10,760 to the Department of Housing and Urban Development for the house last July.\u201cIf you\u2019re doubling your money off of people who are scraping by and you\u2019re taking advantage of their vulnerability to enrich yourself, that is being predatory,\u201d said Beryl Satter, the author of the 2009 book \u201cFamily Properties,\u201d which chronicled the exploitation of black homeowners in Chicago.Nearly half of Vision\u2019s homes were bought from Fannie Mae, the government-backed mortgage firm, according to RealtyTrac.A number of tenants and former tenants interviewed said they had hoped to buy homes from Vision either by ultimately getting a mortgage or saving cash to buy a home outright. But other tenants expressed concern they would end up losing the home.That is what happened to Heidi Anderson, 45, whose two children and partner moved into a Vision house in Vassar, Mich., last fall. They spent the winter months without heat because the furnace had been submerged in water and no longer worked. The only thing they had to keep warm during a cold Michigan winter, she said, was an electric heater and a wood-burning stove in the kitchen.Ms. Anderson said she called Vision several times about the furnace, but nobody got back to her, so she stopped paying rent. In February, Vision filed a nonpayment proceeding, seeking the family\u2019s eviction and $3,100 in overdue rent. She sent a check to Vision, she added, but the company returned it, saying it was late.Days before Memorial Day weekend, the family moved out, before the formal eviction. They have since moved into another nearby home through a contract-for-deed deal. It was the best option available because, Ms. Anderson said, she still could not qualify for a mortgage.\u201cThere is a little bit of work, but mostly it\u2019s cosmetic,\u201d she said. \u201cThe furnace works.\u201dSusan Beachy contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

He got to know Mr. Brin and Mr. Page through a longtime friend, Anne Wojcicki, a founder of the genetics company 23andMe who was married to Mr. Brin.When Mr. Maris founded GV in 2009, some Silicon Valley investors were skeptical that a venture arm of a large corporation could become a major player in start-up investing. Corporate venture capital firms have traditionally had a spotty record of success.Mr. Maris has described how he pushed executives at Google to let him run GV as a traditional venture firm, with little input from corporate executives, so that it could compete with independent venture firms such as Benchmark and Sequoia Capital.In addition to Mr. Krane, GV has a dozen investment professionals and dozens of employees who advise start-ups on engineering, design, marketing and recruiting. The firm, which invests money provided by Alphabet, oversees around $2.4 billion.\u201cI don\u2019t think I could leave GV in a better place or in better hands,\u201d Mr. Maris said. \u201cI\u2019m excited for the team.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It has rotated a bit over the weeks, but regulars include the swimming titan Mark Spitz, the track star Carl Lewis and the gymnast Bart Conner and his \u201cPerfect 10\u201d wife, the Romanian-born Nadia Comaneci.For an American viewer, it is both odd and delightful to spot this ensemble in the same studio, on a wee-hours television show in Brazil. But the experience gets odder and more delightful once you start to listen.The host, Andre Rizek, is asking questions in Portuguese, and the guests, of course, are answering in English. So although everyone stands a few feet from one another, all of the interactions between host and guest have a brief delay, for interpretation, as though Rizek were actually somewhere in China. It\u2019s like a TV show staged at the United Nations.In fact, the show is filmed right in the middle of the wide, sloping and otherwise barren expanse that is the center of Olympic Park. Globo, one of the networks with the rights to broadcast the Games, built a studio there, a three-story futuristic stack that looks like the home of George Jetson.12 PhotosThe set of \u201c\u00c9 campe\u00e3o,\u201d as the show is called \u2014 rough translation: \u201cIt\u2019s the Champions\u201d \u2014 has a lot of windows and overlooks the arena for taekwondo and fencing. A few feet from where Rizek stands, on the other side of a wall, there is a claustrophobic warren of cubicles where interpreters sit. Each panelist is assigned an interpreter for each show. On a recent night, Conner\u2019s was Daniel Azevedo. He said he had been training to learn sports terminology for weeks.\u201cThere are a number of sneaky little challenges that call for maximum attention,\u201d he said. \u201cLike \u2018pirouette.\u2019 It translates easily in gymnastics. But in diving, it has a different name. It\u2019s more like \u2018screw.\u2019\u201dThe technology and personnel that help overcome the language barrier were not the most challenging part of putting \u201c\u00c9 campe\u00e3o\u201d together, Costa said. That honor goes to the negotiations and continuing care of the panelists.\u201cIt was hard to make the agreements,\u201d he said, standing in the studio on a recent night. \u201cThere were a lot of different questions to answer. Which airline? \u2018I love American Airlines.\u2019 \u2018I love Delta.\u2019 \u2018I love United.\u2019 Then when they get here, you need a driver for each one. We have two producers who just make sure they are comfortable. The room is good. The cable TV works. We have to make them happy people.\u201dWhile Costa was talking, the panelists trickled in. Spitz reached the studio first. His mustache is long gone (\u201cSometime in the \u201980s, got tired of it\u201d), and his hair is bushy and gray. Wearing a dark blue sport jacket, khakis and sneakers, he came across as a very fit college professor and gave answers that were far closer to lectures than sound bites.Asked what he had been up to these many decades, he started out with a description of his family and his licensing company, then segued into his lengthy r\u00e9sum\u00e9 as an entrepreneur. Then he plunged into a detailed discussion of \u201cconvertible debentures.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s basically a fancy word for \u2018loan,\u2019\u201d he said. About two minutes into this somewhat technical lesson in high finance, it was pointed out that the conversation was a bit in the weeds.\u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to tell you,\u201d he said, \u201cis that at the end of the day, that was my passion!\u201dConvertible debentures?See the Summer Games in a series of composite images.\u201cYes.\u201dNot swimming?\u201cSwimming had a beginning, middle and end,\u201d he said.Lewis was sitting on a bean-bag-like chair on the first floor of the studio, watching highlights on a large-screen television. A businessman and a coach at the University of Houston, he still has that springy walk that makes him seem perpetually on the verge of flight. He sounded eager to say that he did not really do sports commentary, which seemed peculiar given that he was about to do sports commentary.\u201cThis, really, I don\u2019t look at it as commentary,\u201d he said. \u201cI just look at it as discussion. I\u2019m not doing research. I have no interest in doing research. I really don\u2019t want to know about so and so from Kazakhstan.\u201dWhen the show started, a room full of technicians shushed the set, and Rizek introduced everyone to viewers at home. For some reason, \u201cBart Conner\u201d becomes \u201cBartch Conner\u201d in Portuguese, though everyone else\u2019s name sounded the same.The four-time gold medal-winning sprinter Michael Johnson joined the panel for the first time. He looked resplendent in a blue-and-gray patterned blazer, and he added gravity to a show that has had its share of goofy moments.One night, for instance, Comaneci brought fake Spitz-style mustaches in for everyone to slip under their noses. Another night, Spitz brought Comaneci a knockoff of the outfit she had worn during her floor exercise at the Montreal Games. Somehow this 54-year-old woman was talked into donning that outfit and performing some of the balletic moves from her historic floor exercise, which she did alongside a split-screen image of her teenage self from back then. When she was done, everyone on the panel held up a piece of paper that read \u201c10.\u201dOn this night, though, the proceedings were more earnest. Usain Bolt had just won the 100 meters, and Johnson and Lewis seemed locked in their own personal contest to see who could provide deeper insight into the triumph. Every time Johnson spoke, which he did at length, it seemed to provoke a monologue from Lewis. It was as though words were strides and Lewis refused to be left behind.When the show ended, the panel dispersed quickly. By the time that Rizek had changed out of his suit and into a yellow T-shirt, it was nearly 2 a.m. He walked through the nearly empty Olympic Park and described the show as one of the highlights of his career. This was largely because he adored all the members of the panel.\u201cI don\u2019t know how you say it in English,\u201d he said, heading out of the gates, \u201cbut I\u2019m in ecstasy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "33 U.S. Service Members Have Contracted Zika, Pentagon Says", "Date": "2016-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 More than 30 active-duty American service members \u2014 including a pregnant woman \u2014 have contracted the mosquito-borne Zika virus in countries where the disease has been identified, Pentagon officials said on Wednesday.Maj. Ben Sakrisson, a Pentagon spokesman, said the Defense Department has been tracking Zika in servicemen and women abroad since January, and that the number had reached 33 this month.Pentagon officials did not identify the countries where the service members had contracted the virus, but said that they had all been previously identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as places where mosquitoes with the disease are present.The Pentagon has informed service members in affected areas to take precautions, Major Sakrisson said, and pregnant women in affected areas are being given the option of relocating. Military personnel in affected areas are advised to use insect repellent and to wear appropriate clothing.The news was first reported on Monday by Military Times.As of July 26, the C.D.C. was reporting active Zika virus transmissions in most of Central and South America with the exception of Chile and Uruguay, as well as in Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Tonga, the Marshall Islands, American Samoa and Fiji. The C.D.C. was also reporting active Zika transmissions in Cape Verde, off the coast of Senegal.The Army is working with outside scientists to develop a Zika vaccine, military officials said.Last month a Congressional measure to help fund the Zika response died amid bickering between Democrats and Republicans and despite agreement that the virus, which can cause serious birth defects, is a public health emergency. It failed after House Republicans refused to accept a bipartisan compromise reached in the Senate, and inserted clauses that reignited old disputes over government financing for Planned Parenthood.Last week Florida officials reported the first signs of local transmission of Zika in the continental United States, in a Miami neighborhood. By Monday, federal health officials were urging pregnant women to stay away from the neighborhood, in apparently the first time that the C.D.C. has advised people not to travel to a place in the continental United States.Officials said that the number of Zika cases in Florida caused by local mosquitoes had risen to 14 from four announced last Friday: 12 men and two women. But they maintained that they did not expect the number of cases there to grow into anything like the epidemic that has raged across Latin America in recent months.The Pentagon did not give details about the status of the pregnant woman or her baby.Zika has strained health resources throughout Latin America. The epidemic is now affecting Puerto Rico, with two percent of recent blood donors there reportedly infected, and hundreds of pregnant women testing positive.The disease has been linked to birth defects like microcephaly. As of July 27, 1,658 cases of Zika in the continental United States and Hawaii have been reported to the C.D.C., with the majority of them contracted through exposure to mosquitoes outside the United States.Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Republican of Florida, sent a letter to the C.D.C. on Wednesday signed by the entire Florida congressional delegation saying that Florida needed more funding to fight Zika.\u201cThe virus is finally here in our community and half-steps and half-measures from federal agencies with the power to do more are of little comfort to families throughout our state,\u201d Ms. Ros-Lehtinen said in a statement, which also called the $720,000 of $16 million of new funding allocated to Florida \u201cpaltry.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Air of Graft Around Ex-Argentine Government Arouses Fury", "Date": "2016-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs prosecutors and judges press ahead with the cases, many Argentines question whether the ruling class can move beyond a culture of graft that has hamstrung the country\u2019s progress. \u201cI\u2019ve given up hope,\u201d said Yolanda Galv\u00e1n, 50, a cashier at a pharmacy here, referring to the country\u2019s history of corruption scandals. \u201cThey all end up being the same.\u201dMs. Galv\u00e1n pointed to public unease regarding President Mauricio Macri, whose offshore business activity \u2014 dating to years before his term began in December \u2014 is being investigated after it was revealed in a leak of the documents known as the Panama Papers. Mr. Macri says he has nothing to hide.Ethical concerns also loom over Mr. Macri\u2019s energy minister, Juan Jos\u00e9 Aranguren, who has more than $1 million of shares in Royal Dutch Shell, the oil company for which he previously worked as an executive. The government says owning the shares is not illegal.But it is the cases implicating the upper echelons of Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s administration that have prompted blistering critiques of Argentina\u2019s shortcomings in tackling graft. Experts say that a brittle institutional framework fosters political corruption, and that a politicized judiciary lets those in office off the hook.In the past, corruption scandals involving the Front for Victory\u2019s former officials were viewed by its supporters as smear campaigns engineered by the news media and sectors of the judiciary hostile to Mrs. Kirchner. But more recently, especially with the arrest of the official in the convent, there appears to be little room for such defenses.The official, Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez, a former public works secretary, was discovered by the police with duffel bags packed with cash, Rolex and Omega watches, and a semiautomatic machine gun in the early hours of June 14 at a convent outside Buenos Aires. He has been indicted on charges of illegal enrichment and is in detention while a judge investigates his case.Argentines from across the political spectrum were quick to condemn Mr. L\u00f3pez, who served as public works secretary for the entire three-term period the Front for Victory was in power.\u201cI believe this is the end of Kirchnerismo as an electoral option,\u201d said Andr\u00e9s Malamud, an Argentine political scientist at the University of Lisbon, using the popularized name for the political philosophy adhered to by followers of Mrs. Kirchner and her predecessor and husband, N\u00e9stor Kirchner, who died in 2010.However, many of those supporters are now starting to doubt her. \u201cThey always defended themselves, but now we\u2019ve realized they were screwing us,\u201d said Jonathan Ramis, 20, a business management student who voted for the Front for Victory in last year\u2019s elections.Those allegations stem from a number of continuing cases that have gripped Argentines in recent years. One is a money-laundering investigation involving L\u00e1zaro B\u00e1ez, a construction baron from Patagonia, who has been indicted and is in jail as the investigation progresses.Investigators have also accused Mr. B\u00e1ez of redirecting some funds from the public-works contracts to the Kirchners via schemes involving the family\u2019s hotel and real estate businesses.Prosecutors are investigating whether Mr. B\u00e1ez\u2019s companies paid for block bookings at hotels without ever occupying the rooms. Similarly, it is alleged that Mr. B\u00e1ez kicked back money to the Kirchners through lease agreements to rent the family\u2019s Patagonian properties.Gerardo Pollicita, the lead prosecutor in the hotels case, turned down several interview requests. But in a recent filing, he wrote that the investigation sought to establish whether Mr. Kirchner and Mrs. Kirchner were engaged in a criminal conspiracy involving \u201ccronies\u201d like Mr. B\u00e1ez who in return for business favors from the government channeled funds to the presidential family.Mrs. Kirchner has directed scorn at Claudio Bonadio, a judge who is guiding the investigation into alleged kickbacks to her family\u2019s real estate business. He was taken off the hotels case last year amid concerns over his impartiality.In an interview at his office at Comodoro Py, a run-down courthouse here, Judge Bonadio denied the existence of a coterie of judges and prosecutors plotting against Mrs. Kirchner. He said he simply worked on whatever cases were sent his way. Judge Bonadio said judges treated criminal law as golfers did a tournament, thinking only of the case file \u2014 or hole \u2014 before them.\u201cWe\u2019re golfers, not baseball players or footballers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe play against the course, not another team.\u201dMany experts contend, however, that Argentina\u2019s judiciary is not independent. Federal judges, said Luis Moreno Ocampo, a leading Argentine anticorruption campaigner who was chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court, tend to operate in favor of whichever politicians are in power, only seriously pursuing them once they leave office.This politicization is often traced back to Mr. Menem, the former president, whose former economy minister once claimed he was passed a napkin by another minister scribbled with the names of judges Mr. Menem controlled. \u201cThe biggest issue is moving Argentina\u2019s legal system out of this swamp,\u201d Mr. Moreno Ocampo said. Still, he added, \u201cthe focus should not just be on past corruption but on preventing future corruption.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside the Conservative Push for States to Amend the Constitution", "Date": "2016-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTaking advantage of almost a decade of political victories in state legislatures across the country, conservative advocacy groups are quietly marshaling support for an event unprecedented in the nation\u2019s history: a convention of the 50 states, summoned to consider amending the Constitution.But as the groups near their goal, critics and some skeptical constitutional scholars are warning that holding an amendment-writing meeting with no historical parallel and no written rules could open a Pandora\u2019s box of constitutional mischief.That will by no means be easy. Even if the two-thirds threshold were reached, a convention would probably face a court battle over whether the legislatures\u2019 calls for a convention were sufficiently similar. And as with any amendment that Congress proposes, state-written amendments would need approval by three-quarters of the states \u2014 either by their legislatures or by state conventions \u2014 to take effect.\u201cI think the prospect is very good in 2017,\u201d said Gary Banz, a Republican who is the majority whip in the Oklahoma House of Representatives. \u201cYou can look at any number of states that are not on board yet, and they\u2019re controlled by very conservative elements.\u2019\u2019The juggernaut nature of the convention movement has almost overshadowed the longstanding debate about its motivation: to imbue the Constitution with a binding limit on federal spending.Supporters say the philosophy that state governments and ordinary people usually adhere to \u2014 that it is wrong and destructive to spend beyond one\u2019s income \u2014 should apply to the federal government as well. In that view, the $19.4 trillion national debt threatens to destroy Americans\u2019 future prosperity.\u201cIt\u2019s immoral for one generation to borrow and spend beyond its means and leave the bill to the next generation,\u201d said Scott Rogers, the director of the Balanced Budget Amendment Task Force.But opponents say an amendment, not the deficit, is the threat. A government that could not run deficits, they argue, would not be able to stimulate the economy during recessions, when job-creating spending is most needed. And it would not be able to elude budget ceilings for benefits like Social Security, or for job-creating projects like highways that are financed with debt.In truth, they say, debt is a fact of life for both states and ordinary households \u2014 in bond issues that finance revenue generators like convention centers and bridges, and for ordinary necessities like cars, kitchen remodelings and homes. Banning deficit spending, they say, would bring the economy to a halt.But the basic argument for federal frugality has broad appeal. Polls generally indicate strong support for a balanced-budget amendment, and advocates persuaded 32 state legislatures to back an amendment convention during the Reagan administration.Yet debate over an amendment\u2019s merits has taken a back seat to a more fundamental question: whether delegates to a convention could be trusted not to tinker with other parts of the Constitution.Article 5 places no limits on a convention\u2019s power. Some experts note that the Constitution itself arose from a convention called to amend its predecessor, the Articles of Confederation \u2014 and tore up the document and started from scratch. That convention even scrapped the Articles\u2019 terms of ratification \u2014 unanimous approval by the states \u2014 and substituted a lower barrier, three-fourths of states. (Some pro-amendment conservatives argue that the delegates to Philadelphia did not go rogue, but always planned to rewrite the Articles.)Michael J. Gerhardt, a University of North Carolina law professor and scholar in residence at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, said Article 5\u2019s reticence gave states leeway to improvise.\u201cOnce you have a convention, then in some respects it becomes a free-for-all,\u201d he said. \u201cAll bets are off.\u201dAdvocates scoff at the hand-wringing. Conventions of states, they say, are nothing new: About three dozen met from the 1700s to 1922 \u2014 most before the Constitution was drafted \u2014 considering everything from trade to slavery to divvying up the Colorado River\u2019s water. Most did not include every state, but each generally followed a preset agenda. A convention to draft amendments, they say, would be no different.There is, though, one signal difference: None of those meetings bore the Constitution\u2019s blessing. One, in 1861, did propose an amendment to avert an impending civil war, but it was an ad hoc affair, not an Article 5 meeting.But even if it did, he said, he would not be especially concerned: After all, a convention only proposes amendments.\u201cThe very terms of Article 5 state that proposals aren\u2019t valid unless they\u2019re ratified by three-fourths of the states,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no controversial idea on the left or the right that won\u2019t have 13 states against it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Michelangelo\u2019s real statue did once stand in this spot, but it was moved, for its own protection, 143 years ago. The original is now in a museum across town, shielded from the elements, perfectly safe.Or at least that\u2019s how we like to think of it. We are conditioned to believe that art is safe, beyond the reach of the grimy world. We don\u2019t hang the Mona Lisa next to an archery range. We put her in a fortress: walls, checkpoints, lasers, guards, bulletproof glass. There are scholars, textbooks, posters \u2014 a whole collective mythology suggesting that the work will live forever. But safety is largely an illusion, and permanence a fiction. Empires hemorrhage wealth, bombs fall on cities, religious radicals decimate ancient temples. Destruction happens in any number of ways, for any number of reasons, at any number of speeds \u2014 and it will happen, and no amount of reverence will stop it.Today, the perpetual engine of Florentine destruction seems only to be getting bolder. Its latest target is its most ambitious yet: the mascot of the Renaissance, shining ideal of the human form, one of the most celebrated artworks in this or any other city \u2014 Michelangelo\u2019s David.The trouble is the David\u2019s ankles. They are cracked. Italians first discovered this weakness back in the 19th century, and modern scientists have mapped the cracks extensively, but until recently no one claimed to know just how enfeebled the ankles might be. This changed in 2014, when a team of Italian geoscientists published a paper called \u201cModeling the Failure Mechanisms of Michelangelo\u2019s David Through Small-Scale Centrifuge Experiments.\u201d That dry title concealed a terrifying story. The paper describes an experiment designed to measure, in a novel way, the weakness in the David\u2019s ankles: by creating a small army of tiny David replicas and spinning them in a centrifuge, at various angles, to simulate different levels of real-world stress. What the researchers found was grim. If the David were to be tilted 15 degrees, his ankles would fail.The seed of the problem is a tiny imperfection in the statue\u2019s design. The center of gravity in the base doesn\u2019t align with the center of gravity in the figure itself; when the base is level, in other words, the David\u2019s body is slightly off-balance. There is, as the article nicely puts it, \u201can eccentricity of the loads.\u201d This places extra pressure on the David\u2019s narrowest part: his ankles. As long as the statue is perfectly upright, the eccentricity of the loads is tolerable. But there is very little margin for error. If you tilt the base even slightly, the stress on the ankles sharply increases.Now it just so happens that, for a very long time, before he was moved into his protective museum, the David was leaning slightly. No one is sure exactly why. He stood, for more than 300 years, in the spot where I saw the tourist from Arizona scoff at the dirty replica. Popular legend says the lean was caused by a thunderclap in 1511, part of a violent storm that Florentines interpreted as a bad political omen, but more likely it was a result of the ground shifting slightly, for regular ground-shifting reasons \u2014 something like the force that tilts the famous tower of Pisa or the one that sucks constantly at the city of Venice.For several hundred years, the David leaned at an angle of several degrees. That doesn\u2019t sound like much, but when you\u2019re dealing with six tons bearing down every second of every minute of every day of every year of every century, it is plenty. Hairline fractures worked their way slowly through the stone. The right leg is significantly worse than the left. As the tilt of the statue increases, the stress will move higher and higher up that leg, until \u2014 at the moment of failure \u2014 it will break off just below the knee.But what would make the David tilt? The big fear is tremors, tremors of all kinds: traffic rumbling, the nearby construction of a high-speed train tunnel, the steady concussion of tourists\u2019 feet and \u2014 most of all \u2014 earthquakes. Florence sits near several active fault lines, and every so often the city takes a seismic hit. In December 2014, a rash of 250 earthquakes rattled the countryside around Florence. Most were minor, and none hit the city directly, but still \u2014 Florentines could feel the motion.My mind could not stop imagining it. An earthquake hits the center of Florence. Liquid waves roll under the rigid city: The church bells ring out of time, terra cotta tiles rain down from the Renaissance rooftops, priceless paintings rattle off the walls of the Uffizi. Meanwhile, inside the Accademia Gallery, the David\u2019s pedestal begins to tilt. Slightly at first, just enough to shift the statue\u2019s gaze, so that he looks not at his old enemy anymore \u2014 the implied Goliath off in the distance \u2014 but at a new one: the floor he\u2019s been standing on for 134 years.As the ground continues to roll, the David\u2019s tilt accelerates. Five degrees, six degrees, seven, eight, nine. Gravity begins to act not just on the top of the David\u2019s head but on his back, pushing him forward. Ten degrees, 11, 12.Finally, the compromised ankles reach their angle of maximum stress. They begin to slide along the old microfracture faults \u2014 an earthquake within the earthquake \u2014 and the David\u2019s legs and ankles are crushed by the weight of the body above. He begins to truly fall.The first thing to hit the floor is his bent left elbow, the arm that holds the heroic sling, and it bursts along the lines of its previous breaks, old scars left over from an incident in the 16th century involving an unruly mob and a bench. Then the rest of the marble will meet the floor, and the physics from there will be fast and simple: force, resistance, the brittleness of calcite crystals, the shearing of microscopic grains along the axes on which they align. Michelangelo\u2019s David will explode.Standing in front of the David was, by far, the most powerful experience I had ever had with a work of art. The statue is gigantic: 17 feet tall, three times the size of an actual man, the height of a mature giraffe \u2014 another fact that no one had ever told me. I had always assumed, based on the images, that the David was life-size. To find otherwise seemed like a category error, like arriving at the Taj Mahal to discover that it is actually the size of a walnut. There was an existential snap in my brain, a sudden adjustment of the relative values and proportions of every other object in the world, including me.He towered over me in his iconic pose: back foot flat, front foot tipped, shoulders cocked, left arm raised to hold the sling, huge right hand hanging down by his side, head turned fiercely toward the glorious future. He was a giant marble god, except he wasn\u2019t a god; he was a man, but then of course he wasn\u2019t really a man either; he was white stone \u2014 but the stone looked somehow soft, like flesh, and the hard-soft marble curved and rippled into muscles and veins, tiny and large, subtle and blunt, each feature easing inevitably into the next, all the way around. My eye kept roaming, looking for imperfections, not finding any. My mind ran in silly loops. The only word it would settle on, again and again, was \u201cperfect.\u201dI stood there in my filthy Birkenstocks feeling a sense of religious transcendental soaring: the promise that my true self was not bound by the constraints of my childhood \u2014 by freeway exits, office parks, after-school programs, coin-operated laundry rooms at dingy apartment complexes, vineyards plowed under and converted into Walmarts, instability, change, dead dogs, divorce. No. The David suggested that my true self existed most fully in some interstellar superhistorical realm in which all the ideal things of the universe commingled in a perpetual ecstasy of harmonizing trumpet blasts. If such perfection could exist in the world, I felt, then so many other things were suddenly possible: to live a perfect life creating perfect things, to find an ideal way to be. What was the point of anything less?Again, I was 20. My girlfriend and I were in the middle of a six-week, shoestring-budget grand tour of Europe. We slept every night in teeming hostels, ate meat with our hands in public parks, frightened people with our terrible German. But it was all worth it for moments like this \u2014 moments in which I could truly believe that perfection was real, as real as a train station a few hours away, and that my life was heading toward it.A huge crowd swarmed around the David, gawking and chatting, but I hardly noticed them. My girlfriend and I stood in the museum for an extremely long time, until the crowds began to thin. Eventually we left and moved on to another museum, another city, and then we went home and \u2014 as the years rolled up their sleeves and marched Americanly by \u2014 we got married, had children, found jobs. I fantasized about perfection while crashing, again and again, into what I discovered were the extremely solid walls of my own limitations. Just on the other side of those walls, I knew, stood the David on his special pedestal: an impossible destination that I was nevertheless determined to reach. But the meeting between my head and that wall began to take up more and more of my attention, and after a while I started to wonder if the perfection on the other side actually existed, if there had ever really been anything there to begin with.The first mistake was the stone itself. The marble-cutting community in and around Carrara was, and remains today, practically a sovereign nation, with its own dialect and politics and lore and hierarchies of technical expertise. Michelangelo was a native of the quarrying world, fluent in its ways, but the sculptor who chose the block, Agostino di Duccio, was largely ignorant of them. He had been selected by one of Florence\u2019s most influential groups, the Wool Guild, to carve a monumental marble statue of the biblical David. It would sit high on the edge of the city\u2019s great cathedral, the Duomo, to serve as a show of strength, an artistic boast and a warning to the city\u2019s enemies.But Agostino was in over his head. He had no experience carving marble on this scale \u2014 nobody alive did. The block he chose was huge but flawed. The power of marble, after all, is supposed to be in its perfection: a pure white chunk cut, at almost impossible expense, out of the dirty, ragged mountains. But this slab was marred by little holes, discolored by veins.It was not only Agostino di Duccio who was overmatched \u2014 the quarriers were, too. The block was 18 feet tall and something like 25,000 pounds. No one had harvested a stone this large in close to 1,000 years. The whole process was one ordeal after another. Because statuary marble tends to form up near the tops of mountains, it took months of labor to get it down to the quarry floor. The trip from Carrara to Florence \u2014 an 80-mile journey that takes around two hours in a modern car \u2014 took two more arduous years. There were teams of men, teams of oxen, big ocean ships, flat river barges, inclement weather, monthslong delays. At one point, the giant block fell into a muddy ditch and had to be laboriously extracted. One scholar has speculated that this accident caused the cracks that now plague the ankles.When the block finally arrived in Florence, it was greeted as a wonder. Its size, to the public, would have been more apparent than its imperfections. It was deposited in a courtyard behind the cathedral \u2014 a huge white apparition in the middle of the small brown city. People came from all over just to stare.City leaders went to inspect the block, and they were dismayed. It had not only been badly chosen; it had also been badly carved. Agostino, as was traditional, had \u201croughed out\u201d the block at the quarry \u2014 a quick whittling down to leave only what was necessary for the eventual statue. In doing so, however, he had compounded his previous mistake. The block had been strangely narrow to begin with, and Agostino had made it even narrower. He created an awkward hole in its middle. It was hard to see how this stone was ever going to become a plausible human form. Some believed that it was ruined, that the city\u2019s investment was already lost.Agostino was fired. The block was abandoned. It sat there, on its side, getting rained on, hailed on, fouled by birds, for more than 30 years. After a while, it became a fixed part of the landscape of Florence. People and buildings changed all around it, regimes rose and fell, but the monumental block never moved. Residents began to call it, with some mixture of respect and mockery, \u201cthe Giant.\u201dI didn\u2019t get back to Florence, after my initial visit, for nearly 20 years. When I did finally return, it was as an adult man on the brink of middle age. I was not quite 40 but felt, in many ways, older. My hair, once as heroically thick as the David\u2019s, had begun to thin visibly, and I felt sad about this, and I also considered my sadness to be its own failure, because I wanted to be the kind of person who didn\u2019t care about superficial, middle-age things. Every morning, when I stepped out of bed, my joints hurt, especially my ankles, which a doctor had recently diagnosed with arthritis \u2014 they were 20 years older than the rest of me, he said.Perfection, it turns out, is no way to try to live. It is a child\u2019s idea, a cartoon \u2014 this desire not to be merely good, not to do merely well, but to be faultless, to transcend everything, including the limits of yourself. It is less heroic than neurotic, and it doesn\u2019t take much analysis to get to its ugly side: a lust for control, pseudofascist purity, self-destruction. Perfection makes you flinch at yourself, flinch at the world, flinch at any contact between the two. Soon what you want, above all, is escape: to be gone, elsewhere, annihilated.By the time I returned to Florence, I had grown accustomed to spending solid weeks in a state of high anxiety \u2014 my hands would turn freezing, like a corpse, and I would sit at my desk wishing I could cry, and my wife would tell me, with increasing urgency, that she was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. Eventually, after many years of this, I was prescribed a daily pill intended to stabilize an imbalance in my brain chemistry, and this solution has worked, more or less. Yet I am still plagued by this eccentricity of the loads: an impossible tension between the fantasies in my head and the realities on the ground.And so, on my bad ankles and with my broken gaze, I returned to see the David. Things in Florence seemed essentially the same. Crowds still waited for hours in the brutal heat to enter the churchlike museum. Inside, the David stood exactly as I last saw him. I experienced the same moment of revelation: the sudden improbability of his size, his excellence. He still dominated the space, still held the light on his impossibly subtle musculature. In fact, he was looking better than ever, because in the intervening years he had been cleaned, millimeter by millimeter, at great expense and with some controversy \u2014 the grit and dust of 500 years scrubbed off. The marble seemed to glow. Once again, my brain reached for the word \u201cperfect.\u201dBut \u201cperfect\u201d no longer seemed adequate. Although I couldn\u2019t see the cracks inside the David\u2019s ankles and legs, I knew they were there. I knew other things too: that the marble of his face was pocked with holes, for instance, which restorers had filled in, and that he was missing a small chip of stone from one of his lower eyelids, and that his right little toe had been lost multiple times, and that a crazy man had taken a hammer to his left foot in 1991. Although the David\u2019s maladies were mostly patched up over the centuries, you could still see all the scars.The first step had been to stand the Giant up. This, in itself, was a production. Once again, all of Florence came out to watch. The block had been sitting there for 35 years, almost the entire life expectancy of a 16th-century human, and it was now in worse shape than ever. Marble is best to carve when it is freshly cut from the mountain. The longer it sits out, the more brittle it becomes. The Giant was now thoroughly \u201ccooked,\u201d in the local parlance \u2014 dried out by decades of sun. Some people said it was beyond salvaging. Many wanted to attach extra marble blocks to it. They said it would be impossible to get a proper figure out of the misshapen mess that was left. This would become one of the feats that would elevate Michelangelo to mythic status: that he not only salvaged the ruined block but also turned it into a masterpiece. As the Renaissance art historian Giorgio Vasari put it: \u201cAnd truly it was a miracle on the part of Michelangelo to restore to life a thing that was dead.\u201dThe miracle took some time. First, Michelangelo decided that he needed to carve the David in private, so workers came and built a roofless shed around the Giant. For many months, inside his shed, Michelangelo toiled away unseen, using a series of finer and finer chisels in an attempt to rescue every centimeter of the stone. He was a savant of marble, so he would have understood everything about the block, all of its grains and flaws and possibilities. The figure of the David began to emerge little by little, as A. Victor Coonin puts it in his definitive recent history of the statue, \u201cFrom Marble to Flesh,\u201d \u201clike a person being slowly revealed as water drains from a bath.\u201dWhen the shed was finally opened for a public viewing, in the summer of 1503, the David really must have seemed like a miracle. The dirty old cooked Giant had become a smooth, enormous, naked man, paused just on the brink of heroic motion. The young sculptor had not run from the odd dimensions of the block; he embraced them, turning them into his figure\u2019s signature elements. The block\u2019s narrowness yielded the lean, twisting body (as opposed to an overmuscled superman), with its huge head and hands. Michelangelo gave the David a grotesquely furrowed brow \u2014 a shelf of a forehead closer to a Neanderthal\u2019s than a modern human\u2019s \u2014 because he knew that anything more \u201crealistic\u201d would fail to scan for a viewer on the ground. The figure was unreal but real, stylized but natural. It would come to define the city.A debate raged over where to put the David. The statue was so powerful, so impressive, that it seemed a waste (and perhaps even impossible, engineeringwise) to install it in its intended destination, way up on the cathedral. Instead, after rounds of conferences among the Florentine intelligentsia, it was decided that the sculpture would be installed in the city\u2019s central square, the Piazza della Signoria, where everyone could see it. A special machine had to be invented to move it: a huge wooden frame inside of which the David was suspended in a net of ropes, rocking gently, as a crew of men rolled it across the city on greased beams. At night, it had to be protected by armed guards from rowdy kids who were throwing rocks at it.The David\u2019s journey took four days, at the end of which it was installed, to much fanfare, out in the public square. It would stand in that same spot for the next 369 years, a period during which it would be shaken by thunder, hit by carts and smeared with bird feces. In 1527, a riotous mob tried to storm City Hall, and another mob, in defense of the public order, threw heavy objects out the windows: stones, tiles, furniture. A bench hit the David, breaking his left arm in half.Michelangelo went off to Rome, where he painted the Sistine Chapel; designed the dome of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, at the time the largest in the history of the world; and eventually died, wealthy and famous beyond measure, at age 88. He would never see his David again.The Giant continued its slow decline. Although the broken arm was eventually mended and reattached, the statue remained outside, exposed to rain, ice, hail, wind and vandals. Its surface began to visibly degrade. In the 19th century, the statue\u2019s restorers tended only to make things worse \u2014 they used wax, which discolored the marble, and acid, which ate at its surface. Before long, the David needed restoring from his restoration. A broken rain gutter on the Palazzo Vecchio poured torrents of water directly onto the statue. Concerned citizens began to agitate for him to be moved indoors. They built a protective wooden shed over him, isolating him in a bubble of safety. This brought the public life of the David full circle. He was carved in a shed; he was hidden in a shed.Eventually, the statue\u2019s protectors were able to move him, on train tracks laid laboriously across Florence, to a custom-built room in the Accademia. But the room still wasn\u2019t finished, so the David sat inside a crate for years, growing colonies of microorganisms like a huge piece of cheese.The Accademia attracts well over a million visitors a year, and they all end up in one room: the David\u2019s rotunda. I stood there, in the summer of 2015, watching the crowd watch the David.The air in the room was perfectly still. The tourists fanned themselves with maps of Florence. Guides, speaking directly into their followers\u2019 ears via head-mounted microphones, led large groups into the center of the crowd like battalions into battle. I watched a woman take a short nap while leaning against a stone column. A couple from Holland sat down next to me and fired streams of Dutch at each other, the only word of which I could make out was the English \u201csix-pack.\u201dMost of all, people took pictures. For almost its entire history, the Accademia has been a strict no-camera zone, but the rise of smartphones made that impossible, and now the phones have taken over. Tourists spend their time in front of the three-dimensional David poking a two-dimensional version of him on their touch screens. I witnessed the execution of many, many selfies: the jockeying for a proper angle, the sudden dead-eyed smile, the brisk walk away. (There always seemed to be something furtive, something almost criminal, about a selfie.) Often, through a trick of perspective, the selfie-taker\u2019s own head would appear on the screen twice as big as the David.At the back of the crowd, I found the David\u2019s security guard. He sat sideways on a folding chair, chin in hand, a model of relaxed uninterest; he seemed to watch the room without even looking. When he spoke, his mustache moved over a mouth that was missing several teeth. He was a native Florentine, and he told me stories about crazy tourists (weeping, thongs) and about the great flood of 1966, in which his family\u2019s house was underwater up to the second floor.I asked him if, after all this time, he had any personal feeling of awe left for the David. He said he did not.\u201cIf you eat chocolate every day for 20 years,\u201d he said, \u201cyou will get bored of it.\u201dIf looking at Michelangelo\u2019s David is the equivalent of eating chocolate, then walking the streets of Florence is like drowning in Willy Wonka\u2019s gushing chocolate river. The image of the David is everywhere. There are bookmarks, mouse pads, T-shirts, posters, watches, key chains, mugs, ballpoint pens, commemorative plates, pie servers, snow globes, sugar spoons, USB sticks and Christmas ornaments. There are leather shops and pizzerias and even parking garages named after him. Tourists can buy aprons that make them look as if they have the David\u2019s body: the lean, muscular torso, the naked little penis.And then there are the statuettes: a vast army of miniature imitation Davids that stand in shop windows and on hawkers\u2019 carts in all the famous piazzas. Near the Accademia I found a store called, in English, \u201cDavid Shop.\u201d It was a David-replica bonanza, more Davids than I have ever seen in one place before. The smallest was the size of my pinkie, the biggest slightly taller than an average Italian woman. I bought a postcard that was also a jigsaw puzzle featuring the David\u2019s penis wearing sunglasses and saying \u201cCiao!\u201dNext to the Duomo, for an exorbitant price, I bought a bobblehead David; his giant head, attached by a spring, waggled ridiculously as I walked. He waggled past many other versions of himself \u2014 hundreds, thousands, infinity Davids. From a distance, many of the replicas looked acceptably David-like, but up close most of them were laughably bad. The replicas are like a systematic exploration of all the possible ways to distort Michelangelo\u2019s design. Their faces are squashed, their heads are flat, their noses are pointed, they look like goblins. Some of them seem to have breasts. Others have rib cages jutting out in high relief, like cartoons of shipwreck survivors. One shop-window David stood several feet tall and cost more than $200 \u2014 a serious investment that would have taken up major space in any buyer\u2019s home. Its face looked like a bug-eyed, emaciated elf\u2019s. Its muscles were lumpy and gnarled. Its feet were long and bony, like the feet of an ancient witch in a fairy tale. Its hair looked like a pile of spaghetti. It seemed more a parody of the David than a tribute.In the Accademia gift shop, I bought a sticker that read, simply, \u201cDAVID MANIA.\u201d This, I decided, was the epitome of David souvenirs \u2014 a tribute not to the actual David but to our mass enthusiasm for him.Sometimes, when I found myself fed up with Florence and its crowds, overwhelmed by the kitsch, the heat, the vendors, the constant eruptions of Renaissance cosplay, my walks took me across the river, away from the old bridge, toward a plain yellow building with a stationery shop on its ground floor. Twenty feet up, where no one ever seemed to look, was a small historical plaque identifying it as the temporary home of the great Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky. This is where he agonized over the writing of his novel \u201cThe Idiot,\u201d which I was rereading. Dostoyevsky was, in many ways, the anti-David: ugly, short, hairy, awkward, nervous, ill, angry, a prophet of spite and self-sabotage. I found him incredibly inspiring. He spoke to me beyond the kitsch, above the crowds, from the other side of my old simplistic understanding of the David. He gestured toward something more complex, more inclusive, more sustainable.Dostoyevsky moved to Florence with his wife in 1868, during a miserable swing through Europe, and he detested the city at times with a degree of comic loathing that only he could have mustered for such a beautiful place. He complained about the humidity, the rain, the crowds, the heat. He never learned Italian, preferring to sit in his room, alone, wrestling with his novel. He stayed, for nearly a year, only because he was too poor to leave \u2014 he had compulsively blown much of his money at the roulette tables of Europe.As I looked at the David, I thought about \u201cThe Idiot,\u201d and as I read \u201cThe Idiot,\u201d I thought about the David. They existed at opposite poles, and yet they also spoke deeply to each other. \u201cThe Idiot\u201d was Dostoyevsky\u2019s attempt to create an ideal man, a modern Christ \u2014 what he called \u201ca completely beautiful human being.\u201d He was forced to try to write this perfect book, however, in humiliatingly imperfect conditions: isolated far from home, in intense poverty and grief \u2014 the Dostoyevskys\u2019 young daughter had died just months earlier \u2014 and delayed by fits of epilepsy. Up in his cramped apartment above the paper store, Dostoyevsky flogged his unruly book. \u201cThe Idiot\u201d is full of wild crowds bursting into rooms out of nowhere. Its plot is strange, lurching, unbalanced. Its hero is seen by everyone as a fool, and his presence seems to cause trouble wherever he goes. The book is, in both theme and execution, one of the great artistic statements of the impossibility of human perfection. Rereading it during the visit to Florence made me feel, somehow, spiritually itchy.Unlike Michelangelo, Dostoyevsky was missing from the official lore of the city \u2014 you couldn\u2019t buy postcards bearing his image or visit a museum devoted to his life and work. This made him even more of a refuge, a small secret I shared with no one.We talked about the David\u2019s cracked ankles, a topic with which Tartuferi was very familiar.I asked him about the geoscientists\u2019 terrifying paper. He rolled his eyes. It was, he said, mainly a publicity grab: We have known about these cracks for more than 100 years, he pointed out, and they aren\u2019t getting any worse. The David is now perfectly upright, and he is one of the most closely monitored artworks in the world. There are maps not only of the cracks themselves but also of every stain and blemish on the surface of the marble, of every repair that has ever been made, even of the patterns in which dust tends to fall. Visitors to the Accademia will notice a large, inelegant plastic brick mounted behind the David to monitor all of its vital signs: temperature, motion, angle of inclination. It is labeled \u201cSMARTBRICK. New. Fast. Easy. Smart.\u201dTartuferi conceded, however, that he was still worried about an earthquake. Sometimes he had bad dreams. All of that high-tech monitoring can only warn us \u2014 it can\u2019t protect anything. And while it seems to be true that the cracks aren\u2019t getting worse, they are not getting better either. As long as they exist, the David will be vulnerable.What, then, is to be done? In fact, a relatively simple solution to the ankle problem already exists. Although we can\u2019t fix the cracks, we can mitigate the stress that makes them dangerous. There is a special kind of antiseismic base that allows a marble statue to move along with any tectonic disturbance. It\u2019s similar to the kind of technology you\u2019d find under buildings in San Francisco. Many less illustrious statues in earthquake zones are already protected by such bases. They are not terribly complex and, considering the potential consequences of leaving it undone, not terribly expensive: about 250,000 euros, according to Tartuferi, a tiny fraction of the revenues the David earns the museum in a single year.In 2014, after the earthquakes rocked the countryside around Florence, after the global media fretted about the possible destruction of the David, Italy\u2019s minister of culture said that an antiseismic base would be installed under the statue within a year. But a year passed, and nothing happened. When I arrived in the summer of 2015 \u2014 six months after that statement \u2014 I half-expected to find men in hard hats working around the David\u2019s pedestal. Instead, there were only the usual tourists. The David, meanwhile, stood there in his old precarious rigidity, vulnerable as ever to the tremors.I asked Tartuferi what was happening with the antiseismic base.The delay was only bureaucratic, he said. He had met, long ago, with a company that did this sort of stabilizing work. Tartuferi had told the Italian press that the job was underway. The base could, hypothetically, go in at any moment.But the Italian government, Tartuferi said, refused to allow him to install the base. The nation was in the middle of an elaborate restructuring of its museum system, and it was planning to put new leaders \u2014 some of whom would be known as \u201csupermanagers\u201d \u2014 into Florence\u2019s highest-profile (and therefore most lucrative) museums. This made Tartuferi a lame-duck director, and the Italian government was not going to allow him, on his way out the door, to execute a project as important as saving the David. Italy, in the midst of its own economic collapse, wanted to be the hero that stepped forward to save the David from collapsing.The problem was that no one could say exactly when this power transfer might occur, and \u2014 even after it did \u2014 if and when the base would be installed. When Tartuferi departed, he told me, he was planning to pass the project of the antiseismic base off to his successor. This, he said, is what the new director would have to deal with first.Meanwhile, every day, the David would remain at risk. In fact, Tartuferi told me, the high-tech monitoring device on the back of the David\u2019s pedestal, the smart brick, had recently been turned off. There was no point in monitoring anymore, he said \u2014 everyone knew what needed to be done. Now they just needed to do it.Tartuferi was not the only one who told me a story like this. I met with a woman named Contessa Simonetta Brandolini d\u2019Adda, one of the most powerful figures in Florence\u2019s art world. Eighteen years ago, the contessa founded a nonprofit organization called Friends of Florence, which has financed and overseen the restoration of many of the city\u2019s endangered masterpieces, from sculptures in the central square to Botticelli oil paintings in the Uffizi to 15th-century Mannerist frescoes in a popular local church. The organization fills a crucial lack in Italy, helping to make up for the increasingly cash-strapped government\u2019s inability to take proper care of its decaying cultural heritage. In 2004, Friends of Florence raised half a million dollars to help fund the cleaning and restoration of the David, and they continue to pay for the statue\u2019s regular monitoring and upkeep. A family of spiders, Brandolini told me, had been discovered living in the giant caverns of the David\u2019s hair. Every few months they covered his body with dusty webs that needed to be vacuumed off.Friends of Florence would dearly love to raise the funds to pay for the David\u2019s antiseismic base. But the Italian government, again and again, has insisted that the state will take care of it. It seemed they believed that an outside organization rescuing the David would be improper. She was an even-keeled and practical woman, but while relating this to me, she grew visibly frustrated. There was simply nothing she could do against the overwhelming force of official Italian national pride.My inner troll worshiped not the David but the cracks in the David\u2019s ankles. They were, as a fatal flaw, so deliciously humiliating \u2014 such a perfectly ironic undercutting of the statue\u2019s otherwise heroic stature. The David\u2019s destiny, said my troll, was not to stand but to break.This put me in mind, once again, of Dostoyevsky \u2014 the grumpy outcast seething in Florence, the anti-David. My troll could easily have been one of his characters. It could have been the splenetic narrator of \u201cNotes From Underground,\u201d who recoils against the notion of rational utopia, of the perfectibility of mankind: \u201cTwo times two is four is no longer life, gentlemen, but the beginning of death.\u201dThe real power of Dostoyevsky\u2019s work, though, is that despite all the misery his characters endure, his vision is not actually miserable. It is redemptive, celebratory, powerfully totalizing. Humans are compulsive, irrational and petty, yes, but they are also selfless, intelligent and idealistic. In Dostoyevsky, there is a radical acceptance that strikes me as, in its own way, a new, more perfect vision of perfection: an envelope of understanding that can hold the entire universe.I began to think of the David not as a traditional hero but as a Dostoyevsky character. Like the Idiot, he was an ideal man with no real place in the world \u2014 misunderstood, assaulted by crowds, drawn into all sorts of unheroic shenanigans. There was, God knows, much that was insane about our relationship to the statue: the compulsive selfies, the inertia of the Italian bureaucracy, the DAVID MANIA. But as a character in \u201cThe Idiot\u201d puts it: \u201cTo attain perfection, one must first of all be able not to understand many things.\u201dAs I walked around Florence, I was exposed to hundreds and thousands of horrible David replicas. At a certain point, I began to actually love them. They were so awkward, so bad and so numerous, that they were, in the aggregate, somehow good \u2014 a perfect tribute to Michelangelo\u2019s strange genius, and to the gnarled history of the statue itself. They were, themselves, little trolls: the David\u2019s imperfections made flesh, sprung fully formed out of the cracks in his ankles and set loose upon the world.At home, on my mantle, I keep a small crowd of them: a green one, the bobblehead, a white one that looks like an elf. One of them, a tiny keychain, recently fell over and broke \u2014 his head cracked clean off. I keep its pieces there with the rest.I asked Hollberg about her husband\u2019s ankles. Had there been any progress, under her watch, on the David\u2019s antiseismic base? This was six months after Hollberg took charge and a year and a half after the culture minister\u2019s initial promise to place the David on the base.There had not been any progress. Hollberg, in fact, seemed surprisingly calm. After all, an earthquake was still hypothetical, and she had inherited plenty of other, more pressing problems. There were holes in the museum\u2019s roof that let rainwater through. There were illegal vendors who hassled the tourists while they waited outside in line. There was the problem of finding space, in the clotted center of Florence, to expand the undersized museum.After her arrival, Hollberg said, people emerged from everywhere to tell her how to save the David. Everyone claimed to be an expert. Everyone seemed to have something to sell. But Hollberg wanted to take her time, to consider all the options. She wanted the right solution, not just the fastest or easiest. At some point in the future, she said, she would probably travel to Los Angeles to consult experts at the Getty Center about how they protect their statues.In the meantime, Hollberg said, if a major earthquake were to hit Florence directly, every museum in the city would endure some destruction, not just the Accademia. I found this, somehow, not comforting at all. For now, and for the foreseeable future, we would just have to trust the David to keep standing.Advertisement"}

Stewart on \u2018Powerhouse\u2019", "Date": "2016-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.James Andrew Miller\u2019s \u201cPowerhouse: The Untold Story of Hollywood\u2019s Creative Artists Agency\u201d has a terrific subject for a sprawling narrative, since CAA has been at the vortex of Hollywood and commerce for more than four decades. The story has great characters, plenty of boldface names and surprising twists.\u201cAlmost any of Shakespeare\u2019s political tragedies, or comedies, could serve as road maps to the backstage drama surrounding CAA through the decades,\u201d Miller writes. \u201cCAA long ago ceased to be a traditional talent agency, and what started out as a television representation business had since spiraled into movies, music, investment banking, advertising, marketing and most recently, sports.\u201dAs in his previous books (with a co-\u00adauthor, Tom Shales), \u201cLive From New York\u201d (about \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d) and \u201cThose Guys Have All the Fun\u201d (ESPN), Miller is mostly an invisible hand. \u201cPowerhouse\u201d is largely a series of direct quotations strung together in more or less chronological and topical order. While I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to call the story \u201cuntold\u201d (many of the key events were widely reported and written about), Miller has done an extraordinary number of interviews (more than 500, he says), and simply organizing and piecing together this wealth of material is a feat. Even more impressive is Miller\u2019s ability to get nearly everyone involved not only to talk but also to go on the record, which is remarkable given the notorious culture of secrecy in Hollywood.Still, there are drawbacks to this approach. Few sources are naturally good storytellers, even in the entertainment business. It\u2019s hard for Miller to build up much narrative steam, and just when he gets it going, someone rambles off on a tangent. Some sections are filled with tedious details only an insider could \u00adappreciate.There are too many sources doubling as characters and too many walk-on appearances. (You get a sense of what you\u2019re in for when the cast of characters at the front of the book runs to 11 single-spaced, \u00addouble-columned \u00adpages.)Transitions are nonexistent, jarring or confusing. At times Miller has to abandon the quotations and supply some much-needed connective tissue. This is also an inefficient way to tell a story \u2014 I\u2019d estimate a more conventional narrative could have done the job in half the book\u2019s 700-plus pages. But for readers with the patience to sift through all this semi-raw material, \u201cPowerhouse\u201d delivers a chronicle of vaunting ambition, immense wealth and power, and personal betrayal all the more astonishing in a business ostensibly built on loyalty and trust.Michael Ovitz and Ron Meyer, the most important of the five co-founders of CAA, loom large as both quoted sources and the most fully developed and fascinating characters. They had a remarkably close and symbiotic relationship, Meyer warm and affable, Ovitz cerebral and tough. \u201cI didn\u2019t trust anyone in my life more than Ron Meyer \u2014 no one, except for maybe my wife,\u201d Ovitz says.They had help from others, but it was their fierce determination, hard work and single-minded devotion to clients and CAA that turned a fledgling talent agency into an entertainment colossus. It\u2019s no wonder being an agent is a young person\u2019s job: The actress Ali MacGraw packed her suitcase and walked out of a passionate romance with Meyer when he wouldn\u2019t get off the phone with a client early one Saturday morning. (He says he doesn\u2019t blame her.)Ovitz was once widely acknowledged as the most powerful man in Hollywood, perhaps the most powerful business person in Hollywood ever (at his peak even President Clinton was eating out of his hand). When Earvin (Magic) Johnson suggested Ovitz might someday run a studio, he replied: \u201cEarvin, I don\u2019t have to run a studio. I run them all now anyway.\u201dThen Ovitz overreached and fell ignobly to earth. He blew opportunities to run two major studios \u2014 Universal and Sony \u2014 by making outrageous demands for autonomy and compensation. But why wouldn\u2019t he have? He\u2019d built a career on outrageous demands \u2014 for both himself and his clients \u2014 and they were invariably met.After CAA orchestrated the wildly successful 1993 polar bear ad campaign for Coca-Cola, a senior Coke executive put a $10 million check, payable to Ovitz, in the hands of a toy polar bear and had it delivered to the company. Ovitz returned the check, unendorsed, with a sticky note: \u201cLet\u2019s discuss this.\u201d Ovitz eventually got $31 million.In 1995 Meyer was sent by Ovitz to New York to meet Edgar Bronfman Jr. (the Seagram\u2019s heir and chief executive, who had just gained control of Universal) and to salvage Ovitz\u2019s shot at running the studio. Meyer emerged with the job himself. \u201cThat\u2019s when Ron lost me as a friend,\u201d Judy Ovitz says. \u201cHe turned around and took the job that should have gone to Michael.\u201d Ovitz, who never missed an hour let alone a day of work, was so stunned and depressed, people said, that he didn\u2019t come into the office for a week.With Meyer out and a new generation at CAA \u2014 the so-called Young Turks \u2014 chafing to take over, Ovitz\u2019s days at the agency he founded were numbered. In his own telling, he was \u201cburned out.\u201dFor an exit commensurate with his stature, Ovitz accepted an offer from Michael Eisner to be president of Disney. After Meyer, Ovitz probably considered Eisner his best friend, and their two families had been close for years. Ovitz thought \u2014 \u00aderroneously \u2014 they\u2019d be running the company as equals. Eisner fired Ovitz after little more than a year.A measure of Ovitz\u2019s power was the vindictiveness with which former friends and colleagues greeted his downfall \u2014 none more so than his successors at CAA. As Miller puts it, \u201cJust about anybody in Hollywood with a triple-digit I.Q. heard, firsthand or remotely, about how much the Young Turks resented and even \u00adhated him.\u201d This seems especially ungrateful since Ovitz had paid them lavishly, \u00adhanded them clients, built the agency and then sold it to them for the bargain price of $175 million. (By 2010, it was valued at $700 million.)True, the Turks \u2014 Kevin Huvane, Bryan Lourd, Richard Lovett, Jay Moloney and David O\u2019Connor \u2014 thought they\u2019d been lied to or misled about matters large and small: who earned what; whether CAA owned a private jet; who had an equity stake in CAA\u2019s headquarters building. But none of that seems adequate to explain the intensity of their resentment (which the more genial Meyer seems to have escaped). Miller speculates: \u201cThe Young Turks were prodigal sons, with the agency functioning like the trust fund a rich kid gets when turning 25.\u201dBut the Turks seem to have risen to the challenge. They had to cope not only with the inevitable upheavals that accompany succession but also with tectonic changes in the entertainment business, starting with the collapse of the DVD market and the withering of revenues from feature films, which once contributed the major portion of CAA\u2019s profits.These new leaders had to rethink the nature of the agency business, pushing boldly beyond marketing and investment banking, the expanded boundaries Ovitz and Meyer had laid down. It\u2019s hard to manage change of that magnitude.For CAA, the biggest financial change came in 2010, when it sold a 35 percent stake to one of the biggest and most successful private equity firms, TPG Capital, for $166 million. TPG got a majority share four years later in a financing deal that raised another $435 million, which lifted the value of CAA to more than $1\u202fbillion. The infusion of capital enabled the company to become a principal \u2014 not just an intermediary \u2014 by investing its own capital in projects.It\u2019s too soon to know how that\u2019s going to turn out. We may find out if and when CAA is sold again or goes public, which, for a private equity firm like TPG, would typically be seven to nine years after making the investment.Miller suggests CAA\u2019s best days are behind it. Today, only three of the Young Turks remain at the firm. Moloney, the one closest to Ovitz, who had been viewed as his chosen successor, died in 1999 after struggling with cocaine addiction, apparently by suicide. After 32 years at CAA, O\u2019Connor left in 2015 to become chief executive of Madison Square Garden.CAA is now big and impersonal and focused on the bottom line, which seems to have taken a lot of the fun out of being an agent there (not to mention reading about them). Even so, if money and power are the measure of success in Hollywood, then access to the hundreds of millions in capital TPG delivered gives CAA the potential to be far more powerful than anything Ovitz and Meyer ever envisioned.But money and power may not be the only or even best measure of success in Hollywood. Perhaps I\u2019m na\u00efve, but I came away from the book with the sense that CAA\u2019s most enduring legacy will be the impact its agents had on the lives and careers of their many clients, amply documented in \u201cPowerhouse.\u201d The best of the entertainment they created will be remembered long after CAA is gone.\u201cI think it\u2019s a ghastly way to make a living,\u201d Ali MacGraw says of the agent business. \u201cBut if you\u2019re really good at it like Ron was, you must gain some tremendous happiness by changing people\u2019s lives so dramatically.\u201dOvitz may still be reviled by some, but not his clients. \u201cI\u2019ve never known anybody like Mike Ovitz,\u201d David Letterman says. \u201cThere is nobody like him. He was such an overwhelming positive force, and in show business there are not many positive \u00adforces. He put me back on my feet. It\u2019s comparable to my heart surgery, for God\u2019s sake.\u201dJames B.

{"Headline": "The New Ideology of the New Cold War", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHAMBURG, Germany \u2014 In its heyday, Communism claimed that capitalism had betrayed the worker. So what should we make of Moscow\u2019s new battle cry, that democracy has betrayed the voter?It\u2019s a worldview that has become increasingly clear through the era of Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, via a mosaic of public political statements, off-the-record conversations with academics and intelligence insights. Let\u2019s call it \u201corderism.\u201dOrderism has started to challenge democracy in many parts of the world \u2014 Turkey, Poland, the Philippines. But Mr. Putin\u2019s Russia believes it holds the copyright on this formula, and sees it as the sharp end of the wedge it is trying to drive among the nations of the West.The ideology\u2019s basic political premise is that liberal democracy and international law have not lived up to their promise. Instead of creating stability, they have produced inequality and chaos. The secular religion worshiped in the Western parliaments was globalization (or, in the European Union\u2019s case, Europeanization). These beliefs, according to the orderists, overlooked the downsides.It is the same moral weakness and decadence, orderism warns, that preceded the fall of previous empires. Like Nero, the establishment is fiddling in its palaces while Rome burns.Orderism also claims that, on the global stage, international law is beaten into submission by the rules of the strongest, with terrible outcomes. Even the West, orderists claim, adheres to the global rule of law only when it suits its interests. When it doesn\u2019t, the United States and its allies ignore or circumvent United Nations provisions. Orderists believe that events in Ukraine in 2014 are Exhibit A for Western hypocrisy: The United States encouraged and financed a coup in Kiev, they say, and installed obedient politicians afterward. The rule of law and liberal multilateralism, they insist, are just Trojan horses, carrying the West closer and closer to their borders.Thus it is an act of self-defense for Russia, in the orderist worldview, to secure the Crimean Peninsula, with its sprawling Russian Navy port; to increase military spending; and to hold frequent military exercises along the Russian-NATO borders. Just as the West contained an aggressive East in the 20th century, orderism believes the East must now contain a megalomaniac and arrogant West to prevent the spread of even more chaos.Orderism prioritizes stability over democracy and offers an alternative to the moral abyss of laissez-faire societies. Russia stands as a model for this new social contract. This contract is built on patriotism, traditional gender roles, Orthodox Christianity, military strength and, at the top, a benevolent czar who will promise only as much as he can deliver (provided the public gives him sufficient support, he can deliver a lot). Orderism may not yet boast the same economic performance as liberalism, but its adherents insist that the cohesion and the common spirit of an orderly nation will allow it to outlive the inevitable downturn of the disorderly West.It\u2019s easy to see why, especially for those who have suffered dislocation and anomie under liberal democracy, orderism is appealing. But just as the utopian promises of Communism were merely a fig leaf for tyranny, the official face of orderism hides something much darker. Order is attractive only until it stifles, and then represses. Unchecked autocrats turn on the weakest and most vulnerable as scapegoats, and lash out in foreign misadventures to divert attention from problems at home. Society breaks down; fear reigns. Orderism ultimately fails to deliver on its own promises.What is striking, though, is how compatible orderism is with the attitudes of many voters in the United States and Europe. Donald J. Trump\u2019s campaign boils down to a promise of tough order. And the decision of British voters to leave the European Union, catalyzed by the promise of the U.K. Independence Party and others of an orderly, independent England, was nothing but an attempt to stop the frightening and discomfiting effects of globalization. Part of the difficulty in dealing with orderism is that it is ideological without being an ideology. It is mercurial, pragmatic and cynical; its meaning and values change to fit the circumstances.Yet, in tackling today\u2019s orderism, there is one lesson the West can draw from yesterday\u2019s fight against Communism. Western leaders must respond to criticisms of liberal democracy, not simply reject them as the product of an insidious, anti-liberal worldview. If Franklin D. Roosevelt and Western Europe\u2019s postwar leaders had dismissed calls for stronger welfare states as Communist-inspired, they would have invited revolution. Instead, they built progressive state institutions that drained the appeal of anti-liberalism.If jobs are lost and terrorist attacks are mounting, democratic politicians have to have the steady nerves and fresh ideas to carry out the necessary repair work. In this new clash of worldviews, we need a new generation of Roosevelts, Adenauers and Monnets, leaders who will take on orderism\u2019s challenge without lashing out at its adherents. A calm adversarial spirit is what can make democracy great again.Jochen Bittner is a political editor for the weekly newspaper Die Zeit and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In the U.S., VW Owners Get Cash. In Europe, They Get Plastic Tubes.", "Date": "2016-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe startling gap in treatment is the result of European laws that shield corporations from class-action suits brought by unhappy consumers. Now a group of online legal start-ups wants to change the status quo.The campaigns are attracting people like J\u00fcrgen Franz, a retired advertising executive in Munich who says his Volkswagen, a diesel Tiguan sport utility vehicle, burns more fuel after a software update that was part of a mandatory recall. He drives the same route every morning and now fills his tank more often.\u201cWhy are they getting so much and we\u2019re getting nothing?\u201d Mr. Franz said of American owners.Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers hope the efforts will signal a turning point in European jurisprudence, opening up a clearer path for aggrieved customers to join forces across borders to sue big corporations. The case could be the largest consumer action of its kind in Europe.Owners\u2019 representatives in Europe are seeking a maximum of 5,000 euros per car, or about $5,600, much less than in the United States. But even that figure could be financially devastating. There are 8.5 million tainted diesels in Europe, compared with about 500,000 in the United States that are covered by the settlement.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.European governments, traditionally deferential to Volkswagen, one of the region\u2019s largest employers, have joined in as well. The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, is coordinating efforts by national consumer groups to collect money from the carmaker. And the German state of Bavaria says it will sue Volkswagen on behalf of its employees\u2019 pension fund, which owns sharply devalued shares in the company.The biggest financial threat may come from new online businesses that have found ways around European obstacles to class-action suits.While laws vary, most European countries do not allow large class actions of the variety that led to the $15 billion settlement in the United States. Nor do many European countries, including Germany, allow lawyers to work on commission, so customers who sue companies risk paying not only their own legal fees but also the other side\u2019s if they lose.That is in contrast to the United States, where it is standard practice for lawyers to collect a hefty percentage of the award if a suit is successful and nothing if it\u2019s not.The start-ups are taking advantage of a loophole that allows European consumers to sign over their legal claims to third-party service providers, which then try to recover damages. And the internet has made it possible to recruit huge numbers of consumers who share similar gripes.People who search Google for the German words for \u201cVolkswagen damage claim\u201d see an ad for the website My-right.de, one of several start-ups using the internet to recruit Volkswagen owners. In Paris, Weclaim.com is attracting French customers. Both websites have teamed up with lawyers and are expanding into other European countries.The companies use technology to automate the laborious task of processing the claims, and usually find investors to finance legal costs in return for a share of the eventual judgment. The result is a de facto class action.\u201cThe model has existed for a long time,\u201d said Sven Bode, managing director of Financialright, the Hamburg-based company that owns My-right.de. \u201cWhat is new is that we can do it on a massive basis.\u201dMr. Bode has previously overseen efforts to help airline passengers obtain compensation for canceled or delayed flights, and to pressure banks to refund improper fees. But because Volkswagen is Europe\u2019s largest carmaker by far, Mr. Bode said, \u201cthis is a unique dimension.\u201dBecause the start-ups are considered collection agencies rather than law firms, they are allowed to work on commission. Clients who sign up agree to pay about a third of any money they collect, similar to contingency fees for lawyers in the United States. The Volkswagen owners owe nothing if the efforts to collect are unsuccessful.About 100,000 Volkswagen owners have registered with My-right.de so far, said Christopher Rother, managing partner of the law firm Hausfeld in Berlin, which is working with the website. The firm\u2019s founder, Michael Hausfeld, who is based in Washington, is one of the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers leading the class action against Volkswagen in the United States.That is only about 5 percent of the eligible owners in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Mr. Rother said the goal was to assemble at least 400,000 customers and collect up to \u20ac5,000 for each one.Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Pelouze, chief executive of Weclaim.com, the Paris-based website that is recruiting owners, said the carmaker was underestimating how vulnerable it was to new legal strategies. \u201cThe rules are changing, and I don\u2019t think Volkswagen is getting it,\u201d Mr. Pelouze said.For now, Volkswagen is standing firm.The American settlement allows owners to sell their cars back to Volkswagen at the pre-scandal price or take the cars in for an emissions upgrade, in addition to a cash payout of up to $10,000. All told, about $10 billion is earmarked for the buybacks, recalls and compensation, or about $20,000 per car.But the company has refused to give European owners any money or to buy back cars, disputing claims that diesels in Europe have lost value. It argues that dealers will be able to bring the cars in line with pollution standards without any decline in performance or fuel economy.Volkswagen has also refused to negotiate with owners\u2019 representatives. \u201cOur view is that there is no legal basis for customer claims,\u201d the company said in a statement.The carmaker has begun recalls in Germany that it plans to replicate in other countries. Vehicle owners will receive the software update and, in some cases, a tubular plastic \u201cflow transformer\u201d designed to improve air flow in the engine and to reduce emissions.That\u2019s it.But as in the United States, many people in Europe bought Volkswagen diesels thinking they were doing something good for the environment, only to learn that the cars emit far more poisonous nitrogen oxides than allowed.Guy Samson, a retired electrician who lives outside Paris, said that his friends gave him a hard time about his diesel Tiguan, and that its resale value had plunged.\u201cPeople, friends, they look at you and they kind of make fun of you behind your back,\u201d Mr. Samson said. \u201cEven to your face sometimes.\u201dMartin de Bourmont contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Soccer Team With International Flavor Mixes Drills and Assimilation", "Date": "2016-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn a blistering summer day in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens, an English soccer coach gave a pep talk to a group of 14 players as they sat attentively on a knee-high wall.Whether the message was getting through was open to debate; only a handful of the players arrayed before the coach, Jonathan Vaughan, spoke English as their first language.Ahmed Mohamed, a 17-year old from Alexandria, Egypt, had joined the team only days earlier. In doing so, he became part of a group that included players from Benin and Egypt, Nigeria and Guinea, Bangladesh, Jamaica and Uzbekistan. Mohamed joked that he had seen such ethnically diverse rosters at the elite levels of the game, where top clubs regularly scout and purchase the brightest talents from across the globe. But at the amateur level, a roster of similar diversity remains extremely rare.On his new club, though, it is the norm. Mohamed\u2019s team, Rooklyn International, has created its cosmopolitan mix by using soccer as a way to help young immigrants in New York City \u2014 newcomers, asylum seekers and refugees \u2014 integrate with other teenagers who find themselves in a similar situation.\u201cAt the end of the day, we are the same people,\u201d said Md Ayub Nabi, 19, who moved to New York from Bangladesh five years ago and joined Rooklyn International despite having little experience with the game before he arrived in the United States.Since March, Rooklyn has attracted recruits from at least 10 nations. Last year, 53 players attended one or more Rooklyn practices or games; those players, ages 14 to 20, had roots in 15 countries and spoke 10 languages.Elisha Aninye, a 19-year-old who moved to New York from Lagos, Nigeria, in November 2015, said he had joined Rooklyn\u2019s program to \u201cgain new skills and meet new lads.\u201d Aninye was the captain of Rooklyn that day in the park, where he and his teammates wore matching yellow jerseys provided as part of a league organized by the New York Police Department.Despite their wide-ranging backgrounds and their varied understanding of Vaughan\u2019s instructions and mannerisms, Rooklyn looked very much like a unit. But the program\u2019s roots stretch back to a time when Rooklyn the team wasn\u2019t even Rooklyn at all.In the spring of 2008, Soccer Without Borders, an international organization with the same soccer-based integrative goals as Rooklyn, decided to set up a New York chapter through an agreement with the International Rescue Committee, a nonprofit humanitarian group. Seeking a unifying thread for the children of the families it was resettling, the organizations arranged occasional volunteer-led pickup soccer games for the city\u2019s immigrant youth, focusing on the social elements of the sport, rather than the competitive ones.Players of varying abilities came and went, but by April 2013 organizers began to see a shift in intentions of the immigrants who were coming to the program.\u201cThey wanted to play in M.L.S., for Manchester United or Real Madrid,\u201d said Prospero Herrera, Rooklyn\u2019s co-director and coach. \u201cWe asked the players what they wanted to be in the future, and they said soccer players.\u201d\u201cThe kids come to me often and say, \u2018Where can I play outside of the school?\u2019\u201d said Paul Allen, the soccer coach at Brooklyn International High School. \u201cUnfortunately, in my experience, there are club teams all over New York, but some of them are really competitive, and for some there are costs involved. So the greatest thing is that here is another place for the kids to have organized athletics.\u201dThe school\u2019s focus is mirrored in the weekend training sessions that Herrera, 29, oversees at McLaughlin Park in Brooklyn. Players are encouraged to introduce themselves in English to an ever-changing group, stating their names, ages, home countries, how long they have lived in New York and how long they have been playing soccer. Some find the task comfortable; others look to teammates who may know the words they seek.For some of Rooklyn\u2019s competitive matches last year, the roster was \u201cbetween 65 and 75 percent refugees or asylees,\u201d Herrera said. That percentage is likely to decrease this year, he added, as many players from the group are either too old to play in competitive games or have left to attend college.\u201cWhen I came here, many people helped me,\u201d said Mohamed Condoe, 20, a former refugee from Guinea who played for Rooklyn last year. \u201cFootball helped me because my family do not speak much English.\u201dCondoe now works as a delivery person. While he is too old to play in competitive matches, he has tried to remain a part of the Rooklyn program.Next year, with its agreement with the International Rescue Committee now expired, organizers intend to reach out to new groups that work with refugees, asylum seekers and young immigrants.Currently reliant on donations and the work of a handful of volunteers, Rooklyn\u2019s organizers are also in the process of applying for nonprofit status, which they hope will allow them to finance a part-time position to oversee the program\u2019s expansion. This change, Herrera said, could mean more practice sessions, the introduction of a girls team and joining a year-round recreational league.Though some Rooklyn players were clearly much younger than their opposition this summer, even the youngest ones, at 14, were given equal playing time \u2014 part of the club\u2019s focus on social integration over on-field results. Between the two matches Rooklyn played on a scorching hot day in July \u2014 both of which ended in narrow defeats \u2014 Steben Houenou, 15, of Porto-Novo, Benin, explained to some of his teammates how much he liked the food in New York, especially the cheesecake, which he had not tasted before moving to the United States three years ago.For the other young immigrants, the universal topic of conversation for a group brought together by soccer was, not surprisingly, soccer. Messi or Ronaldo? Barcelona or Real Madrid?\u201cTo me, it\u2019s about integration,\u201d Vaughan said of the Rooklyn program. \u201cYoung people using soccer and coming together in a safe spot.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Very Tall Rental in Prospect-Lefferts Gardens", "Date": "2016-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by6 PhotosThe height of the building was at the heart of a lawsuit filed in 2013 by neighbors and community groups that said the project would ruin views from the park and cast shadows over nearby gardens. While the legal action prompted a temporary work stoppage, it ultimately fell short of its goal. Today the building is just as tall as planned.For its part, Hudson is looking forward.\u201cThere were a lot of concerns about this building changing the neighborhood,\u201d said Alison Novak, a Hudson principal. But because the Parkline has affordable apartments as well as market-rate ones, concerns about shadows should be secondary, Ms. Novak said: \u201cI would lean toward: It\u2019s more important to have a mixed-income building in a neighborhood that\u2019s experiencing economic pressure.\u201dThe light-filled apartments have Caesarstone counters, Bosch washers and dryers, and walls covered in subway tile, arranged unusually in vertical rows.As with many recent rentals, the Parkline has loaded on the amenities. On the second floor is a theater with three tiers of seats and on the third floor, a window-lined gym and a terrace for yoga. Close to that terrace are beds where residents can plant vegetables, for about $12 a month. The Parkline\u2019s top story offers spacious rooms and terraces for lounging or giving parties, though fees are charged for the use of some areas.Since the leasing office opened in early July, about 20 leases have been signed, and move-ins began at the end of July, according to Hudson.One-bedrooms start at $2,775 a month, but with a concession of a month of free rent on a 13-month lease, the monthly net price works out to $2,561.Yisroel Pruss, a salesman with Brick & Galo Realty who grew up in next-door Crown Heights and works as a rental agent in the area, said one-bedrooms nearby average $1,600 to $1,700 a month. But most rentals are in prewar buildings with few amenities.The $92 million Parkline project, which was financed with $72 million in state housing bonds, also has 51 apartments set aside for lower-income renters, all of which have been awarded by lottery.The lawsuit, which named Hudson as well as state agencies involved in the project\u2019s financing, warned that the Parkline would bring noise and congestion, and ruin views. A state judge halted construction on the project in the spring of 2014, but after about two weeks the restraining order was lifted and the project resumed.The suit apparently did not speak for the whole neighborhood, however.\u201cWhen they came to me, I didn\u2019t have an issue, because I thought the building was a big plus for the neighborhood,\u201d said Sandra Marshall-Haye, the owner of Tafari Tribe, a Flatbush store offering tie-dyed T-shirts in exchange for a coupon that is part of the Parkline\u2019s marketing campaign. \u201cIt steps it up a little bit.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Ecosystem Where Start-Ups Help Other Start-Ups", "Date": "2016-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen start-ups begin, it\u2019s akin to Joseph Campbell\u2019s mythical hero\u2019s journey. Instead of battling hydras and gorgons alone, entrepreneurs often help each other face obstacles like entrenched markets, financing and abject fear of failure.Although there are no precise estimates on how many such ecosystems exist, the Kauffman Foundation, a research organization focusing on entrepreneurship, found that nearly every one of the more than 360 major metropolitan areas in the United States had such a network in place.ContextMedia provides customized health care information on screens at doctors\u2019 offices and other sites. Doctors can show patients digital 3-D anatomical diagrams of procedures using ContextMedia \u201cwallboards\u201d or tablets. Their material is now viewed by more than six million patients a month at 25,000 medical practices or health care locations.The company is also working with the Mayo Clinic to bring their media content directly to hospitals and physician offices.More than 400 people work at the company, whose revenue last year was $63.5 million. It hopes to add more than 200 workers by the end of the year.Although ContextMedia has made inroads into a notoriously difficult market to crack \u2014 doctors\u2019 waiting and examination rooms \u2014 it was done without venture capitalists, who weren\u2019t willing to take a risk, Ms. Agarwal said. Support from the Chicago entrepreneurial community not only got her company started, but it also helped the company clear some high hurdles.Professors at Northwestern first helped Mr. Shah and Ms. Agarwal. And the founders \u201cbootstrapped,\u201d or self-funded, their enterprise during the recession.\u201cIn 2008-2009, we slowed down,\u201d Ms. Agarwal said, \u201cso we had to reconnect to our journey, which was our passion for changing health care.\u201d With the Jumpstart fund, she says she now wants to \u201cpay it forward\u201d to other entrepreneurs.An ecosystem also offers social and psychological support. What fuels entrepreneurial success, Ms. Agarwal noted, are passion and purpose. When she started her company, she wanted an enterprise that would have a positive social and personal impact. She started with diabetes education, a disease that affected both her and Mr. Shah\u2019s relatives in India.When Ms. Agarwal interviews candidates for the Jumpstart Ventures portfolio, she wants to find like-minded people who are \u201cpassionate about their mission.\u201dMert Iseri, co-founder and chief executive of SwipeSense, a company focused on reducing hospital infections, was someone who fit the bill. Also a former Northwestern student, he met Ms. Agarwal in 2012.\u201cShradha became our first investor and gave us our first check for $25,000 and employed \u2018radical candor,\u2019\u201d in her mentoring, Mr. Iseri said. That included discussions about tough decisions that had to be made when building a business, such as hiring, firing and determining long-term goals.\u201cIt is always difficult to fire someone,\u201d Mr. Iseri said. He described one situation where a sales representative was a high performer but didn\u2019t fit the culture at SwipeSense. \u201cShradha was very clear; her direct feedback was to part ways right then and there, and she highlighted that no amount of short-term results can justify holding on to folks who won\u2019t be long-term members of the team.\u201dMr. Iseri would not disclose his company\u2019s sales but said it had \u201cannual revenues in the seven figures\u201d and was \u201cexperiencing significant month-over-month growth\u201d with its customers.Ms. Agarwal, her employees, co-investors and angel investors have also bolstered entrepreneurs by simply being nearby and giving direct guidance.\u201cWe\u2019ve been in seven office spaces since we were founded four years ago,\u201d said Jessica Tenuta, a co-founder and head of design of Packback. \u201cShradha showed us how to hire and incorporate our values while mentoring us. We made great connections while being in their space.\u201dMs. Tenuta and Packback\u2019s co-founders \u2014 Kasey Gandham, Nick Currier and Mike Shannon \u2014 have also garnered support in other ways. The company works with 1871, a business incubator in Chicago that offers classes, co-working spaces and access to venture capitalists.Ms. Tenuta did not disclose her company\u2019s sales revenue but said the firm expects to have 30,000 students using Packback in the 2016-17 school year, up from 10,000 students in the previous year.For their part, Mr. Iseri and Ms. Tenuta were inspired by their experiences to mentor other start-ups. These may be at university-based or private incubators and accelerators, in co-working environments or through other angel investors and venture capitalists.Ms. Agarwal characterized the payoff as \u201cthe communal support through learning, wellness and volunteer opportunities.\u201dShe added that her enterprise and those she backs have \u201ca bias toward action and scaling to the market.\u201d That means an entrepreneur\u2019s vision must eventually translate into revenues, profit, growth and a commitment to giving back to the community and other entrepreneurs.The network of support offered by start-up ecosystems, though, won\u2019t get entrepreneurs entirely past the fear of failure and rejection. A plunge into the unknown is part of making it past those perilous first years.\u201cWhen I was a girl, my mother pushed me into the deep end of a pool to get me to swim,\u201d recalled Ms. Agarwal, who grew up in India. \u201cShe said it was the only way to learn. She was one of four daughters in her family, all of whom were pushed to earn college degrees by my grandmother.\u201dIf Ms. Agarwal and her peers succeed, their companies will also contribute to social good such as better medical education and improved health outcomes.They will, in her words, be \u201csolving problems worth solving.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can the States Save American Democracy?", "Date": "2016-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionWASHINGTON \u2014 In this tumultuous election year, little attention has focused on the groundswell of support for political reform across grass-roots America. Beyond Bernie Sanders\u2019s call for a political revolution, a broad array of state-level citizen movements are pressing for reforms against Citizens United, gerrymandering and campaign megadonors to give average voters more voice, make elections more competitive, and ease gridlock in Congress.This populist backlash is in reaction to two monumental developments in 2010: the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United ruling authorizing unlimited corporate campaign donations, and a Republican strategy to rig congressional districts. Together, they have changed the dynamics of American politics.That January, Justice John Paul Stevens warned in his dissent that Citizens United would \u201cunleash the floodgates\u201d of corporate money into political campaigns, and so it has. The overall funding flood this year is expected to surpass the record of $7 billion spent in 2012.Later in 2010, the Republican Party\u2019s \u201cRedmap\u201d strategy won the party control of enough state governments to gerrymander congressional districts across the nation the following year. One result: In the 2014 elections, Republicans won 50.7 percent of the popular vote and reaped a 59-seat majority.Now, with Congress often gridlocked by Republicans from those safe districts, the initiative on reform has shifted to the states. Insurgency has spread beyond California and New York to unlikely Republican bastions like Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Nebraska and South Dakota.At this point, 17 states have become reform battlegrounds. In six, lawsuits are challenging racial or partisan gerrymandering, and in five more, that goal is being pursued by popular movements, state governors or legislative bodies. This summer, federal courts have ruled in favor of suits seeking to strike down strict photo-identification requirements in Texas, North Carolina and North Dakota. The courts found that the requirements discriminated against minorities, and often seniors and students. Other citizen lawsuits have won restoration of early voting days in Ohio and straight-ticket voting for Michigan.South Dakota and Washington State are holding referendums on proposals for more transparent elections; similar petition drives fell just short of success in Arizona and Idaho. This year, reformers in California, New York and Washington State have been mustering votes to press Congress to control campaign funding and ban corporate campaign contributions.In 2014, a Democratic amendment proposal to allow regulation and limits on electoral spending won a 54-42 majority in the Senate, strictly along party lines, but fell short of the 60 votes needed to prevent a filibuster. Now bills calling for a 6-to-1 match of public funds for small campaign donations up to $150, or requiring disclosure of funders for campaign ads, have wide Democratic support, but are blocked by Republican opposition.Yet out in the country, even in some reliably red states, reform movements have sprouted. South Dakota is one, thanks to three petition drives. One seeks to make primaries nonpartisan and another calls for an independent redistricting commission. A third is for a ballot measure, similar to one in Washington State, that would create a $50 tax credit for each voter to donate to a political candidate; ban campaign contributions exceeding $100 from lobbyists and state contractors; and mandate that independent groups speedily disclose the top five contributors to political ads and electioneering communications made within 60 days of an election.In April, Nebraska\u2019s Republican-dominated Legislature voted 29-15 to set up an independent redistricting commission. Gov. Pete Ricketts, a Republican, vetoed the bill, but reformist legislators promise a revised proposal in the next session.Groups like Independentvoting.org, which has grass-roots organizations in 40 states, are mobilizing against the de facto disenfranchisement of independent voters (who now outnumber both Democrats and Republicans) through the gerrymandering of nearly 90 percent of the nation\u2019s congressional districts into one-party monopolies. In states with closed primaries, this denies independents any vote in the primaries, which makes them favorable turf for extremist candidates in the only seriously contested voting.In addition, nonpartisan local-election primaries, in which all voters can choose any candidate without regard for party, are being pushed by a citizens movement in South Dakota. Louisiana, California and Washington State already use them.Two dozen states have attacked gerrymandering head-on. Eleven have set up independent redistricting commissions or other politically neutral mechanisms. Legal challenges have been mounted in half a dozen others. In seven more, including Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania, popular movements, state legislatures and even the Republican governors Larry Hogan of Maryland, John Kasich of Ohio and Mike Pence of Indiana, who is now Donald J. Trump\u2019s running mate, have said it\u2019s time to outlaw gerrymandering.In April, Governor Kasich won resounding applause from the Ohio Legislature when he called for an end to gerrymandering: \u201cWhen pure politics is what drives these kinds of decisions, the result is polarization and division. I think we\u2019ve had enough of that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Today\u2019s preteens weren\u2019t even alive in 2001; for them the 9/11 attacks live in the same mental hinterland as, say, D-Day.Of course, that doesn\u2019t mean these kids aren\u2019t living in a world indelibly marked by what happened that day. With the 15th anniversary coming up, the latest crop of children\u2019s books on the topic are less about processing a tragedy than about finding new ways to introduce one. Wise, then, that two standout novels have set their events not on Sept. 11, 2001, but before and after it.Nora Raleigh Baskin\u2019s \u201cNine, Ten\u201d \u00adfocuses on the lives of four kids in the days leading up to the attacks. The benefits of Baskin\u2019s choice are clear: Since readers know that a tragedy is impending, there\u2019s dramatic tension in reading about these otherwise ordinary lives. When \u00adAimee fights with her mother, who \u201cworked in finance, for a company called Cantor Fitzgerald,\u201d a reader may feel dread for reasons Aimee can\u2019t know.Doing justice to four separate story threads in under 200 pages is a tall task, and fewer protagonists would have allowed more depth. But Baskin creates sharply defined, emotionally compelling characters in a few elegant words. Besides Aimee there\u2019s Sergio, whose fury at his deadbeat father leads to his jumping a subway turnstile and meeting a first responder as a result; Will, who lives near the future crash site of Flight 93 and has just lost his father, straddling \u201can invisible wall between the world out there, where his father\u2019s death wasn\u2019t ever-present, and the world in here, where it always was\u201d; and Naheed, who comes to realize that wearing her hijab in a culture that fears Muslims is \u201cnothing less than a unifying act of faith and bravery.\u201dDaringly, Baskin saves the events of 9/11 for the last act, effectively ending her book with its inciting event. When the attacks finally occur, Baskin leaves the characters\u2019 viewpoints to narrate the events dispassionately, starkly setting out facts of timing and numbers of dead. Doing so prevents any hint of sensationalism or manipulation, and puts the novel at a glossy remove. Though some might wonder if a calm and bloodless novel about 9/11 misses the point, its poise allows \u201cNine, Ten\u201d to honor the emotional distance many kids today feel from the tragedy.In one scene of Jewell Parker Rhodes\u2019s powerful, cleareyed \u201cTowers Falling,\u201d 10-year-old D\u00e8ja huddles at a cafeteria table with her friends, secretly watching on a cellphone as people jump from a burning skyscraper. The video is 15 years old, but finally seeing the forbidden images hammers in the abstractions of a long-past tragedy. In their fifth-grade class, Miss Garcia shows a poster of Manhattan with two towers instead of one, and it takes them many minutes to realize the difference: The twin towers are \u201clike teeth pulled.\u201d Rhodes doesn\u2019t assume her readers know the magnitude of 9/11; she walks them tenderly through it.D\u00e8ja\u2019s family recently entered a homeless shelter, which means she now attends an integrated school in Brooklyn. She feels she\u2019s lagging behind the kids in her class, like nerdy Ben and upbeat \u00adSabeen. In D\u00e8ja, Rhodes offers a believable portrayal of the kid who feels as if she\u2019s always giving the wrong answers in class, leading to sulking and outbursts.Though Miss Garcia\u2019s assignment to explore 9/11 is the central mechanism of \u201cTowers Falling,\u201d Rhodes brings the narrative closer to D\u00e8ja\u2019s home in the tale of her father, who suffers from a mysterious ailment. He\u2019s never acknowledged that his chain of joblessness began with the attacks. It\u2019s a welcome exploration of the long-ranging costs of 9/11, even if his back story won\u2019t surprise even the youngest readers, and his sudden turn from nonverbal to hyperarticulate may ring false.Wise to the priorities of their young audience, both these novels focus on 9/11\u2019s impact on the home front. Maybe that is unnecessarily narrow, all the same: While many will conclude, like D\u00e8ja, that \u201cthe terrorists hate us because we believe in freedom,\u201d I do wonder if they might have benefited from even a line or two proposing more nuanced reasons behind terrorists\u2019 anger toward the United States, or about America\u2019s subsequent involvement in wars that are still playing out.Eliot Schrefer is the author, most recently, of the young adult novel \u201cRescued.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cuomo Moves to Revive a Dormant Housing Aid Program", "Date": "2016-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe administration of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has offered developers and union officials a wage subsidy for construction workers in the hopes of reviving a dormant program that has generated thousands of apartments for poor and moderate-income New Yorkers, and saved property owners tens of millions of dollars in property taxes.The program, known as 421-a, expired in January, prompting concerns that developers \u2014 deterred by rocketing land prices \u2014 would not build rental housing.The creation of more affordable housing has been one of the most important issues for Mr. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio, both Democrats, in recognition of the soaring rents in neighborhoods throughout New York City over the past decade, and the growing number of people who spend more than half their income on shelter.The governor\u2019s proposal, which would set wage rates for government-assisted projects in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens, emerged from secret talks over the past two weeks among Bill J. Mulrow, the governor\u2019s secretary; John H. Banks, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, widely known as Rebny; and Gary LaBarbera, president of the Building and Construction Trades Council.The proposal, as outlined in a skeletal, single-page memo sent to the residential developers on Tuesday night, assured them that they would not be required to hire a union work force, or to pay \u201cprevailing,\u201d or union-level, wages.The plan would, however, set a two-tiered minimum wage for projects of 300 apartments or more in Manhattan and on the waterfront in Brooklyn and Queens. In Manhattan, south of 96th Street, any project seeking 421-a property tax abatements would have to pay an average wage of \u201cno less than\u201d $65 an hour, including benefits.Developers of projects on the East River in prime areas of Queens and Brooklyn would have to pay $50 an hour in wages and benefits \u2014 but 30 percent, or $15 an hour, would be reimbursed by New York State, the memo said.Developers would also be required to set aside 25 percent or 30 percent of the units in a project for below-market rents.It is not clear how the wage subsidy, which could run into the tens of millions of dollars, would be financed or how the program would be managed.In the past, the 421-a program offered a 20-year tax abatement for developers who set aside 20 percent of the apartments in a project for poor and moderate-income families. About 150,000 apartments qualified for 421-a benefits in 2014, resulting in $1.06 billion in forgiven taxes, according to city records.\u201cWe feel this is a viable resolution of the issue,\u201d Mr. LaBarbera, the union leader, said. \u201cIt\u2019s now up to Rebny to agree, or not. The ball\u2019s clearly in their court.\u201dThe proposal was presented at a hastily convened meeting of about 20 developers on Wednesday at the Lexington Avenue offices of the real estate board, a powerful lobbying and advocacy group, participants said. The developers took no action, and Rob Speyer, the group\u2019s chairman, asked them not to speak to the news media.The 45-year-old program was thrown into doubt 16 months ago when Mr. Cuomo insisted that he would not renew the state legislation governing the program unless it required developers to pay union-level wages in order to qualify for the tax benefits.The board balked, claiming that higher wages would increase construction costs by up to 30 percent, resulting in fewer subsidized units, or bigger subsidies.Union leaders, who have seen nonunion contractors gain a sizable foothold in New York over the past decade, countered that developers who got generous public subsidies should not get away with paying low wages.Mr. LaBarbera said the unions have made great strides to be more competitive with nonunion workers on wages, benefits and work rules.But the two sides never came to terms, allowing the 421-a program to lapse in January. Some supporters of the program criticized Mr. Cuomo for not taking a more active role in bringing about a compromise.Indeed, the new proposal may be the first concrete example of the Cuomo administration moving to forge an agreement between labor and real estate executives that would resurrect the program, and allow the governor\u2019s own $2 billion housing initiative to move forward. In June, the two sides had debated setting wage rates, but could not agree on the numbers.Dani Lever, a spokeswoman for the governor, said on Wednesday: \u201cIt is clear through ongoing discussions with Rebny and the labor unions that the city\u2019s original proposal does not provide the economics that would allow for union labor, and that it is unacceptable to the governor and Legislature. We are working on and considering new and various proposals with all stakeholders, but at this point there is no agreement on anything.\u201dNot so long ago, union contractors built just about every project in Manhattan, from water tunnels, convention centers and other public works to luxury apartment buildings in which 20 percent of the units were subsidized for low- and moderate-income families in return for 421-a property tax abatements.But over the last decade, land prices have soared and nonunion contractors, who pay substantially lower wages, have gotten a lot of work, including at high-rise residential towers. And those seeking more affordable housing in New York have been critical of the 421-a program, describing it as a giveaway to developers.Mindful of that criticism, Mr. de Blasio proposed several reforms in 2015 designed to extract more affordable housing for taxpayer subsidies. That proposal \u2014 made in coordination with the real estate board \u2014 would have made condominiums ineligible, while requiring developers to devote up to 30 percent of the units in a project for poor and working-class tenants, in return for a longer tax abatement. But that proposal was rebuffed by the governor.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rally Racing School Teaches the Basics of Controlled Mayhem", "Date": "2016-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheels8 PhotosDALTON, N.H. \u2014 It would seem a parent\u2019s nightmare.A 15-year-old without a driver\u2019s license was gleefully sliding the car sideways through turn after turn, the gas pedal floored and the occupants straining against their seatbelts as they were thrown from side to side.But the father, one of the back-seat passengers, nodded his approval.\u201cI want him to be better at everything than I am,\u201d Alex Dunser, a lawyer from Tampa, Fla., said of his teenage son, Lech, as the instructor in the front passenger seat critiqued the controlled chaos.The Dunsers were among the dozen students here recently for a $3,600, three-day course at the Team O\u2019Neil Rally School in northern New Hampshire.The school\u2019s main purpose is to impart the integral skills of rally racing, an off-track motorsport. Rallies involve cars racing against the clock, typically down narrow, twisting dirt or snow-covered roads at day or night.But many of the Team O\u2019Neil school\u2019s students take the classes for fun, or to learn crash-avoidance techniques. Or, in the case of members of the military\u2019s Special Operations forces who have taken the course, they learn how to drive under extreme duress on rough terrain.\u201cIt is a real road,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cIt is not designed to be driven fast on. If you fly off the road in a rally there are rocks, cliffs and trees, and everything is designed to kill you.\u201dEach year about 500 people take the course at this 600-acre complex. Most are seeking an automotive adventure with the additional benefit of learning to control a car in an emergency or on a slippery road, said Chris Cyr, the school\u2019s general manager.But some are intent on learning to race, and all come away with some basic skills for the sport. In North America, rally courses typically range from 10 to 20 miles on roads that are closed to the public. While speeds vary with the road conditions and the car, 70 miles per hour is not unusual, and the most powerful rally cars easily reach 100 m.p.h.\u201cRally is the best form of motorsports,\u201d Mr. Hanson told the class.Competing on a racetrack is relatively safe, he said, because there are grassy or gravel runoff areas to slow an errant vehicle. And racetrack drivers practice lap after lap, learning what each turn looks like and how to take it. But there are no practice runs in rallying.\u201cIn rally, either you are on the road or you crash,\u201d Mr. Hanson told the novices. \u201cIt\u2019s a little crazy, but I think you guys will like it.\u201dThe promised craziness began with six Ford Fiestas, each containing two students and an instructor, all wearing helmets. They were parked on the edge of a large open area called a skid pad, which a water truck had drenched to create a brown slurp.For the students, the foundation to rally driving is understanding how the transfer of the car\u2019s weight between the front and rear tires affects handling.Braking or letting up on the gas makes the front of the car dip and puts more weight on the front tires, giving them more grip. The lesser weight on the rear tires makes them more likely to slide.Accelerating shifts weight to the back of the car, making it squat and giving the rear tires more grip.In one of the Fiestas, the instructor, Allen Welch, explained to Amit Patel, 38, who works in finance in Des Moines, how to use his left foot to brake while still pushing down hard on the accelerator.\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to slow the car; we\u2019re just trying to put weight on the front to get the car to turn,\u201d said Mr. Welch, who previously spent more than a quarter century as a New Hampshire state trooper.Mr. Patel began slaloming among a half-dozen orange cones placed about 75 feet apart.\u201cPick up a little brake and add gas,\u201d Mr. Welch coached. \u201cGas, gas. More gas. You full throttle?\u201d he said as the high-revving 4-cylinder engine screamed over the squish of tires on mud and the click-click of stones being kicked up against the floor pan.Throughout the course the students were urged to go ever faster. This class was all male, but 10 percent of the students each year are girls and women. One of the instructors, too, is a woman: Duffi Pratt, an elementary-school teacher who has been a motorcycle racer and learned rally driving at Team O\u2019Neil.The instructor\u2019s main task, Ms. Pratt said, is to monitor students\u2019 use of braking, acceleration and steering and try to ensure that each happens at the right time, in the right sequence.\u201cIt\u2019s like a puzzle, putting the puzzle together until there is some success,\u201d she said.As the speeds increased, orange cones were clipped, smashed and dragged under cars. There were a few spinouts. One driver thumped lightly into a ditch. But it was an enthusiastic and increasingly skilled group.Chris Hess, a 22-year-old senior at Virginia Tech, and his father, Scott, shared one of the Fiestas and were among the fastest of the group. Their past adventures had included high-speed driving at racetracks, where they tired of driving lap after lap through the same turns.\u201cThe track is boring,\u2019\u2019 said the elder Mr. Hess, a software engineer from Alexandria, Va. \u201cThis seems like it is a thrill a minute because you don\u2019t know what is next.\u201dAs the class progressed, there was increasing emphasis on the principle of \u201clooking where you want to go.\u201dThat might seem obvious. But it is not, in the context of rally driving or navigating a road in bad weather. Sometimes the car may be sliding in a direction the driver does not want to go \u2014 like toward a tree.The idea is to focus not on that looming, scary tree, but where the driver would rather be going \u2014 even if it means looking out a side window. The brain tells the driver\u2019s hands how to direct the car. It is a leap of faith, but it works, the instructors say.By the third day the class was doing laps along a small loop of the school\u2019s six miles of private roads.Lech Dunser, the 15-year-old, was cornering confidently. \u201cIt\u2019s awesome,\u201d he said.He learned faster than some of the adults, and the instructors were not surprised.\u201cI think they are at an advantage because they haven\u2019t learned a lot of bad habits yet,\u201d said one of Lech\u2019s instructors, Alan Moody. \u201cThey learn the correct way to drive right off the bat.\u201dThat is precisely what his father wanted.\u201cMy thought is for him to have strong fundamentals of driving,\u201d Mr. Dunser said.There has been a debate for decades among auto safety researchers about the wisdom of teaching teens advanced driving techniques.Critics worry that such training encourages risk taking.Dr. Flaura Winston, the director of the Center for Child Injury Prevention Studies at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, argues that teenagers should first focus on learning to recognize and avoid dangerous situations. Learning skid control should come much later.Advocates of advanced driver training say it makes sense to give teenagers skills that can help them prevent a crash if they make a mistake.Mr. Hanson, the rally school\u2019s director of training, acknowledges the debate.\u201cWe can give them the car control skills, but judgment is something that is hard to teach,\u201d Mr. Hanson said. \u201cIt would definitely be something that their parents would have to work with outside our instruction.\u201dMr. Dunser said Lech was a long way from driving by himself. He cannot even apply for his Florida license until next year.\u201cI have also told him not to confuse knowledge with experience,\u201d Mr. Dunser said.\u201cMy focus now is to have Lech to drive with me in as many diverse situations as possible,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cI told him he will not be allowed to drive himself until I am convinced that he does this better than the vast majority of drivers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Canada Moves to Legalize Marijuana, Shop Owners Ask: Why Wait?", "Date": "2016-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVANCOUVER, British Columbia \u2014 The Cannabis Culture Lounge has everything a pothead might need to feel right at home: $3 marijuana buds, bongs for rent, bags of Skittles and Doritos for sale, and black leather couches where customers can recline in zoned-out contemplation in a pungent haze. Never mind that it is all technically prohibited by Canadian law.Mr. Trudeau has promised to make recreational marijuana legal in Canada as soon as next year, bypassing the nation\u2019s strict medical marijuana regulations. Under the latest rules for medical use, announced last week, patients must be registered, have a prescription and obtain their supplies only by mail from a government-licensed producer or by growing a limited amount privately.Impatient to test the shifting political boundaries, entrepreneurs have opened hundreds of illicit dispensaries across Canada, selling products like organic marijuana buds and potent cannabis concentrates, while local governments and the police have tended to look the other way.The marijuana boom they hope for has yet to materialize, though the Canadian government is now doing preliminary work on a measure to govern recreational use.And a lobbying battle is raging between the new entrepreneurs and the licensed medical marijuana producers, who were the only ones allowed to grow and provide the plant under the old regulations. One side complains about being shut out by a politically connected cartel, while the other complains about unfair and damaging competition from those who are breaking the law.The collision of money, politics and policing has made recreational marijuana a major test for Mr. Trudeau. How he solves it will be watched closely in Canada and the United States, where federal law bans marijuana but state laws are inconsistent.Mr. Blair said in an interview that the government\u2019s top priorities were to keep marijuana away from minors and the profits out of the hands of organized crime. That may point to a system similar to the way liquor is sold in some Canadian provinces and American states: strictly through government-owned or licensed stores.Some cities in British Columbia are unwilling to wait for Ottawa, though, and are introducing their own marijuana policies in defiance of federal law. The province has been a center of marijuana growing and culture for decades, and it borders Washington State, where recreational marijuana is legal \u2014 and extremely profitable.In Victoria, the provincial capital, where more than 30 dispensaries have opened in recent years, city leaders proposed new regulations in late July that would allow such businesses to operate if they abide by certain restrictions.Victoria is following Vancouver, which has begun issuing licenses to some of the 120 or so marijuana shops in the city, provided they comply with rules, like being at least 1,000 feet away from the nearest school. Two licenses were granted in the spring, and at least 11 more are in the pipeline, officials said.Krystian Wetulani, 32, who owns three shops, said he felt he was stuck in red tape. Only one of his shops has been approved, and he is appealing a denial for another. Fines are mounting while he seeks locations that will conform to regulations. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible,\u201d Mr. Wetulani said. \u201cLandlords hear the word \u2018weed\u2019 and just say no.\u201dThe city tolerates open use of illegal drugs in the neighborhood and a local safe-injection site for heroin users, but Farm still fell afoul of the distance restrictions in the new marijuana regulations, and had to win an appeal to stay open.Wang Jingzhi, 83, an immigrant who lives in the nearby Chinatown neighborhood, said she frequently bought marijuana from Farm to soothe the aches and pains of old age. \u201cWhenever I smoke it, my whole body feels better,\u201d she said in Chinese.Like many in the local marijuana business, Cait Hurley, 28, the dispensary\u2019s manager, said she was worried that new government regulations would favor corporate interests and exclude women and the working class. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fear this will all be taken away from us,\u201d she said.Mr. Rifici said he had no personal or political connection to the government\u2019s legalization process, but he acknowledged that the licensed companies \u201ctypically pull in people who know how to navigate government.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Mr. Miliovski said. \u201cThe fear is that it won\u2019t help all the people who have struggled and advocated and pushed to make this industry legitimate.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Some companies are blurring that line.The companies get the best of both worlds \u2014 all the rent and no need to fix up the properties. Tenants, however, often walk away with nothing. Many struggle to pay for the repairs. Others, meanwhile, find themselves facing evictions because they are not aware of the state the houses are in and cannot meet deadlines to bring the property up to scratch.\u201dFinancially, they kind of stuck it to me,\u201d said one person with a rent-to-own contract.

Yes, says Judith Fox, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame. \u201cYou can\u2019t have it both ways.\u201dA year ago, the government opened up programs that keep older and disabled Americans out of nursing homes to for-profit companies with the hope of expanding the services faster.The business appeal is clear.

{"Headline": "Badminton Patron and His Grandson Seek an Elusive Medal for the U.S.", "Date": "2016-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Pop quiz: What are the sports in which the United States has never won an Olympic medal?If you guessed badminton, handball and table tennis, you would be correct.That drought may not change in Rio \u2014 for one thing, the United States does not even have a handball team entered. But if badminton is ever to come off that unhappy list, Phillip Chew may be the reason.Chew, 22, is making his Olympic debut this week in men\u2019s doubles and mixed doubles, the culmination of two decades of grooming by his grandfather, Don Chew, one of the leading badminton patrons in the United States.Players from China, Malaysia and other Asian nations dominate badminton, so Chew has a ways to go. But after years on the periphery of the sport, he and the rest of the Americans are making headway. The United States has never had a bigger badminton contingent at the Olympics and for the first time has qualified in every discipline: men\u2019s and women\u2019s singles, men\u2019s and women\u2019s doubles, and mixed doubles.\u201cIt\u2019s a dream of mine to win a medal, but I know I\u2019m a long way off,\u201d Chew said. \u201cBut if the U.S. can somehow win a medal in badminton, it will make it a lot better because money will come into the sport because the U.S. has all the advertisements and power.\u201dLike numerous Olympic sports, in the United States, badminton lives in the shadow of baseball, football and basketball. It also has to battle the perception that it is a game for picnics.16 PhotosThe sport was rocked again last year when Lee Chong Wei of Malaysia, the world\u2019s top-ranked male singles player, was suspended for eight months for taking a banned substance. Another top men\u2019s singles player, Kento Momota, was caught gambling at an illegal casino in Japan and thrown off that country\u2019s Olympic team.The biggest concern in American badminton is not drugs or cheating but a lack of financing. Outside Asia, prize money in badminton is negligible. In a Catch-22 of sorts, the United States Olympic Committee tends to support sports whose athletes it believes can win medals. Meanwhile, badminton athletes have to play in tournaments around the world to collect enough points to qualify for the Olympics. Chew, for instance, has flown about a million miles over the past four years in his quest to represent the United States in Rio. That costs money.\u201cIt\u2019s really hard for the smaller sports without the money or sponsorship,\u201d said Dan Cloppas, the chief executive of U.S.A. Badminton, who said funding from the U.S.O.C. had been cut by a third. \u201cI\u2019ve gone out and tried to sell badminton, but we don\u2019t have the name recognition.\u201dDon Chew, a self-made millionaire who built his own printing and packaging company, has personally tried to fill those gaps. Chew created the Orange County Badminton Club in California, one of the best facilities in the Western Hemisphere. He has sponsored dozens of players, including several American Olympians.But Chew, 75, has focused most of his energy on his grandsons: Phillip and his younger brother, Ryan. He attached a shuttlecock to a fishing pole so that Phillip, as a toddler, could practice hitting it. He hired coaches, including several who had played in the Olympics. He hosted top players from Europe so Phillip had enough talented sparring partners.Chew and his wife accompanied Phillip and his two partners (Sattawat Pongnairat in men\u2019s doubles and Jamie Subandhi in mixed doubles) on nearly all of the 30 trips they made overseas over the past year, at a cost of about $500,000, or $100,000 more than the entire U.S.A. Badminton budget. In April, the five of them flew to Tahiti for one last tournament, at which Phillip earned the final points he needed to qualify for Rio.\u201cI loved badminton so much, and I saw it was popular in Asia, so I wanted to help the U.S. win a medal,\u201d Chew said.Phillip Chew has set more modest goals for his first trip to the Olympics. Just getting out of his groups, which include teams from powerhouses like South Korea would be an achievement. He lost twice on Thursday, with Jamie Subandhi in a mixed doubles group match against a South Korean team, and with Sattawat Pongnairat against Fu Haifeng and Zhang Nan of China.Chew said his style of controlling rallies instead of going for smashes was better suited to a new scoring system in which players can score even when they are not serving.Either way, Don Chew, who is in Rio to watch his grandson, is already looking ahead. After all, he said, Phillip is young enough to qualify for more Olympics.\u201cHe\u2019s got talent, and he loves to win,\u201d Don Chew said. \u201cHe has four more chances.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The transaction requires the approval this year of a majority of shareholders from both Tesla and SolarCity, excluding Mr. Musk and other insiders.Completion of the deal may come down to whether enough investors have the patience to accept the near-term headaches while waiting for Mr. Musk\u2019s long-term vision.His idea is that Tesla\u2019s batteries could store the power that SolarCity\u2019s panels have harnessed, a bet on the increasing use of solar energy. Most analysts, though, say this vision could take years, maybe even decades, to play out on a large scale \u2014 often longer than many investors tend to wait.\u201cI don\u2019t know why people would be voting in favor of it,\u201d said Efraim Levy, chief automotive analyst at Standard & Poor\u2019s Global Market Intelligence. \u201cThe valuation is excessive given the current prospects and the time horizon we\u2019re looking at.\u201dBut Mr. Musk, who also founded a third company with the hope of sending humans to Mars one day, is known for his visionary zeal.

It is expanding its assembly plant in California, in hopes of beginning to fill the more than 300,000 preorders for its coming Model 3 sedan by next year. To speed the process, Mr. Musk has overhauled his manufacturing team, bringing in new executives from rival automakers such as Audi.Tesla is also facing more pressure from federal regulators and Congress about its Autopilot assisted-driving system, which was operational in a Model S that crashed into the side of a tractor-trailer in Florida on May 7. The driver, Joshua Brown, was killed in the accident \u2014 the first known fatality in a vehicle being driven by computer technology.Tesla has until late August to respond to a set of detailed questions from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration about the accident, as well any others involving the Autopilot system, which includes assisted steering, adaptive cruise control, collision avoidance and emergency braking.The National Transportation Safety Board and the Senate Commerce Committee are also investigating the incident.The safety investigations may not directly affect the approval process for the proposed merger. But they could be seen as setbacks in Tesla\u2019s grand expansion strategy, and a distraction for Mr. Musk as he tries to win over investors.Monday\u2019s deal includes a so-called go-shop period, which enables SolarCity to continue soliciting proposals from other parties until Sept. 14.The two companies plan to cut about $150 million in costs through the transaction in the first full year after the deal closes. They expect customers to benefit through lower hardware and installation costs, and they plan to use Tesla\u2019s 190 stores to expand SolarCity\u2019s reach.Through Tesla\u2019s stores, SolarCity would get easier, cheaper access to millions of customers; SolarCity has struggled to reduce its customer acquisition costs. In addition, it could benefit from the carmaker\u2019s expertise in manufacturing, just as SolarCity prepares to produce its own solar panels at a heavily subsidized factory in Buffalo.Mr. Rive, of SolarCity, said in the conference call that he expected almost all solar systems to include battery storage within three to five years, and that the combined company would be able to prosper by providing those systems, along with energy services for the grid. Adding rooftop solar to the overall energy mix, Mr. Musk said, would allow utility companies to avoid building new substations and transmission lines as the rising use of electric vehicles and heating systems increases demand for power.The merger, he said, would help Tesla take better advantage of all the customers it attracts to its stores by offering them more products. Making the solar systems appealing, he said, was important.Although some investors have expressed support for the deal, many analysts and investors have continued to question whether it makes sense for the carmaker to take on SolarCity, which has piled on debt as it seeks to continue its aggressive expansion. Last month, SolarCity said it had raised $345 million in tax-equity financing and added $110 million to a loan agreement, bringing its total to $760 million.And on Monday, SolarCity reduced projections for residential system installations for 2016 by nearly 10 percent because the pace of installations had been slower than expected in the first half of the year.Many analysts are still optimistic that, despite the risks, the deal will ultimately get done.\u201cEverything about Elon is for the long term,\u201d said David Whiston, an analyst with Morningstar. \u201cI suspect the big, institutional shareholders understand that and they\u2019re all in on Elon, and I expect the large shareholders will vote yes for the deal.\u201dDiane Cardwell contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Goldman Sachs, Banker to the Elite, Turns to the Common Man", "Date": "2016-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreet SceneIt is not just coincidence that after 147 years of serving institutions and the ultra-wealthy, Goldman Sachs has decided that it will start catering to the common man: It is opportunism borne of necessity.The years since the financial crisis have not been particularly kind to Goldman Sachs\u2019s moneymaking machine \u2013 not that anyone is weeping for the company or the people who work there \u2014 despite an improving economy and record numbers of corporate financings and mergers and acquisitions. In the last three fiscal years, Goldman has made a cumulative pretax profit of about $33 billion. By contrast, JPMorgan Chase, the nation\u2019s biggest bank by assets, has had cumulative pretax profit of $87 billion, nearly three times more. In 2007, Goldman and JPMorgan were much more evenly matched when it came to profitability. Goldman made $17.6 billion in pretax profit in 2007; JPMorgan made nearly $23 billion.Of course, the two Wall Street behemoths have never been particularly comparable. JPMorgan has a huge retail banking presence, a huge credit card business and an enormous asset management business attached to an increasingly important investment bank. It also has 236,000 employees. Goldman has always been first and foremost an investment bank \u2014 the world\u2019s premiere \u2014 onto which it has tried with varying degrees of success to append, among other things, a wealth management business, an asset management business and a private equity business. It has 36,500 employees.That formula worked magnificently for Goldman for its first 138 years. But things have been much more of a struggle since 2008 for Goldman, thanks to regulators and lawmakers in Washington, who are intent on making sure that Wall Street never again takes the kinds of risks that turned into the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Washington wants Wall Street banks to become more like highly regulated utilities with profit capped. We can debate whether this is a good thing or a bad thing \u2014 personally, I am convinced that Washington\u2019s regulators have become arbitrary and capricious and are hurting Main Street by tying down Wall Street \u2014 but one thing is clear: The kind of clever risk-taking that Goldman specialized in \u2014 making big, and extremely profitable, bets with its own money \u2014 is outlawed for now (and probably for the foreseeable future).And here\u2019s why: In the zero-interest-rate environment that the Federal Reserve has carefully curated for eight years, Goldman and other banks can gather up money \u2014 the raw material they use to make more money \u2014 at virtually no cost. By opening an online bank, Goldman can gather up billions of dollars in consumer deposits without the cost of a physical branch and pay its customers close to nothing for their money. Goldman is offering to pay savers 1.05 percent annually. That may sound like close to zero, and it is, but the rate is also nearly 17 times more than the 0.06 percent annual interest rate that JPMorgan pays me on my savings account.Goldman\u2019s idea is to get people like me to move my money, of course. Sure, the 1.05 percent is a teaser rate, created to attract billions of dollars to Goldman\u2019s new venture. And it will no doubt work. Since April, GS Bank has collected $1.8 billion in deposits, essentially by word of mouth.Goldman will then take that raw material and use it to make more money, in large part by lending it out through its online lender Marcus, which aims at consumers looking to borrow around $20,000. Goldman will charge plenty more in interest for these loans than the 1 percent it is paying savers at GS Bank. Although its terms will not be known until Marcus rolls out officially in October, assume for the moment that the going rate for consumer loans of this nature \u2013 if both Lending Club and Prosper are useful guides \u2013 is around 12 percent. That difference \u2013 the 11 percentage points \u2013 is what Goldman will largely rake in as profit.Once upon a time, individuals needed a minimum of around $10 million in liquid assets, or cash, to be a client of Goldman Sachs\u2019s private bank. According to Quora, in the entire world, there are about one million people at that elite level of wealth. With Marcus and GS Bank, Goldman is hoping that millions more ordinary people will be a new source of riches. So if it floats your boat to be a client of Goldman Sachs, this is your big chance. Just remember that Goldman has never been, and will never be, a charitable organization.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "One Nation, Under Stress", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionIt\u2019s my go-to album when the world seems mad. A 45-year-old 45 wrapped in a dust jacket on my office floor, Marvin Gaye\u2019s \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On\u201d somehow seems more topical on each listen. The panoramas of racism, violence, environmental disaster, war and economic strife that Gaye paints are so prescient as to be eerie. The central idea that undergirds \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On\u201d is something between panic, bewilderment and resignation: Gaye sets out to identify what is wrong with the country but seems overwhelmed when the immensity of the answer stares back at him.As I write this, Alton Sterling and Philando Castile are barely at rest and hundreds have been arrested as protests spill into the streets. Five officers in Dallas lie slain by a sniper, and a toxic miasma of demagogy and xenophobia threatens to asphyxiate our democracy, pumped out by an \u00adorange-hued, straw-haired figure of malice. Even deeper, in the sinews of America\u2019s inner workings, the conversation around voting rights and social order seems primed to turn the clock back 100 years, political gridlock is now taken for granted, and the long-term effects of the Great Recession lie tick-tocking in wait. Fury is the temperature, and fear is the mood.Sarah Jaffe\u2019s \u201cNecessary Trouble: Americans in Revolt\u201d and Zachary Roth\u2019s \u201cThe Great Suppression: Voting Rights, Corporate Cash, and the Conservative Assault on Democracy\u201d both set out to identify the country\u2019s troubles, but unlike Gaye, Jaffe and Roth try to limit the scope of their examinations. Still, their conclusions are enormous. They are fishing for leviathans.Jaffe\u2019s book traces the rebirth and re-\u00adenvisioning of activism, direct action and protest over the past decade, reporting on movements as outwardly disparate as the Tea Party, Occupy Wall Street, modern labor organizing and Black Lives Matter. \u201cNecessary Trouble\u201d depicts the country as a pot set above the flames of economic discontent, ready to boil over. Jaffe, a journalist and a fellow at the Nation Institute, posits that what agitates these groups is economic injustice, and the book does well to set up the financial collapse of 2008 as the beginning of the great conflagration that set them all in motion. That collapse, Jaffe argues, may not be the event that explicitly drives union organizers or black protesters against police violence, but it was a signal that \u201cdemocracy, in this country, is failing, or perhaps, as some are coming to believe, that it never really worked.\u201dThe structure of \u201cNecessary Trouble\u201d is a bit tortuous, with the major issues \u2014 big banks, \u201cthe militarization of everything\u201d \u2014 divided into chapters. Since many of these are necessarily intertwined, Jaffe\u2019s work is an attempt to understand a behemoth by describing it from different angles. Where it works, it works, and the side-by-side profile of the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street as two diametrically opposed but fundamentally connected movements is especially striking. But sometimes the momentum of \u201cNecessary Trouble\u201d feels more like a series of hills and valleys than a buildup and a payoff, as characters from related movements flit in and out. For example, two chapters on black activism, a chapter on socialist challenges to capitalism and a chapter on the Moral Mondays movement in North Carolina might have been better presented as a single story rather than carved up as specific issues.But \u201cNecessary Trouble\u201d shines in its assessment of why those fault lines exist in the first place. Capitalism, Jaffe argues, promotes instability and class divisions, a dynamic that also animates what Barbara Ehrenreich called the \u201cfear of falling\u201d from one class to another. From the beginning, populism, which attempted to wrest power from big corporations, \u201cwas shaped in the image of white working men.\u201d Jaffe largely focuses on those left out of the struggle between traditional populism and corporations, including women and people of color, and her book finds the thread of economic injustice in every tapestry it weaves. In a contemplation of Freddie Gray\u2019s death and subsequent riots in Baltimore, Jaffe notes that \u201cthe people in \u2018those neighborhoods\u2019 were also blamed for causing the entire financial crisis.\u201dZachary Roth\u2019s \u201cThe Great Suppression\u201d is such a complement to Jaffe\u2019s book that the two feel as if they could have been written in tandem. While Jaffe states that \u201cNecessary Trouble\u201d is \u201cmostly not a book about electoral politics,\u201d it shows a pessimism about our current political system\u2019s ability to fix the problems Jaffe explores. \u201cThe Great Suppression,\u201d in turn, exposes the roots of that pessimism, enumerating conservative efforts to combat demographic changes by rolling back democracy itself.Roth, quoting a campaign finance expert, describes a newly gilded \u201cplatinum age\u201d of back-room deals in state houses, policy conferences and Washington cafes that have created what almost amounts to a fourth branch of government while simultaneously reducing the value of actual votes. A national reporter for MSNBC, he includes the voter ID laws and disenfranchisement that grab headlines today, but the bigger story in \u201cThe Great Suppression\u201d is one of a creative and increasingly desperate group of conservative scholars and politicians. They have reduced the ability of local municipalities to govern themselves by enabling gerrymandering, eliminating campaign finance oversight and encouraging judicial activism. They have even floated laws to get rid of public elections for senators and to thwart majority rule for the office of the president.Roth\u2019s book is similarly structured to Jaffe\u2019s \u201cNecessary Trouble,\u201d but the issues he specifies as the core of an antidemocratic agenda are discrete enough to move his story along in a more coherent fashion. Along the way, the book observes the tensions between the founding fathers\u2019 original wishes for a more limited, genteel democracy and the rights of minority groups, and how those tensions have intensified as minorities threaten to claim eventual numerical superiority and therefore political power. The conservative outlook, Roth notes, seems to be that \u201cdemocracy had worked fine when Americans were more homogenous.\u201dBoth books connect at certain moments: in their discussions of the Moral Mondays protests, for instance, and in their broader analyses of who is excluded from the American political landscape. \u201cThe Great Suppression\u201d ponders how the electoral interests of citizens are replaced with the interests of capital, and \u201cNecessary Trouble\u201d explores how many of those excluded groups \u2014 such as occupiers of foreclosed homes \u2014 use civil disobedience, social media and a revival of \u201960s-style activism to circumvent a corroded democratic process. Roth\u2019s critique is bolstered by the stunning tales of corporate malfeasance and unscrupulous profiteering that Jaffe identifies, from Walmart to Wall Street.With the news as it is, both \u201cNecessary Trouble\u201d and \u201cThe Great Suppression\u201d could have benefited from a bit more critical engagement with race as a central factor. Race and racism have a special place in today\u2019s unrest, and while the specter of racism hangs over both books, it is rarely considered as the raison d\u2019\u00eatre for the political suppression that Roth details and the rise of rage and activism that Jaffe explores. What is left in each book is a vital, yet necessarily incomplete, survey of what\u2019s going on in America. As Jaffe puts it, \u201cThe seeds have been planted by a thousand outrages.\u201dVann R.

{"Headline": "Trying to Turn Back the Clock on Deals Gone Sour", "Date": "2016-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDeal ProfessorLyondell Chemical and Basell AF completed their merger nearly nine years ago. Yet today, former shareholders of Lyondell face the possibility that a new court ruling could force them to pay back money \u2014 all $12.5 billion of it.Several such clawback cases over buyouts that were hammered out in the years before the financial crisis but later failed have resulted in thousands of shareholders now fighting to keep the money that was paid out to them.It had seemed so different at the time. In July 2007, with the merger market still a bit bubbly, the more than $20 billion leveraged buyout of Lyondell was announced. Basell borrowed the entire purchase price to create the third-largest chemical company in the world, paying $12.5 billion to shareholders and the rest in fees and debt refinancing.But the chemical industry soon spun into a decline, and in the financial crisis the combined company could simply not shoulder its debt. LyondellBasell entered bankruptcy in January 2009, only 13 months after the purchase was completed.With all that money at stake, the bankruptcy proceedings have been bitterly fought with the bankruptcy trustee \u2014 the person appointed to oversee the debtor\u2019s estate \u2014 pursuing everyone in sight.Not content with big fish, the bankruptcy trustee turned on Lyondell\u2019s old shareholders.In three lawsuits, the trustee argued that the sale of Lyondell was a fraudulent transfer. Dating to England in the 1500s, this is a principle that tries to prevent a debtor from simply transferring their assets to avoid payment of a debt. In its various forms, the doctrine voids transfers made with the intent to defraud creditors like the banks and others who lent over $20 billion to finance this debacle.The doctrine has had a rebirth in the wake of the financial crisis, with a particular vengeance for leveraged buyouts. In the years before the financial crisis, private equity was king, accounting for over 20 percent of takeovers. Debt was piled onto companies, as was the case with Lyondell, which was financed entirely with debt.This debt became an enormous dead weight in the wake of the financial crisis, dragging companies down as they struggled to keep up with payments. More than a few went bankrupt.In the bankruptcy cases that followed, claims of fraudulent transfer were sometimes brought, most prominently in the bankruptcy of the Tribune Company, which had been bought by Sam Zell in an $8.2 billion buyout.Such claims have come as a bombshell to the former shareholders of these companies. They thought the deal was long done. The money was paid out, and shareholders reinvested it in new stocks or perhaps a new kitchen. But like a ghost from the past, a bankruptcy trustee knocks on the door years later, demanding repayment.Even if the trustee does not succeed, the shareholders face legal costs to try and prevent repayment. In the Lyondell case, the trustee sued shareholders who received more than $100,000. He then included everyone, down to a grandparent in Florida who owned 10 shares. And in a lawsuit you need to hire a lawyer.The plaintiffs claimed that there was actual intent here as a result of the actions of Lyondell\u2019s chief executive at the time, Dan F. Smith. In the hasty negotiations of the Basell deal that unfolded in a week, Mr. Smith was accused of updating projections that the plaintiffs said were overly optimistic.But that is not enough \u2014 the plaintiffs had to show intent. Here the chief executive was harmed by some language he had used before the buyout. At a convention in Las Vegas two months before the deal with Basell, Mr. Smith said, \u201cIf you\u2019re a bondholder, I am not sure you get enriched\u201d in a buyout of Lyondell. He continued, \u201cIf you think you are going to have a down cycle in the chemical markets, don\u2019t think you want to add $8 billion, $10 billion debt to this and live through that.\u201d Oops.Judge Cote found that the facts alleged by the plaintiffs were enough to be \u201cbadges\u201d of actual intent sufficient to allow the claim to proceed against the thousands of old Lyondell shareholders.The shareholders have not given up, filing a motion last week for reconsideration or to have the Second Circuit hear the case. The shareholders\u2019 basis for reconsideration is that there is no \u201cactual\u201d intent to defraud here. Instead, it was the Lyondell board that had agreed to sell the company to Basell.The argument can be summed up to an \u201cOh, really?\u201d Or to put it another way, are you really going to hold innocent shareholders liable when it was another party that sold the company? And let\u2019s not forget all those sophisticated banks that willingly lent that money and have not claimed to be defrauded.It\u2019s unclear what should happen. The law seems to be on the defendants\u2019 side, but more so because Delaware law is rather clear that it is the board here that makes these decisions.In other words, we are down to technicalities on whether the shareholders should pay back the $12.5 billion paid to them.That should give you an answer on whether any of this makes sense. Does anyone really think that in these cases the board actually is defrauding everyone? What about the buyer here who knew exactly what they were doing?When a lawsuit doesn\u2019t make sense but the legalities are cited, one has to wonder: Is the law really right here?Steven Davidoff Solomon is a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley.

{"Headline": "The Innovation Campus: Building Better Ideas", "Date": "2016-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhere once the campus amenities arms race was waged over luxury dorms and recreation facilities, now colleges and universities are building deluxe structures for the generation of wonderful ideas. They and their partners in industry are pouring millions into new buildings for business, engineering and applied learning that closely resemble the high-tech workplace, itself inspired by the minimally partitioned spaces of the garage and the factory.What architects take from Building 20 is not its ramshackle aesthetic \u2014 though some believe less polish provides more freedom \u2014 but the importance of mixing disciplines, of work performed out in the open, and of transition zones like hallways and staircases as sites for productive run-ins.Though studies have shown that proximity and conversation can produce creative ideas, there\u2019s little research on the designs needed to facilitate the process. Still, there are commonalities.Staircases and halls are wide and often daylit, encouraging people to dwell between their appointments in hopes of having a creative collision. Exposure to natural light itself contributes to improved workplace performance. There\u2019s also much more to do with your hands than take notes in class: The need to move your body, by working on a prototype, taking the stairs or going in search of caffeine at a centralized cafe, is built in, providing breaks to let the mind wander.The rationales for these buildings are varied: Employers are dissatisfied with graduates\u2019 preparation, students are unhappy with outdated teaching methods, and colleges want to attract students whose eyes are on postgrad venture capital and whose scalable ideas might come in handy on campus. And so universities of all sizes, both public (Wichita State, University of Utah, University of Iowa) and private (Cornell, Northwestern, Stanford), have opened or are planning such facilities.The studio is in the Bloomberg Center, named to acknowledge a $100 million gift from Bloomberg Philanthropies, matching New York City\u2019s contribution toward the total cost for phase one, which is estimated at $800 million. A sculptural staircase, jutting provocatively from the side of the building, was designed to encourage students and faculty members to take the stairs to their work space instead of the shorter elevator route between front door and desk. So much of contemporary design for innovation involves adding friction to people\u2019s work lives, as unexpected encounters (with people, with different spaces, with art) are supposed to lead to unexpected ideas.\u201cBeing in bigger interactive spaces encourages expansive thinking, while being in a box of a room encourages box thinking,\u201d said Dan Huttenlocher, founding dean and vice provost at Cornell Tech. \u201cSometimes you need to be in a box to concentrate, but to always sit in a little box is a problem.\u201dNo one has a private office at the Bloomberg Center, the primary academic building, and opaque walls are few. The only spaces faculty members can truly call their own are lockable storage cabinets, with carts for equipment. Traditional classrooms, too, are few \u2014 the Cornell Tech curriculum privileges projects over lectures. Instead, there will be options so that people can choose how they like to work, from open-plan spaces by the windows, to a roof deck with a garden, to huddle rooms for groups of five or less.\u201cAs you begin to understand how people work together, there is an ideal size of collaboration,\u201d said Ung-Joo Scott Lee, principal at Morphosis, the architects. \u201cBeyond five people it is too much of a crowd.\u201dIf this sounds like Silicon Valley, it should. \u201cWe looked at Pixar in Emeryville very carefully, along with Bloomberg L.P. and Google, who have sizable office space in New York and understand the constraints of the urban environment,\u201d Mr. Huttenlocher said. (Until it moves onto its own campus, Cornell Tech is headquartered in the Google building in Chelsea \u2014 every designer working for a university, it seems, has taken a swing through Mountain View.)\u201cPixar had to bring together very different cultures and get them to work as one, the creative and the business side, but also creative and tech people,\u201d Mr. Huttenlocher said.to this live-work building, anticipating the early lifestyle of dot-com employees, whose living quarters usually resemble walk-in closets. The Utah version is more plush, however: Residents, who can be graduate or undergraduate and in any major, can choose pods (cubbylike rooms with built-in bed, desk, storage and TV), lofts in an industrial vernacular (beds in a communal setting with shared kitchen, lounge and bathrooms) or more traditional single or double rooms.Different floors have different themes, based on Utah\u2019s existing strengths: one for games and digital media, one for adventure and gear, one for design and the arts, one for global impact and sustainability. The ground-floor \u201cgarage\u201d has workshops equipped with 3-D printers, laser cutters and other prototyping tools, available to anyone at the university and staffed by work-study students. All the programs offered by the Lassonde Entrepreneurship Institute, the division that is building the studios, are extracurricular and interdisciplinary; a few degrees are offered in partnership with the business school.\u201cOne thing about the building is it has no formal classrooms, and no faculty or staff offices,\u201d said Troy D\u2019Ambrosio, executive director of the institute. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to have a classroom because that says, \u2018In this room you learn, out here you don\u2019t learn.\u2019\u201dInnovation buildings tend to be affiliated with schools of business or engineering, but there is a strong arts presence within them. Lassonde Studios, designed by Yazdani Studio of Cannon Design, hopes to attract students from industrial design, the fine arts and communications. \u201cWe have made an effort to say, \u2018Entrepreneurs create new things, and you do that too,\u2019\u201d Mr. D\u2019Ambrosio said.A thousand students applied for the 400 beds this fall, and 37 percent of the chosen are women. \u201cIt\u2019s important to have a critical mass of women involved so women will come in,\u201d he said. \u201cEngineering is very heavily male, the business school is more male than female, but we are getting applicants from the fine arts, humanities and health sciences. Students have 35 to 40 different majors, and that happened pretty organically.\u201dThe studios are named after a Canadian businessman, Pierre Lassonde, who gave the initial $7 million for the building (he and his late wife, Claudette MacKay-Lassonde, are Utah alumni). The bulk of the $45 million construction costs were funded by a revenue bond, to be paid back with \u201crents\u201d from students. The experience will cost. A double goes for $6,830 for the academic year, a three-person loft for $9,135. Elsewhere on campus: $4,874 for a double, $4,367 for a triple deluxe.The radical restructuring of both curriculum and architecture are supposed to contribute to greater parity. Gone is a first year of large lecture courses on basic science. Instead, students work alone or in small groups on a \u201cpassion project.\u201d \u201cIf you are working on an efficient filtering system for water in Ethiopia, you will need to know more about mathematics, about partial differential equations,\u201d Dr. Kozinski said. \u201cThey would come to us, and then we would gently start introducing mathematics. Learning by doing and learning in social spaces with professors is reflected in the design.\u201dInformal lounges are threaded throughout the building, from a generous one at entry level to small banquettes in the wide hallways. Active learning classrooms (there are no lecture halls) combine different sizes and heights of tables and chairs, and are equipped with projectors and I.T.-integrated furniture from Steelcase. The \u201cSandbox\u201d space, which includes collaboration-size rooms and a 3-D prototyping lab, gives students the option to brainstorm on their own or work with classmates. The architects specified some furniture with built-in scribble pads, and many of the walls are writable back-painted glass.\u201cWe equate it to a design lab like in architecture school, a place where you can go brainstorm, sketch on the scribble pads, work with classmates,\u201d Paul Stevens, a senior principal at ZAS, said. \u201cOr you can take your sketches and use hand tools to start making a sample.\u201d Tool cribs hold smaller materials for experiential learning. Larger, purpose-built labs are equipped with professional-grade equipment for testing and prototyping, including a concrete-lined mechanical lab with a 12-ton crane. \u201cThis is where you get to build things like solar cars, or crush concrete,\u201d he said.Once students have their model, they can pitch it to industry leaders in a dressed-up lounge intended as a bridge space between students and the wider world. It was important, Mr. Stevens said, that it resemble a corporate lounge \u2014 \u201ca beautiful, high-end-finish space\u201d \u2014 rather than an intimidating board room, and the school made it a priority to have best-in-class furniture, including Eames chairs, to set the tone.The Garage provides cafe, meeting, classroom and workshop space for anyone on campus \u2014 a student center with an entrepreneurial purpose, with amenities like 3-D printers, Bluescape interactive screens and design software. Programs focus on helping students develop ideas and finding them mentors. Melissa Crounse, the executive director of the Garage and a former Google employee, holds weekly dinners for alumni and students, asking the successful (one assumes) alumni to tell a story about a previous failure.Gensler began the design process by diagraming the paths of potential users, from visiting entrepreneurs giving a lecture to a student prototyping a project through sewing, 3-D printing or laser cutting. By overlaying those paths they saw \u201chot spots\u201d where students, faculty members and guests might naturally congregate, like areas around whiteboards on conference room doors.\u201cIf you keep the schedule on the outside of the conference room, the act of signing up in an analog way causes a lot of discussions,\u201d Mr. Heiser said. \u201cMaybe meetings tie together. You need to create experiences that heighten the potential interaction.\u201dArt schools have always had open plans, daylit work spaces and power tools. But the new arts building also has many elements of the STEM-focused innovation campus in hopes of facilitating the mixing of disciplines and modes of instruction.Iowa\u2019s building attempts to embody that idea by placing itself along a primary pedestrian route, so seeing new work is unavoidable. The curriculum, too, draws in majors from across the university, with popular classes that include building your own bicycle.\u201cEngineering majors are often impressed by art students\u2019 relative high level of tool knowledge,\u201d Mr. McGuire said. \u201cThey see their experiences in various studios, from the suite of CNC equipment to traditional fabrication, complementing and enhancing theoretical knowledge they\u2019ve learned in engineering courses.\u201dSet near the university\u2019s museums, the building, like Iowa\u2019s, is positioned as a campus crossroad. People from other disciplines may literally be stopped in their tracks by what\u2019s going on in the transparent ground-floor galleries and workshops, or be drawn inside by a glimpse of people studying in the treehouselike reading room.Here, classes that combine art and science and art and technology include \u201cDrawing With Code\u201d and, most appropriately, \u201cData as Material,\u201d which delves into the history of using information to create art.\u201cWe reached out to the local business community and asked what they wanted in a graduate, and they told us there was a two-year gap between a graduate and someone who is a productive worker,\u201d said Emily Patterson, associate director of facilities planning at Wichita State. \u201cThey were asking for a more prepared student.\u201dSo in the $25 million Experiential Engineering Building, set to open for classes in January, students will be able to do hands-on and applied learning in 25 specialized science and engineering labs; engineering hub rooms will be open 24/7. A separate makerspace with evening hours, run by GoCreate, will offer facilities for metalworking, woodworking, textiles and digital creation to students and local residents. Dassault Syst\u00e8mes, a software company, is planning a 3-D immersive lab, and a few other spaces have been set aside for local businesses.Today\u2019s innovation campuses tend to make their pipeline to the real world explicit. Airbus Americas is moving its engineering center, and 400 Wichita employees, to a new structure on the campus, to be built on ground leased from the university. The center will also have room for up to 100 student workers. In another partnership, a law enforcement training center, with construction costs paid by the city and county, will serve the police departments as well as Wichita State\u2019s criminal justice students.Kansas public education has experienced state cutbacks at every level in recent months. Wichita State, along with other Kansas universities, has increased tuition 5 percent to make up for the budget cuts. \u201cState funding is dwindling, so we have to be innovative in our financing,\u201d Ms. Patterson said. Construction has gone forward on the Innovation Campus because the Experiential Engineering Building, designed by Perkins + Will and WDM Architects, is financed via grants to Kansas universities to produce more engineering graduates in a state where aviation and energy are top industries.How successful will Wichita State and other universities be at fueling innovation and, ultimately, a new entrepreneurship economy? The proof may be many years out, and difficult to quantify. But the pressure on administrators to change their campuses may soon come, not just from above and within, but from below.An anecdote from Kevin B. Sullivan of Payette, whose firm has interdisciplinary science and engineering centers under construction at Northeastern and Tufts, underscores the urgency. \u201cI\u2019m on the board of my daughter\u2019s high school, and what they are doing there is taking the existing library, gutting it and turning it into a tech-enablement space,\u201d he said. \u201cThe college process may be dumbed down from what they do in high school.\u201dAlexandra Lange is the architecture critic for Curbed and the author of \u201cWriting About Architecture: Mastering the Language of Buildings and Cities.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Activist and Herbalife: Just Maybe Ackman\u2019s Right", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookBill Ackman, the activist investor, has been painted as a loser in his yearslong quest to shut down Herbalife, the nutritional supplement company that he bet against, contending it defrauded customers and was a pyramid scheme.On Wall Street, Mr. Ackman\u2019s rivals snickered. The headlines have been withering: \u201cHerbalife Settles Pyramid Scheme Case With Regulator, in Blow to Pershing\u2019s Ackman,\u201d Reuters wrote. \u201cHerbalife Scores Huge Victory in Its Bill Ackman Battle With F.T.C. Settlement,\u201d Forbes said. And on and on.And yet there\u2019s something grossly wrong with this assessment.Yes, Mr. Ackman has lost a ton of money for his investors on his bet against Herbalife. But with the F.T.C. settlement, he has won a moral victory that could very well help hundreds of thousands of Herbalife\u2019s defrauded customers, who are mainly low-income immigrants who would most likely not have had any legal recourse had Mr. Ackman not loudly called the company into question.Herbalife, she said, was responsible for \u201cdeceiving hundreds of thousands of hopeful people.\u201d She described \u201cthe dream portrayed by Herbalife\u201d as an illusion. She went on to say that \u201cthe vast majority of Herbalife distributors found they could make little or no money selling Herbalife products.\u201dWorse still, Ms. Ramirez said, her agency had determined that \u201cpeople who leased space and opened a nutrition club and worked long hours made no money or lost money.\u201d And, she concluded: \u201cThe small minority of Herbalife distributors who did make a lot of money were paid by Herbalife not for selling the company\u2019s products, but for buying the products themselves and then successfully recruiting large networks of others to do the same.\u201dIn other words, she described pretty much exactly what Mr. Ackman has been saying for the last three years.According to Mr. Ackman in 2014, \u201cThese people work really hard, and unfortunately, they don\u2019t realize that they\u2019ve been defrauded.\u201dMr. Ackman specializes in making big, concentrated bets. Sometimes his investments score big, but that\u2019s not always the case. Here\u2019s how some of his ideas have fared.And here we are today, and they were true.\u201cIf it were not for Bill, I don\u2019t think the F.T.C. would have launched an investigation,\u201d Mr. Braun, the director, said. \u201cBill is unquestionably the catalyst.\u201dHerbalife refused to participate in the film, though Mr. Braun said he met and spoke privately with Herbalife\u2019s chief executive, Michael O. Johnson, for several hours.The website also noted that the producer of \u201cBetting on Zero\u201d and Bill Ackman were on the same crew team in college. According to Mr. Braun, one of the producers, Devin Adair, \u201coverlapped\u201d with Mr. Ackman at Harvard, but said that they were not friends and hadn\u2019t talked in decades. Ms. Adair was the coxswain for one of the crew boats; Mr. Ackman rowed on a different boat.The battle has been portrayed as either a pitched fight between a narcissistic, know-it-all investor seeking to bankrupt a company for profit (that\u2019s Herbalife\u2019s view) or as a crusading moralist trying to right a wrong. It may be a combination of both.\u201cThis is an \u2018Emperor Wears No Clothes\u2019 story,\u201d Mr. Braun said, explaining that the charm of that fairy tale \u201cis it\u2019s told by the sweet little boy.\u201d The message, he noted, is harder to accept when \u201cthe messenger is a tough hedge fund manager.\u201dAnd while there have long been moral questions about the very concept of \u201cshorting\u201d \u2014 betting against a company\u2019s stock \u2014 it is hard not to look at this particular situation as an example of an investor acting as a check on the market.Admittedly, there were questions about Mr. Ackman\u2019s tactics. He spent more than $50 million on his campaign, lobbying regulators and members of Congress to look into Herbalife\u2019s practices. But if Mr. Ackman didn\u2019t do it, who would? Complaints about Herbalife have been made for years, but it wasn\u2019t until Mr. Ackman very loudly got involved that the government stepped in.There are those who worry that Mr. Ackman\u2019s involvement in Herbalife means the oligarchs have taken over \u2014 that billionaires have become de facto regulators. It is a valid concern. And the billionaires may not always be on the right side. (Mr. Ackman has been involved in some investments, like Valeant Pharmaceuticals and J. C. Penney, that didn\u2019t go his way.)But, in this instance, he won a victory that will have real benefits for many people.And yet on Wall Street, his victory is considered hollow because he has so far lost money on his bet against Herbalife.\u201cTruth, candor and transparency are at odds with the measuring stick that Wall Street applies,\u201d Mr. Braun said.For now, Herbalife is heralding the settlement as a victory that will allow it to move on with its business. But Mr. Braun says that if the company genuinely changes its business model to conform with the settlement, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine a way for them to be profitable.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think this is over,\u201d he added.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Think Your Obamacare Plan Will Be Like Employer Coverage? Think Again", "Date": "2016-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPublic HealthWhen Obamacare was developed, one goal was to allow middle-class Americans to use the new marketplaces to buy the same kind of health insurance they had at their jobs. People could retire early, or quit a corporate job and become a freelancer, and still have the great care and financial protection that come with high-end plans.But six years into the health law, the reality is that a typical Obamacare plan looks more like Medicaid, only with a high deductible. The typical marketplace plan covers a small number of low-cost doctors and hospitals, and offers fewer frills than employer plans. The recent high-profile exits of many of the national insurers from markets around the country will only heighten the shift.That change in norms may not be all bad. It largely reflects the preferences of Obamacare\u2019s consumers, who are shopping aggressively for the most affordable health insurance they can find. But it is different from how the law\u2019s marketplaces were imagined and described when the legislation was written.Although the local Blue Cross plans largely remain, many are sharply narrowing the networks offered by their exchange plans. The other insurers are either local plans that are often tied to a particular health system or a company that specializes in Medicaid patients. Unlike many employer plans, these policies often do not allow people to go out of network for care if they want the visit to be covered.And even plans that offer out-of-network benefits were limiting the doctors who would be covered as in-network. \u201cWith recent carrier exits, this trend is only growing,\u201d said Erica Coe, a McKinsey partner.Those changes have been a shock to many middle-class professionals who thought the Obamacare marketplace would match their previous experience from the corporate world.When Chris Foley, 42, left his career in finance to begin one in stand-up comedy and acting, he assumed his health insurance would look like the coverage he\u2019d received while working for big banks.The transition was a challenge. First, he bought a plan through a New York State program before Obamacare that had skimpier coverage and bigger deductibles than his corporate plan. Then, when he signed up for his first Obamacare plan in 2014, he found that his doctor of 15 years wasn\u2019t covered by any of the options. He needed a colonoscopy last year, and had a hard time finding a doctor who was covered. He was surprised when he was asked to pay $450 out of pocket for a prescription drug at the pharmacy.\u201cI was frustrated; I was pretty angry about not having good coverage,\u201d said Mr. Foley, who said he briefly considered a return to the corporate world. But over time, he said, he made peace with his skimpier insurance. His premiums were affordable. \u201cI was covered for any kind of disaster or hospital visit or anything like that, and that\u2019s very important,\u201d he said.Insurers say they are shrinking the benefits in response to market pressures.\u201cWhat\u2019s driving it is the demand from consumers who are paying directly for these plans,\u201d said Jon Kingsdale, who teaches at the Boston University School of Public Health and is a managing director at the Wakely Consulting Group. \u201cWhen they compete on the exchange head to head with broader-network, higher-premium plans, the narrow-network, lower-premium plans are winning.\u201dWhether the narrower plans that are dominating the Obamacare exchanges are ultimately good or bad for patients\u2019 health is not clear. Many of these plans are new, and there\u2019s not much evidence about whether they do a good job of caring for patients while avoiding high-cost providers, or simply cover so few doctors, particularly specialists, that patients struggle to get necessary care.Many of those customers are not like Mr. Foley. They didn\u2019t have insurance before. Or their previous coverage, and expectations, were based on their experience with Medicaid.Reed Abelson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gawker.com to Shut Down Next Week", "Date": "2016-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor nearly 14 years, Nick Denton and Gawker.com have defined Gawker Media.But over the last several months, a split of some kind between the company, its founder and its flagship site became inevitable: Gawker Media, under financial pressure from a $140 million legal judgment in an invasion-of-privacy lawsuit brought by Hulk Hogan, the former professional wrestler, also encountered a seemingly unbeatable adversary in the form of Peter Thiel, the billionaire Silicon Valley entrepreneur who was financing legal efforts against the company. Left with few options, Gawker Media filed for bankruptcy and put itself up for sale in June.On Thursday, less than 48 hours after Univision\u2019s $135 million bid won an auction for Gawker Media, the bond finally broke. Gawker.com will shut down next week, and Mr. Denton, whose sites pioneered a wry, conversational and brash form of web journalism that would influence publications across the internet, will leave the company.\u201cSadly, neither I nor Gawker.com, the buccaneering flagship of the group I built with my colleagues, are coming along for this next stage,\u201d Mr. Denton wrote in a note to the staff on Thursday afternoon shortly after a bankruptcy judge approved the company\u2019s sale to Univision.The fate of Gawker.com had been the subject of much speculation ever since the Hogan verdict. Still, it was an abrupt outcome after what had been a long period of uncertainty.\u201cIt was a culmination of a year of dread,\u201d said John Cook, the executive editor of Gawker Media. \u201cThrough a year of just utter constant trauma and assault, it was the thing that I was trying to prevent \u2014 it was the thing that we were all trying to keep from happening.\u201dGawker.com\u2019s archives will remain online, but after Monday it will not publish new material, Mr. Denton wrote in his note. As for Mr. Denton, he said he would \u201cmove on to other projects,\u201d but provided few clues as to what those were except to say they would be \u201cout of the news and gossip business.\u201dBefore the bankruptcy hearing, Mr. Denton gathered the staff of Gawker.com in a windowless conference room at Gawker\u2019s offices to tell them the site would stop publishing.\u201cI\u2019m not going to say we lost, but Peter Thiel achieved his objective,\u201d Mr. Denton said, according to a person at the meeting.Founded in 2003 as one of Gawker Media\u2019s first two blogs, Gawker.com initially covered news and gossip about New York media and society. The site was considered by many as an incubator of talent, and its journalists have gone on to work at places like The New Yorker and New York magazine.Mr. Denton, a former financial journalist, was known for saying that journalists shared the most interesting stories they knew not in their articles but with each other at the bar after work. Gawker.com, perhaps more than any other site, reflected an attempt to change that. Its articles could be at turns witty and caustic, humorous and weighty. Mr. Denton often said that if something was interesting, it was news.Gawker Media\u2019s portfolio of sites also includes the technology site Gizmodo; the sports site Deadspin; and Jezebel, a site aimed at women.The site\u2019s demise could also reignite the debate about press freedom and whether anyone with an agenda and deep enough pockets should be able to sink a news organization.No layoffs were planned in connection with the shutdown, and journalists had been assured they would be offered jobs elsewhere at the company. But the shuttering of Gawker.com nevertheless represents a victory for Mr. Thiel, whose fight with the company began in 2007, when Valleywag, one of Gawker Media\u2019s now-defunct blogs, published an article saying he was gay.At Gawker Media\u2019s offices, the mood on Thursday afternoon was sad but also angry and defeated. A goodbye party planned for two journalists was turning into a goodbye party for Gawker.\u201cI think that people are going to find that they miss Gawker, even the people who hated Gawker,\u201d said Hamilton Nolan, a writer for Gawker who has worked there for eight years.In his note, Mr. Denton said the company had been unable to find a buyer for the site. But while his words were somewhat wistful, he also provided a hint of optimism.\u201cGawker.com,\u201d he wrote, \u201cmay, like Spy Magazine in its day, have a second act.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Anheuser-Busch InBev to Cut Jobs After SABMiller Merger", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Anheuser-Busch InBev said on Friday that it expected to eliminate at least 3 percent of its combined work force as part of cost-cutting efforts following its proposed merger with SABMiller over the next several years.The transaction would create an industry giant accounting for about 30 percent of global beer sales and would give Anheuser-Busch, already the world\u2019s largest brewer, a substantial operation in Africa, where it has little presence, and greater dominance in Latin America.Anheuser-Busch InBev has a target of $1.4 billion in annual cost savings by the end of the fourth year following completion of the deal, which is expected to close later this year. The deal valued SABMiller at more than $100 billion.As part of its integration efforts, Anheuser-Busch InBev said on Friday that it was likely to cut about 3 percent of the combined company\u2019s work force. Those figures exclude sales and front-office staff, which it says it has not been able to include in \u201cadvance integration planning because of regulatory restrictions,\u201d Anheuser-Busch InBev said.At the end of 2015, Anheuser-Busch InBev employed more than 150,000 people worldwide, while SABMiller employed another 70,000.On Friday, Anheuser-Busch InBev did not specify the number of jobs that will be cut. But the company has agreed to sell a number of assets from the combined company to win regulatory approval, so at least some of the SABMiller jobs will transfer along with those assets.As part of its announcement on Friday, Anheuser-Busch InBev said it expected the combined company to have its headquarters in Leuven, Belgium, and would retain Anheuser-Busch InBev\u2019s global functional management office in New York following the transaction.As part of the combination, Anheuser-Busch InBev said it expected to close SABMiller\u2019s headquarters in London within a year following completion of the deal.Anheuser-Busch InBev also said it expected to incur about $1.74 billion in fees and expenses related to the deal, including $725 million related to financing for the transaction.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Artist Takes an Unflinching Look at the Fight Against Terror", "Date": "2016-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 A new exhibition in London takes an unflinching look at American and British counterterrorism methods after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, with a display of stark photographs taken at the Guant\u00e1namo Bay prison in Cuba at its core.But the show is in an unexpected location: The Imperial War Museum, a partly government-financed institution whose mission is to document Britain\u2019s military history, and which was established in 1917 to commemorate British heroism on and off the battlefield in World War I.\u201cOur remit is to look at all aspects of the causes, nature and consequences of conflict in all its form,\u201d said the museum\u2019s curator of photography, Hilary Roberts.\u201cThe so-called war on terror is a very, very complex element of contemporary conflict,\u201d she said. Referring to the people whose experiences are portrayed in the show, she added, \u201cThe fact of the matter is, this small group of individuals were never convicted of anything.\u201cThe central question for you, for us, for everybody who visits the exhibition is the balance between security, which we\u2019re all entitled to, and human rights, which we\u2019re all entitled to.\u201dThe exhibition\u2019s most striking components are the framed color prints from Guant\u00e1namo, which Mr. Clark took in March and April of 2009.A white-walled cell features a concrete bed, a folded yoga mat and blanket, and a plastic storage box containing the prisoner\u2019s possessions. A TV room has an ankle shackle hook beneath the bench, and an arrow on the floor indicating the direction of Mecca, for prayer purposes.More chilling are the close-up of a tall chair on which hunger-striking prisoners are nasally force-fed and the image of a set of wrist and ankle shackles, some bearing faded blood stains.Mr. Clark also photographed letters received by a British resident who was detained at Guant\u00e1namo. \u201cPeople in Ireland are working hard to ensure you are treated justly,\u201d writes one correspondent, signing off as \u201cThe ginga ninja.\u201d Another letter reads: \u201cDear Omar, Thinking of you. I felt sorry for you,\u201d and is signed: \u201cSexy Leslie and Brian from our romantic holiday.\u201dThe exhibition goes on to showthe homes of British citizens or residents who had been held at Guant\u00e1namo. These nondescript, curtained interiors contain armchairs, vases of flowers and bowls of fruit. Only one has more assertive objects: a large black-and-silver dagger hanging on the wall, and a small black jihadist flag with a Koranic inscription, which the curators emphasize is not the flag of the Islamic State.The opening section of the exhibition highlights Mr. Clark\u2019s most recent project \u2014 documenting the day-to-day reality of \u201cextraordinary rendition.\u201dBills issued by private American air charter companies list \u201chandling and landing charges\u201d incurred during flights to Afghanistan, the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Morocco and Dubai. One photograph shows the complex where an American rendition pilot lives; Mr. Clark has blurred part of it for privacy reasons.The banality of some counterterrorism efforts is evoked in a photograph of an indoor pool at the Spanish hotel where a rendition team stayed in January 2004, having conducted transfer missions from Morocco and Macedonia to Afghanistan. The team ordered shrimp cocktails and wine while there, according to a Spanish police inquiry cited in the exhibition.For the final section, \u201cControl Order House,\u201d Mr. Clark was given access to a suburban British house where a man suspected of involvement in terrorist-related activity lived under a British Home Office \u201ccontrol order\u201d that limited his activities and movements.Nearly 500 pictures of the house, in the order in which they were taken, and several videos create a sense of confinement.

{"Headline": "After Olympics, Rio Is Altered if Not Reborn", "Date": "2016-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the criticism aside, the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio have profoundly altered this city of six million, yielding a revitalized port; a new subway line; and a flush of municipal projects, big and small, that had long been on the wish list of city planners.\u201cIf we set aside our political passions, it\u2019s plain to see that the Olympics have created an enormous legacy for Rio,\u201d said Pedro Corr\u00eaa do Lago, a historian, economist and former president of Brazil\u2019s national library. \u201cThese are improvements that might have otherwise taken 20 or 30 years to realize.\u201dTo many, it has become an article of faith that the modern Olympics are a drain on public coffers, a sop to corporate interests and a vanity project for glory-seeking leaders hoping to burnish their legacies and their nations\u2019 standing on the world stage.Brazil is no different. Born seven years ago in the heady days of an economic boom, these Games were initially seen as a triumphal capstone for a newly ascendant global power. Instead, as the country suffered through its worst recession in decades, the Games became an emblem of government waste and political hubris \u2014 and a target for protesters who dogged the Olympic torch relay as it wended its way across the country.But experts say the Games also served as a powerful catalyst for urban revitalization, spurring infrastructure projects, financed with taxpayer money and private investment, that will enhance the lives of Rio\u2019s residents.Nearly 100 miles of rapid bus lanes have slashed commuting times for thousands of the working poor. Four new tunnels have been built, and a 17-mile light rail system opened in June. A new subway line, the system\u2019s first major expansion in decades, began operating four days before the opening ceremony.The city said it had sped up the construction of more than 400 schools and health clinics in impoverished neighborhoods, part of what the mayor called a revitalization spurred by the Olympics.Still, critics say the Games have delivered uneven benefits, favoring upscale areas like Barra da Tijuca, the site of the Olympic Village, while ignoring hundreds of poor communities where residents live in jerry-built housing that lacks basic sanitation.\u201cThe Olympics have led to displacement, gentrification and sweet deals for real estate developers and construction companies,\u201d said Theresa Williamson, the executive director of Catalytic Communities, an advocacy group for the city\u2019s favelas.\u201cIt\u2019s undeniable that the infrastructure that has been built for the Games will benefit the population once the Olympics are over,\u201d said Barbara Mattos, an analyst at Moody\u2019s, the credit rating agency.Eduardo Paes, Rio\u2019s hard-charging mayor, who has aspirations of higher office, is quick to swat away criticism of the Games, calling the event a once-in-a-generation opportunity to lure investment to a city where fortunes have waned in the nearly six decades since the national capital moved from Rio to Bras\u00edlia.\u201cNo one ever said the Olympics were going to solve all of the city\u2019s problems,\u201d Mr. Paes said in an interview. \u201cBut we used the Games as a good excuse to get a lot of things done, things that have been the dream of mayors for 50 years.\u201dHe noted that the $12 billion budget for the Games was significantly lower than the expenses of other recent host cities \u2014 the roughly $15 billion spent on the 2012 London Games and the $51 billion that Russia lavished on the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.More important, Mr. Paes said, much of the money came from the private companies that built the Olympic Village and the Olympic golf course, as well as those that renovated the city\u2019s port, a project that includes a two-mile waterfront promenade and two new museums.Over all, he said, the city has built 75,000 units of affordable housing since 2009, although some estimates suggest that nearly as many people, most of them poor, lost their homes to projects related to the Olympics.Critics dispute some of Mr. Paes\u2019s figures, pointing out that cost overruns will most likely bring the final cost of the Games to $20 billion. Others note that the 3,600 apartments that make up the Olympic Village will end up as homes for the rich, and that the golf course, which required filling in protected wetlands, will serve only the wealthy.\u201cYes, the Olympic Village will be something for rich people,\u201d Mr. Paes said. \u201cBut there\u2019s no shame in that.\u201dIn a sign of the anger over the Games, a media bus was attacked on August 9 in an area torn apart for Olympic projects. But some analysts agree with Mr. Paes that the Games will not leave the city with significant debt.That assessment stood in stark contrast to the benefits seen in the estimated $11 billion that Brazil spent hosting the 2014 World Cup, which left behind a constellation of 12 new or renovated stadiums, most of which are not used regularly.Parsing the numbers can be tricky, of course, and Olympic hosts often fiddle with budget categories to conceal the true costs.Bent Flyvbjerg, an Oxford University economist and the lead researcher on a study that examined Rio\u2019s Olympic finances, said the actual amount spent on sports venues was most likely $4.6 billion, 51 percent over budget.That amount, Mr. Flyvbjerg said, placed Rio somewhere in the middle of host cities that have exceeded their spending projections.\u201cAll governments try to take the most convenient truth and spin it for their own purposes,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess if I was doing P.R. for the mayor of Rio, I\u2019d also say we\u2019re doing better than the previous three Olympics.\u201dIn recent years, Oslo, Boston and Munich, bowing to popular opposition, have dropped their Olympic ambitions. Over the last three decades, nearly every city that has hosted the Games has lost money, and few expect Rio to recoup the billions of dollars spent preparing for an event that lasts just weeks.\u201cFewer and fewer cities are willing to host the Olympics because they are a tremendous waste of resources,\u201d said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College and the author of \u201cCircus Maximus: The Economic Gamble Behind Hosting the Olympics and the World Cup.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no sensible way to rationalize the expenditures that have gone into this.\u201dBut city officials say the Olympics helped move the needle on infrastructure plans that had languished for years.In some poor neighborhoods, the Olympics served as a cudgel to speed the overhaul of public clinics that had been plagued by long waits and poor service. At one, in the troubled City of God favela, software now streamlines the triage process, a cheery ombudsman takes complaints and a new app lets supervisors track how long doctors spend with each patient \u2014 or whether they take inordinately long lunch breaks.\u201cIt\u2019s like night and day,\u201d said Elizabeth Rezende, 61, a retired maid waiting to get her electrocardiogram results after experiencing chest pain. \u201cThe other emergency hospitals are so chaotic.\u201dThe $2.5 billion rehabilitation, much of it financed through the sale of air rights from adjacent properties and tax incentives to developers, included demolishing the viaduct and funneling traffic through a new three-mile tunnel.\u201cIf we didn\u2019t get the Games, I\u2019m not sure this would have happened in our lifetime,\u201d said Alberto Silva, who is in charge of the project.Since opening in May, the port has been a hit with Brazilians, who crowd the waterfront promenade day and night, drawn by free concerts, food trucks and the opportunity for selfies in front of the Olympic flame.As she made her way through the elbow-to-elbow throngs, Maria Helana Lima, 49, a house cleaner, said she had initially shared the skepticism of friends who viewed the Games as a colossal waste of money.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to get excited about the Olympics when our hospitals are so overcrowded and people can\u2019t find jobs,\u201d she said. But sitting in the shadow of a new science museum by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, Ms. Lima said she had changed her mind.\u201cI\u2019m sure there was a lot of corruption and waste that went into this, but the end result is gorgeous and really cool,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is definitely a place I\u2019m going to come back to again and again.\u201dPaula Moura contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

With two years left of medical school in her native Moscow, she followed her sensitive prodigy of a husband, Sergey, to New York, became an ultrasound technician and put Sergey through business school, always assuming she would become a doctor once he made it big. Vica\u2019s now 35, still an \u00adultrasound tech, and Sergey is clonking ineffectually around the margins of the finance world. Their son\u2019s old enough that school quality is becoming an issue, and the family\u2019s stuck in a drab home in Staten Island, a universe away from the glitz of nearby Manhattan. Discontent is the understandable current through Vica\u2019s every thought. But tonight! At a Morningside Heights dinner party, Sergey \u2014 prompted by Vica\u2019s coaching (hectoring?) \u2014 will pitch his idea for a new app to the tech entrepreneur husband of Vica\u2019s friend Regina. Tonight, fortunes will change!Thus begins \u201cStill Here,\u201d Lara Vapnyar\u2019s minutely observed, razor funny and wholly wonderful third novel. Vapnyar has been well regarded since her debut story collection, \u201cThere Are Jews in My House\u201d (2003), and her reputation has grown with each subsequent book. Her subjects include the immigrant experience, the costs and isolation of assimilating, the vagaries of appetite and the mass of confusion that is the human heart. \u201cStill Here\u201d puts her talents on a big stage. This is a winding, expansive mash-up of a novel, centering on four Russian immigrant friends: Vica; the earthbound dreamer Sergey; the literary translator Regina; and Vica\u2019s ex-\u00adboyfriend Vadik, who works with Regina\u2019s husband. Occupying various sociocultural levels of the New York landscape (Staten Island, TriBeCa, Williamsburg), they act as a makeshift if cranky support network for one another. All have hit their mid-30s at least, and are at that stage where their bodies are no longer tight and prim, where mortality is no longer romantic or abstract, where a person can\u2019t help wondering what has become of his or her promise.Sergey\u2019s proposed app \u2014 he\u2019s given it the tone-deaf name Virtual Grave \u2014 would keep users\u2019 online presence thriving after their physical selves have passed from the world. Of course, his pitch goes awry, and the hidden fissures of the couple\u2019s marriage erupt, ending with Vica\u2019s perfectly served humiliation. Ramifications ensue: a separation, a lost job, long-buried sexual undercurrents resur\u00adfacing. Rivalries simmer, bonds of loyalty and love and family all intersect, ambitions and hurt feelings bubble up. Usually these transpire in largish set pieces, with each chapter following a different member of the foursome and extended expository interludes laying out the knotted back stories and complications. The structure echoes Vapnyar\u2019s spiritual predecessors \u2014 19th-\u00adcentury masters like Austen and Flaubert \u2014 and \u201cStill Here\u201d does work as something of a remix, combining Vapnyar\u2019s tragic Russian sensibility with her modernist aesthetic. Like her forebears, Vap\u00adnyar doesn\u2019t oversell sentences or push unnecessary emotions; rather, she lines up telling details in a steady march of patient sentences, her tone carefully constructed, at once flat and comic and malleable. Always, a larger goal is in mind: the absurdities and bathos and impossibility of How We Live Now.The results can be electric. One chapter (excerpted in The New Yorker in April) details Vadik\u2019s first night in Manhattan, when he meets a young woman, Rachel, in a diner. Conversation turns on a discussion of Vadik\u2019s favorite singer, Leonard Cohen. When Rachel calls Cohen a misogynist, it\u2019s a thrilling slap to the face of our expectations. Indeed, Rachel\u2019s subsequent criticisms of Cohen\u2019s lyrics \u2014 and Vadik\u2019s dumbstruck response \u2014 perfectly foreshadow both the romantic evening to come at Rachel\u2019s apartment and Vadik\u2019s sneaking out early the next morning. It\u2019s the kind of denouement Aristotle would have called inevitable but unexpected, and it will haunt Vadik through the novel. Always, Vapnyar puts more than one psychological layer into play. A quick moment during the same night shows this to different effect, when Vadik calls Sergey to say that instead of coming to Staten Island as expected, he will spend his first night in the United States in Manhattan with an American girl. \u201cHe had to listen to Sergey\u2019s stunned silence for what seemed like an eternity. \u2018O.K., see you tomorrow,\u2019 Sergey finally said.\u201d Readers feel the married man\u2019s unspoken resentment and jealousy.The other side of the fence always has that neat, green lawn. Status is always up for grabs, being tracked, and on the nuances of class difference Vapnyar has an especially precise eye. She sees how ward nurses react differently to the colleague they assume is a single mother working to pay the bills, as opposed to the seemingly bored suburban wife looking for something to do. She enters the mind-set of a financier magnanimous enough to provide enthusiastic feedback about a start-up idea even as he explains why he won\u2019t bankroll it: \u201cYour project is just a little too visionary.\u201d She catalogs the different kinds of parents standing in line with their 11-year-olds for the gifted-and-talented test at an elite public school on the Upper East Side: \u201cThe Sontag types were all about 50 years old, wore no makeup, had various amounts of gray in their hair and had roughly the same amount of intellectual flair. Their clothes looked elegant yet comfortable, a sure sign that they were very, very expensive. .\u2008.\u2008. The Outer Borough types wore puffy jackets and knitted hats.\u201dThrow in an imaginary novel about motherhood called \u201cHumdrum.\u201d Add an app named Eat\u2019n\u2019Watch that matches nearby takeout meals and television shows: \u201cThe problem was that Regina could never synchronize the time it took her to watch an episode with the time it took her to consume food. By the time Episode 1 of \u2018Blameless\u2019 ended, she still had one pancake, two strips of bacon and some home fries left. She could just eat them in dumb silence like an animal, like a stupid zombie, or she could do the more civilized thing and turn on Episode 2.\u201dIf \u201cStill Here\u201d is recognizable as a particular type of modern comedy, it also feels fresh and special \u2014 nowhere more so than in a chapter called \u201cBury Your Mother,\u201d which centers on Regina. Despite early success as a translator, Vica\u2019s friend has become louche, distant and a bit too attached to Eat\u2019n\u2019Watch. Returning to Russia, she cannot bear to visit her mother\u2019s headstone or see a beloved, aged aunt until the last possible moment. When she finally does, Regina is shocked by the sight of her shrunken aunt and doubly horrified to learn that the woman has taken in a troubled little girl. Auntie wants to talk.

And this is just the start of their journey.Meanwhile, through the background of every scene death taps its bony finger. Characters wonder if an algorithm could realistically imitate a dead person\u2019s presence; they debate whether such an app is simply an attempt to hold on to a missed loved one and whether an online presence after death is morally objectionable, if this idea is just a last chance for its flailing inventor to make good on his unrealized promise. Everyone has an opinion. Moments of actual mortality also intrude \u2014 unavoidably, as we all know, especially in the cancer ward where Vica works.All sides and facets of the diamond are examined, yet the stone as a whole remains inscrutable, its surface reflecting questions that gleam back at each of us: How do you want to spend your days; what truly matters in this life?

{"Headline": "World Bank President Jim Yong Kim Is Nominated for a Second Term", "Date": "2016-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe bank\u2019s board announced two days earlier that it was beginning to consider who would be its next president, inviting nominations as it did for the first time in 2012. While many World Bank watchers expect Mr. Kim to be reappointed, given the seven-decade tradition of choosing an American picked by the United States, the bank\u2019s largest contributor, they say he will have to work to solidify support.His nomination was made shortly after midnight in a statement from Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew. Because Thursday was the first day for nominations, the administration was signaling its strong support for Mr. Kim by making its announcement just minutes into the day, according to a Treasury official.And with the deadline for nominations just weeks away, Sept. 14, the quick action was also intended to discourage would-be rivals.\u201cPresident Kim has used his first term to focus the World Bank on effectively addressing today\u2019s most pressing global development challenges in innovative ways, from ending extreme poverty and tackling inequality, to combating climate change,\u201d Mr. Lew said.The Treasury secretary also lauded Mr. Kim, whose term ends next June, for spearheading the bank\u2019s response to the Ebola epidemic and the refugee crisis in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, and for the \u201cneeded reforms at the World Bank.\u201dA letter this month to the bank board from the staff association, which urged consideration of other nominees, reflected both concerns \u2014 with Mr. Kim and the Americans-only tradition. \u201cWe have accepted decades of back-room deals which, 12 times in a row, selected an American male,\u201d it said. \u201cThis must change.\u201dAs for Mr. Kim, the staff letter noted that annual employee surveys \u201cfor two years running, made it painfully clear that the World Bank is experiencing a crisis of leadership.\u201dIt also pointed up a core complaint: that Mr. Kim was prone to making substantial changes with minimal consultation.\u201cOnly one in three understand where the senior management team is leading us,\u201d it added. \u201cEven fewer believe that our senior management creates a culture of openness and trust.\u201dThe tradition of Americans leading the bank dates to its creation at the end of World War II; it has been honored in tandem with naming a European to lead the other major multinational financial institution, the International Monetary Fund. Its president, Christine Lagarde, was reappointed in February.For all of Mr. Kim\u2019s critics, he has acquired allies among the member nations whose board representatives will vote. Several nations announced support on Thursday, including the Netherlands, Pakistan and South Korea. Mr. Kim was born in South Korea but moved to the United States as a child and became a citizen.Scott Morris, a former Treasury official who is now a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, which works to alleviate poverty and inequality, said that support for Mr. Kim among emerging nations that include China, Brazil and India should show that his nomination is \u201cnot just the Americans jamming someone through.\u201d\u201cI think he\u2019s worked very hard during his first term to cultivate his relationships, particularly with the large emerging market countries,\u201d said Mr. Morris.\u201cThe emphasis on pandemic preparedness, on climate change, on refugee work \u2014 these are new emphases for the institution,\u201d said Ian H. Solomon, who was executive director on the bank\u2019s board for the United States from 2010 to 2013, and as such nominated Mr. Kim four years ago. He called that vision \u201ca necessary one and an urgent one,\u201d at a time when world poverty is down, client nations can get cheap credit on their own or \u2014 as China does \u2014 finance their own development projects.But Mr. Kim\u2019s \u201cexecution has been challenged,\u201d Mr. Solomon said. He has directed \u201ca very ambitious internal reorganization process which has gone on for a long time. And I think there is a lot of fatigue internally.\u201dMr. Kim, who was traveling in Europe and Africa this week, said in a recent issue of Foreign Policy magazine: \u201cIn order to do a real change, you have to put jobs at risk. And completely understandably, people hate that.\u201dThe selection process could be concluded in October and almost certainly before the next American president takes office in January, officials say. It is not lost on bank directors that they are acting during an American presidential campaign in which a major party nominee \u2014 the Republican Donald J. Trump \u2014 questions American involvement in multinational organizations.The Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, as secretary of state in 2012 put Mr. Kim\u2019s name into the mix of those being vetted by the Obama administration, according to officials involved at the time. Mr. Kim, an anthropologist and physician well known for his work addressing health issues in poor countries, was familiar to Mrs. Clinton and former President Bill Clinton from Mr. Clinton\u2019s post-presidential efforts in global health and education.Mr. Kim, a former president of Dartmouth College, did not have the experience in economics and development finance typical of past bank presidents. In 2012, Obama officials lobbied scores of finance ministers for Mr. Kim, and dispatched him to meet some. The board ultimately appointed him by acclamation.Whoever is president, the bank\u2019s role remains in flux.\u201cThe World Bank will need to be transformed to maximize its impact in a world where private money for developing countries and expertise are much more widely available than ever before,\u201d said Lawrence H. Summers, a former Treasury secretary. \u201cThat does not make the bank less important, but it does mean that it is going to have to pursue very different strategies in the future than it has in the past.\u201cvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ballot Measures: American Direct Democracy at Work", "Date": "2016-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMiddleton, Wis. \u2014 Throughout our nation\u2019s history, citizens and legislators alike have used ballot measures to shape public policy and public opinion in the states. This process of direct democracy has often proved more effective than the customary actions of a party, politician, interest group or deep-pocketed donor at addressing some of the most divisive topics in our history: including suffrage, prohibition, gay rights, the death penalty and marijuana.Despite their significant and lasting impact, ballot measures and the varied laws governing how they work can be daunting and complex. Which states allow the ballot initiative process? Not all do. Why are initiatives so popular in California, yet unavailable in New York? How do voters get measures placed on the ballot? None of this is simple or straightforward; in fact, many people now find the language used in these measures so confusing that they abstain from voting on them entirely.The origins of direct democracy in the United States date from the 1600s, when New England colonists debated and voted on ordinances and other issues during town hall meetings. This set the stage for legislative referrals, which, as their name implies, are measures referred to the ballot by a state legislature.In 1778, citizens in Massachusetts were the first to attempt ratification of their state Constitution by a legislative referendum. Several other states followed suit in subsequent decades, and in 1857, Congress mandated that all changes to state constitutions for states entering the union after that year had to be approved by voters. Today, voters in 49 states, excluding Delaware, must vote on and approve legislatively referred constitutional amendments. These have become the most prominent type of measure seen on ballots in recent years, and they enable legislators to keep a finger on the pulse of the electorate.Not all states, though, allow voters to weigh in on changes to state statutes and laws. Legislators in 23 states can refer changes to a state\u2019s statutes to the ballot. As with constitutional amendments, voters can approve or reject only the laws that their legislature decides to place before them.While a majority of ballot measures work like this \u2014 in other words, are legislatively referred \u2014 two other types of measures, initiatives and referendums, tend to attract more media attention, money and controversy.The unique nature of these measures stems from their origins: the citizenry. Ballot initiatives are devised by voters, who then circulate a petition for signatures from other registered voters. If the initiative garners enough valid signatures and uses language that conforms with the state\u2019s laws, it is put before the electorate for approval. Citizens can use this tool to bring about votes on a proposed state statute or a constitutional amendment, depending on the laws in a given state.Citizens, too, can gain a veto referendum, or simply a referendum, by collecting enough signatures to place a law that has been passed by the state legislature on the ballot. Voters then decide whether to keep or nullify the law. The topics addressed by initiatives and referendums have ranged from the mundane to the exotic, from bond measures to the act of dueling.The practice of statewide initiative and referendum gained traction among the populist movements of the Progressive Era, around the turn of the 20th century. Frustrated with the ineptitude of government and elected officials, these movements demanded a comprehensive program of reform that included women\u2019s suffrage, the direct election of United States senators, the recall mechanism, primary elections and the initiative and referendum process.The most essential of these measures, the reform movement came to realize, was the initiative process: Without it, the rest of the program risked being blocked by state legislatures and ultimately failing. Activists lobbied state legislators to add amendments allowing for an initiative and popular referendum process in the states. At first, it was an uphill battle, and lawmakers, by and large, wanted to preserve their prerogative. Elected officials should govern, they felt, not the people by plebiscite.But the perseverance of initiative and referendum supporters paid off. In 1898, South Dakota became the first state to adopt the process for statewide ballots, although Nebraska allowed local ballot measures the year before. Utah and Oregon implemented it in 1900 and 1902, respectively, and many others soon followed. All told, 26 states as well as the District of Columbia currently have some form of initiative or referendum, allowing citizens to directly engage in policy making.The process gained currency mainly in Western states, which, to this day, have a more robust culture of direct democracy. More than 60 percent of all initiative activity has taken place in just six states: Arizona, California, Colorado, North Dakota, Oregon and Washington. Eastern and Southern states initially rejected initiatives and referendums, largely out of fear that direct democracy would empower immigrants and African-Americans. That anxiety eventually dissipated.Mississippi became the most recent state to implement the initiative and referendum process, with voters approving the change in 1992. Since then, voters there have weighed in on pressing issues like term limits, abortion and education.Some consider the initiative and referendum process valuable for voters in the states that allow it, viewing it as a vital tool to keep government in check. According to the Initiative and Referendum Institute, states that feature an initiative on the ballot in a given election year also feature higher turnouts, of between 3 percent and 4.5 percent in presidential years and between 7 percent and 9 percent in midterm years, over states without an initiative on the ballot.Others view the initiative and referendum process through a more cynical lens. Over the years, ballot measures \u2014 especially initiatives \u2014 have been hijacked by pressure groups to push particular political agendas. For example, party operatives have used ballot measures that are designed to increase voter turnout for their slate of candidates.A prime example occurred during the 2004 presidential election. Republicans in Ohio, a key swing state, ensured that the ballot would carry a vote on Amendment 1, a state mandate to recognize only heterosexual marriages. Amendment 1 not only passed by a handy margin, but it also helped drive up Republican turnout generally in Ohio; George W. Bush won the state over John Kerry.A similar situation may unfold in California in the election this fall. The state Supreme Court ruled in favor of placing on the statewide ballot a nonbinding, advisory question asking voters to weigh in on whether Congress should take steps to overturn the controversial Citizens United Supreme Court case. Critics contend that the measure, which particularly appeals to progressives, is on the ballot solely to spur Democratic voter turnout.In addition to the problem of politicos gaming the system, critics of initiatives and referendums have also questioned whether voters are informed enough to make decisions on complicated policy issues. That concern is amplified by the massive amounts of money sometimes thrown at campaigns either supporting or opposing a given measure. Some have concluded that even direct democracy has been corrupted and turned into a pay-to-play gambit.Despite these critiques, every even-numbered election year hundreds of measures are put before voters (with a handful on off-election year ballots, as well). Since 1900, nearly 14,000 measures \u2014 including those referred by state legislatures and citizens \u2014 have been decided by voters. Of these, about 61 percent were approved, and 39 percent were defeated.Love them or hate them, ballot measures aren\u2019t disappearing in the near future. In fact, with signature requirements in many states lower than in the past thanks to poor voter turnout in 2014, this may be a blockbuster year for initiatives. For instance, for the first time in recent history, more initiatives are certified for the ballot than legislatively referred amendments.This much is certain: Whatever the negatives of the parties\u2019 presidential nominees, the predominance of hot-button issues like marijuana, guns, health care and campaign finance on ballots means voter turnout will be as high as the stakes.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Millennials Became Spooked by Credit Cards", "Date": "2016-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKids these days: They just aren\u2019t pulling out the plastic like they did in the past.Data from the Federal Reserve indicates that the percentage of Americans under 35 who hold credit card debt has fallen to its lowest level since 1989, when the Fed began collecting data in a standardized way, according to an analysis by The New York Times.Some older Americans have also been shedding credit card debt since the financial crisis that began in 2008. But for no other age group has the decline in the proportion holding credit card debt been more rapid than it has been for young Americans \u2014 who are often referred to as millennials \u2014 the data from the Survey of Consumer Finances shows.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that young people are not interested in becoming indebted in the way that their parents are or were,\u201d said David Robertson, the publisher of The Nilson Report, a newsletter that tracks the payment industry.Their reluctance could have lasting repercussions for millennials, as well as for the financial system and the economy. Early use of credit cards has, in the past, helped young Americans develop a comfort level with credit that can last a lifetime and lead to a succession of big purchases financed by debt. Without a substantial credit history, it is much harder to take out a home mortgage, for example.\u201cIt will probably take them longer to get access to credit,\u201d said Gregory Elliehausen, an economist at the Federal Reserve specializing in consumer finance. \u201cIn the meantime, their behavior and some of their habits will have already been formed.\u201dOver all, Americans\u2019 use of credit cards has recently been creeping up again: Household debt in the United States increased by $35 billion, to $12.29 trillion, during the second quarter of 2016, a 0.3 percent rise from the previous quarter that was driven by credit cards and auto loans, according to a report released on Tuesday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.Banks say that their credit card operations are running at full tilt, and that in recent months the number of people having trouble paying their bills has been at record lows.But many younger people have been sitting on the sidelines, deterred by new laws passed after the crisis and big loads of student debt. They are also spooked by the temptation that credit cards offer to spend beyond one\u2019s means.Jason Towner, a 32-year-old who works at a private equity firm, cut up his last credit card, from Capital One, in 2010. He did not have any unruly debts, but he had just watched his father and sister close the family furniture store after a bank cut off their credit line in the middle of the financial crisis.\u201cI was seeing what was happening around the world, and what was happening in my backyard, and I was thinking, \u2018This is not a great idea,\u2019\u201d Mr. Towner said recently.The resurgence of overall credit card use in the United States over the last year or two has been driven largely by subprime borrowers, according to the Federal Reserve, which has not looked at the recent growth in borrowing by age.But it is clear to economists who study payment patterns that millennials are gravitating toward payment methods that skirt both cash and credit. Why carry cash when you can whip out a debit card for the smallest transaction \u2014 a sandwich or a bottle of soda \u2014 or use an app like Venmo or an online payment service like PayPal? All of those typically draw funds directly from a bank account.Mr. Elliehausen of the Federal Reserve said he expected the aversion to debt among young Americans to continue, potentially with a downside. Credit cards are frequently necessary for the bigger purchases \u2014 like washing machines and computers \u2014 that can make households more efficient and help the economy grow. And credit cards are usually an essential part of the credit history that allows someone to borrow to buy a house.Only 37 percent of American households headed by someone aged 35 and under held credit card debt in 2013, the most recent year for which data from the Survey of Consumer Finances is available, down by nearly a quarter from immediately before the financial crisis. That statistic may undercount young cardholders to some extent, as it excludes people under 35 who live with their parents.But more recent data has also suggested that millennials are using credit cards less than people of a similar age did in the past \u2014 and that they are taking on fewer auto loans and mortgage loans than people of similar age did before the financial crisis.Rebecca Liebman, 23, graduated from Clark University in 2015 with a load of student debt. She avoided getting a credit card until earlier this year, and did so then only because she kept hearing about how she would need to build up her credit history if she ever hoped to get a mortgage.\u201cI don\u2019t want to use a credit card irresponsibly, and because of that, it\u2019s scarier to use,\u201d she said. \u201cI grew up \u2014 I saw 2008 \u2014 I saw my dad get laid off. I don\u2019t trust the financial market.\u201dToday Ms. Liebman is a founder of a financial literacy site for millennials, LearnLux, and the reluctant holder of a Discover card. Even after getting the card, it took her five months to overcome her ingrained aversion to debt and make her first purchase \u2014 a physical wallet.She understands what the aversion will mean for her and for her customers.\u201cIt\u2019s going to make me buy a home a lot later in life,\u201d Ms. Liebman said. \u201cI think it will impact a lot of big decisions and push them further out. There are some things that are going to be specific to our generation around financial decision-making for sure.\u201dThe reasons for the shift are varied: Like Ms. Liebman, many young people carry burdensome loads of student debt, making it hard for them to take on any more debt \u2014 and giving them a sour taste in their mouths when it comes to credit of any sort. The average American under 35 now has $17,200 of student debt, 182 percent more than Americans of the same age had in 1995, the Fed data shows.On a more practical level, laws passed after the financial crisis made it much harder for younger people to secure cards unless they could prove they had the income to pay the bills. The tents that credit card companies used to pitch all over college campuses \u2014 offering students free T-shirts when they signed up for cards \u2014 have largely disappeared.Then there are the young professionals who are able to get a card, but have seen the strain that debt put on their families and friends during the financial crisis.Mr. Towner, whose job in private equity involves lending money to small businesses, is a prime example. To him, the risks involved with debt outweigh the benefits, so he tends to use Venmo and PayPal, or, whenever possible, cash. When he bought his apartment in Berkeley, Calif., he chose a foreclosure and paid with money he had in the bank.\u201cI don\u2019t want to go out and buy, buy, buy, even though that\u2019s what society wants me to do,\u201d Mr. Towner said. \u201cI want to save and invest for the long term.\u201dAn article on Monday about the reluctance of millennials to take on credit card debt misidentified the university from which one such person, Rebecca Liebman, graduated. She received a degree from Clark University, not Bentley University.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From California, a Better Way to Retire", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialAt any given moment, about half of the private-sector employees in the United States \u2014 some 60 million people \u2014 do not have any type of employer-sponsored retirement plan. The result is a growing American underclass, in which a third of current retirees live almost entirely on Social Security and fully half of future retirees will face reduced standards of living. Worse, the coverage gap has long proved intractable, with Congress and the financial industry unable or unwilling to design or support truly simple and low-cost retirement savings plans.And yet, retirement prospects are about to improve for the 6.8 million employees without retirement coverage who work in California for businesses with five or more workers. Next week, the California Legislature is set to vote on a plan, nearly four years in the making, to automatically enroll most uncovered workers in individual retirement savings accounts. Employee advocates are confident the measure will pass, and Gov. Jerry Brown is expected to sign it. When that happens, Californians will gain more security \u2014 and the rest of the nation will gain a national model for promoting retirement savings.Under the plan, uncovered employees would have up to 5 percent of pay deducted from their paychecks, unless they opted out. Those contributions would be pooled and managed by investment professionals chosen by the state through a bidding process. The plan, called the California Secure Choice Retirement Program, would be overseen by a board of public- and private-sector leaders, appointed by the governor and the Legislature in 2012, when the legislative effort first got underway.The benefits of such a plan are the lower fees and higher returns that come with pooled contributions and professional management. The burden on employers is minimal: They have to deduct the employees\u2019 contributions from paychecks. The risks to the state are also minimal: Because the accounts are financed entirely with employee contributions, they do not present the fiscal problems associated with many public pension funds.One last hurdle is an 11th-hour lobbying blitz, directed at Mr. Brown, by the Investment Company Institute, the trade group for the mutual fund industry. The industry is obviously worried that the plan, with fees that are both low and transparent, will drive down fees industrywide.The California plan is not perfect. It is designed to branch out slowly from a supersafe Treasury bond investment into a more complete menu of investment options. More ambitious features, like insurance guarantees to protect employees from investment losses, had to be dropped along the way, given their cost, complexity and novelty.What is most important, however, is for employees to have the chance to start saving consistently. Other states, including Oregon and Illinois, have enacted similar plans that will start taking effect beginning next year. Several states are considering such plans. California, however, was the first to broach the idea and will be the largest and most influential to execute it. Ideally, retirement coverage, like health care coverage, would be a federal effort to ensure the broadest possible participation at the lowest possible costs. Until then, California is taking on the mantle of leadership.Advertisement"}

Also left unclear was whether Saudi Arabia\u2019s removal from the list would remain temporary.Within days, Mr. Ban announced that he had been coerced by the Saudis into temporarily removing the coalition from the annex, which is regarded as an annual blacklist of shame.Mr. Ban said at the time that Saudi Arabia, among the most generous donors to United Nations relief causes, had threatened to withhold financing if he refused. He described the decision as one of the most difficult of his nearly decade-long tenure, which ends this year.Saudi officials contested Mr. Ban\u2019s version of events, insisting that they had issued no threats. Still, the episode offered a telling glimpse into the limits of a secretary general\u2019s power at the 193-member United Nations and the influence of its wealthiest contributors.Human rights groups have criticized Mr. Ban\u2019s decision, describing at as a capitulation that eroded the moral authority of the United Nations.Mr. Ban reiterated to the Security Council on Tuesday that he stood by the information in the annual report, which chronicled violations of children\u2019s rights in war zones around the world.The report said Saudi Arabia and its coalition allies \u2014 the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Senegal and Sudan \u2014 had been responsible for 60 percent of child deaths and injuries in Yemen in 2015.\u201cWe will continue our engagement to ensure that concrete measures to protect children are implemented,\u201d Mr. Ban said. In an apparent reference to the stigma of inclusion in the report\u2019s annex, he also said: \u201cToday I renew my appeal to every member state and every party to conflict: If you want to protect your image, protect children.\u201dThe Saudi ambassador to the United Nations, Abdullah al-Mouallimi, who was among those invited to address the Security Council on Tuesday, said his country and its partners were \u201ccommitted to abiding by international law\u201d in the Yemen conflict, and that their original inclusion in the annex was done \u201cwithout any valid reasons.\u201dHe also said the allies had undertaken a \u201cperiodic comprehensive review to avoid adverse effects on the civilian population,\u201d and that the Saudis had allocated more than $3 billion to help in aiding and rebuilding Yemen, the poorest country in the Middle East.The United Nations report has created diplomatic awkwardness for the United States, a Saudi ally and military supplier, which has frequently called upon the Saudis to exercise restraint in Yemen to avoid civilian casualties.Ms. Power described Mr. Ban\u2019s report as a \u201cbleak, yet unsurprising, picture of the human rights violations committed against children in conflicts, many of which are actually worsening.\u201dShe added: \u201cEven if we governments do not ultimately agree with certain U.N. findings or conclusions, we must maintain support for the United Nations, such a vital organization that is aiming, as we\u2019ve heard today, to help children everywhere.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to the Security Council meeting. Saudi Arabia\u2019s inclusion in the list of child rights violators came up again \u2014 not the Saudi fury over the inclusion itself.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Edward Snowden\u2019s Long, Strange Journey to Hollywood", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "FeatureOliver Stone wanted a hit \u2014 and the chance to put America\u2019s most iconic dissident onscreen. The subject wanted veto power. The Russian lawyer wanted someone to option the novel he\u2019d written. The American lawyer just wanted the whole insane project to go away. Somehow a film got made.Supported by\u201cI think we should move,\u201d he said. His producer, Moritz Borman, led the way to another corner. \u201cHow\u2019s this?\u201d Borman asked.Stone didn\u2019t answer. He eyed an older couple slurping soup and kept moving. A moment later, Stone finally settled in by a window, comfortably beyond earshot of the other patrons.Such security precautions had become routine. Ever since Stone decided to make a biopic about Edward Snowden, the American whistle-\u00adblower currently holed up in Moscow somewhere, the director \u2014 who became a Buddhist while making \u201cHeaven & Earth\u201d and sampled a buffet of psychedelic drugs for \u201cThe Doors\u201d \u2014 had gone all method again. On \u201cSnowden,\u201d he and Borman became so preoccupied with American government surveillance that they had their Los Angeles offices swept for bugs more than once.The director hadn\u2019t been sleeping well. Principal photography wrapped a month earlier, and now Stone had come to Moscow to film Snowden for the movie\u2019s grand finale. He ordered a decaf coffee and began to lay out the events that led him and Borman to be hanging out in Russian hotels, on the lookout for potential spies. \u201cLast January, Moritz calls me,\u201d Stone said. \u201cHe says: \u2018You got a call from this fella who represents Mr. Snowden. You\u2019re invited to Moscow.\u2019\u2009\u201dThe call had come from Anatoly Kucherena, Snowden\u2019s Russian lawyer. In the course of his career, Kucherena has represented Russian oligarchs, film directors, a few pop singers and a state minister. In 2012, he campaigned for Vladimir V. Putin, and soon after Snowden landed in Moscow, Kucherena showed up at Sheremetyevo Airport and offered his services. Then Kucherena wrote a novel about his new client. Titled \u201cTime of the Octopus,\u201d it follows a National Security Agency leaker named Joshua Cold who is marooned in the airport and the Russian advocate who liberates him. In January 2014, months before the book was published, Kucherena called Borman to see if Stone might like to make it into a Hollywood movie.\u201cAnd I know you from working on, what, three films?\u201d Stone said at the bar.\u201cFive,\u201d Borman said.At the time, Stone and Borman were barely speaking after a falling-\u00adout during the making of \u201cSavages,\u201d a beachy Blake Lively thriller. \u201cWe\u2019ve had our fights,\u201d Stone said. \u201cYou know, he\u2019s German; I\u2019m American.\u201d He didn\u2019t elaborate.\u201cHe calls, and I go: \u2018Oh, [expletive]. Not again,\u2019\u2009\u201d Stone continued. It wasn\u2019t just about Borman. Stone wanted nothing to do with another political docudrama. He spent two decades trying to get a biopic about the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. off the ground, only to see \u201cSelma\u201d get made to critical acclaim. Then there was the My Lai massacre film. Merrill Lynch put up cash, Bruce Willis was set to star and Stone built an entire village in Thailand. As the economy collapsed in 2008, the financing evaporated. \u201cYou get these scars, and they don\u2019t go away,\u201d Stone said.So Stone was skeptical. But this was Snowden, who single-\u00adhandedly exposed the colossal scale on which the United States had been surveilling its citizens. Plus, the director needed a hit. After early successes like \u201cPlatoon\u201d and \u201cWall Street,\u201d his more recent films didn\u2019t receive the attention he hoped. The Snowden story had all the ingredients of an epic Stone picture: politics, government conspiracy and, at the center of it all, an American patriot who had lost faith. If it panned out, it could be Stone\u2019s millennial follow-\u00adup to \u201cBorn on the Fourth of July,\u201d the Ron Kovic biopic that won him an Oscar in 1990.But first Stone and Borman had to make sure Kucherena was for real. Borman asked the lawyer to send the book and two first-class tickets to Moscow. Both arrived the next day. In case they still had doubts, Kucherena\u2019s office gave Borman a number to call. On the other end was an employee of the Russian consulate in San Francisco, who turned out to be a big fan of \u201cThe Life of David Gale,\u201d a film Borman produced. They were issued visas that same week. (Kucherena denies buying first-class tickets for Stone and Borman or helping expedite their visas.)\u201cWhen that happened,\u201d Borman said, \u201cI thought, O.K., I guess Kucherena can pull the strings.\u201dThe initial revelations were sensational. Not only had the N.S.A. been monitoring the calls, emails and web activity of millions of Americans, but it also had been tapping into the networks of Google, Yahoo and other companies to do so. The Guardian published the leaks, and Greenwald eventually revealed the identity of his source in a video shot by Poitras. Depending on your feelings about national security, the N.S.A.\u2019s actions were either necessary or unconstitutional. The Apple co-\u00adfounder Steve Wozniak called Snowden a hero. Secretary of State John Kerry called him a traitor. Donald Trump called for his execution.As Snowden became a celebrity, a cause and a historical event, the web of people who wanted to take part in it widened. Most had his best interests in mind, but his story also happened to advance agendas that had long needed an appealing spokesperson. Civil-\u00adliberties lawyers wanted to represent him. Activist journalists wanted access to him. Publishers rushed out books, including \u201cThe Snowden Files: The Inside Story of the World\u2019s Most Wanted Man,\u201d by Luke Harding of The Guardian, and \u201cThe Snowden Operation: Inside the West\u2019s Greatest Intelligence Disaster,\u201d by Edward Lucas of The Economist. Despite promising an \u201cinside\u201d look, neither writer had ever met Snowden.Those with intimate knowledge documented the experience, too. In 2014, Greenwald published \u201cNo Place to Hide: Edward Snowden, the N.S.A. and the U.S. Surveillance State,\u201d a dramatic retelling of how Greenwald broke the story. That fall, Poitras released \u201cCitizenfour,\u201d a tense and spooky documentary about a modest and intelligent young man who hid under a blanket when typing on his laptop. (It won the 2015 Oscar for best documentary.)Snowden, meanwhile, ended up in Russia. He had embarked on a trip to Ecuador, but the United States revoked his passport midflight, leaving him stranded in Moscow. For Russia, Snowden was like a bird that flew in through an open window \u2014 or, as Putin joked, an unwanted Christmas present. But politically speaking, he could be useful. After enduring the United States\u2019 endless lectures about human rights, the Kremlin could suddenly welcome a man who exposed large-scale American hypocrisy.Kucherena entered the picture as Snowden\u2019s lifeline, or at least as someone who could help him navigate Russia\u2019s asylum laws. An experienced lawyer, Kucherena was appointed by Putin to the Public Council, overseeing the Federal Security Service (F.S.B.). Snowden\u2019s case presented a new opportunity. It took Kucherena a month to negotiate Snowden\u2019s stay and three months to write \u201cTime of the Octopus.\u201dStone\u2019s first meeting with Kucherena was a disaster. (\u201cI thought he was a gruff bear,\u201d Stone told me.) The director wanted to meet Snowden, but Kucherena said Snowden wouldn\u2019t meet them until they agreed to option \u201cTime of the Octopus.\u201d (Kucherena denies this.) According to Stone and Borman, by the end of a long weekend, they reached a gentlemen\u2019s agreement: Stone would option the novel \u2014 if Kucherena could provide regular access to his client.During those 24 hours, this magazine had contacted Ben Wizner, Snowden\u2019s lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union, to arrange an interview with his client. Kucherena may be Snowden\u2019s Russian representative, but in the United States, Wizner runs the show. Wizner was furious. Not just because Stone had invited a reporter to Moscow, but because of how it all looked: that Snowden was involved in a Hollywood movie and that the whole production was seemingly brokered by a lawyer with ties to the Kremlin. Borman would later tell me that we had waded into the sticky territory of Snowden\u2019s multiple emissaries. \u201cThere are two ways to access him: One is Kucherena and one is Wizner, and it\u2019s completely political,\u201d Borman said. \u201cIt\u2019s a political situation that goes way above your head.\u201dWhen Wizner and I finally got on the phone, he was in damage-\u00adcontrol mode. He told me that Snowden wasn\u2019t profiting from Stone\u2019s film in any way. \u201cOne hard-and-fast rule Ed always had was, I\u2019m not selling my life rights,\u201d Wizner said. Snowden\u2019s participation in a Hollywood movie would only fuel the claims of his critics \u2014 that he was a narcissist eager to cash in. That said, Stone\u2019s film would be seen by millions of people, which meant it could sway public opinion. \u201cWe were choosing between two bad options,\u201d Wizner said. \u201cHe could have stubbornly stayed completely at arm\u2019s length and had no input whatsoever. Or he could have some input and compromised the arm\u2019s-length relationship. And I didn\u2019t know how to advise him on that.\u201dAccording to Wizner, Snowden met with Stone only to make sure that the film told an accurate story. \u201cIt\u2019s been us walking this tightrope between clearly not having any formal connection to the project \u2014 not deriving any benefit from it \u2014 and also not wanting to just be completely helpless and, you know, see what Oliver Stone comes up with,\u201d Wizner said. Despite some initial discomfort, he was tentatively optimistic. \u201cMaybe it\u2019ll be good,\u201d Wizner added. \u201cYou know, Oliver Stone wrote \u2018Scarface.\u2019\u2009\u201dStill, Stone was heading to Moscow to film Snowden for an appearance in the movie, which could be seen as an endorsement. Fact-\u00adchecking is one thing, I said; a cameo is another. \u201cIt is, and I\u2019m not entirely comfortable with it,\u201d Wizner said.Wizner had negotiated veto control over any footage featuring Snowden in the film. After we spoke, the lawyer says he asked Borman to put that in writing. He also reiterated that if Stone took a reporter along, Snowden would not participate. Stone and I eventually reached a compromise: I wouldn\u2019t observe the shoot, but I could still come and meet Kucherena.A few days later, I met Stone in Moscow. The director, who is 69, has a forward-\u00adleaning gait and unruly eyebrows, so that he looks a bit like a bull that is always about to charge. He emerged from the hotel\u2019s elevator with a pained look on his face. It was drizzling, and Stone\u2019s hair, which is the color of dark shoe polish, was pointing laterally. \u201cI have some bad news,\u201d he said. \u201cI cannot deliver Anatoly.\u201d He had just seen Snowden, who had been in touch with Wizner and was very upset, Stone said. \u201cEd said he doesn\u2019t want Anatoly talking to you, and he said that very clearly,\u201d Stone added.I would spend the next few days camped out at the hotel. When Stone wasn\u2019t shooting, we would meet in the lobby bar as he continued to tell me about the making of his film.Soon after optioning Kucherena\u2019s novel, Stone had returned to Moscow with his co-\u00adwriter, Kieran Fitzgerald, a recent University of Texas M.F.A. graduate. Anticipating a homesick Snowden, Fitzgerald hauled over a duffel bag packed with the stuff of Americana dreams: Kraft macaroni and cheese, \u00adJell-O cups, Oreos, Pepperidge Farm cookies, Twizzlers, peanut butter, Spam, an Orioles baseball cap and a pair of Converse sneakers. \u201cIt was like delivering a care package to a kid at summer camp,\u201d Fitzgerald told me. He also slipped in a copy of \u201cThe Odyssey\u201d translated by his grandfather, Robert Fitzgerald. \u201cI thought it was appropriate, since Ed was on his own kind of odyssey trying to get home.\u201dSnowden and Stone had gotten off to a slow start. Snowden was squeamish about a movie being made about his life. Stone, in turn, said the film would be made with or without him. Fitzgerald says he played referee. \u201cOliver can be a bit of battering ram,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cHe\u2019s accustomed to hard men who need to be cracked, but that\u2019s not Edward Snowden. He\u2019s not an alpha-\u00admale type. He\u2019s a very sensitive mind. So I was there to say: \u2018Everything is going to be O.K. He\u2019s a good guy. It\u2019s going to be a good movie.\u2019\u2009\u201d Eventually, Snowden began to open up, answering questions about his childhood; his girlfriend, Lindsay Mills; and what he could about his work for the N.S.A.While Fitzgerald returned to Austin to work on the script, Stone set out to plant his flag in the Snowden story. In Hollywood, book options are the equivalent of calling dibs, and Stone had competition. In May 2014, Sony Pictures optioned Greenwald\u2019s \u201cNo Place to Hide.\u201d By June, Stone had announced that he acquired Kucherena\u2019s book and Harding\u2019s \u201cThe Snowden Files.\u201d The tactic worked. Sony got nervous. \u201cNow what?\u201d Amy Pascal, then Sony\u2019s co-\u00adchairwoman, wrote to another executive. (The email would be leaked during the Sony hack.) Pascal\u2019s colleague reminded her of the case of the dual Steve Jobs biopics \u2014 \u201cJobs,\u201d with Ashton Kutcher, might have come out first, but it was \u201cSteve Jobs,\u201d starring Michael Fassbender, that was the better film. Pascal wasn\u2019t convinced. \u201cOliver Stone is not Ashton Kutcher,\u201d she responded. She wrote to George Clooney to pique his interest in adapting Greenwald\u2019s book, but Clooney passed. \u201cStone will do a hatchet job on the movie, but it will still be the film of Snowden,\u201d he replied.For Stone, the impending Sony project was a call to arms. Fitzgerald cranked out a first draft of the script, and that fall Stone went out to studios with a budget of $50 million and a release date in December 2015. Each one turned it down, and Stone became convinced that the studios wanted to quash the project because of its controversial subject matter. \u201cThis is why corporations owning movie studios is not a good idea,\u201d he said.While Borman hustled to find independent financing, Stone dove into casting. For the lead, he chose Joseph Gordon-\u00adLevitt, the son of liberals from Sherman Oaks, Calif., and a former child actor who has retained a pleasingly boyish look. \u201cThere\u2019s an interesting blandness to him in the same way that Jimmy Stewart might\u2019ve been considered bland,\u201d Stone said. \u201cThere\u2019s a neutrality there, which allows him to grow on you.\u201d Shailene Woodley was cast to play Lindsay Mills, Zachary Quinto as Greenwald and Melissa Leo as Poitras.By early 2015, Borman and Stone had racked up several hundred thousand dollars in debt, but the money was still short. The shoot was ultimately delayed three weeks as the producer cobbled together European partners. In the United States, \u201cSnowden\u201d was picked up by Open Road Films, a small production company that had just put out \u201cJobs\u201d \u2014 the Kutcher version.\u201cIt was painful that we ended up with this independent distributor,\u201d Stone said.Borman offered that Open Road was not so independent anymore.\u201cI\u2019d never heard of it,\u201d Stone said, adding: \u201cI\u2019ve been there before, but not on this level and not at this age. So for me, it was very difficult personally.\u201dI had gotten my copy from Stone, who handed it to me with a disclaimer. \u201cNow, it\u2019s easy to take a shot at this,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, it wasn\u2019t the basis of the movie. But it\u2019s fun. I enjoyed reading it.\u201d\u201cTime of the Octopus\u201d takes place in a single night. The protagonist, Joshua Cold, is sequestered in a bunker at Sheremetyevo Airport, where his Russian lawyer keeps him company. The chapters alternate between their time-\u00adstamped conversations and those labeled as digital files (\u201cFile 004.wav\u201d), suggesting that they are the lawyer\u2019s transcribed recordings. The basic facts of Cold\u2019s case sound familiar, as do the character names: There are journalists named Boitras and Greywold and an organization called Mikileaks run by an Augusto Cassangie. For the most part, Cold and the lawyer sit and talk about life, quoting Laozi to each other. But there is also a distinctly post-\u00adSoviet tone to the novel, which reads both like a love letter to American culture \u2014 Steven Spielberg, B.B. King, \u201cThe Terminator,\u201d Penthouse magazine, Popeye, \u201cThe \u00adX-Files,\u201d Paul Newman, Bon Jovi, \u201cSpider-\u00adMan,\u201d \u201cBraveheart,\u201d Quentin Tarantino and Tupac Shakur are all mentioned \u2014 and a gleeful taunt to its government. \u201cNot only did [Cold] snap the beak of the American eagle,\u201d Kucherena writes, \u201cbut he also gave him a good kick and a very humiliating one, as if it was not a menacing predator but a rural hen.\u201dIn the bunker, Cold enjoys pizza and whiskey, but he is worried about American agents coming to retrieve him. \u201cBelieve me, Russia is not the worst option for you,\u201d the lawyer tells Cold. \u201cAnd you needn\u2019t regard us with such mistrust.\u201dOnce Cold is granted asylum, the propaganda is dialed up. \u201cI shall work in Russia and get an apartment!\u201d Cold announces. \u201cI thought I would spend the rest of my life in this underground prison.\u201d\u201cAs far as I know Mr. Putin, he is not one to change his mind easily,\u201d the lawyer assures him. \u201cAll will be O.K.\u201d The novel concludes with Cold vowing to learn to drink like the Russians, but the lawyer suggests he try Kvass instead, a fermented beverage made from rye bread. (\u201cIt is the Russian Coca-\u00adCola,\u201d the lawyer says.) Then they leave the bunker.\u201cWeird, huh?\u201d Fitzgerald said when I asked about the novel. In fact, few people associated with either Snowden or \u201cSnowden\u201d wanted to discuss it. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say anything on the record about that book,\u201d Gordon-\u00adLevitt told me.According to WikiLeaks, Stone paid a million dollars for \u201cTime of the Octopus,\u201d which seemed like a hefty amount to pay for material that Stone admitted he had no plans of using. (That\u2019s the same figure Sony reportedly paid for the rights to \u201cEat, Pray, Love.\u201d) \u201cWe bought it because we did get good access to Ed,\u201d Stone explained. \u201cHe had to be brought along.\u201dDuring Stone\u2019s visits, Kucherena hosted the director at his favorite restaurants and at his dacha outside Moscow. \u201cThey had a kind of bromance,\u201d Fitzgerald told me. Photos from the trips look like vacation postcards, with Stone and Fitzgerald grinning in Red Army caps (a gift from Kucherena) and Fitzgerald and Gordon-\u00adLevitt posing for a selfie in front of St. Basil\u2019s Cathedral. While out in public, the group referred to Snowden as \u201cSasha,\u201d a nickname Kucherena had given him.Kucherena and I would eventually speak by phone. He said he wrote the novel because he had received calls from many \u201crepresentatives of Hollywood,\u201d writers and filmmakers. \u201cAt some point, I just thought to myself, Why don\u2019t I try to write the book?\u201d he said. I asked which writers and directors had called him. \u201cVery many people called me,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut I honestly don\u2019t remember their names now.\u201dThe lawyer was deeply troubled by the news media\u2019s insinuations that he is connected to the Kremlin. He pointed to several clients he has defended against the F.S.B., including Platon Obukhov, a writer accused of spying for Britain. \u201cI never had any kind of agreement with the Kremlin,\u201d he said. \u201cThey tried to say I\u2019m tied to the F.S.B., but that\u2019s complete nonsense, excuse me.\u201dKucherena said he was inspired by his favorite authors, who include Tom Clancy, Aldous Huxley and George Orwell. \u201cThe Octopus in my novel is, you can say, a direct offspring of Big Brother,\u201d he said. Like most writers of fiction, he was reluctant to discuss which parts of his book were based in reality. \u201cA person can only be open with someone he trusts,\u201d Kucherena said. \u201cAnd here, because he had no one else, it turned out that I took on the role of mother and father. Accordingly, we had confidential conversations of various sorts.\u201dHe did not see a conflict of interest in his writing the novel. \u201cI wrote an artistic book,\u201d Kucherena said. Because he represents Snowden pro bono, he never expected to capitalize on the relationship. \u201cI don\u2019t take any money from him,\u201d Kucherena said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have any. So I wrote a book, yes, fine. So I got a little, as we say in Russian.\u201dDespite being the one to put the \u201cSnowden\u201d project into motion, Kucherena shied away from assuming any credit. \u201cI\u2019m very far from all that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just an advocate. Look at where I am and where Hollywood is!\u201dWizner, who is 45, has been at the A.C.L.U. since 2001. Before Snowden, he tried to bring several suits to increase oversight over the intelligence community. Wizner likes to say that he spent a decade banging his head against a wall, and then Snowden came along and brought that wall down. Snowden had not only revealed the scope of the surveillance apparatus, but also that top government officials routinely misled the public about it. Since becoming Snowden\u2019s advocate, Wizner has become a figure of not insignificant geopolitical importance. Those revelations have since formed a critical backdrop for legislative reforms, and there are few things that irritate Wizner more than claims that threaten to tarnish Snowden\u2019s character and their common cause.It would not be a stretch to say that for Wizner, Kucherena has become a bit of a liability. Since 2013, the Russian lawyer has announced that Snowden landed a job at a major Russian website \u2014 news that turned out to not be true \u2014 and has supplied the news media with photos of his client enjoying his new life in Russia, attending an opera at the Bolshoi Theater and cheerfully hugging a dog named Rick. (Rick later turned out to be the dog of one of Kucherena\u2019s friends.) Now Kucherena had sold a novel to Stone, making it seem as if the director had to pay a Russian fixer to have access to Snowden \u2014 or worse, that Snowden was somehow under the lock and key of the Russian authorities, lent to Stone for a Hollywood movie.Wizner\u2019s counterefforts in the United States have been successful. Former Attorney General Eric Holder, once a fierce critic, has acknowledged that Snowden performed \u201ca public service.\u201d President Obama has called for the reform of phone metadata collection, and last June, Congress passed the U.S.A. Freedom Act, a law that directly resulted from Snowden\u2019s leaks. Snowden has come to be seen as a levelheaded activist. According to Wizner, he leads a free existence in Russia, making appearances via live video and publishing op-eds against Russia\u2019s human rights violations. \u201cI think people are inclined to believe that Russia would never let him stay there unless he was paying for it in some way,\u201d Wizner said. \u201cBut it\u2019s just not true. Not only is he not cooperating, but he\u2019s actually being critical.\u201dWhen I asked Wizner about Kucherena\u2019s book, we were meeting at a cafe near his office in Lower Manhattan. \u201cMaybe you should just characterize my facial expression \u2014 \u2018He smirked,\u2019\u2009\u201d Wizner said. (Except that his smirk was mixed with a frown.)According to him, Snowden has not read Kucherena\u2019s book. \u201cThe thing is, Ed has much bigger fish to fry,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you had people calling for your assassination, you\u2019d be annoyed. If you were facing life in solitary confinement, you\u2019d be concerned. If someone wrote some book in Russia that no one is going to read, it doesn\u2019t register.\u201dWizner was reluctant to discuss Kucherena\u2019s role in Snowden\u2019s life, but he conceded that it was somewhat unorthodox. \u201cIt seems like the ethical rules governing the attorney-\u00adclient relationship may be somewhat different in Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be very unusual for a lawyer in a high-\u00adprofile case to provide exclusive photos of his client to newspapers or write an unauthorized book and sell it to Hollywood.\u201dKucherena and Wizner have never met. Whatever uneasiness there may be, Kucherena spoke warmly about his American counterpart. \u201cWe are on the same team!\u201d he told me. \u201cBen works in America, I work in Russia. If he wanted to write a book, I would have no problem.\u201d Wizner told me he has no plans to write a book about Snowden, fictional or otherwise.We had met in the lobby bar again, the day after he filmed Snowden, and the director was in better spirits. The shoot took place at Kucherena\u2019s dacha. The day went long. Stone\u2019s idea was to interview Snowden and capture an affecting moment that would give the film its dramatic ending. But the first takes were stiff. \u201cEd is used to answering questions on a level of intelligence,\u201d Stone said. \u201cBut I was interested in the emotional, which is difficult for him.\u201d Stone ended up doing nine takes. At one point, they took a break and went for a walk around Kucherena\u2019s property. By the end of the day, Stone decided that he had gotten Snowden to go as far as he was going to. \u201cHe was cooperative,\u201d Stone said. \u201cHe wanted to make it work. But as an actor \u2014 he\u2019s not used to that. I mean, he\u2019s not an actor. And I don\u2019t think he became one that day.\u201dTo make Snowden more comfortable, Stone worked with a minimal crew. Some were meeting the whistle-\u00adblower for the first time and still seemed a bit star-struck. \u201cSuddenly this little creature comes teetering in \u2014 so fragile, so lovely, such a charming, well-\u00adbehaved, beautiful little man,\u201d the cinematographer, Anthony Dod Mantle, told me. \u201cHe\u2019s like an old soul in a very young body. He\u2019s got fingers like violins.\u201d Filming Snowden reminded Mantle of shooting other men with outsize reputations and slight builds. \u201cIt\u2019s like Bono or Al Pacino,\u201d he added. \u201cThose guys are teeny-\u00adweenies. But if you isolate him into a frame, he can be as big as anybody else.\u201dMantle shot Danny Boyle\u2019s \u201cSlumdog Millionaire\u201d and \u201c127 Hours,\u201d but \u201cSnowden\u201d proved to be a special challenge. Convinced that making the film on American soil would be too risky, Stone decided to film in Germany, where Borman was able to score some tax subsidies. With roughly 140 script pages to shoot in 54 days, the crew sprinted from Munich to Washington, to Hawaii, to Hong Kong, and then back to Munich. Often, Mantle wouldn\u2019t get to see locations before he had to film in them. To cut costs, the suburbs of Munich had to stand in for rural Maryland and Virginia, with German extras cast as Americans. \u201cThank God the Germans act like Americans,\u201d Stone said.The production itself resembled a covert operation, with a code name (\u201cSasha\u201d had stuck) and elaborate security protocols. Worried that \u201cSasha\u201d would be of interest to the N.S.A., Borman and Stone avoided discussing production details by phone or email \u2014 \u201cIt was all handwritten notes and long walks in the park,\u201d Borman said \u2014 and kept the script on air-\u00adgapped computers, ones that have never been connected to the internet. If it had to be mailed, Borman would mix up the pages into four packages, which he would send with four different couriers to four different addresses. \u201cMaybe nobody gave a [expletive],\u201d Borman told me. \u201cOr maybe the N.S.A. is laughing at us like, \u2018Look at those idiots \u2014 of course we copied everything that came through DHL and FedEx!\u201dFor the actors, the frenetic schedule and paranoia on set added to the mood of the production. \u201cSnowden himself was in the midst of a stressful situation, so the fact that our shoot was a little bit that way, I think, helped,\u201d Gordon-\u00adLevitt said, before catching himself. \u201cMaking the movie was obviously a walk in the park compared to what he did. But just to have those little emotional touch points can help when you\u2019re acting.\u201dCommitted to inhabiting Snowden\u2019s robotic speech pattern, Gordon-\u00adLevitt lifted the audio from \u201cCitizenfour\u201d and played it on repeat while he slept. He also worried that some of the dialogue felt heavy-\u00adhanded. \u201cOliver is very into making his point,\u201d the actor said, \u201cas he should be. I really admire him for that. But I felt like it was my job to be like, \u2018O.K., I want to make the point, too, but this is a human being and not just a mouthpiece.\u201d Stone found Gordon-\u00adLevitt\u2019s approach too \u201cdocumentary-\u00adish\u201d at times. \u201cI was trying for the dramatic side as much as possible,\u201d Stone said. Fitzgerald was ultimately flown in to the set to execute last-\u00adminute rewrites.By late spring of 2015, Stone was close to wrapping when his mother, Jacqueline Goddet Stone, died at 93. She had called him in Munich, but Stone felt he couldn\u2019t risk leaving. \u201cTo go to L.A. would have cost us three down days,\u201d Stone told me. \u201cI knew she was going to pass, but I thought I could make it.\u201d Stone remained on set during the funeral and kept shooting.Stone\u2019s trip to Moscow to film the real Snowden was the last bit he needed to complete the film. But he was still worried \u2014 that the footage would be leaked, that critics would eviscerate it, that Snowden wouldn\u2019t like it. \u201cI want him to vet it,\u201d he said. He was heading to New York to begin editing and planned to return to Moscow at the end of the summer to show Snowden a rough cut. \u201cO.K., my dear,\u201d Stone said, getting up to leave. \u201cSee you in New York.\u201dThen he disappeared for six months.At the time, Stone wasn\u2019t interested, and Greenwald negotiated the deal with Sony. Stone later came back and offered to match Sony\u2019s bid, but Greenwald declined. \u201cI think he was a little perturbed,\u201d Greenwald said. Of the principal cast, Zachary Quinto, who plays Greenwald in Stone\u2019s movie, was the only actor who didn\u2019t meet his real-life counterpart as research. \u201cI always thought that was a little weird,\u201d Greenwald said. \u201cI think Oliver thought I had some competitive hostility toward his project, or he had some hostility \u2014 I\u2019m not really sure.\u201d (According to Stone, Quinto didn\u2019t need to meet Greenwald because there were so many videos of the journalist online.)In the spring of 2014, Stone flew to Berlin and met with Poitras. The meeting did not go well. According to Poitras, Stone proposed that she delay the release of \u201cCitizenfour,\u201d which she was then in the middle of editing, to time up with his film. \u201cBecause his film would be the real movie \u2014 because it\u2019s a Hollywood movie,\u201d Poitras told me. \u201cObviously I wasn\u2019t interested in doing that. To have another filmmaker ask me to delay the release of my film was \u2014 well, it was somewhat insulting.\u201dStone was annoyed, but he stuck around for a few drinks. They discussed new movies, including \u201c12 Years a Slave.\u201d As Poitras recalls, Stone found the film too violent, while Poitras thought the brutality was appropriate given the subject matter. Stone was growing increasingly frustrated. \u201cAt some point, he reached over and had his hands around my neck,\u201d Poitras said. \u201cIt was sort of in a joking way. I think he was a little bit drunk. But it was not a particularly pleasant evening.\u201dAccording to Stone, he only offered to help Poitras get distribution. \u201cWe thought we\u2019d help her either bring out her film with our film, or in the wake of it or before it, if we could,\u201d Stone said. He didn\u2019t recall pretending to strangle Poitras. \u201cI think from talking to her, you sense she\u2019s superparanoid,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I liked her,\u201d he continued. \u201cI admired her. I saw her films. I was trying to help her. If Laura is accusing me of trying to aggress her or kill her, she\u2019s crazy.\u201dStone\u2019s torment is at least in part self-\u00adinflicted. Biopics can be a nasty business, and Stone routinely throws himself into historical narratives and the messy negotiation between fact and fiction. The haggling with historians and family estates is the reason Stone was never able to make films about Martin Luther King Jr. and Hank Williams, and it was why he had to wait for Richard M. Nixon to die to make \u201cNixon.\u201d For Stone, the real-life characters of the stories he is after have become both the obstacles and the necessary arbiters of his work. It\u2019s why he refused to make \u201cSnowden\u201d without Snowden, and why his appeals to Greenwald and Poitras were his way of getting them on board.If Poitras had a strong reaction to Stone\u2019s proposal, it was because she had already been hounded by Sony. After the studio optioned Greenwald\u2019s book, Poitras says Sony asked to buy her life rights \u2014 an offer she declined. Sony suggested that she come on as a consultant, but when the contract arrived, it stipulated that the studio would have access to Poitras\u2019s tapes and notebooks. \u201cSo I\u2019d already gone through that when Oliver came in trying to position himself,\u201d she said.Poitras is a soft-\u00adspoken, cautious woman who has spent much of the past decade on government watch lists. Her resistance to participating in various Snowden projects has less to do with her feeling territorial than with her trying to maintain some control as she has become a character in a story that is no longer hers. Poitras\u2019s radical position is that the \u201cSnowden story\u201d can really belong only to Snowden. \u201cI could have asked him for a life-rights contract in Hong Kong, but I don\u2019t believe in that as a concept,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s his story, and I hope he tells it when he\u2019s ready.\u201dNeither Greenwald nor Poitras ultimately object to Stone making his film. While his own movie still lingered in development, Greenwald thought Snowden\u2019s story might in fact be safer in Stone\u2019s hands than it would be elsewhere. The Sony leaks would eventually reveal that Stone\u2019s paranoia may have been justified: In emails about the purchase of Greenwald\u2019s book, an executive in Sony\u2019s government-\u00adaffairs office suggests toning down the news release, changing \u201cillegal spying\u201d to \u201cintelligence gathering\u201d and \u201cmisuse of power\u201d to \u201cactions.\u201d\u201cMy big worry with Hollywood and the Snowden story is that they\u2019re either going to be cowards and completely drain it of its political vitality,\u201d Greenwald told me, \u201cor that they\u2019re going to do a superbiased smear job. For all the talk about how liberal Hollywood is, the reality is that they\u2019re really close to the government. And whatever other things you might say about Oliver, I was actually relieved that someone was going to do this film where there was no danger of those things happening.\u201dLike \u201cCitizenfour,\u201d \u201cSnowden\u201d takes place in Hong Kong, but this time the story has the eerie feeling of a familiar scene re-\u00adenacted by skilled Hollywood actors. Stone was right about Gordon-\u00adLevitt. His performance is not an interpretation so much as a direct replica of the whistle-\u00adblower\u2019s even demeanor and intonation. Quinto plays Greenwald with such intensity that he appears perpetually enraged. Melissa Leo\u2019s Poitras is in turn warm and protective, almost maternal.Stone came in just as the credits rolled. He was nursing a cold but was back on caffeine and asked his assistant for Bulletproof, the trendy coffee brand made with \u201cgrass-fed butter.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be nutritional,\u201d Stone said. \u201cNo radicals.\u201dSince I last saw him, the film\u2019s release had been pushed from December 2015 to May 2016 as Stone rushed to complete it, and then once more to September 2016. The biggest challenge was pacing. Stone likes to structure his movies around a series of plot-\u00adpivoting, battlelike scenes \u2014 the concerts in \u201cThe Doors,\u201d the football games in \u201cAny Given Sunday\u201d or actual warfare in \u201cAlexander.\u201d A story in which the drama hinges on a tech specialist downloading classified documents was more subdued than he was accustomed to. \u201cCoding is not exciting,\u201d Stone said. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s a nerdlike behavior \u2014 it\u2019s dull on a screen.\u201dStone got around the tedium of reality by turning his film into a cross between a cyberthriller and a love story, using Snowden\u2019s relationship with Mills to inject emotional stakes. Cutting between Snowden in Hong Kong and flashbacks to his past, the film speeds through Snowden\u2019s biography with the help of techno music, snappy explanations of N.S.A. programs and tricky camerawork to build in the tension of surveillance. (There are scenes filmed from the perspective of tiny phone cameras \u2014 the modern peephole \u2014 and suggestive zoom-ins on eye pupils.)But there are also unmistakable Stone-isms. \u201cI just don\u2019t really like bashing my country,\u201d Gordon-\u00adLevitt says to Woodley as they stroll past a Bush-\u00adera antiwar protest in front of the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s my country, too,\u201d Woodley says. \u201cAnd right now, it\u2019s got blood on its hands.\u201dSnowden\u2019s N.S.A. boss is unsubtly named Corbin O\u2019Brian, after the antagonist in Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984.\u201d \u201cMost Americans don\u2019t want freedom,\u201d O\u2019Brian tells Snowden. \u201cThey want security.\u201dSnowden\u2019s many storytellers all tell a similar hero narrative. But if Greenwald\u2019s account is about journalism, Poitras\u2019s is a subtle and artful character study and Kucherena\u2019s is an attempt at the Russian novel \u2014 a man alone in a room, wrestling with his conscience \u2014 Stone\u2019s is the explicit blockbuster version, told in high gloss with big, emotional music and digestible plot points that will appeal to mass audiences. As Wizner wisely anticipated, it is the narrative most likely to cement Snowden\u2019s story in Americans\u2019 minds.Snowden declined to comment for this article, but Stone told me he had seen the film and liked it. At a screening at Comic-\u00adCon a few months later, Snowden would beam in via satellite to give his somewhat wary approval. \u201cIt was something that made me really nervous,\u201d he said of Stone\u2019s film. \u201cBut I think he made it work.\u201dAs Stone intended, Snowden shows up at the end of the film. He appears in a wood-\u00adpaneled room in Kucherena\u2019s dacha, a modest, foreign-\u00adlooking space, with little to see except a vase of flowers and some curtains in the background. The Snowden who speaks is not the stoic version, but one who manages to deliver a Stone-\u00adcaliber movie line. \u201cI no longer have to worry about what happens tomorrow,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause I\u2019m happy with what I\u2019ve done today.\u201d Just before the screen fades to black, Snowden is shown gazing toward a window, a faint, inscrutable smile on his face.Gordon-\u00adLevitt was so moved by Snowden\u2019s story that he donated most of his salary from the film to the A.C.L.U. and used the rest to collaborate with Wizner on a series of videos about democracy. Wizner was preparing to petition Obama to grant Snowden a presidential pardon in the fall, and he hoped Stone\u2019s film would help transform the public\u2019s perception of his client. Kucherena, meanwhile, had turned \u201cTime of the Octopus\u201d into a trilogy \u2014 in the sequel, the N.S.A. sends an assassin to Russia to \u201celiminate\u201d Joshua Cold. He hoped to come to the United States for the premiere of the film, in which he has a cameo as a Russian banker who encounters Snowden at a party. \u201cIf I can get a visa, why not?\u201d he said.In July, Stone and Wizner joined forces for an A.C.L.U. event. The evening was billed as a conversation with Wizner about surveillance and Edward Snowden, with Stone hosting at his Tudor-\u00adstyle home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles.As several dozen West Coast supporters of the A.C.L.U. filtered into Stone\u2019s backyard, the director sat camped out on a bench by the pool, taking the party in from a distance. He boasted that he had recently cut four more minutes from the film, bringing the run time to a lean 134 minutes. I asked if he would keep finessing until the end. \u201cNo, it\u2019s over,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is it. Now I die.\u201dWizner roamed around, inspecting a meditation gazebo outfitted with a large gold Buddha. After several people inquired who was playing him in the movie, the lawyer came up with a pithy reply. \u201cKevin Spacey, reprising his role as Keyser Soze,\u201d he joked. \u201cThe guy behind the guy behind the guy \u2014 hiding in plain sight.\u201d (Wizner is not a character in Stone\u2019s film.)That week, NPR ran an interview with a Russian security official who posited that Snowden is maybe, probably, most definitely cooperating with Russian intelligence. This inevitably set Wizner off. \u201cOf course, this is the same week that Snowden is blasting Putin on Twitter every day,\u201d Wizner said to Borman, who nodded along. The producer suggested that Snowden\u2019s critics would claim it\u2019s a cover. \u201cThat\u2019s what they say!\u201d Wizner said. \u201cThis is preapproved criticism so that it\u2019ll seem like he\u2019s free, but actually Putin is the master pulling the strings.\u201dEventually, everyone moved to the den, a spacious, brightly lit room filled with family photos. Matthew Weiner, the \u201cMad Men\u201d creator, took a seat by a stack of DVDs, which included multiple seasons of his own hit TV show. Others arranged themselves along wicker chairs that lined the room\u2019s perimeter. The whole thing had the feeling of a P.T.A. meeting, but without the stale cookies.Wizner got up and spoke for some time about his efforts as Snowden\u2019s lawyer. As he opened the room to questions, someone asked how long Russia could be relied on to keep Snowden safe. Wizner turned the question over to Stone. \u201cOliver is the Russia expert,\u201d he said with a hint of passive-\u00adaggression. Since completing \u201cSnowden,\u201d Stone had become absorbed in his newfound interest in Russia and announced that he was making a documentary about Putin. In recent months, he had accompanied the Russian president to a theater performance and a World War II Victory Day parade in Moscow. \u201cHe represents a different point of view that Americans don\u2019t want to hear,\u201d Stone had told RIA Novosti, a Russian news service.When someone else asked about Stone\u2019s experience of making \u201cSnowden,\u201d his answer was despondent. \u201cIt was really a horrible experience in every way,\u201d he said. Everyone laughed except for Stone.As the guests dispersed, Wizner lingered in the foyer, admiring Stone\u2019s art collection depicting important and mostly dead men. He thought that a print of Jean-Paul Sartre looked like Steve Buscemi and that a pained-\u00adlooking Beethoven was actually Stone. On the opposite wall was a sketch of Genghis Khan, the feared Mongolian emperor. Stone called him a liberal.\u201cYes, Genghis Khan \u2014 misunderstood,\u201d Wizner teased.Stone smiled and cocked his head. \u201cListen, the A.C.L.U. should defend him!\u201dAdvertisement"}

The Oceana Naval Air Station is less than a mile away, and we\u2019re in the flight path of the jet planes. There are other military installations nearby, too. The jet noise can be quite loud in the area at times, but to me it\u2019s the sound of freedom. You\u2019ll often see bumper stickers around here with that phrase.In January I took over from my predecessor, Fred Whyte, and moved into his office. Before that I was vice president for finance, I.T. and H.R. I didn\u2019t want to invest a lot of money in making sweeping changes to the office, and I also wanted to send the message that we\u2019ve been extremely successful so far and I wanted to continue on that path. I substituted some photos and added new chairs, some technology and personal items.Open to the worldI\u2019m South African. My grandfather was a missionary there and lived in the bush. Both he and my father were accepting of all people and cultures in a time when others were not. They both had the strength and character I hope to achieve. Often, as you grow up, you build a framework of how you think the world works, but as you travel, meet new people and experience new cultures, you realize there are other frames of reference and ways of doing things.2. Show and tellI\u2019m a visual learner. I ask staff members to bring whatever they\u2019re working on to meetings so we can all see the product or part. For example, we manufacture the pistons here that are used in our chain saws, blowers, hedge trimmers and other products. When we\u2019re talking about a component or an assembly, I want to make sure we all have the same understanding, and it\u2019s so much quicker if you have the object in front of you during the discussion.3. Keeping it in lineIn 2007 we built a plant here to manufacture guide bars, the part that directs or guides the cutting chain on a saw blade. Previously they were all built at a Stihl facility in Germany. This one is signed by Hans Peter Stihl, a son of the company founder, who visits here every year.Breaking bread with workersI never eat lunch in my office. I try to catch up with staff at that time. Either I go to our canteen or go out with someone. Once a month I attend a luncheon for employees celebrating milestone anniversaries. My favorite part is when employees talk about their long history with Stihl. Recently three people celebrated 35 years.4. The big screenI have an 80-inch TV screen connected to my computer, and dual monitors on my desk that display emails on one and my calendar on the other. I also use an iPad and tablet during the day. I\u2019ll often transfer whatever I\u2019m working on to the TV. During meetings in my office, I like to pull up calendars, spreadsheets and so forth on the screen so we can view the details together. I also have an Apple Watch tethered to my iPhone that notifies me about coming meetings.Vying for the lumberjack crownI\u2019ve displayed a few photos from our company collection that are representative of people who use our products. We sponsor various competitions and own and run the annual Stihl Timbersports series, which we established in 1985. One of the photos is of a contestant vying for the title of best lumberjack. Another is of a worker cutting down a tree. I especially like a photo of firefighters from Virginia Beach.A personalized prototypeWhen we were experimenting with 3-D printers, one of our engineers printed my name in 3-D to try to sell me on how they could be used at Stihl. I spent time with him understanding how they could help with metal production pieces we were sending out to be made. Now we use two printers to produce jigs and fittings.Making the roundsI travel to Germany two or three times a year to our headquarters, and about once a month I visit some of our six Stihl branches and five independent distributors in the United States. They sell to more than 9,000 Stihl servicing dealers.Message in a bottleMy predecessor could be a bit of a prankster. He left me a Japanese scroll and a note saying it was my business plan. I had no idea what the Japanese writing meant. He also left a box and suggested I open it in case I needed help with the plan.

{"Headline": "Women Have Been Boxing in the Shadows for Too Long", "Date": "2016-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEssayShields\u2019s brow creases. She looks completely befuddled. \u201cI box,\u201d she says.Boxing, if it was smart and forward-thinking, would recognize that it needs women (especially the Claressa Shieldses of the world) in order to compete with other combat sports that are dominating the market. It may be no accident that after a 1-minute-and-41-second technical knockout at the Barclays Center last month, the main line of questioning for the victor, the featherweight Amanda Serrano, was: \u201cAre you training in M.M.A.?\u201d There is money to be made for female fighters in M.M.A., in part because the U.F.C.\u2019s president, Dana White, decided to reverse a 2011 decision barring women. \u201cThis whole women\u2019s-power movement that\u2019s going on right now is crazy,\u201d he said during a 2015 news conference. \u201cRonda [Rousey] has been the whole thing. Ronda is the one that launched this whole thing. I wouldn\u2019t have done it if it wasn\u2019t for Ronda. She\u2019s the one that convinced me to do it.\u201d When Ronda Rousey fought Holly Holms (previously a professional boxer), U.F.C. made more than $50 million in pay-per-view buys. White now calls the decision to open up a women\u2019s division one of the smartest and most bankable decisions he\u2019s ever made; earlier this year, his company sold for $4 billion.So why has M.M.A. succeeded where women\u2019s boxing has historically failed? One answer is organization \u2014 U.F.C. has one governing body, and women\u2019s boxing has four. That means a proliferation of belts, and a lack of central authority to ensure that fights are well-matched, timely and fair. Women\u2019s boxing also suffers from a lack of exposure: Fights need to be televised in order to gauge audience enthusiasm and to build audience in the first place. \u201cWomen\u2019s boxing just isn\u2019t televised,\u201d the promoter Lou DiBella told me. \u201cBoxing for generations and centuries has been a man\u2019s sport, and when women popped up, it was treated as a novelty.\u201d One way to fix it, he suggested, was to advocate for equality: National figures like Ellen DeGeneres and Oprah Winfrey need to champion fighters and to provide a platform for them. The professional featherweight Heather Hardy thinks male fighters should insist on televised female undercards as part of their contracts. \u201cSneak us on to a broadcast and let the audience decide. But don\u2019t put together some all-women\u2019s card on Showtime Extreme at 2 a.m. That\u2019s a sideshow.\u201d Hardy, a single mother with a 12-year-old daughter, works full-time as a personal trainer in addition to training and fighting professionally; she also sells blocks of tickets to finance her fights. \u201cSomeone needs to be held accountable, because it\u2019s not fair,\u2019\u2019 she says. \u201cAfter one fight, I walked away with $30,000 in ticket sales and a $10,000 purse, and the next guy, also on the undercard and not televised, made $150,000 for his purse. And I bet he didn\u2019t sell any of his own tickets.\u201dWomen\u2019s boxing also needs a champion like Dana White to push for capitalization on market potential so that this generation of Olympic boxers, like Claressa Shields, has somewhere to go professionally. That person may be Stephen Espinoza, the general manager of Showtime sports, who recently told The Wall Street Journal that he could see showing a professional women\u2019s bout on a live broadcast within the next six months. Even more promising, P.B.C. will air its first-ever female undercard, between Heather Hardy and Shelly Vincent on Aug. 21 in Coney Island, on NBC Sports \u2014 a fight promoted by DiBella.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Warned of a Crash, Start-Ups in Silicon Valley Narrow Their Focus", "Date": "2016-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Evernote, a Silicon Valley start-up that makes a note-taking app, was supposed to be dead by now.\u201cHere we sit, a year after we were supposed to die,\u201d said Chris O\u2019Neill, 43, chief executive of the start-up, which is based in Redwood City, Calif. \u201cIt was hard for employees to readjust expectations. They had only known a world where another fund-raise was just around the corner.\u201dSilicon Valley start-ups were set to face a great reckoning in 2016. Yet the crash hasn\u2019t happened.The worst fallout may yet come, but many of the start-ups have hung on. Across Silicon Valley, engineers are still commanding annual salaries that average $136,000, according to Hired, a recruiting firm. Demand is brisk for $4 buttered toast, and office space rents remain near record highs. The biggest start-ups, like Uber and Airbnb, continue to land billions of dollars in funding. And investors are shoveling money into venture capital funds, which raised so much cash in the first half of this year that it rivaled the amount raised in all of 2015.For all of the hand-wringing, \u201cthere just hasn\u2019t been much of a downturn,\u201d said Paul Buchheit, a managing partner at Y Combinator, a prominent start-up incubator that nurtured companies including Dropbox and Airbnb. \u201cI don\u2019t even see many companies going out of business.\u201dYet it is precisely these adaptations that have allowed many Silicon Valley start-ups to stick it out \u2014 for now, at least.\u201cThe start-up world did heed the warnings,\u201d said Max Levchin, a former employee and a founder of PayPal and the chief executive of Affirm, a lending start-up in San Francisco.For techies who have been grappling with the not-yet-a-crash environment, the adjustment in their outlook is evident in their speech. Entrepreneurs who once talked about how fast their start-ups were growing are now spouting from a bible of fiscal responsibility.Sean Behr, the chief executive of the parking service Zirx, epitomizes the change. The company, named after the Ukrainian word for star, was in the \u201con-demand\u201d space, providing valet parking with the touch of a smartphone button. Mr. Behr said his goal was to make all of Zirx\u2019s consumers feel like stars.But each customer was so expensive to acquire and serve that Zirx lost money and consumers in all six cities where it operated. By late last year, Zirx, a San Francisco start-up that had raised $36 million, had only about a year\u2019s worth of cash left.So in January, Mr. Behr, 41, walked his employees through nearly 40 PowerPoint slides detailing the company\u2019s precarious finances and explained that Zirx needed to take drastic actions. That month, he told customers Zirx was shutting down its on-demand businesses where valets would park cars for any customer who asked and would instead focus on more lucrative corporate clients.\u201cInvestors used to say grow, grow, grow and don\u2019t worry about costs,\u201d Mr. Behr said. \u201cNow you\u2019re encouraged to not run out of money and make sure you\u2019ll be around.\u201dToday, Zirx is profitable in eight of its nine markets, he said. The company has preserved $10 million from its last financing round to keep in the bank for a rainier day.At Bannerman, a 16-person security guard start-up based in San Francisco, Johnny Chin, the chief executive, also narrowed the company\u2019s focus after warnings of a crash. While the start-up once pursued several types of customers, it began concentrating on serving only medium-size offices and property managers.The company was losing money last year, but it is now profitable. Start-ups \u201cstarted to cut their most frivolous spending,\u201d said Mr. Chin, 30. \u201cPeople are just cautious. It\u2019s healthier.\u201dOther entrepreneurs have a newfound air of practicality, no longer shooting for their companies to be the next tech behemoth like Facebook.Ken Denman, chief executive of the artificial intelligence start-up Emotient, was trying to drum up more money for his company last year when he heard the talk about a coming start-up calamity. So to hedge his bets, he started talking to potential buyers, too.\u201cIn 2013, I wouldn\u2019t have thought about selling,\u201d said Mr. Denman, 58. But all the concerns \u201cencouraged folks to behave in whatever way would give them the greatest chance to succeed.\u201dIn January, he sold his four-year-old company for an undisclosed amount to Apple, where most of his team now works. \u201cI looked at all the variables and wanted to do what was the best thing for the employees and the company,\u201d said Mr. Denman, who is taking a break after the sale.While there has been no crash since then, he does not regret any prognostications. He said he was glad if young companies had stopped overspending because of his warnings.\u201cFunding for just anything under the sun has gone away,\u201d Mr. Gurley said. \u201cI spoke out because the longer those things go on, the worse things end up later on.

{"Headline": "Warren Hinckle, 77, Ramparts Editor Who Embraced Gonzo Journalism, Dies", "Date": "2016-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWarren Hinckle, the flamboyant editor who made Ramparts magazine a powerful national voice for the radical left in the 1960s and later, by championing the work of Hunter S. Thompson, helped introduce the no-holds-barred reporting style known as gonzo journalism, died on Thursday in San Francisco. He was 77.The cause was complications of pneumonia, his daughter Pia Hinckle said.Ramparts was a small-circulation quarterly for liberal Roman Catholics when Mr. Hinckle began writing for and promoting it in the early 1960s. A born provocateur with a keen sense of public relations, he took over as the executive editor in 1964 and immediately set about transforming Ramparts from a sleepy intellectual journal to a slickly produced, crusading political magazine that galvanized the American left.With cover art and eye-catching headlines reminiscent of mainstream magazines like Esquire, Ramparts aimed to deliver \u201ca bomb in every issue,\u201d as Time magazine once put it. It looked at Cardinal Francis Spellman\u2019s involvement in promoting American involvement in Vietnam and the Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s financing of a wide variety of cultural organizations.It published Che Guevara\u2019s diaries, with a long introduction by Fidel Castro; Eldridge Cleaver\u2019s letters from prison; and some of the wilder conspiracy theories surrounding the Kennedy assassination. The magazine\u2019s photo essay in January 1967 showing the injuries inflicted on Vietnamese children by American bombs helped persuade the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to take a public stand against the war.The covers became countercultural classics: an illustration depicting Ho Chi Minh, the Communist leader of North Vietnam, as Washington crossing the Delaware; a photograph of four hands (belonging to the magazine\u2019s top editors) holding up draft cards that had been set on fire.By 1967, the magazine, which began with about 2,500 readers, had a circulation of nearly 250,000 and an ability to wrest coverage, however grudging, from mass-circulation magazines and newspapers.\u201cWhat journalism is about is to attack everybody,\u201d Mr. Hinckle told The Washington Post in 1981. \u201cFirst you decide what\u2019s wrong, then you go out to find the facts to support that view, and then you generate enough controversy to attract attention.\u201dWarren James Hinckle III was born on Oct. 12, 1938, in San Francisco, where his father, Warren Hinckle Jr., was a shipyard worker and his mother, the former Angela DeVere, worked in the accounts department of the Southern Pacific Railroad. At 10, he lost an eye in a car accident, and for the rest of his life he wore a large eye patch, which became a prominent feature of his buccaneering image.He attended Roman Catholic schools and enrolled in the University of San Francisco, a Jesuit institution, where he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in philosophy in 1961.As editor of the college newspaper, The San Francisco Foghorn, he showed early signs of the flair that would insert Ramparts into the national conversation. On a slow day, he and a friend generated news by burning down a wooden guard house at the entrance to the campus, an incident he described in his 1974 memoir, \u201cIf You Have a Lemon, Make Lemonade.\u201dAfter graduating from college, he started a public relations company and ran, unsuccessfully, for the county board of supervisors before joining The San Francisco Chronicle as a city reporter.In 1962, he married Denise Libarle. The marriage ended in divorce. In addition to his daughter Pia, he is survived by his wife, the writer Susan Cheever, from whom he was separated; his companion, Linda Corso; another daughter, Hilary Hinckle; a son, Warren Hinckle IV; five grandchildren; a brother, Robert; and a sister, Marianne Hinckle.His relationship with Ramparts began inauspiciously, when Edward M. Keating, who founded the magazine in 1962, hired him to develop a promotional plan. Mr. Hinckle proposed a splashy party at a Manhattan hotel for leading Catholic laymen and journalists, with models and film stars thrown in for glamour. Mr. Keating, appalled, fired him.Undeterred, he contributed an article on J. D. Salinger to the magazine\u2019s first issue and, after whipping up press attention for an article on the killing of three civil rights workers in Mississippi in June 1964, was named executive editor.It was a turning point. Before the year was out, he had transformed the publication from a quarterly to a monthly and hired Robert Scheer, a seasoned foreign correspondent, who wrote some of the magazine\u2019s most hard-hitting antiwar articles and secured the rights to publish the Guevara diaries.Mr. Hinckle extracted maximum publicity at every turn. When the C.I.A. learned that Ramparts was about to reveal the agency\u2019s secret funding of a long list of organizations, including the National Student Association, the A.F.L.-C.I.O., and Encounter and Partisan Review magazines, it tried to minimize the impact by holding a news conference to admit the facts.Mr. Hinckle counterpunched. \u201cI was damned if I was going to let the C.I.A. scoop me,\u201d he wrote in his memoir. \u201cI bought full-page advertisements in The New York Times and The Washington Post to scoop myself, which seemed the preferable alternative.\u201d The magazine received a George Polk Award that year for its coverage.Ramparts was always in the news, always in chaos, always in debt. The hard-drinking Mr. Hinckle often worked from Cookie Picetti\u2019s, a bar in San Francisco\u2019s North Beach that was frequented by the police. When Mr. Cleaver told him that colleagues at Ramparts objected, he challenged him to name a decent left-wing bar. He spent lavishly, traveling first-class and staying in top hotels. He particularly enjoyed treating investors to sumptuous meals at their expense.In Feed/Back magazine in 1975, Adam Hochschild, a staff writer and later a founder of Mother Jones, wrote: \u201cAll action at the magazine swirled around him: a pet monkey named Henry Luce would sit on his shoulder while he paced his office, drink in hand, shouting instructions into a speakerphone across the room to someone in New York about a vast promotional mailing; on his couch would be sitting, slightly dazed, a French television crew or Malcolm X\u2019s widow (who arrived one day surrounded by a dozen bodyguards with loaded shotguns), or the private detective to whom Hinckle had given the title Criminology Editor.\u201dWith the magazine teetering on bankruptcy, Mr. Hinckle resigned as editor in 1969. Ramparts carried on until 1975, but the end of the Vietnam War and the splintering of the American left left it stranded.The magazine lasted only eight issues, but Mr. Hinckle used his platform to his advantage. He ran a scathing profile of the French skier Jean-Claude Killy that Hunter Thompson had written for Playboy, which rejected it. He then dispatched Mr. Thompson to cover the Kentucky Derby, in company with the English illustrator Ralph Steadman. The resulting article, \u201cThe Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved,\u201d put Mr. Thompson on the road to gonzo glory.Mr. Hinckle briefly edited City of San Francisco, a magazine owned by Francis Ford Coppola. \u201cInsiders joke that Hinckle is the only man who can spend money faster than Coppola can make it,\u201d Newsweek wrote. After that magazine ceased publication in 1976, Mr. Hinckle founded another magazine, Frisco, which quickly died.In the 1980s and 1990s, as a columnist for The Chronicle, The San Francisco Examiner and The San Francisco Independent, he validated his reputation as a free-swinging street brawler. He led a campaign to remove \u201cI Left My Heart in San Francisco\u201d as the city\u2019s official song, calling Tony Bennett \u201can over-the-hill Italian croaker,\u201d and attacked Dianne Feinstein, when she was mayor, with such gusto that she once tried to empty a drink over his head.\u201cHe\u2019s a man who invents things, who often gets his facts wrong, who gets carried away by the emotion,\u201d Maitland Zane, a reporter for The Chronicle, told SF Weekly in 1996. \u201cHe lets his prejudices dictate his writing. He\u2019s not even a good speller.\u201dIn 1993, Mr. Hinckle revived The Argonaut, a 19th-century magazine once edited by Ambrose Bierce, as a thick journal devoted, he told The Times in 1994, to \u201cmuckraking, left politics and the willingness to promote new writing and celebrate popular culture.\u201dIn 1969, Mr. Hinckle described Ramparts under his editorship as \u201ctotally and absolutely and joyfully biased.\u201d He added: \u201cWe went in to hang the Saigon government, to kill the war in Vietnam. That\u2019s what political journalism is about.\u201dAn obituary on Friday about Warren Hinckle, the editor who made Ramparts magazine a voice for the radical left, referred incorrectly to Mr. Hinckle\u2019s marriage to the writer Susan Cheever. Although separated, they were still married; they were not divorced.An obituary on Friday about Warren Hinckle, the editor who made Ramparts magazine a voice for the radical left, omitted two survivors, based on information from his family. A brother, Robert, and a sister, Marianne Hinckle, also survive him.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gordon T. Danby, Who Helped Invent Magnetic-Levitation Trains, Dies at 86", "Date": "2016-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGordon T. Danby, a physicist who with a colleague invented superconducting magnetic-levitation trains in the 1960s and then spent decades in largely futile efforts to get them built, died on Aug. 2 in Stony Brook, N.Y. He was 86.His daughter, Jennifer, confirmed his death. Dr. Danby, a longtime resident of Wading River, N.Y., moved to an assisted-living facility in nearby East Setauket three years ago.Dr. Danby was a young scientist at Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island in 1960 when a colleague and housemate, James R. Powell, told him about an idea he had had one day while stuck in traffic for five hours. The idea was for a futuristic train without tracks or an engine, but with strong electromagnets that would keep the cars elevated and propel them, providing a very high-speed and nearly friction-free ride.The concept of using magnetic forces in what is known as a maglev train had been around for half a century. But Dr. Danby and Dr. Powell proposed using superconducting magnets that would be powerful enough to levitate heavy passenger or freight train cars.The two men worked on the maglev project in their spare time, published a paper on it in an engineering journal in 1966 and received a patent two years later.\u201cIf we had not been working on it together, I doubt it would ever have happened,\u201d Dr. Powell said.Scientists and engineers from the federal government and from Germany and Japan soon came calling, he recalled.For their work on maglev transportation, Dr. Danby and Dr. Powell were awarded the Benjamin Franklin Medal in Engineering in 2000 by the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia.Gordon Thompson Danby was born on Nov. 8, 1929, in Richmond, Ontario, near Ottawa. After developing rickets as a child, he was sent to live with his grandparents at their farm in rural Ontario.He became a skilled hockey player and played the sport semiprofessionally. He studied mathematics and physics at Carleton University in Ottawa and received a doctorate in nuclear physics in 1956 from McGill University in Montreal.Dr. Danby was hired at Brookhaven the next year and worked there until 1999. While at the lab, he devised a way to make particle accelerators more powerful by using separate magnets to bend and curve the particle beam, rather than combining the functions in one magnet.He later worked as a consultant for the Fonar Corporation in Melville, N.Y., designing superconducting electromagnets for the company\u2019s magnetic resonance imaging machines, including those that allow a patient to be upright during the procedure.In addition to his daughter, Dr. Danby is survived by his wife, Jane, and a son, Judd.In the 1990s, frustrated by the lackluster response of federal agencies to their maglev work, Dr. Danby and Dr. Powell proposed a privately financed 20-mile line in Florida. It did not get very far. But they never stopped believing in the technology and promoting it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Close My Tax Loophole", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMy fellow venture capitalists and private equity investors are paying close attention to the heated election-year rhetoric about the future of \u201ccarried interest,\u201d which is the performance fee we charge to manage other people\u2019s money. Carried interest is the fund manager\u2019s share of the earnings from a profitable investment, normally paid on top of a much smaller management fee.It\u2019s also a subject of increasing political disfavor. Over the past year, every major presidential candidate \u2014 from Jeb Bush and Donald J. Trump to Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders \u2014 has called for an end to a tax loophole that exists for carried interest. Mrs. Clinton has vowed that if Congress does not close the loophole, as president she would ask the Treasury Department to use its regulatory authority to do so.Ultimately, the controversy has to do with tax fairness, or the lack thereof. Instead of being taxed as wages or commissions earned, carried interest is currently taxed as if it were a personal investment, or capital gains. This gives us a significant tax advantage since the capital gains tax rate is about 50 percent lower than the top rate on ordinary income.When I started my first fund, Alan Patricof Associates, in 1970, I vividly remember my accountant telling me about my first sale of an investment: \u201cWe\u2019re going to treat this as capital gain, but sooner or later, it will be characterized as ordinary income.\u201dThat was 46 years ago \u2014 and virtually nothing has changed.It is past time for that to change, and for fund managers like myself to accept the reality: We should not be receiving a tax break meant for investors when our work does not involve the risk of our own investment of capital.As the former Treasury secretary Larry Summers once said of carried interest, \u201cRarely has a policy existed so long with such weak arguments in its favor.\u201dThe capital gains tax benefit was originally created for people who invested with their own capital at risk. It was established as an incentive for investors to take greater risk than they would with their ordinary income. But because of the nature of our work, carried interest does not merit that incentive.To the extent that venture capitalists and private equity investors have their own capital invested in their own or any funds, they deserve capital gains treatment, just as any other limited partner does. But the same does not hold true for a general partner.The general partner is managing the funds of others and rarely puts his own money into the initial investment. The risk he takes is that his ultimate payout is not guaranteed unless the venture is profitable \u2014 which is very different from the investor who is putting his own money at stake.Most important, it comes back to a question of fairness. Our current political and cultural environment is marred by a toxic belief that the country\u2019s economic order is rigged against ordinary Americans \u2014 that the world of high finance unjustly supersedes their rights, needs and wants.For that reason alone, my fellow venture capitalists and private equity investors should support the closing of the carried interest loophole: It would carry great symbolic weight.There needs to be a more realistic attitude from those of us who have benefited from the carried interest loophole for too many years.We need to demonstrate a little more patriotism, and a greater sense of fairness, even if it affects our pocketbooks.Advertisement"}

As art prices soared, the big international houses gambled with guarantees and sacrificed commissions to attract the most valuable lots, squeezing their own margins.Sotheby\u2019s rival, the privately owned Christie\u2019s, said auction sales were $2.5 billion over the equivalent six months, a drop of 37.5 percent.Mike Goss, Sotheby\u2019s chief financial officer, said at the earnings call for investors and analysts that the company\u2019s auction commission margin had increased to 16.4 percent in the second quarter, up from 15.5 percent in the equivalent period last year.Mr. Goss attributed the improvement to \u201ca shift in mix toward lower price bands\u201d and to a lesser extent \u201cgreater pricing discipline.\u201d\u201cGuarantees on masterworks have generally proven to be attritional to earnings, but in the past they did buy market share,\u201d said Neal Meltzer, an art adviser in New York. \u201cWinning the sale of the Taubman collection was vital to maintaining respect for the Sotheby\u2019s brand.\u201d\u201cSotheby\u2019s has held the line,\u201d said Guy Jennings, managing director of the Fine Art Fund Group in London. \u201cThey haven\u2019t allowed consignors to eat into their margins.\u201d\u201cPictures at $70 million are good P.R., but the revenues are in the middle market,\u201d he said, where sellers tend to pay full commissions and guarantees are nearly unheard of. \u201cThat\u2019s the most lucrative way to do business.\u201dSotheby\u2019s results cheered investors. In after-hours trading Thursday, it was at $40 a share, up from its Aug. 5 price of $32.28. Back in February, it had sunk as low as $19.13.\u201cDespite the overall drop in auction sales last year, the Asian market remains the biggest in the world,\u201d said Wendy Cromwell, an art adviser in New York. \u201cThis investment can potentially open new avenues for profitability for Sotheby\u2019s.\u201dIn announcing the acquisition, Tad Smith, Sotheby\u2019s president and chief executive, said it would help improve the company\u2019s \u201cleadership position at the high end of the fine art market, bolstering our private sales capability, giving us new growth opportunities in advisory services and reinforcing the client-first culture in all we do.\u201dIn the first half of 2016, year-on-year private sales declined 33 percent to $249.6 million. But Sotheby\u2019s S.E.C. filing does register $3.4 million of income from advisory fees \u2014 though the company did have to pay Art Agency, Partners $4.4 million in compensation for the privilege. Still, since the merger, Sotheby\u2019s has managed to secure the prime consignment of an otherwise thin-looking November auction season in New York \u2014 the collection of paintings owned by the New York collector and philanthropist Steven Ames, who died in March, and his wife, Ann.To do so, Sotheby\u2019s offered a guarantee, and has estimated the collection at around $100 million. It includes two 1980s Gerhard Richter abstracts, each expected to sell for at least $20 million, and a 1976-77 Willem de Kooning painting, which has yet to be formally estimated. Mr. Smith said in the Monday earnings call that Sotheby\u2019s intended to hedge some of the Ames guarantees with third-party investors.So, Sotheby\u2019s would appear to be shipshape, ready for whatever geopolitical storms blow at the art market.\u201cI wonder how much of this was fortuitous,\u201d said Steven Blitz, the chief economist at ITG Investment Research, a brokerage firm in New York. \u201cThey\u2019ve kind of fallen into a situation where the average hammer prices were lower and the commissions were higher. It\u2019s not a strong market.\u201d\u201cSotheby\u2019s stock is a macro trade,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the global economy goes into recession, it will lose money.\u201d\u201cBut it will survive and come back, if it\u2019s not overloaded with debt,\u201d he added. \u201cThey have kept control of costs. There\u2019s nothing magical about it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "De La Soul\u2019s Legacy Is Trapped in Digital Limbo", "Date": "2016-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter gathering fans\u2019 email addresses in an online call-out, this hip-hop trio from Long Island sent out links to zip files for its first six albums. Those albums \u2014 including its 1989 debut, \u201c3 Feet High and Rising,\u201d a platinum record in the Library of Congress\u2019s National Recording Registry \u2014 are some of the genre\u2019s most influential and sonically adventurous, threading samples from obscure, kitschy records alongside recognizable pop, jazz and funk hooks.The links were available for a day, and the group says the response overloaded the servers hosting the music files. They also attracted the attention of Warner Music, which has owned those records since 2002, when it acquired the catalog of Tommy Boy Records, a pioneering indie hip-hop label.The attention wasn\u2019t just because the group was giving its catalog away. It was because those six albums have never been available to buy digitally or to stream.In a recent interview, the group explained that it had reached a boiling point.\u201cWe were frustrated with people not being able to just get it,\u201d Vincent Mason, 46, the group\u2019s D.J., known as Maseo, said, adding that the financial impact of digital invisibility was amplified by the fact that their work with Damon Albarn\u2019s Gorillaz had introduced them to another audience.Warner Music Group, which controls the albums\u2019 distribution, was quick to reach out. \u201cThey did tap on our window,\u201d said David Jolicoeur, 47, formerly known as Trugoy the Dove (now just Dave), rapping his knuckles on a table for emphasis. \u201c\u2018Hey guys, what the [expletive] are you doing?\u2019\u201d\u201cWe spent years and years trying to figure this out with Warner,\u201d said Kelvin Mercer, 46, known as Posdnuos, who added that label personnel kept shifting and allies were \u201cshuffled out\u201d over time.Mr. Mason said they considered how much money they would earn from a record label and decided owning the album was worth more. \u201cThe faith, I would say, really kicked in when we gave away the music.\u201d\u201cAnd the Anonymous Nobody\u201d is a drastic departure for the group. Rather than use samples, De La Soul spent three years recording more than 200 hours of the Rhythm Roots Allstars, a 10-piece funk and soul band it has toured with. Then the group mined that material for the basis of the 17 tracks (25 musicians ended up playing on the album). From the opening horn fanfare of \u201cRoyalty Capes\u201d to the Queen-esque metal of \u201cLord Intended\u201d to the loping cowboy funk of \u201cUnfold\u201d (an exclusive track for those who contributed to the Kickstarter campaign), the record explores a number of genres, with extended instrumental passages. And a wild variety of guests \u2014 Usher, Snoop Dogg, David Byrne, Little Dragon \u2014 help shift the moods. The proposed guest list was even more ambitious \u2014 Tom Waits, Jack Black and Axl Rose were also approached. \u201cWillie Nelson kindly declined,\u201d Mr. Jolicoeur said.The album\u2019s title, Mr. Jolicoeur said, represented part of the collaborative process. \u201cThis is about a person selflessly giving everything they could to make something cool or new or fun or better happen,\u201d he said. \u201cThat became the vibe of the record. It wasn\u2019t really about a concept of the song; it was about, out of nowhere: \u2018I play trumpet. I want to contribute.\u2019\u201dMr. Jolicoeur said he had learned that a similar, freewheeling approach often led to the kinds of sounds the group had sampled in the past. \u201cWhen these guys from the Ohio Players to Parliament-Funkadelic were just jamming, that\u2019s where the songs came from,\u201d Mr. Jolicoeur said. \u201cIt was allowing something to happen organically.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re in the Library of Congress, but we\u2019re not on iTunes,\u201d Mr. Mercer said, adding that when the group interacts with fans in person or online, they always ask the same question: \u201cYo, where\u2019s the old stuff?\u201dThat old stuff \u2014 which also includes \u201cDe La Soul Is Dead\u201d (1991), \u201cBuhloone Mindstate\u201d (1993) and \u201cStakes Is High\u201d (1996) \u2014 may be fraught with problems, according to people familiar with the group\u2019s recording and publishing history. In 1989, obtaining the permission of musical copyright holders for the use of their intellectual property was often an afterthought. There was little precedent for young artists\u2019 mining their parents\u2019 record collections for source material and little regulation or guidelines for that process.Deborah Mannis-Gardner, a sample-clearance agent who worked with De La Soul on its new record, said that lack of guidelines could be why Warner Music is keeping the catalog in digital limbo.\u201cMy understanding is that due to allegedly uncleared samples, Warners has been uncomfortable or unwilling to license a lot of the De La Soul stuff,\u201d Ms. Mannis-Gardner said. \u201cIt becomes difficult opening these cans of worms \u2014 were things possibly cleared with a handshake?\u201dAn added possible complication lies in the language of the agreements drafted for the use of all those samples. (There are more than 60 on \u201c3 Feet High and Rising\u201d alone \u2014 the group was sued by the Turtles in 1991 for the use of their song \u201cYou Showed Me\u201d on a skit on that album and settled out of court for a reported $1.7 million.) If those agreements, written nearly three decades ago, do not account for formats other than CDs, vinyl LPs and cassettes, Warner Music would have to renegotiate terms for every sample on the group\u2019s first four records with their respective copyright holders to make those available digitally.In a statement, a person speaking for Rhino, a subsidiary of Warner Music Group that deals with the label\u2019s back catalog, said: \u201cDe La Soul is one of hip-hop\u2019s seminal acts, and we\u2019d love for their music to reach audiences on digital platforms around the world, but we don\u2019t believe it is possible to clear all of the samples for digital use, and we wouldn\u2019t want to release the albums other than in their complete, original forms. We understand this is very frustrating for the artists and the fans; it is frustrating for us, too.\u201dA number of people interviewed say the legal phrase \u201cnow known or hereafter discovered\u201d may determine De La Soul\u2019s digital future. It ensures that samples cleared in the past are legal for use on streaming services and for digital music retailers.Michelle Bayer, who handles De La Soul\u2019s publishing administration, said that phrase\u2019s potential absence on the group\u2019s contracts for samples could complicate matters for Warner Music. (Warner Music would not provide details about the sample contracts.)\u201cIt\u2019s tricky because someone could deny the sample use now, or negotiate high upfront advances, maybe even higher percentage or royalty than was originally negotiated, which lessens what the label can earn,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore, people were like, \u2018Oh yeah, whatever you want to do, we don\u2019t even know what you\u2019re talking about, sampling, who cares, whatever.\u2019 Now, it\u2019s like, \u2018Wow, that\u2019s a big piece of real estate.\u2019\u201dMs. Bayer added that people are still filing copyright claims on samples from De La Soul\u2019s early records.\u201cTwo songs from the first album just came up that had never come up before,\u201d Ms. Bayer said. \u201cI think when Warner got the catalog, I think people started making claims, people were kind of coming out of the woodwork going, \u2018Oh, well now it\u2019s a major label involved, and we can possibly get more from them than we might have gotten from an independent label like Tommy Boy.\u2019\u201dBut others, including Paul Huston, the producer known as Prince Paul, who worked closely with the group on its first three albums, say they did their due diligence. \u201cSampling was obviously new, but we were told, \u2018Hey, here\u2019s some sample-clearance forms \u2014 you have to fill these out,\u2019\u201d Mr. Huston said, adding that Tommy Boy became much more careful after the success of \u201c3 Feet High and Rising.\u201d \u201cIt got to the point where it was like, \u2018What is that scratch!?\u2019\u201dTom Silverman, the founder of Tommy Boy Records \u2014 which also put out albums by Digital Underground and Queen Latifah \u2014 said that making the group\u2019s catalog available digitally would not be difficult, considering that Warner Music should know the copyright holders who have been receiving royalties for the physical sales of the records.Mr. Silverman said: \u201cCutting a deal, you would think, to give them more money, shouldn\u2019t be that hard, especially if you\u2019re fair and logical and say, \u2018Let me pay you the same percentage that we\u2019ve always paid you on physical on digital, too, so you can make that much money.\u2019 So it doesn\u2019t really make a lot of sense that they\u2019ve haven\u2019t even tried.\u201dFor De La Soul, Warner Music and the owners of the copyrighted samples, the catalog\u2019s absence from digital media can be felt in an absence of income. That money would have come from downloads (the iTunes Music Store opened in 2003); streaming; ringtones (Mr. Silverman points out the group\u2019s 1991 single \u201cRing Ring (Ha Ha Hey)\u201d as a potential ringtone windfall); and deals with television, movies and advertisers.The cultural loss, said Ahmir Thompson, the Roots drummer known as Questlove, is just as significant.\u201cUnless Warner\u2019s illustrious history is so disposable that they can let one or two classics just fall by the wayside,\u201d Mr. Thompson said, \u201cand live in this sort of storied folklore \u2014 I mean, \u20183 Feet High and Rising\u2019 is very much in danger of being the classic tree that fell in the forest that was once given high praise and now is just a stump.\u201dLonnie Lynn, the rapper known as Common who has appeared on De La Soul albums, said the lack of a digital presence is a blow to available hip-hop history. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously disappointing, because I feel like De La is timeless music, and I feel like there\u2019s a 16-year-old that would find De La and be like, \u2018Aw, man, that\u2019s cool.\u2019\u201dThe group says it volunteered to bear the administrative burden of making the catalog available but that Warner Music was not interested.Mr. Jolicoeur acknowledges the potential task Warner faces is \u201ca lot of work,\u201d but Mr. Mason argues the time to do that work is now. \u201cWhen I try my best to tap into the psyche of record execs and how they think, they know there\u2019s some value \u2014 that\u2019s why they\u2019re not letting go,\u201d he said. \u201cBut on this side of the fence, you\u2019re like, \u2018I\u2019d appreciate you don\u2019t wait until one of us die to do this.\u2019 Can I enjoy some of the fruits of my own labor, while I\u2019m alive? Obviously, we\u2019re in the music industry \u2014 more people are more valuable dead than alive, you know? Can we change that landscape?\u201d\u201cIt really financially hurts these guys,\u201d Ms. Mannis-Gardner said. \u201cIf Warners won\u2019t license it, perhaps they could sell it back to the band members.\u201dMr. Huston said that several independent labels had approached him about releasing these records but that interest fizzles when he directs them to Warner Music.\u201cIt\u2019s like almost when you\u2019re a kid and somebody says, \u2018Hey, can I borrow your bike?\u2019\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cAnd it\u2019s like, \u2018I don\u2019t know, my mom won\u2019t let me; you can ask my mom,\u2019 and they go: \u2018Ohhh, that\u2019s all right. I don\u2019t need to borrow it.\u2019\u201dMr. Silverman, who still runs Tommy Boy, hopes to obtain his label\u2019s entire back catalog from Warner Music, and making De La Soul\u2019s disputed albums available digitally is the first thing he said he would do. \u201cThey\u2019ll be making a lot more money when that stuff becomes available,\u201d he said. \u201cNot the download part, the streaming part. It\u2019s like they missed the entire era of downloads.\u201dGiven the success of its Kickstarter campaign, De La Soul hasn\u2019t ruled out turning to crowdfunding to free its catalog.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Donald Trump Proposes to Double Hillary Clinton\u2019s Spending on Infrastructure", "Date": "2016-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDonald J. Trump took a step to Hillary Clinton\u2019s left on Tuesday, saying that he would like to spend at least twice as much as his Democratic opponent has proposed to invest in new infrastructure as part of his plan to stimulate the United States\u2019 economy.The idea takes a page out of the progressive playbook and is another indication that the Republican presidential nominee is prepared to break with the fiscal conservatism that his party has evangelized over the past eight years.\u201cWe have bridges that are falling down,\u201d Mr. Trump said on the Fox Business Network. \u201cWe have many, many bridges that are in danger of falling.\u201dAsked how he would pay for $800 billion to $1 trillion in infrastructure spending, Mr. Trump described a strategy that has been favored by liberal economists over the years. He said he would create an infrastructure fund that would be supported by government bonds that investors and citizens could purchase.\u201cWe\u2019re going to go out with a fund,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll get a fund, make a phenomenal deal with low interest rates and rebuild our infrastructure.\u201dHe added, \u201cWe\u2019d do infrastructure bonds from the country, from the United States.\u201dIf Mr. Trump\u2019s call for more spending sounds familiar, that could be because Lawrence H. Summers, who was President Bill Clinton\u2019s Treasury secretary and the director of President Obama\u2019s National Economic Council, has been saying the same thing. At a Democratic National Convention round table last week in Philadelphia, he said the United States should invest between $1 trillion and $2 trillion in infrastructure over the next 10 years.Conservative critics of Mr. Trump expressed concern that the idea would put the country deeper in debt and that it sounded alarmingly similar to Mr. Obama\u2019s 2009 stimulus program.\u201cI\u2019m old enough to remember when the people who supported Trump hated this idea when Obama proposed it,\u201d said Leon Wolf, a commentator on the conservative website Red State.Part of that plan, which Republicans opposed, was the issuance of \u201cBuild America Bonds,\u201d which allowed a broader group of investors to help finance infrastructure projects in states and cities.Although Mr. Trump has said he would use his prowess as a builder to redevelop infrastructure more efficiently than others could, an investment of $1 trillion could conflict with Mr. Trump\u2019s promises to reduce the deficit.\u201cYou\u2019d be increasing the deficit for a significant period of time if you were deploying that money,\u201d said Donald Marron, who was a member of President George W. Bush\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers.The Clinton campaign rejected the idea that Mr. Trump has serious ideas for rebuilding American infrastructure. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s only actual infrastructure proposal is to build a giant wall on the Mexican border and have Mexico pay for it,\u201d said Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton. \u201cOnly one candidate in this campaign has put forward a specific and credible plan for investing in our nation\u2019s infrastructure, and that\u2019s Hillary Clinton.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Reporter Recalls One of the Many Victims of Colombia\u2019s War: Her Father", "Date": "2016-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byReporter's NotebookWhile my stepmother, Samantha, negotiated with the rebels and took care of my younger siblings Nicolas and Lorena in Bogot\u00e1, and I finished my sophomore year of college in the United States, my father was moved from camp to camp, hidden under the jungle canopy as military planes swarmed above. He slept in 38 different places.What would my father think of the peace deal with his kidnappers?While my father was being held, his travel company went out of business. We lost everything. And we were among the lucky ones. The 52-year conflict, involving the FARC, the military and brutal right-wing paramilitaries, is believed to have claimed more than 220,000 lives, left 40,000 people missing and displaced more than five million.Yet on Oct. 2, when Colombians will have the final say on the peace deal by voting in a referendum, the decision will not be simple. Under the agreement, FARC fighters will receive amnesty for crimes such as drug trafficking.Those who confess to crimes like kidnapping and executions will be subject to five to eight years of restricted mobility, but no prison time. During that time, they are expected to perform social work in communities affected by the conflict. The deal faces significant political opposition, and many Colombians are furious.My father seldom mentioned his time with the FARC after he came home. Once, at the grocery store, he pointed to a package of crackers. \u201cThat\u2019s what they gave us to eat during marches,\u201d he said. Another time, he told me that rubber boots made a good pillow if you slipped one inside the other.Those moments offered glimpses of the distant world he had been pulled into, and how it lingered. Generally, and surely for our benefit, he made light of the kidnapping, calling it \u201cmy eco-challenge\u201d and a much-needed vacation.He was also forced to trek for days over punishing terrain. Once, when the military moved into a FARC-held area, he walked for 11 days straight, climbing a mountain pass in driving rain.Among the hostages on that march were the \u00c1ngulos, a working-class couple in their late 60s who had been kidnapped outside Bogot\u00e1. At some point, he told me, Carmenza \u00c1ngulo fell behind \u2014 her feet had swelled and wouldn\u2019t fit into her boots.As she limped along in bare feet, her husband, Gerardo, stayed by her side. A FARC fighter circled back with them. When my father\u2019s group stopped to rest for the night, the fighter reappeared; the \u00c1ngulos did not.The guerrilla had led them into the trees and, acting on orders, killed them. They were too slow. Their children paid a ransom and searched for them for years in vain, their son H\u00e9ctor \u00c1ngulo told me. Eventually, H\u00e9ctor returned with a team of investigators and captured guerrillas to look for their bones.One of these fighters played a role in his release.On my father\u2019s 265th day in captivity, as he languished in a camp with several hostages, gunfire erupted outside their caletas. It was the Colombian military, with around 60 soldiers. They fired machine guns, threw grenades.When the noise stopped, a soldier wearing a bandanna approached. \u201cGuys,\u201d my father remembered him saying, \u201cyou\u2019re free men.\u201d The rebels had fled.Among the soldiers was a figure smaller than the others, in a balaclava. After the ambush, she took off her mask, and my father recognized her. She was about 17, and a FARC fighter. He had seen her washing dishes in a camp mess hall.She helped free five hostages. At the time, it was one of the largest rescues in Colombia\u2019s history. (It is not clear what happened to her, or to her brother.)After the rescue, my family immediately moved to Panama, where we had family roots. We rarely returned to Colombia, but my father kept track of the news. In the years that followed, the FARC suffered a long string of battlefield setbacks, which ultimately led it to peace talks in Oslo and Havana. Through the peace process, my father remained deeply skeptical of the guerrillas, but hopeful.Was the deal finally reached last week something that he, a victim of the FARC, could endorse?Sadly, I couldn\u2019t call and ask.My father died in June, after a series of strokes, at 63. In the end, the conflict outlived him, if only by a couple of months.After he died, as I prepared to fly back home to New York from Panama, I opened his closet and stood amid his shirts and suits. Seventeen years before, when he was taken from us the first time, I had done the same thing.Then, somewhat miraculously, he had returned. He was reunited with his wife, Samantha, and together they washed away the dank stench of the jungle before he slipped back into his clean, old clothes.With somewhat more effort, he let go of the rancor, the outrage at what had happened, quite senselessly, to him and to our family.

{"Headline": "As Puerto Ricans Move to Florida, the Clinton Campaign Is Waiting for Them", "Date": "2016-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKISSIMMEE, Fla. \u2014 Bilingual campaign workers fanned out across the event hall, clutching clipboards as they sought prospective voters to register. Handmade signs shot up from the crowd: \u201cLatinos for Hillary\u201d and \u201cEstoy con ella!\u201dAnd from the stage at her rally here on Monday night, Hillary Clinton set aside time for \u201ca special word about Puerto Rico.\u201dIndeed.In that exodus, Clinton campaign organizers have recognized an opportunity, setting off a furious scramble to register a coveted class of new voters: those who arrive as full-fledged citizens.Many are settling in Central Florida, a swing region in a swing state with a peerless record of razor-thin electoral margins.Campaign officials and outside groups have responded accordingly.In the Orlando area \u2014 which for years has been a de facto San Juan suburb, with an estimated 400,000 Puerto Ricans calling it home \u2014 the Clinton campaign has assigned organizers to neighborhoods, churches and even bus stops. \u201cCaravanas\u201d of cars blasting reggaeton music and reminders to vote call to mind similar processions through San Juan\u2019s cobblestone streets during elections on the island. When neighbors come outside to investigate the fuss, they are offered brochures about the candidate, known to many Latinos simply as \u201cLa Hillary,\u201d and about her plans for education and health care.Democrats are not operating unchallenged. While Donald J. Trump\u2019s campaign has left little organizational footprint, other Republican-aligned operatives have stepped in.\u201cMoving on gives me a great, new opportunity to continue promoting free-market solutions while avoiding efforts that support Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Gaitan said in a statement.Republicans could once rely on solidly conservative Cuban-American political refugees in Miami as a crucial source of support. But it is not so simple anymore: Young Cuban arrivals are less reliably Republican; South Americans now make up a growing segment of the Latino population in the state; and Puerto Ricans, who at more than a million statewide now rival the Cuban-American population, are flocking to Orange, Osceola and Polk Counties in Central Florida \u2014 once the heart of the state\u2019s white working-class vote.Those demographic changes have already had consequences: George W. Bush lost to John Kerry in Orange County by fewer than 1,000 votes in 2004, but in 2008 and again in 2012, President Obama won there by about 85,000.Still, while Puerto Ricans generally favor Democrats, they have tended to be less party-conscious than some other groups, bolstering Mr. Obama in his two Florida victories but also helping to elect Charlie Crist as governor when he was a Republican.And in contrast to Cuban-Americans, who have long wielded power in Florida, newly arrived Puerto Rican voters often need to be reminded they can even vote.\u201cTheir political participation on the island is so high,\u201d said Lorella Praeli, the Peruvian-born Latino vote director for the Clinton campaign. \u201cNow that they\u2019re in Florida, it\u2019s about voter education, reminding them they can participate.\u201dSome have not required prodding.Fernando Ruiz, 39, said that registering to vote was among his first priorities after fleeing Toa Alta, P.R., last year amid the island\u2019s debt crisis.\u201cThere\u2019s no excuse,\u201d he said through an interpreter when asked why it was important to vote. \u201cI came to the United States to progress.\u201dAfter finding work at a pizza restaurant, Mr. Ruiz said, he was quickly promoted to food preparer from dishwasher.The Upshot\u2019s presidential forecast, updated daily.\u201cIt\u2019s driving a migration to this area that\u2019s not been seen before,\u201d Mr. Garces said of the island\u2019s financial strain.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s team is intent on pressing its advantage. Her campaign has more than a dozen offices in Florida, with some aides focusing on non-Cuban Hispanics.Mrs. Clinton herself has ample experience: During the 2008 Democratic primary, she wore a tropical-print shirt to campaign and participated in her own \u201ccaravana\u201d in Puerto Rico, where she handily defeated Mr. Obama. She returned to the island last year to discuss health care and, again, won the June 5 primary there by double digits.Bill Clinton and the campaign\u2019s political director, Amanda Renteria, have also visited Puerto Rico. And the campaign has issued bilingual messages of support for an increase in funding to fight the Zika virus and for a bipartisan bill to address the debt crisis.More recently, the Clinton campaign has invested in shoe-leather outreach.On Wednesday, a campaign team held court at the entrance of a Walmart in Kissimmee, contending with humidity and flies while asking just about every passer-by about his or her registration status.A day earlier, after meeting outside a laundromat near Miami\u2019s Little Havana, in a neighborhood that includes a high concentration of both Cuban and non-Cuban Hispanics, three organizers canvassed the surrounding blocks.\u201cHola!\u201d said Cari Casas, 20, the field organizer for the area, as she approached a woman who was spraying a white blouse inside the laundromat.\u201cS\u00ed,\u201d the woman replied pre-emptively, assuring Ms. Casas that she was ready for November.Over the course of an hour, the group registered about eight voters \u2014 outside a Starbucks, in a minimall and at a bus stop, where Ms. Casas persuaded a woman to scribble the requisite information on a form just as her ride was arriving. Most people they engaged said they were already accounted for.A few recognized Ms. Casas from past visits, offering waves and well wishes. In an interview, she suggested that Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy had assigned a particular urgency to her work, decades after her grandparents emigrated from Mexico.\u201cThey\u2019re not rapists or criminals,\u201d Ms. Casas said. \u201cThey\u2019re janitors.\u201dMatt Flegenheimer reported from Kissimmee, and Amy Chozick from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Think Tank Scholar or Corporate Consultant? It Depends on the Day", "Date": "2016-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Over the many months that officials in Washington debated sweeping new regulations for internet providers, Jeffrey A. Eisenach, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, was hard to miss.And he has plenty of company.An examination of 75 think tanks found an array of researchers who had simultaneously worked as registered lobbyists, members of corporate boards or outside consultants in litigation and regulatory disputes, with only intermittent disclosure of their dual roles.With their expertise and authority, think tank scholars offer themselves as independent arbiters, playing a vital role in Washington\u2019s political economy. Their imprimatur helps shape government decisions that can be lucrative to corporations.But the examination identified dozens of examples of scholars conducting research at think tanks while corporations were paying them to help shape government policy. Many think tanks also readily confer \u201cnonresident scholar\u201d status on lobbyists, former government officials and others who earn their primary living working for private clients, with few restrictions on such outside work.Largely free from disclosure requirements, the researchers\u2019 work is often woven into elaborate corporate lobbying campaigns.And it is a decidedly bipartisan practice.The overlapping roles are often not made clear, and even members of Congress say they are frequently unaware of the financial ties between industries and the witnesses with think tank titles appearing before them at hearings.\u201cThey can make a very deceptive and false claim to credibility that is totally lacking,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, who said he had become increasingly disturbed by the role of think tank experts on Capitol Hill. \u201cI think about it every time there is a witness now from a \u2018think tank,\u2019 putting that term in very boldface quotes.\u201dScholars sometimes include general references to their private-sector work in their official biographies. Mr. Eisenach, for example, notes that he is an executive at NERA Economic Consulting in addition to his position at the American Enterprise Institute. And when a private company pays him or his consulting firm to publish a study, he discloses the name of the corporate sponsor on the study.But there is no way for the public or policy makers to know Mr. Eisenach\u2019s full roster of NERA clients. And there is no comprehensive disclosure of these clients when he writes his think tank reports or academic papers, testifies before Congress, or meets with F.C.C. members or staff.Mr. Eisenach declined repeated requests to comment in detail. But a spokeswoman for the American Enterprise Institute, Judy Mayka Stecker, said she saw no conflict in his roles.\u201cWe believe in the open competition of ideas and encourage our scholars to engage with experts from all sectors and viewpoints,\u201d she said.A footnote on the first page of the letter indicated that none of the scholars who signed had been compensated by stakeholder companies. But of the dozen studies they submitted as evidence, more than half had been funded by telecommunications giants or based on other work for the companies, industry ties that were disclosed only in footnotes in the original studies.No federal rules required broader disclosure. Yet on many highly technical policy issues like telecommunications regulation, scholarship is dominated by industry-funded research, according to a review of hundreds of studies, regulatory filings and other documents.\u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019re in legal and you want to have a paper that says what you want it to say,\u201d said Dennis Weller, a former Verizon economist who occasionally consults for telecommunications companies and international organizations. \u201cYou could have a bunch of economists in house and ask them if they agree with you. How much easier would it be to go to an outside economist and say, \u2018How about if I pay you $100,000 to write this?\u2019\u201dFew policy battles have had higher stakes in recent years than the debate over net neutrality \u2014 a catchall term for proposals to restrict internet service providers from blocking websites or regulating speed.To bolster their claims that the regulations would hurt consumers, companies have financed research that contends the rules would reduce investment in new services and raise prices. That work is used to shape the public debate and to build an industry-funded narrative in the regulatory record, one that the F.C.C. is required by law to evaluate.Industry-sponsored research has also figured prominently in court battles over F.C.C. efforts to regulate the internet. When Verizon successfully opposed an earlier F.C.C. rule on net neutrality, more than half of the 23 studies or expert declarations cited in court filings had been sponsored directly by telecommunications companies or trade associations, according to an analysis by The Times. Other studies had been published under the banner of think tanks but written by scholars who consulted extensively for companies.The attacks began to grow particularly heated nearly two years ago, when Mr. Obama called on Mr. Wheeler and his fellow F.C.C. commissioners to regulate the internet like traditional phone lines.The study mentioned their employment at Economists Incorporated, a consulting firm in Washington. But a reader would have had to do more research to learn that Economists Incorporated\u2019s clients included AT&T and Verizon, companies leading the industry\u2019s charge against the commission proposal. That was disclosed on a \u201cselect client list\u201d on the Economists Incorporated website.\u201cPeople who are running advertisements are not going to say, \u2018In a study we paid for,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Litan, now an adjunct senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cIn the public discourse, the disclaimers often do get dropped.\u201d\u201cNone of us works for free,\u201d Mr. Singer wrote. \u201cSo let\u2019s focus on the merits & be nice to each other!\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Singer said he \u2014 like most scholars \u2014 disclosed when a client commissioned a particular study published through his consulting firm. Most specialists in the telecommunications field, he suggested, are well aware of his business connections and views on regulatory issues.\u201cEverybody is on different teams,\u201d Mr. Singer said. \u201cSo long as you tell the audience what team you are on, you can then offer the opinions. Disclosure is the antidote to all of this.\u201dFew scholars have been as active in the net neutrality debate as Mr. Eisenach.\u201cJeff is good at linking big theoretical ideas to policy, and he\u2019s been good at making money doing that,\u201d said Mr. Weller, the former Verizon economist. \u201cHe\u2019s been good at moving from think tank to think tank and company to company, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever lost money doing it.\u201dAt a given moment, it can be difficult to determine which hat Mr. Eisenach is wearing.In September 2014, at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on net neutrality, the formal meeting agenda listed Mr. Eisenach as a visiting scholar at the institute.Scholar, consultant, expert witness \u2014 Jeffrey A. Eisenach has worn all these hats while playing a leading role in the debate over telecommunications policy in the United States. Here is a look at the potential conflicts that this situation creates for Mr. Eiensach, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.He then detailed his vehement opposition to further federal regulation of the internet.Mr. Eisenach was similarly ambiguous when he interacted with members of the F.C.C., according to dozens of emails obtained by The Times, all but one of which was sent from Mr. Eisenach\u2019s email address at the American Enterprise Institute.On behalf of the think tank, he sought meetings with F.C.C. commissioners and lawyers to discuss the rules, and briefed the commission\u2019s Republican members on what its general counsel was telling him about Mr. Wheeler\u2019s thinking. Mr. Eisenach offered speaking slots at American Enterprise Institute events to the two Republican members on the commission, urging one to use a January 2015 forum to speak out against the proposed regulations.Ms. Stecker, the institute spokeswoman, said it should be no surprise that the opinions of experts like Mr. Eisenach were in demand. The think tank requires scholars to submit an annual report on any \u201coutside activities,\u201d she added, and A.E.I. has \u201cnot as an institution sought to influence or constrain\u201d this work.While private consulting arrangements can leave scholars\u2019 ties to corporate interests murky, the conflict is more apparent when think tank researchers do double duty as registered lobbyists.Mr. Verdery, a former senior official at the Department of Homeland Security whose office helped run the inspection program at foreign airports, briefly mentioned that in addition to his status as a scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, he was the founder of the Monument Policy Group.Officials at the Toronto airport, with Mr. Verdery\u2019s help, have been trying to persuade the American authorities to increase staff and equipment to reduce bottlenecks sometimes created by the preclearance program.Asked whether it was appropriate for a lobbyist to host his clients at a think tank event, Mr. Verdery said, \u201cIt is fairly typical.\u201dMr. Verdery is not paid by the think tank, he noted. He does benefit from the C.S.I.S. title, however, when laying out a client\u2019s case.As of late last year, at least 70 unpaid senior advisers and associates listed on the think tank\u2019s website had simultaneously worked as consultants. Seven others listed as C.S.I.S. senior advisers or associates during the past five years had worked as registered corporate lobbyists while holding the positions.Officials at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, when asked about Mr. Verdery, said his December presentation should not have occurred.\u201cThis event did not meet our standards of transparency and integrity,\u201d the think tank said in a statement in response to questions. \u201cThis constituted a lapse in oversight from C.S.I.S.\u201dMr. Verdery is no longer listed among the think tank\u2019s senior associates.Bruce Bartlett, a scholar who has worked at the Cato Institute and the Heritage Foundation, said it was becoming the norm in Washington for lobbyists and consultants like Mr. Verdery to vie for nonresident scholar posts to help them burnish sales pitches to corporate clients.\u201cClients prefer it that way,\u201d Mr. Bartlett said. \u201cThey get a chance to have their work done by scholars.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think they see any downside,\u201d Mr. Miller said of his corporate clients and the think tank.While Mr. Miller is not well known, he has high-profile company.Mr. Dorgan did not immediately register as a lobbyist, but his firm has oil and gas industry clients.Asked if his dual role represented a conflict of interest, Mr. Dorgan said that the premise of the Bipartisan Policy Center was \u201cto bring interested parties together to find solutions to difficult problems,\u201d and that he was proud to work there.Mr. Zakheim, of the American Enterprise Institute, is also a lobbyist at Covington & Burling L.L.P., where, on behalf of BAE Systems, he is urging Congress and the Defense Department to increase spending on ground combat vehicles that the company manufactures. Other clients include Northrop Grumman, which is building a new long-range Air Force bomber.Some scholars add another twist: They serve on corporate boards directly related to their areas of expertise at think tanks.Dr. McClellan, a former commissioner at the Food and Drug Administration who until January was a senior fellow at Brookings, has been a go-to expert for the federal government as it debates how to cope with surging costs of prescription drugs.At public events, Dr. McClellan emphasized the extraordinary progress by the pharmaceutical industry in coming up with treatments for diseases like diabetes, H.I.V. and hepatitis C.Dr. McClellan, in a statement, disputed any suggestion that he might have had a conflict.\u201cMy entire career in academics, government and public policy has focused on evidence-based ways to improve health and restrain costs for consumers, and my extensive track record speaks for itself,\u201d he said.She said that her change of heart on nuclear power had predated her engagement with Nuclear Matters, and was motivated by her desire to combat climate change, not by payment from the industry.\u201cObviously, the single most important thing any individual has is their reputation,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cI have worked really hard to be forthcoming about what I stand for and believe in. I am who I am.\u201dAdam S. Posen, the president of the Peterson Institute, considered the world\u2019s pre-eminent think tank on global economics, has a commanding view of the construction of the new headquarters for the American Enterprise Institute, as well as the main office of Brookings. In his office, he recently had a series of uncomfortable conversations with three scholars he had decided to let go.After much internal debate, Mr. Posen decided to formally prohibit Peterson\u2019s scholars from holding outside jobs that directly related to the field they wrote about on behalf of the think tank.The three who had such outside engagements were terminated.Mr. Posen noted that the change did not imply the researchers had done anything wrong. But tighter rules are needed, he said, to respond to a growing sense he shares with the Peterson board that the think tank industry must reassert its commitment to impartiality.\u201cI live in a glass house,\u201d said Mr. Posen, a Harvard-trained economist who previously served on the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England, gesturing toward the floor-to-ceiling glass that provides him stunning views.\u201cOur reputation is built on our credibility,\u201d Mr. Posen said. \u201cWithout being perceived as credible and objective, our studies just get thrown on the scrap heap.\u201dThe Urban Institute, a Washington-based think tank that focuses on issues confronting cities, has decided to require that its scholars with any outside jobs detail the relationship in their writings.And at Brookings, executives imposed new rules in December requiring that unpaid nonresident scholars use their title from any paying job, not from Brookings, if they testify before Congress. They are also prohibited from using their affiliation with Brookings in any research report they publish under contract with an outside party.\u201cI\u2019ve moved on to other issues,\u201d Mr. Eisenach said.\u201cIt has gotten to the point where everyone in Washington has their own expert,\u201d Mr. Medvetz said. \u201cIt is yet another reflection of the tremendous influence of economic power in American politics \u2014 as with money, you can create your own vehicles of political influence.\u201dStill, not everyone is worried about the multiple roles played by think tank scholars.\u201cEveryone\u2019s got their point of view,\u201d Mr. Walden said in an interview last year. \u201cAnd some of them get paid to have that point of view.\u201dBrooke Williams is a reporter at the New England Center for Investigative Reporting, which collaborated with The New York Times on this series.

{"Headline": "How Paul Manafort Wielded Power in Ukraine Before Advising Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Few political consultants have had a client fail quite as spectacularly as Paul Manafort\u2019s did in Ukraine in the winter of 2014.Mr. Manafort was undaunted.Within months of his client\u2019s political demise, he went to work seeking to bring his disgraced party back to power, much as he had Mr. Yanukovych himself nearly a decade earlier. Mr. Manafort has already had some success, with former Yanukovych loyalists \u2014 and some Communists \u2014 forming a new bloc opposing Ukraine\u2019s struggling pro-Western government.And now Mr. Manafort has taken on a much larger campaign, seeking to turn Donald J. Trump into a winning presidential candidate.With Mr. Putin\u2019s Russia, and its interference in Ukraine, becoming a focus of the United States presidential campaign, Mr. Manafort\u2019s work in Ukraine has come under scrutiny \u2014 along with his business dealings with prominent Ukrainian and Russian tycoons.It is far from certain that Mr. Manafort\u2019s views have directly shaped Mr. Trump\u2019s, since Mr. Trump spoke favorably of Mr. Putin\u2019s leadership before Mr. Manafort joined the campaign. But it is clear that the two have a shared view of Russia and neighbors like Ukraine \u2014 an affection, even \u2014 that, in Mr. Manafort\u2019s case, has been shaped by years of business dealings as much as by any policy or ideology.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t put out any moral arguments about his work,\u201d said Yevgeny E. Kopachko, a pollster with Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s former party who cooperated with Mr. Manafort for years and called him a pragmatic and effective strategist. \u201cNobody has a monopoly on truth and morals.\u201dMr. Manafort did not respond to requests for an interview. In television interviews on Sunday, though, he defended Mr. Trump\u2019s views on Russia, saying that as president, Mr. Trump would be firm with Russia but would deal with it like any other country when doing so suited American interests.\u201cHe views Russia as a foreign power that has its own interests at stake,\u201d Mr. Manafort said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201dMr. Manafort, 67, is the scion of an immigrant family that built a construction business in Connecticut. A lawyer by education, he served briefly in the Reagan administration before devoting himself to politics and later to business. A review of his work in Ukraine shows how politics and business converged in a country still struggling to function as a democracy, a quarter of a century after it had gained independence with the collapse of the Soviet Union. In that world in flux, Mr. Manafort\u2019s political strategy had echoes of Mr. Trump\u2019s populist campaign.Mr. Manafort\u2019s influence in the country was significant, and his political expertise deeply valued, according to Ukrainian politicians and officials who worked with him. He also had a voice in decisions about major American investments in Ukraine, said a former spokesman for Ukraine\u2019s foreign ministry, Oleg Voloshyn, who also ran as a candidate in the new bloc Mr. Manafort helped form.Mr. Manafort began working in Ukraine after the popular uprising in the winter of 2004-5 that became known as the Orange Revolution. Mr. Yanukovych, then prime minister, was declared the winner of a presidential election in 2004 that was marred by fraud and overturned by the country\u2019s highest court after weeks of protests in favor of his pro-Western rival, Viktor A. Yushchenko.Mr. Yanukovych had relied disastrously on Russian political advisers who underestimated voter frustration. After his defeat, he turned to American experts.Mr. Manafort had begun working for one of Ukraine\u2019s richest men, Rinat Akhmetov, to improve the image of his companies. Mr. Akhmetov was also a prominent sponsor of Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s party, the Party of Regions, and he introduced the two men.With Mr. Manafort\u2019s advice, Mr. Yanukovych began a comeback, with the Party of Regions winning the biggest bloc in parliamentary elections in 2006 and again in 2007, returning him to the post of prime minister. At the time, Mr. Manafort called Mr. Yanukovych, a former coal trucking director who was twice convicted of assault as a young man, an outstanding leader who had been badly misunderstood in the West.During this time, lucrative side deals opened for Mr. Manafort.A separate deal also funneled Russian-linked oligarchic money into Ukraine. In 2007, Mr. Manafort and two partners, Rick Gates and Rick Davis, set up a private equity company in the Cayman Islands to buy assets in Ukraine, and invited the Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska to invest, according to a court filing. Mr. Deripaska agreed to pay a 2 percent annual management fee to Mr. Manafort and his partners, and put $100 million into the fund, which bought a cable television station in the Black Sea port of Odessa, Ukraine, before the agreement unraveled in disagreements over auditing and Mr. Deripaska sued Mr. Manafort. The case is still pending.By 2010, Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s revival was complete. He had won a presidential campaign against Ms. Tymoshenko, who was convicted of abuse of office and sent to prison.Mr. Kopachko, the pollster, said Mr. Manafort envisioned an approach that exploited regional and ethnic peculiarities in voting, tapping the disenfranchisement of those who felt abandoned by the Orange Revolution in eastern Ukraine, which has more ethnic Russians and Russian speakers.Konstantin Grishchenko, a former foreign minister and a deputy prime minister under Mr. Yanukovych, said in a telephone interview that Mr. Manafort had ultimately grown disillusioned with his client.Mr. Manafort pressed Mr. Yanukovych to sign an agreement with the European Union that would link the country closer to the West \u2014 and lobbied for the Americans to support Ukraine\u2019s membership, as well, despite deep reservations because of the prosecution of Ms. Tymoshenko.Mr. Manafort helped draft a report defending the prosecution that Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s government commissioned from the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom in 2012.Mr. Manafort\u2019s role was disclosed after a document was discovered in a box in a sauna belonging to a former senior Ukrainian official. Other documents in that cache are now evidence in a criminal case against a former justice official, and could shed more light on Mr. Manafort\u2019s role.Ultimately Mr. Yanukovych disregarded Mr. Manafort\u2019s advice and refused to sign the trade agreement, which Mr. Putin vehemently opposed. Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s decision led to the protests that culminated in two nights of violence in February 2014 and Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s flight.Mr. Manafort has said little about Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s fall. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s very happy with the outcome,\u201d Mr. Grishchenko said.Mr. Manafort\u2019s chance for a comeback, however, came sooner than anyone had expected.When the government of President Petro O. Poroshenko called snap parliamentary elections for October 2014, just eight months later, Mr. Manafort rallied the dispirited remnants of Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s party.He was now on the payroll of Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s former chief of staff, Serhiy Lyovochkin. Mr. Manafort flew to Ukraine in September 2014 and set to work rebranding a party deeply fractured by the violence and by Russia\u2019s intervention.Rather than try to resurrect the disgraced party, he supported pitching a bigger political tent to help his clients and, he argued, to help stabilize Ukraine. The new bloc would woo everyone in the country angry at the new Western-backed government.It was Mr. Manafort who had argued for a new name for the movement \u2014 the Opposition Bloc, or Oppo Bloc, as it was called. \u201cHe thought to gather the largest number of people opposed to the current government, you needed to avoid anything concrete, and just become a symbol of being opposed,\u201d recalled Mikhail B. Pogrebinsky, a political analyst in Kiev.The strategy worked. Under the new name, the Party of Regions kept a foothold in Parliament. Its new bloc now has 43 members in the 450-seat chamber.It is not clear that Mr. Manafort\u2019s work in Ukraine ended with his work with Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. A communications aide for Mr. Lyovochkin, who financed Mr. Manafort\u2019s work, declined to say whether he was still on retainer or how much he had been paid.Steven Lee Myers reported from Washington, and Andrew E. Kramer from Moscow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Meet the Hartford Yard Goats, Now Playing Anywhere but Hartford", "Date": "2016-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMANCHESTER, N.H. \u2014 In March 2015, Hartford\u2019s soon-to-be first professional baseball team in 44 years announced to much fanfare that it would be known as the Yard Goats, an old rail yard term for an engine that switches trains between tracks.As the team\u2019s first season nears its merciful end, catcher-infielder Ashley Graeter has a more appropriate name for his club: the Yardless Goats.That is because when its season ends on Labor Day, the Class AA Eastern League affiliate of the Colorado Rockies, which relocated after the 2015 season from nearby New Britain, will have played all of its 141 games on the road.Hartford was supposed to open its season April 7 in a $63 million downtown stadium financed by the city. But the inaugural season for Dunkin\u2019 Donuts Park began going awry in December, when $10 million in cost overruns and construction delays became public. In January, the team owner, Josh Solomon; the city\u2019s new mayor, Luke Bronin; the Hartford Stadium Authority; and developers Centerplan Companies and DoNo Hartford announced a revised construction schedule, setting May 31 as the new completion date.Disputes over design changes and costs, though, continued until the developers did not meet a deadline to have the ballpark \u201csubstantially completed\u201d by May 17, two weeks before its revised home opener. In short order, the city called the performance bond, effectively firing the developers. Construction stopped on June 7, with the stadium 95 percent complete, and in late July, the team was sentenced to finish the season as vagabonds.\u201cA season to remember,\u201d pitcher Zach Jemiola said on Thursday, sitting in the lobby of the team\u2019s hotel in Manchester, N.H., at the start of Yard Goats\u2019 final \u201chomestand\u201d of the season, against Harrisburg.Jemiola, 22, of Temecula, Calif., is one of the team\u2019s youngest players. He has been with the Yard Goats since they left spring training. That means when the season ends in Harrisburg, Pa., next Monday, he will have traveled approximately 10,000 miles, all by bus, throughout this year\u2019s hot, parched and long summer in the Northeast.The Yard Goats arrived in Manchester at 5 a.m. after a six-hour bus ride from Binghamton, N.Y. Little more than three hours until game time at 5:05 p.m., that night\u2019s starting pitcher, Sam Howard, a 23-year-old left-hander, was sitting on a bench outside the hotel, sipping coffee and waiting for the team bus to Northeast Delta Dental Stadium, home of the New Hampshire Fisher Cats.\u201cDidn\u2019t get much sleep, and I haven\u2019t had anything to eat yet,\u201d said the lanky Howard, of Cartersville, Ga., northwest of Atlanta.Food is an ever-present issue. With no home base, there are no apartments or host families to return to for a home-cooked meal. On the road, the players are at the mercy of their hotel location, as well as their $29 per diem (increased from $25 this year because of their unusual circumstances).\u201cMentally, you\u2019ve got to lock in every day, but physically, it\u2019s pretty tough, too,\u201d said Howard, who joined the Yard Goats in early June from Class A Modesto of the California League. \u201cYou\u2019re eating out for every meal.\u201dThe only other time a professional baseball team played its entire season on the road was in 2012, when Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, the Yankees\u2019 Class AAA affiliate, went homeless while PNC Field underwent a $43 million renovation. The team, though, arranged to play 37 of its home games at Frontier Field in Rochester, N.Y., home of the International League\u2019s Red Wings, so as to have a semblance of normalcy during the season. It played the rest of its home games at five other International League ballparks.The Yard Goats played 19 home games in May and June at Dodd Stadium in Norwich, Conn., 40 miles from Hartford, before the short-season Class A Connecticut Tigers reclaimed their ballpark. Yard Goats Manager Darin Everson said playing in Norwich made an already trying situation worse, not better.Dodd Stadium was a 55-minute bus ride from the team\u2019s hotel in Newington, Conn., so the back and forth for a home game required far more travel than when Hartford played a series in another team\u2019s park. To accommodate the developmental training that minor league players require, the team bus left Newington at 12:45 p.m. for a 7 p.m. game.\u201cThat was our toughest stretch of the season because it changed our daily procedures and routines,\u201d said Everson, who also managed the team last year in New Britain.It also was when Everson told his players, the day of their first game at Dodd, that they would not be in their new home field by May 31. He said he did not think it was coincidental that the first games in Norwich coincided with the team\u2019s season-high, six-game losing streak.Girlfriends, wives and other family members have had to catch up with the team as it traveled. Many had bought plane tickets to Hartford for visits during the season only to have to make new plans, sometimes multiple times.Responsibility for managing the ever-evolving travel schedule, for players and their immediate families, fell to Billy Whitehead, whose primary job is trainer. Referring to the regular attention he was required to give to plane, bus and hotel arrangements, he said, \u201cIt was like having a whole other job.\u201dThe most recent games in Manchester were typical of home games in another team\u2019s park. The large video board in center field was dark. Two small auxiliary scoreboards provided only the most basic game information. One concession stand was open, with limited offerings. During lulls in the action, the hum of the stadium\u2019s electrical infrastructure was audible along the concourse. Even with free admission, no more than 20 fans were in attendance.The Yard Goats even played a July 4 home game in Binghamton, N.Y., when the host team closed its park. The game was played before only stadium personnel and a couple of scouts.\u201cWe draw more at one normal away game than if you put together all the people at of our home games combined,\u201d Howard said.Despite the season-long travails, the Yard Goats, 72-60 entering Monday night\u2019s game, will finish with no higher than the third-best record in the 12-team league. They will miss the playoffs, though, because two clubs in their division, Reading and Trenton, will finish with better records.\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019d have a problem beating the teams ahead of us in the playoffs, even though our record might not show it,\u201d Jemiola, the young pitcher, said, citing the Yard Goats\u2019 lack of a home field as a mitigating factor.Everson, whose 14-year-old son, Jared, had been with him from spring training until he returned home to start school, said he was always conscious of his team\u2019s \u201cheartbeat\u201d as the season progressed.\u201cThey\u2019ve been a really tight-knit group,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have fun whether they\u2019re on the field, in the dugout, out shopping, or razzing each other on the bus.\u201dJemiola said, \u201cIt\u2019s a good group of guys.\u201dLast Tuesday, the Eastern League released its 2017 schedule, with Hartford\u2019s home opener scheduled for April 13. Two days later, the league\u2019s president, Joe McEacharn, stood in front of the padlocked gates of Hartford\u2019s stadium and said, \u201cNo action is no longer acceptable.\u201d If progress is not made in the next few weeks, he said, the league and the team will be required to find a permanent home for 2017.\u201cIf the stadium is not done, baseball will not come to Hartford,\u201d McEacharn said.Those decisions will be made once the season ends next Monday. Players like Howard have their sights set on more immediate rewards.\u201cA home-cooked meal from my parents would be great right now,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Putin, Disinformation Is Power", "Date": "2016-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMOSCOW \u2014 Fifteen years ago, a few months into his presidency, Vladimir V. Putin told Larry King on CNN that his previous job as a K.G.B. officer had been like that of a journalist. \u201cThey have the same purpose of gathering information, synthesizing it and presenting it for the consumption of decision makers,\u201d he said. Since then, he has excelled at using the media to consolidate power inside Russia and, increasingly, to wage an information war against the West.So the apparent hacking by Russian security services of the Democratic National Committee emails, followed by their publication by WikiLeaks, should come as no great surprise to Americans. It is only the latest example of how Mr. Putin uses information as a weapon. And the Kremlin has cultivated ties with WikiLeaks for years.It has also used disinformation in its annexation of Crimea and in its war in Ukraine, launched cyberattacks on Finland and the Baltic States, and planted hoax stories in Germany to embarrass Angela Merkel. During the Cold War, the Kremlin interfered in American politics for decades. The K.G.B.\u2019s so-called active measures \u2014 subversion, media manipulations, forgery and the financing of some \u201cpeace\u201d organizations \u2014 lay at the heart of Soviet intelligence.Then as now, Russia exploited real grievances in the West \u2014 discontent with the war in Vietnam and racial tensions in the 1960s; anxiety and fear of Muslim immigrants today. Nevertheless, Mr. Putin\u2019s support of the likes of Donald Trump in America, Brexiters in Britain or the right-wing Marine Le Pen in France does not mean they are his creations.What seems to puzzle the American public most is why Russia, having shed Communism, is working to undermine the West today. Didn\u2019t America win the Cold War?Actually, that question, which arose 15 years ago, is as alive today as it was then. While most Americans saw the end of the Cold War as a triumph over the Soviet Union, most Russians saw it as a victory of their own common sense over a senile and inept regime that had run out of money and ideas and had lost its appetite for repression. After Mikhail Gorbachev opened up the Soviet media, the contrast between socialist and capitalist economic systems had become too apparent. And when the K.G.B. attempted a coup against Mr. Gorbachev in 1991, not a single person came out on the street to defend Communism, while thousands risked their lives protesting the coup in Moscow, in defense of freedom.Then came an American mistake: triumphalism, rather than congratulating the Russian people on their victory over authoritarian rule, and using a short window of opportunity to offer Russia sufficient economic aid to ease the pain of a collapsing economy. This was shortsighted and dangerous. It created a false sense of invincibility in America and paved the way for resentment in Russia. Eventually, it let revisionists like Mr. Putin portray the collapse of the Soviet Union as an American conspiracy.Over the past decade, this narrative of defeat and humiliation has become a stalwart of Mr. Putin\u2019s ideology of resurgence. If America won the Cold War, it must be responsible for the Soviet breakup and the impoverishment of millions of Russians. And if Russia was defeated, it could only be expected to one day seek revenge.This narrative has become extremely popular in Russia. Anti-Americanism offers Russians a familiar outlet for their frustration and sense of impotence in the face of their own corrupt and oppressive regime. It gives Mr. Putin an ideological cover for his kleptocratic system of governance led by current and former security servicemen. To sustain this narrative, the Kremlin\u2019s state-controlled media has excelled at reconstructing the centuries-old image of Russia as a besieged fortress.Today, Mr. Putin presents Russia\u2019s actions as responsive, not aggressive. Every time Russia attacks a former Soviet republic, the confrontation is portrayed as a proxy war started by America against Russia. When Russia attacked Georgia in 2008, the United States was in the midst of a presidential election that the incumbent Republican Party would soon lose, so the war was followed the next year not by tough sanctions against Russia but with a \u201creset\u201d initiated by the new Democratic president, Barack Obama, and his secretary of state, Hillary Clinton.That, too, proved a misstep. The idea was that two new presidents \u2014 Mr. Obama and Dmitri A. Medvedev, who had recently taken Mr. Putin\u2019s place in the Kremlin \u2014 could put the past behind them. But Mr. Medvedev, who oversaw the war in Georgia, was only a place-holder appointed by Mr. Putin to circumvent a constitutional term limit. Policy makers in Washington and in Berlin knew this but decided to build up Mr. Medvedev, hoping to split Russia\u2019s elites. Instead, Russia got away with the Georgia war cost-free, which ultimately contributed to Russian confidence that its later incursions into Ukraine would succeed.Mr. Medvedev\u2019s presidency ended with mass demonstrations in Moscow and other cities in the winter of 2011-12, with tens of thousands protesting Mr. Putin\u2019s return to the presidency and demanding modernization of the state. At the time, Mr. Putin accused Mrs. Clinton of taking \u201cactive measures\u201d to spur protesters on. \u201cShe set the tone for some actors in our country and gave them a signal,\u201d he said. \u201cThey heard the signal and with the support of the U.S. State Department began active work.\u201dNow Mr. Putin, who is known to bear grudges, appears to be disrupting Mrs. Clinton\u2019s own presidential campaign with \u201cactive measures.\u201d That the disclosures of the Democratic National Committee emails could benefit only Donald Trump is probably an added bonus. Mr. Trump\u2019s main appeal within the Kremlin is not that he admires Mr. Putin, but that he has little interest in Russia\u2019s sphere of influence. And Mr. Putin has long dreamed of a new Yalta-style agreement to let Russia and America divide Europe again.To be sure, Russia\u2019s ability to influence American elections is limited. Mr. Putin does not control the American media, and Russia lacks the financial and military resources that the Soviet Union had. Still, the effort points to a danger. An angry and declining Russia is far more perilous than an ascending economic power like China. Sanctions won\u2019t change Mr. Putin\u2019s behavior: He rates the security of his regime far above the economic good of the country.Mr. Putin has reason to fear in one respect. His system does face an existential threat from the Western model of governance. Just as the economic inadequacies of Soviet Communism were exposed by comparison with the wealth produced by Western capitalism, Mr. Putin\u2019s authoritarianism cannot match the appeal of an economy based on the rule of law, openness and competition. The best way for the West to resist Russia, now as then, is to uphold its own values.\u201cRussia, as opposed to the Western world in general, is still by far the weaker party and may well contain deficiencies which will eventually weaken its own total potential.\u201d So wrote the master diplomat George F. Kennan in 1947. We know now that Kennan was right. The bad news is that it took 44 years for his prophecy to come true.Arkady Ostrovsky, the Russia and Eastern Europe editor at The Economist, is the author of \u201cThe Invention of Russia: From Gorbachev\u2019s Freedom to Putin\u2019s War.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saudis and Extremism: \u2018Both the Arsonists and the Firefighters\u2019", "Date": "2016-08-25", "News": "Critics see Saudi Arabia\u2019s export of a rigid strain of Islam as contributing to terrorism, but the kingdom\u2019s influence depends greatly on local conditions.Supported byThe idea has become a commonplace: that Saudi Arabia\u2019s export of the rigid, bigoted, patriarchal, fundamentalist strain of Islam known as Wahhabism has fueled global extremism and contributed to terrorism. As the Islamic State projects its menacing calls for violence into the West, directing or inspiring terrorist attacks in country after country, an old debate over Saudi influence on Islam has taken on new relevance.Is the world today a more divided, dangerous and violent place because of the cumulative effect of five decades of oil-financed proselytizing from the historical heart of the Muslim world? Or is Saudi Arabia, which has often supported Western-friendly autocrats over Islamists, merely a convenient scapegoat for extremism and terrorism with many complex causes \u2014 the United States\u2019s own actions among them?Those questions are deeply contentious, partly because of the contradictory impulses of the Saudi state.In the realm of extremist Islam, the Saudis are \u201cboth the arsonists and the firefighters,\u201d said William McCants, a Brookings Institution scholar. \u201cThey promote a very toxic form of Islam that draws sharp lines between a small number of true believers and everyone else, Muslim and non-Muslim,\u201d he said, providing ideological fodder for violent jihadists.Yet at the same time, \u201cthey\u2019re our partners in counterterrorism,\u201d said Mr. McCants, one of three dozen academics, government officials and experts on Islam from multiple countries interviewed for this article.Saudi leaders seek good relations with the West and see jihadist violence as a menace that could endanger their rule, especially now that the Islamic State is staging attacks in the kingdom \u2014 25 in the last eight months, by the government\u2019s count. But they are also driven by their rivalry with Iran, and they depend for legitimacy on a clerical establishment dedicated to a reactionary set of beliefs. Those conflicting goals can play out in a bafflingly inconsistent manner.Thomas Hegghammer, a Norwegian terrorism expert who has advised the United States government, said the most important effect of Saudi proselytizing might have been to slow the evolution of Islam, blocking its natural accommodation to a diverse and globalized world. \u201cIf there was going to be an Islamic reformation in the 20th century, the Saudis probably prevented it by pumping out literalism,\u201d he said.The reach of the Saudis has been stunning, touching nearly every country with a Muslim population, from the Gothenburg Mosque in Sweden to the King Faisal Mosque in Chad, from the King Fahad Mosque in Los Angeles to the Seoul Central Mosque in South Korea. Support has come from the Saudi government; the royal family; Saudi charities; and Saudi-sponsored organizations including the World Muslim League, the World Assembly of Muslim Youth and the International Islamic Relief Organization, providing the hardware of impressive edifices and the software of preaching and teaching.But exactly how Saudi influence plays out seems to depend greatly on local conditions. In parts of Africa and Southeast Asia, for instance, Saudi teachings have shifted the religious culture in a markedly conservative direction, most visibly in the decision of more women to cover their hair or of men to grow beards. Among Muslim immigrant communities in Europe, the Saudi influence seems to be just one factor driving radicalization, and not the most significant. In divided countries like Pakistan and Nigeria, the flood of Saudi money, and the ideology it promotes, have exacerbated divisions over religion that regularly prove lethal.And for a small minority in many countries, the exclusionary Saudi version of Sunni Islam, with its denigration of Jews and Christians, as well as of Muslims of Shiite, Sufi and other traditions, may have made some people vulnerable to the lure of Al Qaeda, the Islamic State and other violent jihadist groups. \u201cThere\u2019s only so much dehumanizing of the other that you can be exposed to \u2014 and exposed to as the word of God \u2014 without becoming susceptible to recruitment,\u201d said David Andrew Weinberg, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington who tracks Saudi influence.Mehmet Gormez, the senior Islamic cleric in Turkey, said that while he was meeting with Saudi clerics in Riyadh in January, the Saudi authorities had executed 47 people in a single day on terrorism charges, 45 of them Saudi citizens. \u201cI said: \u2018These people studied Islam for 10 or 15 years in your country. Is there a problem with the educational system?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Gormez said in an interview. He argued that Wahhabi teaching was undermining the pluralism, tolerance and openness to science and learning that had long characterized Islam. \u201cSadly,\u201d he said, the changes have taken place \u201cin almost all of the Islamic world.\u201dAccordingly, many American officials who have worked to counter extremism and terrorism have formed a dark view of the Saudi effect \u2014 even if, given the sensitivity of the relationship, they are often loath to discuss it publicly. The United States\u2019 reliance on Saudi counterterrorism cooperation in recent years \u2014 for instance, the Saudi tip that foiled a 2010 Qaeda plot to blow up two American cargo planes \u2014 has often taken precedence over concerns about radical influence. And generous Saudi funding for professorships and research centers at American universities, including the most elite institutions, has deterred criticism and discouraged research on the effects of Wahhabi proselytizing, according to Mr. McCants \u2014 who is working on a book about the Saudi impact on global Islam \u2014 and other scholars.Yet some scholars on Islam and extremism, including experts on radicalization in many countries, push back against the notion that Saudi Arabia bears predominant responsibility for the current wave of extremism and jihadist violence. They point to multiple sources for the rise and spread of Islamist terrorism, including repressive secular governments in the Middle East, local injustices and divisions, the hijacking of the internet for terrorist propaganda, and American interventions in the Muslim world from the anti-Soviet war in Afghanistan to the invasion of Iraq. The 20th-century ideologues most influential with modern jihadists, like Sayyid Qutb of Egypt and Abul Ala Maududi of Pakistan, reached their extreme, anti-Western views without much Saudi input. Al Qaeda and the Islamic State despise Saudi rulers, whom they consider the worst of hypocrites.\u201cAmericans like to have someone to blame \u2014 a person, a political party or country,\u201d said Robert S. Ford, a former United States ambassador to Syria and Algeria. \u201cBut it\u2019s a lot more complicated than that. I\u2019d be careful about blaming the Saudis.\u201dWhile Saudi religious influence may be disruptive, he and others say, its effect is not monolithic. A major tenet of official Saudi Islamic teaching is obedience to rulers \u2014 hardly a precept that encourages terrorism intended to break nations. Many Saudi and Saudi-trained clerics are quietist, characterized by a devotion to scripture and prayer and a shunning of politics, let alone political violence.An American scholar with long experience in Saudi Arabia \u2014 who spoke on condition of anonymity to preserve his ability to travel to the kingdom for research \u2014 said he believed that Saudi influence had often been exaggerated in American political discourse. But he compared it to climate change. Just as a one-degree increase in temperature can ultimately result in drastic effects around the globe, with glaciers melting and species dying off, so Saudi teaching is playing out in many countries in ways that are hard to predict and difficult to trace but often profound, the scholar said.Saudi proselytizing can result in a \u201crecalibrating of the religious center of gravity\u201d for young people, the scholar said, which makes it \u201ceasier for them to swallow or make sense of the ISIS religious narrative when it does arrive. It doesn\u2019t seem quite as foreign as it might have, had that Saudi religious influence not been there.\u201dWhy does Saudi Arabia find it so difficult to let go of an ideology that much of the world finds repugnant? The key to the Saudi dilemma dates back nearly three centuries to the origin of the alliance that still undergirds the Saudi state. In 1744, Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, a reformist cleric, sought the protection of Muhammad bin Saud, a powerful tribal leader in the harsh desert of the Arabian Peninsula. The alliance was mutually beneficial: Wahhab received military protection for his movement, which sought to return Muslims to what he believed were the values of the early years of Islam in the seventh century, when the Prophet Muhammad was alive. (His beliefs were a variant of Salafism, the conservative school of Islam that teaches that the salaf, or pious ancestors, had the correct ways and beliefs and should be emulated.) In return, the Saud family earned the endorsement of an Islamic cleric \u2014 a puritanical enforcer known for insisting on the death by stoning of a woman for adultery.Wahhab\u2019s particular version of Islam was the first of two historical accidents that would define Saudi religious influence centuries later. What came to be known as Wahhabism was \u201ca tribal, desert Islam,\u201d said Akbar Ahmed, the chairman of Islamic studies at American University in Washington. It was shaped by the austere environment \u2014 xenophobic, fiercely opposed to shrines and tombs, disapproving of art and music, and hugely different from the cosmopolitan Islam of diverse trading cities like Baghdad and Cairo.The second historical accident came in 1938, when American prospectors discovered the largest oil reserves on earth in Saudi Arabia. Oil revenue generated by the Arabian-American Oil Company, or Aramco, created fabulous wealth. But it also froze in place a rigid social and economic system and gave the conservative religious establishment an extravagant budget for the export of its severe strain of Islam.\u201cOne day you find oil, and the world is coming to you,\u201d Professor Ahmed said. \u201cGod has given you the ability to take your version of Islam to the world.\u201dIn 1964, when King Faisal ascended the throne, he embraced the obligation of spreading Islam. A modernizer in many respects, with close ties to the West, he nonetheless could not overhaul the Wahhabi doctrine that became the face of Saudi generosity in many countries. Over the next four decades, in non-Muslim-majority countries alone, Saudi Arabia would build 1,359 mosques, 210 Islamic centers, 202 colleges and 2,000 schools. Saudi money helped finance 16 American mosques; four in Canada; and others in London, Madrid, Brussels and Geneva, according to a report in an official Saudi weekly, Ain al-Yaqeen. The total spending, including supplying or training imams and teachers, was \u201cmany billions\u201d of Saudi riyals (at a rate of about four to a dollar), the report said.Saudi religious teaching had particular force because it came from the birthplace of the Prophet Muhammad, the land of Islam\u2019s two holiest places, Mecca and Medina. When Saudi imams arrived in Muslim countries in Asia or Africa, or in Muslim communities in Europe or the Americas, wearing traditional Arabian robes, speaking the language of the Quran \u2014 and carrying a generous checkbook \u2014 they had automatic credibility.As the 20th century progressed and people of different nationalities and faiths mixed routinely, the puritanical, exclusionary nature of Wahhab\u2019s teachings would become more and more dysfunctional. But the Saudi government would find it extraordinarily difficult to shed or soften its ideology, especially after the landmark year of 1979.In Tehran that year, the Iranian revolution brought to power a radical Shiite government, symbolically challenging Saudi Arabia, the leader of Sunnism, for leadership of global Islam. The declaration of an Islamic Republic escalated the competition between the two major branches of Islam, spurring the Saudis to redouble their efforts to counter Iran and spread Wahhabism around the world.Then, in a stunning strike, a band of 500 Saudi extremists seized the Grand Mosque in Mecca for two weeks, publicly calling Saudi rulers puppets of the West and traitors to true Islam. The rebels were defeated, but leading clerics agreed to back the government only after assurances of support for a crackdown on immodest ways in the kingdom and a more aggressive export of Wahhabism abroad.Finally, at year\u2019s end, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan and seized power to prop up a Communist government. It soon faced an insurgent movement of mujahedeen, or holy warriors battling for Islam, which drew fighters from around the world for a decade-long battle to expel the occupiers.Throughout the 1980s, Saudi Arabia and the United States worked together to finance the mujahedeen in this great Afghan war, which would revive the notion of noble armed jihad for Muslims worldwide. President Ronald Reagan famously welcomed to the Oval Office a delegation of bearded \u201cAfghan freedom fighters\u201d whose social and theological views were hardly distinguishable from those later embraced by the Taliban.One day in the months after the Sept. 11 attacks, Robert W. Jordan, the United States ambassador to Saudi Arabia, was driving in the kingdom with the longtime Saudi ambassador to the United States, Prince Bandar Bin Sultan. The prince pointed to a mosque and said, \u201cI just fired the imam there.\u201d The man\u2019s preaching had been too militant, he said.Mr. Jordan, a Texas lawyer, said that after the Qaeda attacks, he had stepped up pressure on the Saudi government over its spread of extremism. \u201cI told them: \u2018What you teach in your schools and preach in your mosques now is not an internal matter. It affects our national security,\u2019\u201d he said.After years of encouraging and financing a harsh Islam in support of the anti-Soviet jihad, the United States had reversed course \u2014 gradually during the 1990s and then dramatically after the Sept. 11 attacks. But in pressuring Saudi Arabia, American officials would tread lightly, acutely aware of American dependence on Saudi oil and intelligence cooperation. Saudi reform would move at an excruciatingly slow pace.A two-part study of Saudi textbooks commissioned by the State Department and conducted by the International Center for Religion and Diplomacy, a Washington research group, was finished in 2013 but was never released for fear of angering Saudi officials. The New York Times obtained a copy under the Freedom of Information Act.Seventh graders were being taught that \u201cfighting the infidels to elevate the words of Allah\u201d was among the deeds Allah loved the most, the report found, among dozens of passages it found troubling. Tenth graders learned that Muslims who abandoned Islam should be jailed for three days and, if they did not change their minds, \u201ckilled for walking away from their true religion.\u201d Fourth graders read that non-Muslims had been \u201cshown the truth but abandoned it, like the Jews,\u201d or had replaced truth with \u201cignorance and delusion, like the Christians.\u201dSome of the books, prepared and distributed by the government, propagated views that were hostile to science, modernity and women\u2019s rights, not to say downright quirky \u2014 advocating, for instance, execution for sorcerers and warning against the dangers of the Rotary Club and the Lions Club. (The groups\u2019 intent, said a 10th-grade textbook, \u201cis to achieve the goals of the Zionist movement.\u201d)The textbooks, or other Saudi teaching materials with similar content, had been distributed in scores of countries, the study found. Textbook reform has continued since the 2013 study, and Saudi officials say they are trying to replace older books distributed overseas.But as the study noted, the schoolbooks were only a modest part of the Saudis\u2019 lavishly funded global export of Wahhabism. In many places, the study said, the largess includes \u201ca Saudi-funded school with a Wahhabist faculty (educated in a Saudi-funded Wahhabist University), attached to a mosque with a Wahhabist imam, and ultimately controlled by an international Wahhabist educational body.\u201dThis ideological steamroller has landed in diverse places where Muslims of different sects had spent centuries learning to accommodate one another. Sayyed Shah, a Pakistani journalist working on a doctorate in the United States, described the devastating effect on his town, not far from the Afghan border, of the arrival some years ago of a young Pakistani preacher trained in a Saudi-funded seminary.Village residents had long held a m\u00e9lange of Muslim beliefs, he said. \u201cWe were Sunni, but our culture, our traditions were a mixture of Shia and Barelvi and Deobandi,\u201d Mr. Shah said, referring to Muslim sects. His family would visit the large Barelvi shrine, and watch their Shiite neighbors as they lashed themselves in a public religious ritual. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t do that ourselves, but we\u2019d hand out sweets and water,\u201d he said.The new preacher, he said, denounced the Barelvi and Shiite beliefs as false and heretical, dividing the community and setting off years of bitter argument. By 2010, Mr. Shah said, \u201ceverything had changed.\u201d Women who had used shawls to cover their hair and face began wearing full burqas. Militants began attacking kiosks where merchants sold secular music CDs. Twice, terrorists used explosives to try to destroy the village\u2019s locally famous shrine.Now, Mr. Shah said, families are divided; his cousin, he said, \u201cjust wants Saudi religion.\u201d He said an entire generation had been \u201cindoctrinated\u201d with a rigid, unforgiving creed.\u201cIt\u2019s so difficult these days,\u201d he said. \u201cInitially we were on a single path. We just had economic problems, but we were culturally sound.\u201dHe added, \u201cBut now it\u2019s very difficult, because some people want Saudi culture to be our culture, and others are opposing that.\u201dC. Christine Fair, a specialist on Pakistan at Georgetown University, said Mr. Shah\u2019s account was credible. But like many scholars describing the Saudi impact on religion, she said that militancy in Pakistan also had local causes. While Saudi money and teaching have unquestionably been \u201caccelerants,\u201d Pakistan\u2019s sectarian troubles and jihadist violence have deep roots dating to the country\u2019s origins in the partition of India in 1947.\u201cThe idea that without the Saudis Pakistan would be Switzerland is ridiculous,\u201d she said.That is the disputed question, of course: how the world would be different without decades of Saudi-funded shaping of Islam. Though there is a widespread belief that Saudi influence has contributed to the growth of terrorism, it is rare to find a direct case of cause and effect. For example, in Brussels, the Grand Mosque was built with Saudi money and staffed with Saudi imams. In 2012, according to Saudi diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks, one Saudi preacher was removed after Belgian complaints that he was a \u201ctrue Salafi\u201d who did not accept other schools of Islam. And Brussels\u2019 immigrant neighborhoods, notably Molenbeek, have long been the home of storefront mosques teaching hard-line Salafi views.Several suspects had petty criminal backgrounds; their knowledge of Islam was described by friends as superficial; they did not appear to be regulars at any mosque. Though the Islamic State claimed responsibility for the blasts, resentment of the treatment of North African immigrant families in Belgium and exposure to Islamic State propaganda, in person or via the internet and social media, appeared to be the major factors motivating the attacks.If there was a Saudi connection, it was highly indirect, perhaps playing out over a generation or longer. Hind Fraihi, a Moroccan-Belgian journalist who went underground in the Brussels immigrant neighborhood of Molenbeek in 2005 and wrote a book about it, met Saudi-trained imams and found lots of extremist literature written in Saudi Arabia that encouraged \u201cpolarization, the sentiment of us against them, the glorification of jihad.\u201dThe recent attackers, Ms. Fraihi said, were motivated by \u201clots of factors \u2014 economic frustration, racism, a generation that feels it has no future.\u201d But Saudi teaching, she said, \u201cis part of the cocktail.\u201dWithout the Saudi presence over the decades, might a more progressive and accommodating Islam, reflecting immigrants\u2019 Moroccan roots, have taken hold in Brussels? Would young Muslims raised in Belgium have been less susceptible to the stark, violent call of the Islamic State? Conceivably, but the case is impossible to prove.Or consider an utterly different cultural milieu \u2014 the world\u2019s most populous Muslim country, Indonesia. The Saudis have sent money for mosque-building, books and teachers for decades, said Sidney Jones, the director of the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict in Jakarta.But when Ms. Jones studied the approximately 1,000 people arrested in Indonesia on terrorism charges since 2002, she found only a few \u2014 \u201cliterally four or five\u201d \u2014 with ties to Wahhabi or Salafi institutions. When it comes to violence, she concluded, the Saudi connection is \u201cmostly a red herring.\u201dIn fact, she said, there is a gulf between Indonesian jihadists and Indonesian Salafis who look to Saudi or Yemeni scholars for guidance. The jihadists accuse the Salafis of failing to act on their convictions; the Salafis scorn the jihadists as extremists.Whatever the global effects of decades of Saudi proselytizing, it is under greater scrutiny than ever, from outside and inside the kingdom. Saudi leaders\u2019 ideological reform efforts, encompassing textbooks and preaching, amount to a tacit recognition that its religious exports have sometimes backfired. And the kingdom has stepped up an aggressive public relations campaign in the West, hiring American publicists to counter critical news media reports and fashion a reformist image for Saudi leaders.But neither the publicists nor their clients can renounce the strain of Islam on which the Saudi state was built, and old habits sometimes prove difficult to suppress. A prominent cleric, Saad bin Nasser al-Shethri, had been stripped of a leadership position by the previous king, Abdullah, for condemning coeducation. King Salman restored Mr. Shethri to the job last year, not long after the cleric had joined the chorus of official voices criticizing the Islamic State. But Mr. Shethri\u2019s reasoning for denouncing the Islamic State suggested the difficulty of change. The group was, he said, \u201cmore infidel than Jews and Christians.\u201dHala Droubi contributed reporting from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Quake Exposes Italy\u2019s Challenge to Retrofit Its Architecture", "Date": "2016-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThis is just ground, soil,\u201d he said, sadly. \u201cIn so many buildings in this area, that was the material used to keep together the irregular stones found in the surroundings which people used to build their homes.\u201dItaly is beloved for its rich architectural history. But that beauty comes at a steep price: both the lives lost when nature reminds its borrowers who is boss, and the money required in the attempt to even the scales.Many experts maintain that Italy has among the world\u2019s best anti-seismic standards already \u2014 at least on paper. But the problems in executing them are legion: money, corruption, tangled bureaucracy, shoddy construction and a lack of enforcement of national regulations at the local level.This quake, like many in the past, already seems likely to expose corners that were cut, contributing to the 280 or more deaths in about 80 villages in the area along the Apennines, Italy\u2019s fragile spinal cord, where the 6.2-magnitude quake struck.\u201cYou can have the best rules, but if the weak link is the human factor then it\u2019s all over,\u201d said Gianpaolo Rosati, a professor of structural engineering at the Polytechnic University of Milan. \u201cUnfortunately, we find ourselves always protesting about the same things.\u201dPerhaps the most central, and inescapable, problem is that Italy is old. About 60 percent of its buildings are estimated to be more than 100 years old. That means that most of the country\u2019s architectural heritage was built before any of the modern anti-seismic standards were instituted.\u201cYou can\u2019t ask that an ancient structure adhere to norms designed for modern structures, but you can try to improve them, that\u2019s the path to take with the objective to save human lives,\u201d said Donatella Guzzoni, an engineer and an expert in the preservation of historic buildings.\u201cItaly has the best technologies to do this,\u201d she added. \u201cBut it does come down to money.\u201dCasetta, a hamlet of about two dozen homes, sat on the hill north of Amatrice on the east side of the Tronto River that cuts this valley between two mountain chains.The area was among the most devastated by the quake for a combination of historical, economic and cultural reasons, Mr. Camassi said.\u201cIn many cases, they used rounded river stones, put next to one another by someone who ignored even the most ancient best construction practices,\u201d he said.He pointed to a long cement beam hanging perilously from the debris of a two-story house.\u201cWhen residents decided to reinforce the buildings, they often substituted the light wooden roofs with cement beams and bricks like that, which only worsened the impact of the quake because they burdened the otherwise frail structure,\u201d he said.Mr. Camassi and other experts pointed out that certifying an existing building to anti-seismic standards was difficult and often too expensive for most people.Just having a technical expert determine a building\u2019s vulnerability has a price, Mr. Rosati said, estimating it would cost around 10,000 euros to evaluate a small house.\u201cThe cost of reinforcing a building to meet anti-seismic standards can be around 300 euro per square meter, which means the owner of a largish apartment faces a cost of some 300,000 euro,\u201d he said, sometimes more than the apartment is worth.And it is not enough for just one homeowner to want to sleep a little easier.\u201cThe entire apartment building has to agree to do the same,\u201d he added, and if the palazzos or apartment buildings are connected, the whole neighborhood must agree.Villages like Amatrice and Accumoli are loved for the charm of their narrow streets and spaces, where houses were built cheek to cheek over the centuries to use prime land, often atop narrow peaks.In those tightly packed places, the entire block must be reinforced or the buildings \u201cinteract\u201d in an earthquake and can topple like dominoes, Mr. Rosati said.That is precisely the dynamic Mr. Camassi found in Casetta. \u201cNeighbors built in different periods, different buildings with different materials, but adjacent,\u201d he said. \u201cSo even those that would have resisted the quake were damaged or even taken down by the others.\u201dFarther up the mountain is Cossito, an idyllic village of little houses with red geraniums on the terraces. One narrow street divides a recently restored building from the town square, where almost all homes collapsed, killing at least three people.The village had only four families, Mr. Camassi said, and they all lost a member or a close friend.\u201cWe thought we did all we needed, but now we simply need to erase this house,\u201d said Roberto Paganelli, a former police officer in the Carabinieri, who was retrieving items from his 82-year-old mother\u2019s home. The building dates to 1864, he said, and was reinforced in the 1960s.The costs of evaluating and retrofitting old structures are prohibitive for many in this corner of Italy, an easy drive from Rome. Many of these homes were used only in the summer and were not primary residences worth a huge investment. In many cases, the residents are old, living on a pension and barely getting by.The state cannot oblige homeowners to upgrade their buildings unless there are obvious reasons to intervene.\u201cWe have up-to-date norms, but they only apply to new buildings or important restorations,\u201d said Luca Ferrari, the president of Italy\u2019s Association of Seismic Engineers. \u201cFor the vast majority of buildings, we don\u2019t have an anti-seismic classification, so no one knows whether they are dangerous or not during a quake.\u201dWith a government-coordinated group of experts, Mr. Ferrari drafted guidelines to classify buildings, with parameters similar to the energy efficiency of a building.This work finished in April 2015, but the government campaign \u2014 and its fiscal incentives \u2014 to reinforce existing buildings were still lacking, he said.\u201cThis area is at very high seismic danger, and we know that in these small towns of the Apennine Mountains, there are vulnerable buildings,\u201d said Filippo Bernardini, a geologist who worked on Mr. Camassi\u2019s team. \u201cUnless we build better, we offer no hope for the future.\u201dThe alternative \u2014 razing ancient buildings to construct modern, up-to-date palazzos \u2014 is hardly an option.But, as Mr. Lagomarsino pointed out, Italy has a more conservative approach and is aware that preserving its heritage has value for the country.\u201cIn the face of an important building you can\u2019t demolish a historic center and rebuild it with fake stones,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would \u2018denaturalize\u2019 Italy.\u201dvideoslide showAdvertisement"}

Trump may rail against Wall Street and business elites at his campaign rallies, but that has not stopped him from turning to many of them for economic advice. On Friday, Mr. Trump announced his economic team, just days before he is expected to give a speech in Detroit on Monday about what he would do to improve American growth.The 13-member team \u2014 all men \u2014 includes several billionaire bankers and investment managers, and even a part-time professional poker player.

{"Headline": "Ernst Neizvestny, a Russian Sculptor Who Clashed With Khrushchev, Dies at 91", "Date": "2016-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byErnst Neizvestny, a sculptor whose ventures into modernism put him at odds with the Soviet cultural authorities and led to a memorable confrontation with Nikita S. Khrushchev in 1962, died on Aug. 9 in Stony Brook, N.Y. He was 91.His death was confirmed by his wife, Anna Graham.As cultural policy in the post-Stalin era began to loosen, Mr. Neizvestny (pronounced nyai-eez-VYEST-nee) and a dozen abstract painters were invited to show their work at a large exhibition in Moscow to mark the 30th anniversary of the Moscow section of the Soviet Artists\u2019 Union.One visitor was Khrushchev, whose irritation at being dragged to an event in which he had no interest \u2014 agricultural machinery was more to his taste \u2014 grew into incandescent rage when he beheld the work of Mr. Neizvestny and his fellow avant-gardists.Cursing, Khrushchev pronounced the work degenerate and incompetent. The paintings, he said, looked as though a donkey had swished its tail across the canvas. He asked to speak to the most important artist at the show. Mr. Neizvestny was pushed forward.\u201cHe started shouting at me,\u201d Mr. Neizvestny wrote in the journal The Time and Us in 1979. \u201cI said that I would only talk about my own work, and turned away to go into the room where my work was on display, not imagining that Khrushchev would follow me. But follow me he did, and so did the whole of his entourage and the rest of the crowd.\u201dA photograph of the ensuing face-off showed, in close attendance, Leonid I. Brezhnev, who would succeed Khrushchev as Soviet leader; Brezhnev\u2019s deputy, Andrei P. Kirilenko; and the party theoretician Mikhail A. Suslov. It was widely assumed that conservatives in the Artists\u2019 Union had engineered the confrontation, one of the signal cultural events of the Khrushchev era, to bring about a crackdown on cultural experimentation.Mr. Neizvestny, like Khrushchev, was blunt and volatile. \u201cYou may be premier and chairman, but not here in front of my works,\u201d he told Khrushchev. \u201cHere I am premier, and we shall discuss as equals.\u201dA lively conversation ensued. \u201cI made it clear to him that he had been duped, as he was neither an artist nor a critic and was illiterate when it came to aesthetics,\u201d Mr. Neizvestny recalled.Khrushchev counterpunched, but seemed rather taken with his opponent, as Mr. Neizvestny was with him.\u201cI should stress that as I talked to Khrushchev, something in me responded to the dynamism of his personality,\u201d Mr. Neizvestny wrote. \u201cIn spite of the fear in the air, I found him easy to talk to.\u201d He added, \u201cKhrushchev spoke frankly \u2014 ignorantly, but frankly \u2014 which meant that I could answer him frankly.\u201dAs the conversation wound down, Khrushchev said: \u201cYou\u2019re an interesting man \u2014 I enjoy people like you \u2014 but inside you there are an angel and a devil. If the devil wins, we\u2019ll crush you. If the angel wins, we\u2019ll do all we can to help you.\u201d The two men shook hands.Mr. Neizvestny paid a price for his boldness. He could not work officially for several years, a period of ostracism that ended in 1966 when he entered anonymously and won an international competition sponsored by Egypt to create a monument for the Aswan High Dam, financed in large part by the Soviet Union.Ernst Iosifovich Neizvestny was born on April 9, 1925, in Sverdlovsk (now Ekaterinburg), in the Ural Mountains. His father, Iosif, was a pediatric surgeon. His mother, the former Bella Dizhur, was a biochemist, poet and children\u2019s book author. Ernst was sent to a school for artistically gifted children in Leningrad. (It was relocated to Samarkand after the outbreak of World War II.)In 1942, Mr. Neizvestny enlisted in the military, serving on the Second Ukrainian Front as an airborne commando. He was severely wounded in Austria in 1945, left for dead and awarded \u2014 posthumously, the authorities assumed \u2014 the prestigious Order of the Red Star.After the war, he taught drawing at the Suvorov Military Institute in Sverdlovsk before resuming his art studies at the Academy of Fine Arts in Riga. He later studied art at the Surikov Art Institute in Moscow and philosophy at Moscow State University. In 1955, he was accepted into the sculpture section of the Moscow branch of the Soviet Artists\u2019 Union and began exhibiting widely in group shows.His marriage to Dina Mukhina, a ceramist, ended in divorce. In addition to his wife, Ms. Graham, he is survived by a daughter from his first marriage, Olga Neizvestny; a sister, Liudmila Lifson; and a stepdaughter, Olivia Graham.In 1996, his \u201cMask of Sorrow,\u201d a monument to the victims of the Stalinist purges, was installed in the Siberian coastal city of Magadan, a dispersal point for the camps of the gulag. In 2004, \u201cThe Tree of Life,\u201d a work he first conceived in the 1950s, was placed in the foyer of the Bagration pedestrian bridge in Moscow.In a telegram sent to relatives and friends of the artist, and posted on the Kremlin\u2019s website, Vladimir V. Putin, Russia\u2019s president, said that Mr. Neizvestny was \u201crightly considered one of the greatest sculptors of our time\u201d and called his death \u201ca grievous loss for Russia\u2019s culture and for world culture as a whole.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jefferies, Free of the Restraints of Bigger Banks, Is Emboldened", "Date": "2016-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen the activist investor Carl C. Icahn bought 15 percent of the organic and natural products maker Hain Celestial in 2010, the company\u2019s chief turned for advice to Mr. Icahn\u2019s own Wall Street banker, Richard Handler, the chief executive of the investment bank Jefferies.When Mr. Icahn decided to sell that stake at a big profit three years later, Jefferies was the buyer. It quickly resold the shares to its clients in two bites for a total of $611 million.In the six years since regulators forced Wall Street banks to rein in risk-taking, Jefferies has emerged with an appetite for risk and a set of relationships to rival bigger Wall Street firms. It never took federal bailout money. Now, as a subsidiary of the conglomerate Leucadia National, Jefferies is not subject to the trading restrictions and capital requirements imposed on other investment banks that did take bailout funds and became part of bank holding companies. That gives it room to make bolder moves than some of its larger peers.It is easier for Jefferies to do deals that exceed \u201ccookie cutter\u201d debt limits, said Chris Kotowski, an analyst at Oppenheimer.Although Jefferies\u2019s $37 billion in assets remain tiny next to Wall Street giants like Goldman Sachs at $878 billion, its share of Wall Street trading has doubled since 2006, and Leucadia \u201ccan write a significant equity check at a moment\u2019s notice,\u201d Mr. Kotowski said.Leucadia\u2019s willingness to provide such capital relatively quickly \u201cstands in contrast with big bank holding companies which have shrunk and retreated,\u201d said Bill Ford, the chief executive of General Atlantic, which manages $17 billion and invested alongside Jefferies in Knight.Mike Holland, a money manager, said Leucadia was \u201cnot afraid to go there wherever there is and have a look.\u201dSome of its risks have backfired, however. Leucadia, which bought Jefferies in 2012, has since booked losses from the investment bank\u2019s exposure to energy, junk bonds and Bache, the commodity division that it bought from Prudential in 2011 and sold to Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale last year. Leucadia also stumbled because of its own 79 percent stake in National Beef, a meat-processing business that has been struggling.Shares of Leucadia fell 46 percent from their peak in May 2013 through last year, while those of 13 business peers rose an average 14 percent. This year, despite battling volatile markets early in the year, Leucadia has outperformed as results started to rebound. At Jefferies, profit for the second quarter, which ended in May, was 10 percent lower than the same period a year ago but compared favorably with a $167 million first-quarter loss. In a statement announcing earnings, Mr. Handler said conditions were returning to \u201ca more normal level.\u201dMr. Handler, who became the Jefferies chief executive in 2001 and chairman the following year, does not court media attention or like to be photographed. He dresses casually in polo shirts as he works in his Manhattan corner office, which is decorated with a picture of him and a fellow New Jersey native, Bruce Springsteen, on the wall.Under his leadership, Jefferies had the best stock performance of any investment bank through 2012, Mr. Kotowski said, sailing relatively unscathed through the financial crisis, in part by selling a 14 percent stake to Leucadia in early 2008.The trading and merchant banking risks the firm now takes are no greater than those for other Wall Street dealers, say people at the firm. Jefferies says it has cut its leverage, or the ratio of assets to equity capital, from 17 in 2010 to a current 10. The current level is below that of competitors, Moody\u2019s Investors Service said.This year, Jefferies\u2019s interests in the growing financial technology field put it back in the spotlight. Jefferies has packaged loans for resale to investors from upstart lenders including Avant, CircleBack Lending and OnDeck. The firm ranks an outsize No. 5 in underwriting such loan packages, according to PeerIQ, which tracks marketplace lending. Jefferies has also taken venture capital-style equity stakes in two financial tech lending start-ups, Affirm and Bond Street.Jefferies is also linked to Lending Club, the peer-to-peer lender that has been in turmoil since an internal investigation revealed improprieties in the sale of loans and a separate disclosure issue, which resulted in the ouster of its chief executive in May. About $22 million in loans sold to Jefferies did not meet the investment bank\u2019s criteria, and the company bought them back.Leucadia\u2019s other non-Jefferies-related assets remain a grab bag, including an Italian broadband company, a plastic net maker, auto dealers, timber and real estate. And the jury is out on more than $500 million in postmerger investments in energy and gold mining, and another $500 million in hedge funds.Mr. Kotowski of Oppenheimer is bullish, but some investors shun the stock. Ted Hart, who follows financial stocks at Tufton Capital Management in Baltimore, said the new Leucadia with Jefferies as its core was highly correlated with the high-yield debt market. In its former life as a multi-industry conglomerate, \u201cIf one business wasn\u2019t doing well, you had another that was picking up the slack,\u201d Mr. Hart said.But now, he added: \u201cThe outlook for Leucadia is kind of the outlook for the high-yield market, which isn\u2019t too rosy. With oil prices remaining low, Leucadia may continue to struggle in high-yield debt underwriting and trading. It looks cheap on a price-to-book-value basis, but it\u2019s an entirely different company.\u201dThe son of a tax preparer from Fair Lawn, N.J., Mr. Handler, 55, sold vacuum cleaners door-to-door and life insurance at a bank before graduating from the University of Rochester. After a stint as a junior analyst at First Boston during its Wasserstein Perella mid-1980s heyday, he got an M.B.A. from Stanford and worked in the Los Angeles office of Drexel Burnham Lambert before that firm\u2019s demise in 1990. He built the Jefferies junk-bond desk before he became chief executive.At Jefferies, trading and banking often rest partly on relationships, trust and loyalty \u2014 a culture set by Mr. Handler. His dealings with Mr. Icahn, once a prominent Drexel client, illustrate that point. Jefferies led or helped lead bond sales of $3.7 billion in 2014 and $2 billion in 2010 for Icahn Enterprises, Mr. Icahn\u2019s main investment vehicle.Mr. Handler\u2019s Drexel relationships were on display at an 80th birthday gathering he hosted for Mr. Icahn at a New York steakhouse in February.On hand were Michael Milken, Drexel\u2019s onetime junk-bond chief; Leon Black, a former top Drexel banker who is now chief executive of the private equity firm Apollo Global Management; and the former Drexel client Bennett LeBow, now chairman of the Vector Group, another staunch Jefferies client.The same group, minus Mr. Milken, meets monthly, said an attendee, Howard Lorber, chief of the Vector Group, a tobacco producer and majority owner of the Douglas Elliman real estate brokerage firm.

{"Headline": "As Games End, Rio Celebrates While Looking Warily to Future", "Date": "2016-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 The skies opened on Sunday night over Maracan\u00e3, the stadium where Brazil bade farewell to the Rio Olympics with a spectacle celebrating everything from the giants of Brazilian music to the rock art drawn by tribesmen thousands of years ago, as if the heavens were lamenting the end of the 17-day sports extravaganza.Nodding to Brazil\u2019s diversity as Latin America\u2019s largest country, the ceremony also honored facets of an astonishingly rich musical heritage that are often overlooked, promoting As Ganhadeiras de Itapu\u00e3, a group of former washerwomen rescuing Afro-Brazilian songs in northeast Brazil, as well as Arnaldo Antunes, a poet and vocalist who once sang for Tit\u00e3s, a pioneering S\u00e3o Paulo rock band.Despite widespread fears that the city would be unprepared, or that crime and disorganization might turn the Olympics into a national embarrassment, many Brazilians came to view the Games as a triumph and a much-needed distraction from the country\u2019s economic malaise and political upheaval.In the days after the opening ceremony, the criticisms that the Games were an inappropriate use of public money at a time of crisis were mostly subsumed by a sense that Brazil had largely met the logistical challenges, delivering the world\u2019s biggest sporting event for the half-million visitors who flocked to Rio for South America\u2019s first Olympics.\u201cWe know the city isn\u2019t an easy place to live in, but Rio flung its arms wide open, and we need to congratulate ourselves for our receptiveness and joy in making such a beautiful party,\u201d said Naid\u00ea Gouv\u00eaa Lira, 45, a logistics analyst.The ebullience was further buoyed on Saturday by the Brazilian soccer team\u2019s win over Germany, a victory that yielded one of the country\u2019s seven gold medals in the Games and helped ease the sting of its humiliating 2014 World Cup loss to the Germans.14 PhotosOver all, Brazilians seemed satisfied with their relatively modest medal count, which placed the country among the top 14 nations, its best Olympic showing ever. Many are still savoring their first gold of the Rio Games, won in judo by Rafaela Silva, 24, a black woman from an impoverished part of Rio.\u201cTo see her win really lifted our spirits,\u201d said Fabio Costa dos Santos, 47, an unemployed carpenter who, like Silva, hails from City of God, a favela in the city\u2019s western suburbs.The Games were far from trouble free. Even after the authorities deployed an 85,000-strong security force to ease crime fears, Portugal\u2019s education minister was robbed at knifepoint. An Olympic bus carrying journalists was attacked by people throwing rocks.Outside the Olympic bubble, gun battles between the police and drug gangs in Complexo do Alem\u00e3o, a collection of favelas, the poor urban areas that emerged as squatter settlements, were a stubborn reminder of the untamed violence and yawning inequities in a city that officials had promised would be the world\u2019s safest during the Games.A police officer deployed to Rio for the Games was killed when the vehicle he was in came under fire in a favela controlled by drug gangs. The killing of the officer, H\u00e9lio Vieira Andrade, from Roraima State in the Brazilian Amazon, focused scrutiny on Rio\u2019s priorities during the Olympics.\u201cThere wasn\u2019t even a tear shed for him in the ocean that was the Olympics,\u201d Fernando Gabeira, a politician and writer, said, noting the contrast with emotions expressed around the victories and defeats of Brazil\u2019s athletes.Transportation gridlock frustrated visitors as they rushed between events on opposite sides of a sprawling metropolis. And many people complained about the glaring sight of empty seats, even at the closing ceremony, partly the result of unsold tickets that proved unaffordable to the working poor.The organizers seemed to stumble on several fronts, at least early on. Long security lines and shortages of food at some sites left spectators grumbling. A mysterious green tint in the diving and water polo pools was highly embarrassing.Here is a breakdown of all the medals awarded and the athletes who have competed at each Olympics, starting with the 1896 Games in Athens. The schedule for the Games in Rio de Janeiro and all the medal winners there are also listed.Still, 57 percent of Brazilians said that the Olympics had generated a more positive image of the country around the world, according to Ibope. The poll, conducted from Aug. 11 to 15 in interviews with 2,002 people, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus two percentage points.Those mixed feelings produced something of a paradox: a \u201cwasteful event that worked out,\u201d in the words of Jos\u00e9 Roberto de Toledo, a columnist for the newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo, who analyzed the poll.Still, many of the worst fears proved unfounded. Zika, the mosquito-borne virus that prompted some foreign athletes to stay home, was largely forgotten as the Games got underway.So, too, were anxieties over a potential terrorist attack. And while the state government failed to meet promises that it would clean up the sewage-infested Guanabara Bay, boating competitions took place without any collisions between sailors and floating sofas.Anderson Gurgel, a sports researcher at Mackenzie Presbyterian University in S\u00e3o Paulo, commended the organizers for dealing with the unexpected problems, although he said they were sometimes slow to act.\u201cEvery event of this size has problems; the issue is how to manage them,\u201d Gurgel said. \u201cBrazilians need to learn things won\u2019t always go wrong, that there won\u2019t always be chaos.\u201dStill, the closing ceremony exuded simplicity while lacking the over-the-top dazzle of other Olympic spectacles, creating a buoyant atmosphere inside Maracan\u00e3 by mixing performances by contemporary musicians like Lenine with homages for giants of Brazilian culture like the composer Luiz Gonzaga. Athletes paraded under the rain to the samba tunes.The Rio Games will also be remembered for a debacle that was not of its own making: the false claims by the American swimmer Ryan Lochte that he and some of his teammates had been pulled over and robbed at gunpoint by men describing themselves as police officers.On Saturday, Lochte tried to put the controversy to rest by admitting that he had exaggerated the details of the incident. \u201cI let my team down,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cI learned my lesson.\u201dStill, the victory of Brazil\u2019s national soccer team over Germany\u2019s allowed many in the country to pivot from the episode involving the swimmers. Globo, Brazil\u2019s dominant television network, luxuriated in the conquest of the soccer gold medal, devoting the bulk of its nightly news program to the triumph.But even amid the celebrations, the rising polarization of Brazil\u2019s unruly if functioning democracy was on display.Indeed, the sense of reverie will be tested in the coming weeks as Brazilians confront the ugly realities of surging unemployment, rampant corruption and the intensifying political drama in the capital, Bras\u00edlia.The respite will be brief: In the coming days, Brazil\u2019s Senate will start its trial of Ms. Rousseff on charges that she illegally manipulated the federal budget. Michel Temer, the interim president, did not event attend the closing spectacle after he was greeted with a chorus of boos during the opening ceremony.For Rio residents, the intoxicating mood of the past two weeks will inevitably give way to an array of challenges: the inadequate sewage-treatment system, the growing poverty and a broken state government unable to pay thousands of civil servants on time. Rio\u2019s mayor, Eduardo Paes, who hitched his political fortunes to the organization of the Games, was booed when he appeared on stage Sunday night, a reception that stood in contrast to the applause for Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, who appeared to mark the transition to the next Summer Olympics in Tokyo in 2020.Most worrisome, many say, is what happens after the tens of thousands of soldiers and military police personnel who were dispatched to Rio for the Games go back to their home states. A last-minute cash infusion from the federal government helped finance the surge in security, but a police union official has warned of strikes should the city\u2019s police force go unpaid.Elizabeth Rezende, 61, a retired maid, said she was bracing for a return of the status quo. \u201cSure, the Games have been a good thing for Rio, but once they are over, poor people like us will be back in hell,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be locked in our homes while the criminals roam the streets with impunity.\u201dPaula Moura and Anna Jean Kaiser contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders\u2019s New Political Group Is Met by Staff Revolt", "Date": "2016-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySenator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, his presidential campaign behind him, looked to advance the movement he built during the Democratic primary race, with the public unveiling on Wednesday of a political organization focused on addressing economic inequality and taking on special interests.But while the establishment of the new group, Our Revolution, had been eagerly awaited by many of his most ardent supporters, it has been met with criticism and controversy over its financing and management.A principal concern among backers of Mr. Sanders, whose condemnation of the campaign finance system was a pillar of his presidential bid, is that the group can draw from the pool of \u201cdark money\u201d that Mr. Sanders condemned for lacking transparency.The announcement of the group, which was live streamed on Wednesday night, also came as a majority of its staff resigned after the appointment last Monday of Jeff Weaver, Mr. Sanders\u2019s former campaign manager, to lead the organization.Several people familiar with the organization said eight core staff members had stepped down. The group\u2019s entire organizing department quit this week, along with people working in digital and data positions.After the resignations, Mr. Sanders spoke to some who had quit and asked them to reconsider, but the staff members refused.At the heart of the issue, according to several people who left, was deep distrust of and frustration with Mr. Weaver, whom they accused of wasting money on television advertising during Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign; mismanaging campaign funds by failing to hire staff members or effectively target voters; and creating a hostile work environment by threatening to criticize staff members if they quit.The Upshot\u2019s presidential forecast, updated daily.Claire Sandberg, who was the organizing director at Our Revolution and had worked on Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign, said she and others were also concerned about the group\u2019s tax status \u2014 as a 501(c)(4) organization it can collect large donations from anonymous sources \u2014 and that a focus by Mr. Weaver on television advertising meant that it would fail to reach many of the young voters who powered Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign and are best reached online.\u201cI left and others left because we were alarmed that Jeff would mismanage this organization as he mismanaged the campaign,\u201d she said, expressing concern that Mr. Weaver would \u201cbetray its core purpose by accepting money from billionaires and not remaining grass-roots-funded and plowing that billionaire cash into TV instead of investing it in building a genuine movement.\u201dKenneth Pennington, who was the digital director of Our Revolution, declined to go into detail about his reasons for leaving but confirmed that he was no longer with the organization.The staff members who quit also said that they feared that the 501(c)(4) designation meant that the group would not be able to work directly with Mr. Sanders or the people that he had encouraged to run for office because such organizations are not allowed to coordinate directly with candidates.Mr. Weaver did not respond to requests for comment.In an email sent to Sanders supporters on Tuesday night encouraging them to participate, Mr. Weaver said that the new group would work together to \u201cempower a wave of progressive candidates this November and win the major upcoming fights for the values we share.\u201dIn his live-stream announcement, Mr. Sanders sounded nostalgic about his presidential campaign as he repeatedly said his candidacy had changed the Democratic Party and pulled Hillary Clinton toward his progressive ideas.\u201cWe changed the conversation regarding the possibilities of our country. That is what we changed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe redefined what the vision and the future of our country should be, and that is no small thing.\u201dMr. Sanders also said Our Revolution would focus on seven specific initiatives across the country, including a California proposition aimed at lowering the cost of prescription drugs and a Colorado initiative aimed at creating a single-payer health care system.But Mr. Sanders also made it clear that he did not plan to run the organization himself, saying, \u201cAs a United States senator, I will not be directing or controlling Our Revolution.\u201dMr. Sanders praised Mr. Weaver as someone who had worked with him for 30 years and who has \u201cvery, very good qualifications.\u201d Mr. Sanders added that Shannon Jackson, his former assistant, would be the executive director of Our Revolution.\u201cI expect big things from them and all of you who join with them to carry the political revolution forward,\u201d Mr. Sanders said.The creation of the group comes as Mr. Sanders faces lingering disappointment from some of his supporters for his endorsement of Mrs. Clinton and questions about his finances that have arisen since he left the race.Paul S. Ryan, a campaign finance expert at the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit political finance group, said that it was unusual for a federal lawmaker to set up such a fund-raising organization and that Mr. Sanders should have had to follow Federal Election Commission donation limits and disclosure requirements.\u201cThere are definitely some red flags with respect to the formation of this group,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a murky area.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Corporate America Is Leaving the Suburbs for the City", "Date": "2016-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWILMINGTON, Del. \u2014 For decades, many of the nation\u2019s biggest companies staked their futures far from the fraying downtowns of aging East Coast and Midwestern cities. One after another, they decamped for sprawling campuses in the suburbs and exurbs.Now, corporate America is moving in the other direction.In June, McDonald\u2019s joined a long list of companies that are returning to downtown Chicago from suburbs like Oak Brook, Northfield and Schaumburg.Later this month, the top executive team at General Electric \u2014 whose 70-acre wooded campus in Fairfield, Conn., has embodied the quintessential suburban corporate office park since it opened in 1974 \u2014 will move to downtown Boston. When the move is completed in 2018, the renovated red brick warehouses that will form part of G.E.\u2019s new headquarters won\u2019t even have a parking lot, let alone a spot reserved for the chief executive.But even as they establish new urban beachheads, business giants like G.E. are also changing the nature of their headquarters, staffing them with a few top white-collar employees and a smattering of digital talent, rather than recreating the endless Dilbert-like pods they once built in the \u2019burbs.\u201cPart of it is that cities are more attractive places to live than they were 30 years ago and are more willing to provide tax incentives, and young people want to be there,\u201d said David J. Collis, who teaches corporate strategy at Harvard Business School.\u201cBut the trend also represents the deconstruction and disaggregation of the traditional corporate headquarters,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe executive suite might be downtown, but you could have the back office and administrative functions in Colorado, the finance guys in Switzerland and the tax team in the U.K.\u201dReinforcing the trend, Chemours plans to announce on Tuesday that it is staying here in Wilmington after considering suburban locations, most likely in the century-old headquarters it inherited from DuPont when the chemical giant spun out Chemours last year.Unlike Chicago and Boston, Wilmington\u2019s urban renaissance remains a work in progress, and Chemours was very close to moving to a new home in southern New Jersey or suburban Philadelphia, despite the DuPont family\u2019s deep roots in Wilmington and the state of Delaware.But the company\u2019s chief executive, Mark Vergnano, ultimately came to the same conclusion that leaders of bigger and better-known firms did: To attract younger workers, it helps to be in the city.\u201cWe are going through a change in our work force, and we wanted to be where we could attract millennials,\u201d Mr. Vergnano said. \u201cThis is a group that likes to be in an urban setting, with access to public transportation. They don\u2019t want to be confined to a building with a cafeteria or be next door to a shopping center.\u201dTo be sure, cash from the State of Delaware and other incentives played an important role in the decision as well.In addition to providing Chemours, which produces a range of industrial chemical products, with a $7.9 million package of grants, Delaware overhauled its corporate tax code, sacrificing revenue and easing the company\u2019s tax burden as an added lure to stay put.For Wilmington, where the unemployment rate of 5.7 percent is above both the national average and Delaware\u2019s overall 4.2 percent level of joblessness, keeping Chemours\u2019s 800 headquarters jobs in the city counts as a major win.\u201cIn a more perfect world, states would be competing on the quality of schools, infrastructure, work force and so forth,\u201d said Gov. Jack A. Markell of Delaware. \u201cWe live in a world that\u2019s not perfect, so if other states are competing on the basis of these dollar incentives, we need to be in the same arena.\u201dIn an era of relentless cost-cutting, many corporate moves these days coincide with downsizing. Kraft Heinz, for example, had 2,200 workers when the company was based in Northfield; it has 1,500 now in downtown Chicago.With advanced communications tools making it easier than ever to separate headquarters from other corporate operations, location is increasingly being driven by function.The first 175 members of G.E.\u2019s management team, including Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chief executive, will move to Boston\u2019s Fort Point section on Aug. 22. Even after the move is completed, about 800 G.E. employees will be based there. Hundreds of other workers in back-office functions like human resources, legal and finance will be scattered among G.E\u2019s existing locations in Cincinnati, Norwalk, Conn., and Schenectady, N.Y.The headquarters of Motorola Solutions will start moving to downtown Chicago on Aug. 15, though more workers will stay in suburban Schaumburg than move to the new offices near Union Station. But for the first time in half a century, top executives from the company will again be in downtown Chicago.\u201cWhere you work really matters,\u201d said Greg Brown, the chief executive of Motorola Solutions. \u201cNo disrespect to Schaumburg, but customers and new hires didn\u2019t want to come to the suburbs an hour outside of Chicago. We wanted energy, vibrancy and diversity, and to accelerate a change in our culture by moving downtown.\u201dMr. Brown and most of the executive team will be in the city, along with data scientists and design engineers; workaday functions like procurement, training and supply chain management will stay in Schaumburg.Over all, Motorola Solutions will have 1,100 employees in downtown Chicago, and 1,600 still in Schaumburg. Unlike many other corporate migrants, the company did not receive any financial incentives to move, Mr. Brown said.\u201cThis was the right thing in terms of strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cMillennials want the access and vibrancy of downtown. When we post jobs downtown, we get four or five times the response.\u201dAs for G.E., executives were focused on moving to a city from the beginning of its search for a new headquarters, said Ann R. Klee, director of Boston operations and development for the company.Along with eliminating the parking lot (workers are being encouraged to use public transit) G.E. wanted to do away with security gates and the sense of isolation that characterizes many corporate campuses.\u201cThis is going to be the exact opposite,\u201d Ms. Klee said. \u201cWe want it to be open and to bring the public in with a museum and exhibits of technology like 3-D printers.\u201dBesides blue-chip icons like G.E., McDonald\u2019s and Kraft Heinz, venture capital investors and start-ups are increasingly looking to urban centers, particularly on the West Coast, said Richard Florida, an urban theorist and professor at the University of Toronto.\u201cThe period of companies moving to suburbs and edge cities has ebbed, but I had thought that start-ups would continue to locate in so-called nerdistans, like office parks,\u201d he said. But a recent study by Mr. Florida showed more than half of new venture capital flowing into urban neighborhoods, with two San Francisco ZIP codes garnering more than $1 billion each, he said.The return of a top echelon of executives to American cities reflects \u2014 and may well reinforce \u2014 disparities driven by widening inequality, underscoring how jobs are disappearing in other locales.Over all, there has been a slight pickup in employment and population in the central core of big cities, said Joel Kotkin, an author and urban geographer at Chapman University in California. But many close-in suburbs and neighborhoods are withering, particularly in the Northeast. More distant suburbs and exurbs are still thriving, especially in the Sun Belt.\u201cThe elite functions are going downtown,\u201d Mr. Kotkin said. \u201cBut at the same time, middle-management jobs are moving to the suburbs in places like Dallas, if they\u2019re not leaving the country entirely.\u201dIn Wilmington, local shopkeepers were elated that Chemours decided not to follow its former corporate parent, DuPont, to the suburbs. \u201cAnybody who has a business in downtown Wilmington doesn\u2019t want to lose Chemours,\u201d said Leonard Simon, whose family-owned men\u2019s clothing store, Wright & Simon, has been around the corner from Chemours since 1952. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled.\u201dJeffrey C. Flynn, director of economic development for Wilmington, said that the advantages of city life ultimately proved to be a compelling selling point.\u201cWe\u2019re not Philadelphia,\u201d Mr. Flynn said, \u201cbut we do have an urban atmosphere.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Uncovering Gay History in San Francisco", "Date": "2016-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPursuitsOsento, a Japanese bathhouse on Valencia Street in San Francisco, is long gone, closed now for nearly a decade. I could have used a soak, though: It was an uncommonly hot and muggy day in the city, and I\u2019d been walking its streets for hours.Back in the day, people looking for Osento on a similarly soupy afternoon were probably just as confounded. The women-only communal bathhouse, a frequent haunt for lesbians, didn\u2019t have a sign out front. It was mostly known through word of mouth by its clientele, who say its founder ended a nearly three-decade run when she shuttered it in 2008 and moved north to Lake County, Calif.Now it is a splendid Victorian dwelling, kaleidoscopic in hues of magenta, turquoise and gold. On its facade are stunning sculptured plaques of sea horses, conchs and starfish. Elaborate cast reliefs of tattooed mermaids by a San Francisco artist named Natasha Dikareva gaze ahead. While the relaxation rooms, saunas and a secluded deck for nude sunbathing were all gone, somehow the bathhouse\u2019s spirit lives on.The permanent exhibition makes clear that while the defense industry employed women in huge numbers \u2014 12 million in 1941 and 18 million by 1944 \u2014 there were still others whose lives were similarly shifting amid war and discrimination. According to Fanny Christina Hill, who is quoted alongside a riveting drill: \u201cHitler was the one who got us out of the white folks\u2019 kitchen.\u201d The war effort was also carried out by blacks, Mexican-Americans, the elderly, the disabled and Japanese-Americans, who would end up forcibly relocated and incarcerated at internment camps around the American West.The long workdays here would be critical to vanquishing the enemy abroad. Midway through the exhibition, I watched a film showing, in accelerated motion, how crews built a ship within a month, and read that during the war years, the 90,000 men and women who worked at the Richmond shipyards produced an impressive 747 vessels, including more Liberty and Victory cargo ships than anywhere else in the country.Farther on, there were welding masks and riveting drills, and a plaque quoting Ludie Mitchell, who found her way from Texas to Richmond, later observing: \u201cI remember climbing a steep ship\u2019s ladder with a heavy coil on my shoulder. I was pretty small then and was struggling. The man coming up the ladder behind me lifted the cable off my shoulder and said: \u2018You women are going to be some pretty good men after the war.\u2019 \u201dWe continued our stroll to the corner of Taylor and Turk Streets, to a four-story blue building with fire escapes and seemingly new stucco trim. The first floor was boarded up, but two plaques, one metal, one stone, were embedded in the sidewalk before it.There was a powerful retrospective of dancers who died of AIDS on exhibit, and I also stood for a time in front of a glass case shielding the bloodstained shirt, tie, jacket, pants and belt that Mr. Milk \u2014 affectionately called the mayor of the Castro \u2014 was wearing when he was assassinated. Visitors can listen, as I did, to a moving, reflective recording Mr. Milk made shortly after being elected to the city\u2019s board of supervisors in 1977.Afterward, around the corner, I sat at Harvey\u2019s for a late veggie burger lunch. Like Castro Camera and other sites I had visited earlier in the day, it had a story. As I waited for my order, I read about it in the menu: It had once been called the Elephant Walk, and its opening date, Nov. 27, 1974, was exactly four years before Milk was assassinated. The disco icon Sylvester had been a regular in the 1970s; a police riot broke out here when Mr. Milk\u2019s convicted assassin, Dan White, received a light sentence. In 1988, a fire nearly destroyed it.But it was thriving now, with packed tables and large windows thrown open onto the street. The owners, when they opened the Elephant Walk, decided it should be a place where all patrons feel no shame, and it would have this airy atmosphere, this wide and good view to the world. It hadn\u2019t been easy. But then again, as the author Armistead Maupin, the San Francisco faithful and connoisseur, once put it, \u201cThe worst of times in San Francisco was still better than the best of times anywhere else.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The negotiations for both trips were first reported by The Washington Post.The Clinton campaign said Mrs. Clinton last met with the Mexican president in 2014 and would talk again with him \u201cat the appropriate time,\u201d without elaborating.Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto is reaching out to Mr. Trump in the face of the Republican candidate\u2019s antagonistic attitude toward Mexico in his policies and campaign rallies. He has said many Mexican immigrants who enter the United States illegally are rapists, and he has repeatedly insisted that Mexico will pay for his proposed wall along the southern United States border.The Upshot\u2019s presidential forecast, updated daily.He is widely reviled in Mexico, where the wall proposal has revived deep grievances over sovereignty and respect that have historically dogged Mexico\u2019s relationship with the United States.\u201cThey are not our friend, believe me,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a speech last year in which he accused Mexico of treating the United States unfairly, \u201cbut they are killing us economically.\u201d\u201cWhen Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019re bringing drugs, they\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists, and some I assume are good people.\u201dPoliticians in Mexico have largely remained silent on Mr. Trump, though there have been outbursts, including from Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto himself. In March, he compared Mr. Trump to Hitler and Mussolini for what he called Mr. Trump\u2019s strident remarks and populism, though he later tried to soften his words without quite taking them back.\u201cFrom the first days of his campaign, Donald Trump has painted Mexicans as \u2018rapists\u2019 and criminals and has promised to deport 16 million people, including children and U.S. citizens,\u201d Jennifer Palmieri, the Clinton campaign\u2019s communications director, said in a statement. \u201cWhat ultimately matters is what Donald Trump says to voters in Arizona, not Mexico, and whether he remains committed to the splitting up of families and deportation of millions.\u201dThe trip is the latest gamble for Mr. Trump and his struggling campaign. But for all the risk it poses, it offers an image Mr. Trump relishes: of a wily negotiator willing to do the unexpected \u2014 meeting with a perceived enemy \u2014 to advance his agenda.It will also be his first official meeting with a head of state as the Republican presidential nominee.Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s routine scolding of Mexico and its leadership, several of his closest allies have warm ties with the country and its president. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a top Trump adviser and confidant, traveled to Mexico in 2014 to meet with Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, arguing that it was imperative for the United States to put Mexico at the center of its foreign relations.During that trip, Mr. Christie offered lavish praise for Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s market-oriented policies and, unlike Mr. Trump, spoke of the need to cultivate stronger ties with Mexico.\u201cToo often, our neighbors in Mexico and Canada have felt that they were an afterthought in U.S. foreign policy,\u201d he said. \u201cMy view is that they should be our first thought.\u201dA person briefed on the trip discussions said that Mr. Christie, who leads Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team, had helped with them.Mexico\u2019s disaffection with Mr. Trump began early in his campaign, when he said, among other things, that the immigrants entering the United States illegally from Mexico were criminals. From that point on, columns, articles and public forums have been filled with anti-Trump tirades, his words galvanizing Mexicans across the social spectrum.Artisans have fashioned Trump pi\u00f1atas, and former President Vicente Fox has made it his mission to rebuke Mr. Trump\u2019s every word, to name but two of the rejoinders from Mexican society. Last year, writers, intellectuals and scientists from across the Spanish-speaking world wrote a public letter denouncing Mr. Trump and accusing him of xenophobia.Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s finance minister has said that under no circumstances would Mexico pay for a border wall.Andrew Selee, the executive vice president of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and a Mexico expert, said Mexico\u2019s motivation to invite Mr. Trump might simply have been pragmatic.\u201cI think the Mexican government wants channels with whoever is going to be president of the U.S. next, and Trump is a legitimate candidate,\u201d Mr. Selee said. \u201cAnd from a political perspective, Pe\u00f1a Nieto getting Trump to come to Mexico shows that Trump has been forced to shift some of his rhetoric and take Mexico seriously.\u201dBut considering how often Mr. Trump comes up in conversation in Mexico, and the uniform insult felt by the nation every time he talks about the wall, the government has remained disciplined in their public statements. That is in part a political decision: Officials feel that any responses will do little but provide more publicity for the candidate.For Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, though, the politics could be difficult. His poll numbers are the lowest of any Mexican president in a quarter-century.Maggie Haberman, Michael Barbaro and Patrick Healy contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Turing Pharmaceuticals Accused of Retaliating for Sex Assault Complaint", "Date": "2016-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow, that executive, Nancy Retzlaff, has filed a federal complaint against Turing, accusing one of Mr. Shkreli\u2019s friends, a fellow founder of the company, of sexually assaulting her in a hotel room in March. He resigned from Turing after an internal investigation, which, she says, led the company leaders to retaliate against her.On Tuesday, Ron Tilles, chairman and chief executive of Turing, said in an email, \u201cAs a matter of corporate policy, we do not comment on any pending litigation.\u201d Edwin Urrutia, the co-founder Ms. Retzlaff accuses of sexual assault, declined to comment when reached by phone on Monday.In the complaint, filed on Monday with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Ms. Retzlaff said she and other Turing executives traveled to Washington in March for another hearing before Congress on Turing\u2019s pricing practices. At the hotel bar, the complaint says, she was approached by Mr. Urrutia, who made sexual advances and tried to kiss her.According to the complaint, which was obtained by The New York Times, Ms. Retzlaff left the bar and took the elevator back to her room, but Mr. Urrutia followed her and blocked her way when she tried to exit, demanding that she join him in his room for a drink. When she did, she said, \u201che threw me onto the bed and sexually assaulted me.\u201dMs. Retzlaff said she was groped and that he repeatedly kissed her against her will, then tried to pull off her tights. \u201cFinally, after struggling for many minutes, I was able to escape Mr. Urrutia and run out of the room,\u201d she said in the complaint.Mr. Urrutia, who was Turing\u2019s interim chief financial officer, worked as an analyst at a handful of banks before going to work at Mr. Shkreli\u2019s previous company, Retrophin, as vice president of finance, according to his LinkedIn profile. He is a graduate of Northeastern University with a bachelor\u2019s degree in finance.After that episode and other sexual advances at company functions afterward, Ms. Retzlaff said, a co-worker reported Mr. Urrutia\u2019s behavior to Turing, which hired an outside company to investigate. The investigation substantiated her claims, she said, and Mr. Urrutia resigned from Turing \u201cin lieu of termination.\u201dBut although Ms. Retzlaff had been vindicated, she said that others at the company retaliated against her for causing Mr. Urrutia\u2019s departure, in June.Ms. Retzlaff said she had been a candidate for chief executive and had been promised restricted stock in the company but was told she would not be eligible for either after Mr. Urrutia left.Ms. Retzlaff declined to comment through her lawyer, Douglas H. Wigdor.Ms. Retzlaff did not report the episode in the hotel room, Mr. Wigdor said. He noted that a majority of sexual assaults and rapes are not reported.\u201cAmongst the cast of characters running Turing, it is not hard to fathom that our client was genuinely fearful of reprisal, victim blaming, and being denied the C.E.O. position for which she was eminently qualified \u2014 all of which are now happening but for which we will utilize all of our resources to hold those responsible accountable,\u201d he said in an email.The complaint accuses Mr. Shkreli of sexist and vulgar behavior that set the tone for the office atmosphere, although he left the company before the incident in March. Ms. Retzlaff said that Mr. Shkreli, who she says is still involved in running the company, was angry that his friend, Mr. Urrutia, had been forced to leave.In a phone interview, Mr. Shkreli said that was not the case, and he praised Ms. Retzlaff as a talented executive. He confirmed that she had been a candidate for chief executive, even as he brushed aside claims that there was any sexism at his company.\u201cI had whispered to her many times that if she performed well, she could become the C.E.O. of the company,\u201d he said, noting that she was among Turing\u2019s highest-paid employees and that other high-level posts, including the general counsel, were held by women. \u201cNancy was in many ways the boss of the company. I kind of looked at her as more or less the C.E.O., in a lot of respects.\u201dAlthough he said he didn\u2019t have details since he left the company, he denied her claims that she had been retaliated against, saying, \u201cI know she was made some promises, but she fell a little bit short of expectations.\u201dMr. Shkreli said he had asked Mr. Urrutia to take a seat on Turing\u2019s board, and Mr. Urrutia agreed, then abruptly withdrew and left the company. Mr. Shkreli said he had heard \u201crumors\u201d about the sexual harassment investigation but that he didn\u2019t know any details.Mr. Shkreli also said he was not involved in the day-to-day operations of Turing and said he wished he had more say in how it is run. \u201cThis notion that I control this company is absurd,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Web Series About \u2018Raising Kids and Lowering Expectations\u2019", "Date": "2016-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe web series began as a catastrophe.Maccabee Montandon had an original idea for a show to be called \u201cThe Building,\u201d about a bunch of Brooklyn residents from diverse cultures all trapped in their apartment house during a catastrophic world event, complete with green screens and explosions. When he showed the treatment to Nicole Haran, his new writing partner and neighbor, she suggested that they lose the disaster angle and boil it down to its essence.\u201cI said, \u2018Listen, why do we need the huge apocalyptic thing? We\u2019re all trapped. Let\u2019s be real,\u2019\u201d Ms. Haran said. \u201cWe\u2019re parents. How much freedom do we really have anyway?\u201dFor a moment, the series idea became a musical. \u201cBut I only wrote one song,\u201d Mr. Montandon acknowledged, laughing. They decided to keep it simple, hiring neighbors, friends and family members (including Mr. Montandon\u2019s two daughters, who were 10 and 8 at the time) to create four five-minute episodes.\u201cOcean Parkway\u201d is about the Wickershams, a downwardly mobile family of four, struggling to survive the city and one another. \u201cThe older daughter, Edie, has goals, her sister, Lo, has dreams, but the parents, Tina and Paul, might have peaked in college,\u201d the production notes say.\u201cEssentially, it\u2019s about raising kids and lowering expectations,\u201d Ms. Haran said.The web series was shot inside and outside Mr. Montandon\u2019s apartment at the Ocean Parkway circle where Windsor Terrace meets Ditmas Park, and inside his dented 1999 Subaru Forester, which bears a bumper sticker that reads, \u201cCalmer Than You Are\u201d \u2014 a nod to \u201cThe Big Lebowski.\u201dThough he does not look like the Dude, Mr. Montandon, 45, has the same laid-back, nice-guy vibe as Jeff Bridges\u2019s character in the Coen Brothers\u2019 cult film. He has made his living as an author, a freelance writer and an editor. Ms. Haran, 47, a founder of Barefoot Theater Co. and a mother of two, has more of a schoolteacher air and spends most of her time giving feedback to writers on new play development. She met Mr. Montandon two years ago through a mutual friend and gave him notes on a film script he was writing.Their new web series production \u2014 two episodes shot in March 2015, and two shot that June \u2014 came together in that magical way that only some projects do, Ms. Haran said. A producer friend, Theodora Dunlap, came on board and brought on Rudy Valdez as the director of photography, who brought in the actress Nadia Quinn to play the mother, who in turn brought in the actor Jim Santangeli to play the father. A small part went to the man who runs the local Seeley Street deli, Ali Ghaith. His sister, Alla, was hired as a production assistant.\u201cIt\u2019s a reminder of why we live in New York City,\u201d Mr. Montandon said, \u201cwith all this incredible talent all around us.\u201dThe series is funny, irreverent and filled with only-in-Brooklyn moments, some of them taken from the writers\u2019 lives.In another episode, the mother\u2019s Fjallraven backpack is stolen on the F train, but is recovered by a young man standing on the platform. Episode 4 ends with the father, Paul, admiring a speedboat parked next to the apartment building. \u201cWe wrote that episode because there was this boat in the alley, and we wanted to use it,\u201d Ms. Haran said, pointing to the boat on a tour of the neighborhood.Once the four episodes were finished \u2014 on a shoestring budget of $1,600 \u2014 the writers and the producer started looking for a platform. On a whim, Mr. Montandon decided to send an email to Sarah Condon, a fellow soccer parent, after seeing her name and HBO email address on a group thread for the American Youth Soccer Organization. He looked her up online and found that she was a producer who had been the head of comedy for HBO and had worked on the series \u201cBored to Death.\u201dMs. Condon, who lives in Cobble Hill and runs her own production company, Fair Harbor, and has a first-look deal with HBO, does not usually take unsolicited submissions from strangers. But she took a look and was impressed. \u201cI was really taken by the tone and the authenticity that they managed to get across,\u201d she said.Ms. Condon set up a meeting with Ms. Haran and Mr. Montandon, who were nervous.\u201cMy first thought was, maybe she just wants to meet with us and tell us to never email her again,\u201d Mr. Montandon said. \u201cIt was like, \u2018Are we in trouble?\u2019\u201dThey all met in April and decided to write a half-hour pilot and an overview focusing more on the teen and tween girls in the show. \u201cIt reminded me a little bit of a younger version of \u2018Girls,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Condon, who has an 11-year-old daughter. \u201cThat kind of girl at that age in Brooklyn. I feel in touch with that right now as a mom, this girl on the cusp of being a teenager and eventually a woman. It\u2019s a very vulnerable moment.\u201d Ms. Condon got her start at Nickelodeon and helped produce the 1990s show \u201cClarissa Explains It All.\u201dSmart series from a younger point of view are rare these days, she said. A gap exists between kid shows like \u201ciCarly\u201d and adult fare. \u201cIt\u2019s something kids could watch, but also adults,\u201d Ms. Condon said. \u201cAnd I love telling Brooklyn stories.\u201dMs. Condon made her pitch to Lisa Heller, an executive at HBO Family, who was open to producing a live-action tween project.HBO now has the four episodes, the pilot script and the overview, and it is considering the series for development. If HBO passes, Ms. Condon will pitch the project to other networks.Even if nothing else happens with the series, the writers are glad to have worked on the project together. \u201cThe best thing of all,\u201d Ms. Haran said, \u201cwas meeting and collaborating with Mac.

The metropolis of about 600,000 in southern Spain and the capital of the eponymous Andalusian province is part of the country\u2019s tourist-heavy Costa del Sol and full of beachside resorts offering all-inclusive packages at wallet-friendly prices.Today, the growing number of cultural attractions here may be more of a reason to come than the soft golden- sand beaches and sparkling Mediterranean. In the last decade, more than 20 museums have opened in the port city showcasing everything from paintings by art world heavy-hitters to rare automobiles. Many are concentrated in the historical center, much of it entirely pedestrian and dating back to Phoenician times.World-class museums like these opening in M\u00e1laga are a revolution for the city, said Virginia Irurita, the founder of the Madrid-based travel company Made for Spain and Portugal. \u201cM\u00e1laga is where you went for a cheap beach holiday. People couldn\u2019t care less about the city itself, but it\u2019s become the place now where all the Spanish want to come and stay to see the museums,\u201d she said.Although there are other Picasso museums including one in Paris, M\u00e1laga\u2019s is unique because of the artist\u2019s connection to the city, said Cristina Savage, who works in the museum\u2019s education department. \u201cSince so much of what is on display in this museum comes from Picasso\u2019s family, and he is from here, there is something very personal about the art,\u201d she said.But the splashiest museums to fold into M\u00e1laga\u2019s already strong lineup are the two openings in the spring of 2015.The Centre Pompidou M\u00e1laga, housed in a futuristic-looking glass cube with red, yellow, blue and green squares on the city\u2019s marina, makes a dramatic mark on the skyline. The visual appeal continues inside with works from marquee artists such as Frida Kahlo, Francis Bacon, Marc Chagall and John Currin.M\u00e1laga\u2019s mayor, Francisco de la Torre, brought the endeavor to fruition by traveling to Paris and presenting a proposal from the city hall to Pompidou Center officials. \u201cWe already had the Picasso museum and came up with a strategy to build on that to make M\u00e1laga more cultural,\u201d he said in Spanish through a translator. The museum had about 220,000 visitors in its first year, a number that he anticipates only to increase, he said.The mayor\u2019s deal for M\u00e1laga\u2019s branch of the Russian Museum St. Petersburg keeps the museum open for 10 years with the option to extend for another decade.Situated in the same tobacco factory complex as the Automobile Museum, the light-filled space, spanning two floors and about 43,000 square feet, is a showcase for 18th-century to modern-day works by prolific artists who are Russian or who have worked in Russia, such as the 19th-century landscape painter Ivan Shishkin and the 20th-century painter Vladimir Gavrilov.These museums undoubtedly have made M\u00e1laga culturally relevant. But the mayor said the transformation isn\u2019t over. \u201cWe have big plans for the city, and there\u2019s more coming to the work we\u2019ve already done.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Bloomberg, as a wealthy businessman and an outsider to politics with the management chops needed to run the nation\u2019s biggest city.But if Mr. Massey, a Republican, wanted to project the image of a capable manager, his first act as a declared candidate did little to help that cause.Although a news release announced that Mr. Massey had filed papers to begin his run for mayor with the city\u2019s Campaign Finance Board, a spokesman for the board, Matthew Sollars, said that officials there were not aware of having received any such filing.At the same time, John Conklin, a spokesman for the State Board of Elections, said that papers were filed on Thursday to form a political committee called Massey for Mayor 2017 \u2014 but that the filing was missing a required document and the papers were returned.Although Mr. Massey is little known outside the real estate world, and will have to work mightily to achieve the name recognition needed to make a successful run for mayor, he turned down a request for an interview.\u201cHe\u2019s not doing any interviews right now,\u201d a spokeswoman, Jessica Proud, said. \u201cIt\u2019s a soft launch.\u201dA spokesman for Mr. Massey, William F.

{"Headline": "Israel Quietly Legalizes Pirate Outposts in the West Bank", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "Unauthorized settlements dot hilltops in the West Bank, and anti-settlement groups and Palestinians say retroactively legalizing them is a methodical effort to change the region\u2019s map.Supported byDozens of youthful supporters came to cheer on the entrepreneur, Shimon Riklin, whose wife, newborn and toddler joined him a few days later. A second family also moved in. To their initial surprise, nobody from the military or government came to remove them. \u201cAfter six months,\u201d Mr. Riklin said in a recent interview, \u201cI understood it was a done deal.\u201dAt least one-third of these have either been retroactively legalized or \u2014 like Mitzpe Danny \u2014 are on their way, in what anti-settlement groups that track the process see as a quiet but methodical effort by the government to change the map of the West Bank, now in its 50th year under Israeli occupation, by entrenching the outposts that spread like fingers across it.Israel, Ms. Stahl said, has tried to avoid international censure by registering outposts like Mitzpe Danny as \u201cneighborhoods\u201d of established settlements, though some are far apart and function as separate communities.Pointing to other Israeli measures, including the demolitions of unauthorized Palestinian structures in the West Bank, she added, \u201cWe see it as a very gradual move toward annexation.\u201dAsked about the legalization of outposts \u2014 and the international criticism \u2014 Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s spokesman, David Keyes, did not respond directly, but instead turned the question to the Palestinian leaders\u2019 stance that no settlements could remain in the West Bank under a future deal.\u201cThe frequently echoed Palestinian demand to ethnically cleanse their future state of Jews,\u201d Mr. Keyes said via email, \u201cis outrageous, immoral and antithetical to peace.\u201dThe outposts are strategically located alongside more than 120 settlements that were formally approved by Israel, and are home to a fraction of the West Bank\u2019s 350,000 Jewish settlers.Rabbah Hazameh, a Palestinian whose family owns olive orchards and agricultural fields in the area, said that settlers prevented him and his relatives from working their land close to Adei Ad, and that trees had been damaged and poisoned. He said that his uncle had submitted 86 complaints to the Israeli police over the years, but \u201cnothing happened.\u201dWhile most of the world considers all of these settlements a violation of international law, Israel itself makes distinctions, including whether they sit on privately owned Palestinian land and whether they had government approval for construction.The Israeli leader\u2019s settlement policy resembles his predecessors\u2019, but it is a march toward permanence at a time when prospects for peace are few.But in 2012, Mr. Netanyahu commissioned another panel that came to starkly different conclusions.Led by Edmund Levy, a retired Israeli Supreme Court justice, this report concluded that the West Bank is not actually occupied \u2014 in part because Jordan\u2019s previous 19-year hold there was never internationally recognized \u2014 and that there was no impediment to approving outposts that were built on state land with what it called the \u201cimplied agreement\u201d of senior Israeli officials. The Levy report, though, upheld the Israeli policy that settlements on private Palestinian land are illegal.Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s government in 2011 had already quietly introduced what it called a new \u201ccombined policy.\u201d The idea was that Israel would remove settlement structures built on privately owned Palestinian land, but, in areas that Israel has declared as state land, would instead \u201cregulate the planning status\u201d \u2014 or, in other words, legalize construction after the fact.The first indications of changes in status of specific outposts have mostly emerged in the Israeli government\u2019s responses to court petitions by anti-settlement groups.This was the case late last year, when the Israeli Supreme Court dismissed a petition for the demolition of an illegal structure in Mitzpe Danny after the state told the court that it was advancing a process to authorize the outpost.The court cited an October 2015 decision of an Israeli planning committee to promote an old master plan for Jewish population growth in that area.Mitzpe Danny is defined in the plan as a \u201cneighborhood\u201d of Ma\u2019ale Michmash, the mother settlement across the highway, though part of the outpost lies outside the settlement\u2019s broadest boundaries. According to the blueprint, Mitzpe Danny is projected to accommodate 189 permanent homes by 2040.Most of the approval process takes place cautiously and with a degree of ambiguity. Mr. Riklin, the founder of Mitzpe Danny and its neighboring outposts, described it as \u201call cat and mouse\u201d between Mr. Netanyahu and President Obama, who has consistently said any settlement expansion is an obstacle to peace.Yigal Dilmoni, the deputy chief executive of the settler council, said that groups like Peace Now have actually done settlers a favor by suing the state because those cases often force the government to commit to a position. After one court petition led to government authorization of illegal building in a settlement and an outpost, the council sent Peace Now flowers.The note accompanying the bouquet said, \u201cWe will happily consider naming a street \u2018Peace Now\u2019 in the new neighborhoods.\u201dMs. Sasson\u2019s 2005 survey outlined how officials in the housing, defense and other ministries worked systematically to establish the new settlement points, financing them and helping provide infrastructure.Settler groups had drawn up the first plans for Mitzpe Danny \u2014 which like many outposts straddles public and private land, according to the Sasson survey \u2014 in the early 1990s. It sits above a winding route named for Yigal Allon, an Israeli general and Labor Party politician who, soon after the Arab-Israeli War of 1967, advocated Israeli withdrawal from most areas of the West Bank that were densely populated by Palestinians while keeping strategic territory along the Jordan Valley.\u201cI felt there weren\u2019t enough settlers in Judea and Samaria to ensure the future of the settlements,\u201d said Mr. Riklin, now 53 and a strident pro-settler voice in the Israeli news media, referring to the West Bank by its biblical name. \u201cWe felt we had to go out of the fences.\u201dDanny Frei, the slain British immigrant for whom the outpost was named, had been Mr. Riklin\u2019s neighbor in Ma\u2019ale Michmash. He was a 28-year-old computer engineer who was killed in his home while his 18-month-old daughter slept.The outpost now has dozens of trailers, as well as a few spacious, stone-clad houses and a new basketball court in a crevice not easily visible from the highway. There is a kindergarten and a playground that were guarded by a soldier on a recent day. Its residents include a lawyer, an architect and teachers.At a scenic lookout point, an audio system describes Jewish settlement of the area as the fulfillment of Jeremiah\u2019s prophecy: \u201cThy children shall return to their border.\u201dMr. Riklin, the outpost\u2019s founder, ultimately remained in Ma\u2019ale Michmash. The current leaders of the outpost refused to be interviewed for this article.\u201cI believe this is our land,\u201d he said of the West Bank, adding, \u201cGod brought us back. God writes our history.\u201d Of the Palestinians, he said, \u201cWhoever accepts us can live here comfortably.\u201dMr. Naamad was not fazed by the wait for a permanent home. \u201cIt is written that redemption evolves slowly,\u201d he said. \u201cLike nature.

Then, looking unenthusiastic, he urged Egyptian reporters to whip up public support for the monetary fund\u2019s bailout plan \u2014 and the presumably painful austerity measures that it would bring. \u201cWe must stand together and put up with each other for a while,\u201d he said.The years of political upheaval after President Hosni Mubarak was ousted in 2011 have taken a heavy toll on the country\u2019s economy, especially its revenue from tourism, an important source of hard currency for Egypt, which relies heavily on imports.The announcement of the loan reinforced a general sense of foreboding among Egyptians, especially after Mr. Sisi suggested twice in recent months on state television that they may have to go hungry for their economy to stabilize. The prices of food and electricity have soared.Chris Jarvis, the monetary fund\u2019s mission chief for Egypt, said in a telephone interview that for Egypt to increase its revenue, it would have to enact a value-added tax and continue to cut energy subsidies. Mr. Jarvis said Egyptian officials \u201chave been confident enough to specify\u201d in the agreement that the added government revenue would be used to increase food subsidies and social programs for the poor.Many Egyptians have been skeptical of a loan from the fund because they distrust the government in general and worry that cuts in subsidies could produce runaway inflation that could prompt riots.The agreement with the monetary fund will require the Sisi administration to ease some of the notoriously difficult restrictions on the registration of businesses. It will also require the government to send Parliament more frequent and detailed reports on the country\u2019s economic condition, the deputy finance minister, Ahmed Kouchouk, said.\u201cThings can\u2019t be late anymore,\u201d Mr. Kouchouk said. \u201cWe will provide more information on government spending and on government revenue.\u2019\u2019Apparently in an effort to deflect some of the blame from the Egyptian government, Amr El-Garhy, the finance minister, pointedly noted the role overpopulation has played in the economic crisis. \u201cIn the past 35 years, our population growth has equaled two countries like Algeria and Saudi Arabia combined,\u201d Mr. Garhy said of the country\u2019s 91 million people.Egyptian officials declined to say whether the loan deal would address the country\u2019s rigid currency laws, which have kept the Egyptian pound artificially high and have encouraged a rampant black market.The headline with an article in some editions on Aug. 12 about a loan request from Egypt to the International Monetary Fund overstated the I.M.F.\u2019s action. It tentatively agreed to lend Egypt $12 billion, pending final approval by its board of executives; it did not yet lend the money.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Harry Reid and Koch Brothers Wage Proxy War for a Nevada Senate Seat", "Date": "2016-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn WashingtonLAS VEGAS \u2014 Nevada\u2019s Senate race could not get much bigger. It is the only real chance Republicans have to flip a Democratic seat. The outcome could seal control of the Senate.For those who have followed the intrigue of recent campaign cycles, it is riveting for another reason. The battle to choose a successor to Senator Harry Reid, the retiring Democratic leader, is pitting Mr. Reid and his home-state political operation against his archenemies, Charles G. and David H. Koch, the billionaire industrialist brothers whom Mr. Reid has spent the past few years denouncing as the avatars of dark-money politics.This is an epic proxy war, with Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat and a former Nevada attorney general, and Representative Joe Heck, a Republican, serving as surrogates in a clash to see who gets the last word in this brutal rivalry.Both sides, as they say around the Texas Hold \u2019Em tables here in America\u2019s gambling capital, are all in.\u201cI am going to do everything I can do to prevail, to help her prevail,\u201d a determined Mr. Reid said in an interview at his home in nearby Henderson, Nev., as he takes on a more visible role in the Senate fight.For their part, leaders of the Koch network, which has at least four groups working to defeat Ms. Cortez Masto, do not disguise the fact that they would sorely like to knock off Mr. Reid\u2019s chosen successor to exact a bit of revenge and to help Republicans hold the Senate.\u201cIt would certainly be poetic justice to see Harry Reid, who for so long has waged an unhinged personal vendetta against people we care a lot about, to see his seat go to someone who supports limited government, free speech,\u201d said Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity, the Koch-aligned group mounting an extensive ground game against Ms. Cortez Masto.With polls showing the Nevada race close, Mr. Reid has become pretty caustic with his own speech when it comes to the Kochs and their preferred candidate, Mr. Heck, a three-term House member and a former state lawmaker.The Senate minority leader, who for years has taken to the Senate floor to assail the Kochs for taking advantage of campaign finance laws to covertly funnel money into defeating Democrats, seems more than willing to go on the attack for Ms. Cortez Masto, who chooses her own words very carefully.While receiving an award on Thursday from a progressive group whose leadership praised him for \u201cholding the Koch brothers accountable,\u201d Mr. Reid declared that the goal of the Kochs and their allies was to turn the United States into an oligarchy with a chosen few running the nation for their personal benefit.\u201cThey want to make sure that they pick the next Supreme Court justices,\u201d said Mr. Reid, who regularly refers to Mr. Heck as a fraud and a phony. And he lashed out at Mr. Heck for being behind an advertising campaign that blamed Ms. Cortez Masto for a rise in violent crime even though the state attorney general in Nevada has little to do with local law enforcement.\u201cHeck is an absolute stooge for these right-wing nut cases,\u201d Mr. Reid said.The Heck camp dismisses Mr. Reid\u2019s comments as over-the-top criticism that will backfire with Nevada voters already familiar with the congressman. They say the combative tone reflects Mr. Reid\u2019s rising fear about losing the seat, which could be interpreted as a rejection of his 30-year career in the Senate.\u201cIt is clear that in terms of both outside help and fund-raising that Harry Reid is calling in every favor and connection he has and that this is about continuing his legacy,\u201d said Brian Baluta, a spokesman for Mr. Heck.The Heck campaign is eager to link Ms. Cortez Masto to Mr. Reid, and at times it can be hard to tell from its Twitter feeds whether it is running against her or Mr. Reid.Mr. Baluta is correct that outside groups are supporting Ms. Cortez Masto, including the League of Conservation Voters and the Senate Majority PAC, a group run by Democrats with connections to Mr. Reid that has spent nearly $2.5 million on ads against Mr. Heck.But Mr. Heck is receiving help from outside the state as well. Freedom Partners Action Fund, which relies on considerable Koch funding, reports that it has spent more than $4.5 million against Ms. Cortez Masto. Concerned Veterans for America, another part of the Koch network, earlier ran more than $700,000 in ads on behalf of Mr. Heck, a military veteran.Mark Holden, the chairman of Freedom Partners and general counsel to Koch Industries, said the Koch network was backing Mr. Heck because he supported policies that would \u201chelp drive a free and open society.\u201d\u201cThis will be a welcome change from the petty bitterness of Senator Reid, and the divisive and harmful policies that he favored, which Ms. Masto also supports,\u201d Mr. Holden said.As for the ground game, Americans for Prosperity has three offices in the state, plans on opening a fourth and intends to marshal hundreds of volunteers to go door to door to reach out to voters identified as being open to opposing Ms. Cortez Masto.\u201cOur No. 1 goal is to educate voters on her record,\u201d said Adam Jones, the state director of the group, as young volunteers bustled around the organization\u2019s headquarters in a strip mall.The Libre Initiative, another group partly funded by Freedom Partners, is for the first time actively opposing a candidate and hopes to mobilize Hispanic voters against Ms. Cortez Masto in a race where the Latino vote will be crucial. The stance means the organization, formed to promote economic opportunity for Latinos, will be trying to defeat the woman who would be the first Latina elected to the Senate.\u201cA big-spending, big-government Latina is still a big-spending, big-government liberal,\u201d said Dan Garza, the executive director of the group.Mr. Heck is generally seen as having a slight edge in the race at the moment and is being helped by the fact that Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, who was endorsed by Mr. Heck, has not fallen as far in Nevada as he has in other swing states.Reflecting Democratic concern, some Reid staff members, including Kristen Orthman, his communications director, are being dispatched to the state party to bolster the final Democratic push.Mr. Reid, who concedes he can sometimes be \u201charsh\u201d in his comments, remains confident that Democrats will hold his seat. And he takes pride in the fact that it is such a target of the Kochs.\u201cI think people are not only identified by their friends, but also their enemies,\u201d said Mr. Reid, who promised to stay as aggressive in protecting his seat as he has been in his long-running feud with the Kochs.\u201cSay what you want about me \u2014 and people do \u2014 but as my dad said, \u2018If you do something, don\u2019t do it half-assed,\u2019\u201d Mr. Reid said. \u201cJust do it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
